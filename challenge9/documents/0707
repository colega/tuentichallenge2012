The G string or thong is probably the earliest form of clothing known to mankind It originated in the warmer climates of sub Saharan Africa where clothing was first worn almost 75000 years ago Many tribal peoples like some of the Khoisan people of southern Africa wore thongs for many centuries These early pieces of clothes were made to fit the male genitalia

The G string was first developed for men by primitive peoples However in modern days Western thongs are usually worn by females They first became popular in South America in the 1970s In Brazil it was originally a style of swimsuit that had a rear area which became so narrow that it would disappear between the buttocks

The origin of the term G string is not fully known The term was first written about by Americans in the late 1800s They described the loincloth of Philippine natives Others say the term came from from the g string on an instrument The origin of the word thong is from the Old English thwong which is a flexible leather cord

G strings may cause urinary tract infections in women just like other types of underwear Sliding the string against the anus and vagina can let bacteria get inside the body It is necessary for the person who wears G strings to keep the anus and vagina clean Menstruating women can also continue to wear G strings if they are using tampons and G string panty liners

Signal signals or signalling may refer to

In the fields of communications signal processing and in electrical engineering more generally a signal is any time varying quantity 

The concept is broad and hard to define precisely Definitions specific to subfields are common For example in information theory a signal is a codified message ie the sequence of states in a communications channel that encodes a message In a communications system a transmitter encodes a message into a signal which is carried to a receiver by the communications channel For example the words Mary had a little lamb might be the message spoken into a telephone The telephone transmitter converts the sounds into an electrical voltage signal The signal is transmitted to the receiving telephone by wires and at the receiver it is reconverted into sounds

Ecosystem valuation is a widely used tool to find out the impact of human activities on an environmental system It is done by giving an economic value to an ecosystem or its ecosystem services

The simplest form of ecosystem valuation is that one looks at an ecosystem as if its ecological yield had the same value as it would be on commodity markets That means one looks at the value of water wood fish or game that is produced in that ecosystem Thus a price can be put on the natural capital of an ecosystem based on the price of natural resources it yields each year 

More complex arguments in ecosystem valuation regard natures services and the assignment of values in a service economy to all that nature does for humans Studies compiled by Robert Costanza in the 1990s argued strongly that even just considering the most basic seventeen of these services the combined value of the ecosystems of the earth was worth more each year than the whole human exchange economy at that time Other studies have focused on the marginal value of ecosystem changes which can be used in cost benefit analysis of environmental policies

In Natural Capitalism 1999 Paul Hawken Amory Lovins and Hunter Lovins advanced an argument to assign the value of Earth in current currency See value of Earth article for that and other examples of this extreme case of ecosystem valuation  biosphere valuation

Four types of values can be assigned to ecosystems

Methods to estimate the value of ecosystem services which cannot be derived from market prices include stated preference methods and revealed preference methods Stated preference methods such as the contingent valuation method ask people for their willingness to pay for a certain ecosystem Revealed preference methods such as hedonic pricing and the travel cost method use a relation with a market good or service to estimate the willingness to pay for the service

Such valuation and that of the effectiveness of various environmental health measures that affect the value of life and quality of life are usually thought to be part of economics Natural capital and individual capital are studied ecology as living systems however this does not extend to the economics of valuation by which they are related

Considering valuation as an economic not ecological issue reflects the way these fields divide of the activities of humans versus non humans in making a living When humans go out to get food or homes that is studied in economics but when non humans do it that is ecology though it is clear that there are motivations methods and certainly bodily needs in common

Since animals do not put explicit prices on ecosystems they use but do behave as if they are valuable eg by defending turf or access to water it is mostly a matter of definition whether ecology should include valuation as an issue It may be anthropocentric to do so since valuation more clearly refers to a human perception rather than being an objective attribute of the system perceived Ecology itself is also human perception and such related concepts as a food chain are constructed by humans to help them understand ecosystems In many cases by those who hold that markets and pricing exist independently of any individual human observers and users and especially those who deem markets to be out of control ecosystem valuation is considered a part of economics 

Some versions of conflict theory focus on the role of resource scarcity in sparking or propagating human conflicts  in effect holding that the resources or ecosystems they fight over are being held so valuable that they are worth considerable risk of harm to control This is at least a relative notion of value and value at risk applied to ecosystem

An economist is someone who studies or has a job in economics the study of how people make choices to satisfy their wants

The Conservative and Unionist Party is the main centre right political party in the United Kingdom Their policies usually promote conservatism and British Unionism They are the largest party in the British House of Commons with 307 out of 650 seats and the party leader David Cameron is the Prime Minister 

Most Conservatives believe in the following things

The party was founded in 1834 by Robert Peel out of the old Tory Party which was founded in 1678 During the 1800s the party was one of the two main political parties along with the Liberal Party In 1846 the party split over the repeal of the Corn Laws which was favoured by Robert Peel and most top Conservatives but was disliked by backbencher Conservative MPs Following the repeal the Peel government fell and Robert Peel and his followers went on to join the Liberal Party Because of this the Conservatives were not able to form a majority government for twenty eight years

Under the leadership of Benjamin Disraeli the party created a philosophy which supported the British Empire the Church of England the monarchy and social reforms which took the party into power from 1874 to 1880 In 1886 the Liberal Party split over whether Ireland should be given independence and those who did not support it became known as the Liberal Unionists and they joined with the Conservatives This alliance meant that the Conservatives were in power for most of the period 18851906 under Lord Salisbury and then Arthur Balfour

By 1906 the Conservatives had another split this time about an issue known as tariff reform and as a result the party was defeated in a landslide at the 1906 General Election by the Liberal Party In 1912 the Conservative Party formally joined with the Liberal Unionist Party to create the modern day Conservative and Unionist Party however this is usually shortened to Conservative Party The party was in a coalition with the Liberal Party from 1916 to 1922 and was mostly in power from 1922 to 1929 under Stanley Baldwin During the 1920s the Labour Party replaced the Liberals as the Conservatives main political opponent

The Conservatives were the leading figure in the coalitions of 19311935 and 19401945 and Winston Churchill was Prime Minister during World War II Labour defeated the Conservatives at the 1945 General Election and the Conservatives were forced to accept many of Labours new reforms like the creation of the welfare state and high taxes The Conservatives returned to power from 1951 to 1964 under Churchill Anthony Eden Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas Home and during this time Britain saw a period of economic and national prosperity The Conservatives were led by Edward Heath from 1965 to 1975 and were in power from 1970 to 1974

Whilst Heath was in power he took Britain into the European Union which later would deeply divide the Conservative Party Direct rule had to be placed on Northern Ireland because of the violence that occurred because of The Troubles After this the Ulster Unionist Party stopped supporting the Conservative Party at Westminster A miners strike and rising inflation in 1973 caused Heath to start the three day working week to ration power The February 1974 General Election caused a hung parliament and Labour was in power until 1979

Margaret Thatcher became Conservative leader in 1975 and successfully introduced a number of monetarist policies In 1979 the party was returned to power because of the Labour governments handling of the Winter of Discontent and Britains growing inflation Thatcher was Prime Minister from 1979 to 1990 and won the General Elections of 1979 1983 and 1987 Thatchers second and third terms saw the privatisation of most of Britains state owned industry such as British Telecom in 1984 British gas in 1986 British Airways in 1987 and British Leyland and British Steel in 1988

In 1989 the Conservative government introduced the Community Charge or Poll Tax which was seen as unfair to the poor and was very unpopular Thatcher was replaced as Prime Minister and Conservative Party leader in 1990 by John Major Major led the country and the party until 1997 John Major replaced the unpopular Community Charge with the Council Tax in 1992 and led the party to a surprise victory in the 1992 General Election Although there was a recession in the early 1990s John Majors Conservative government started a long period of economic prosperity which would last until the late 2000s In the 1997 General Election the Conservatives were defeated in a landslide and lost all of their Scottish and Welsh seats This is blamed on party splits over the European Union the events of Black Wednesday in 1992 and the New Labour Party led by Tony Blair

The party then entered thirteen years of opposition with William Hague leading the party from 1997 to 2001 At the 2001 General Election the partys campaign focussed on several right wing policies and whilst Hague was seen as a powerful speaker his leadership was damaged by some poor publicity stunts and the party made a net gain of only one seat at the 2001 General Election Iain Duncan Smith led the party from 2001 to 2003 and whilst he did moderate some of the partys right wing policies he was seen as unable to return the party to power by many Conservative MPs and Michael Howard became leader in 2003

The Labour government under Tony Blair was becoming unpopular because of the Iraq War and Michael Howard managed to reduce Labours majority in parliament at the 2005 General Election from 167 to 66 Howard resigned soon after this and David Cameron became Conservative Party leader Cameron made the party more modern by distancing himself from several right wing elements within the party and focussed on modern and environmental issues The Conservatives had a regular lead in opinion polls from 2007 onwards and at the 2010 General Election the party won the most seats in parliament and the highest number of votes but was 20 seats short of a majority in parliament A coalition government was then made with the Liberal Democrats and David Cameron has been Prime Minister since May 11 2010

Usually support for the party comes from the south of England Eastern England and rural areas Party support is not very strong in the north of England Scotland or Wales

The first theory is the legend of the Holy Grail which was included more holy objects There are four of them the first was the holy plate used by Christ at the Last Supper the second was the spear with which the soldiers tried to hit Jesus on the cross the third was the Grail itself and the last was the Sword of King David It was also called the Grail Sword 

The second theory said that the Grail Sword sword belonged to a Celtic Wounded King and was also known as The Sword of Light or The Sword of Nuadu The sword was found by Gawain and it was broken into two places Gawain was the one to find its place of origin The Sword of Nuadu was made in the city of Findias byt he druid Uiscias Nuadu himself was the King of the de Danann Gods He very often is represented with a sword in his hands The sword replaced his arm which he lost in the battle

In the show the four colorful Teletubbies play in the cheerful and fun Teletubbyland They do things that little children like to do such as rolling on the ground laughing running about and watching real children on the televisions on their bellies Mysterious pinwheels and telephones rise out of the meadow to show the days activities The Sun who has a babys face makes baby noises during the show and it rises and sets to begin and end the show The land is covered with unusually talkative flowers and microphone like voice trumpets The only natural animals are rabbits The weather is always sunny and enjoyable except for some cloudy days with rain and puddles and snow at Christmas time The Teletubbies are played by actors dressed in stuffy costumes although the recording site is designed to give no sense of scale The costumes sort of look like large spacesuits although the Teletubbies appear not to wear real clothes They are instead furry and have pieces of cloth on their tubbiesThis is where the name Teletubbies comes fromTele is the British word for television and tubby is the British word for stomach These screens are used to switch into short movie sequences which are generally repeated at least once When the series is shown in different countries around the world the movie clips are changed to fit the countries main audiences

The Teletubbies body shapes actions and ways of talking are similar to toddlers The speed and design of the show was made by writerco producer Andrew Davenport who shaped the show to fit the attention spans of the target audience The repeating of just about every word is familiar to everyone who has ever worked with young children There was also help from Shatarra Willis the stage manager who helped the show to become a success The Teletubbies speak in a baby like language which is the subject of some controversy among educationalists some of whom argue that this supposedly made up talk is not good for children

The Teletubbies are at the stage of understanding speech but not yet fully capable of repeating it exactly like their target audience They often simply groan in anger in times where a human toddler would throw a tantrum The Teletubbies catch phrases are Eh oh as in Eh oh Laa Laa to which Laa Laa will respond Eh oh Uh oh a common response to anything thats not good Run away Run away especially from Dipsy and Bye bye at least four times in a row Laa Laa when flustered will explode with Bibberly cheese which is as angry as the Teletubbies get But perhaps the most common exclamation is Big hug which one or more of the Teletubbies will call for during the course of an episode resulting in a big group hug Their diet is mainly of Tubby Tustard and Tubby Toast They are very messy eaters In one episode The Tubby Toaster the machine that makes Tubby Toast went seriously wrong and filled the Teletubbies house with toast Fortunately one of their companions is Noo Noo a vacuum cleaner Machines like Noo Noothe voice trumpets and the televisions in the Teletubbies stomachs were designed to show small children who are born into a world surrounded by strange and powerful electronic gadgets that technology is benevolent and helpful not something to be afraid of

The Teletubbies landscape is an outdoor set in rural Warwickshire England at Sweet Knowle Farm Redhill Bank Rd Whimpstone CV37 8NR All the Teletubbies say Bye Bye three times The narrator bids each Teletubby goodbye and they disappear but reappear a moment later saying Boo The narrator then says No and proceeds to say goodbye to each Teletubby again The sun is then shown setting and the Teletubbies each say goodbye again before jumping down a hole in the roof of their house Finally one Teletubby says goodbye a fourth time  they pop out of a hole in the house and say Bye bye For special episodes and at the end of the Fun With The Teletubbies cassette all four Teletubbies say Bye bye in this way Many of the occurrences of the show including the end sequence and the scene preceding the short film broadcast on a characters tummy were shot only once and the same scenes are used in each episode A main feature of each episode is a broken wikt linkradiantradiant sun that has a picture of a smiling baby on it The baby in the sun occasionally laughs out loud in short bursts In 2001 production of the show was cancelled and it was announced that no new episodes would be produced However the existing 365 episodes have been played in re runs years for seven year until January 2008

Tinky Winky is the first Teletubby He is the largest of the Teletubbies is purple and has a triangular antenna on his head He is notable for the red luggage he always carries He is also found dancing in a ballet style tutu from time to time which is also often worn by Laa Laa

Dipsy is the second Teletubby He is green and is called Dipsy because his horn looks like a dipstick He likes his black and white furry top hat which he once lost Laa Laa found it but instead of simply returning Dipsys hat to the stricken Dipsy she ran around it for about ten minutes shouting Dipsy Hat Dipsy Hat He is the most stubbon of the Teletubbies and will sometimes refuse to go along with the other Teletubbies group opinion His face is also notably darker than the rest of the Teletubbies

Laa Laa is the third Teletubby She is yellow has a curly antenna and is concerned with the welfare of all She is the best singer of all the teletubbies and is a Drama queen party girl and motherly type Her favorite thing is a bouncy orange ball which is almost as big as she is

Po is the red Teletubby She is the fourth of the Teletubbbies has an antenna that is shaped like a stick used for blowing soap bubbles is the smallest of the Teletubbies and is most often the one who always gets into trouble She also says the word Eh oh a word used by all of Teletubbies

Pos favorite object is her scooter which she calls scoota Po often wants attention and can sometimes be mischievous and naughty when she disobeys the commands of the voice trumpets

Po is bilingual meaning she can speak more than one language Those languages are English and Cantonese She is a problem solver and the best spider fighter She is also a Tomboy type and of all the Teletubbies Po usually becomes most involved with the audience She loves both attention and her curly red circular aerial on her head 

In the Teletubbies house she sleeps at the side of all the other Teletubbies and sometimes eats Tubby Toast while the others are sleeping She is voiced by Pui Fan Lee which is why she can speak in dual languages

A girls talking Po doll was thought to be saying faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot bite my butt as well as fatty fatty The toy was recalled and it was revealed to have said fidit fidit inspired by the Cantonese for faster faster

Although many are unsure of Pos gender or think she is male she is clearly said to be female in several episodes such as Dads Portrait and Numbers 2 Many refer to her as he even though it is she

The show also features the voices of Toyah Willcox and Eric Sykes and occasionally Sandra Dickinson and Penelope Keith all of whom provide narration The only physical cast member is Tamzin Griffin who plays the manic Funny Lady The Sun is personified with the face of baby Jessica Smith who is believed to have been around seven months old at the time of filming Her giggle was included in the single Teletubbies Say Eh Oh Although not credited this makes her technically the youngest person ever whose vocal appeared on a number one song

The antenna shapes of each Teletubbie provides mnemonic clues as to the characters name

Tinky Winky started a still talked about controversy in 1999 due to his carrying a bag that looks like a womans handbag and gained the interest of Jerry Falwell in 1997 when Fallwell said that the character was a gay role model Falwell wrote about it in his National Liberty Journal He said that in the Washington Post InOut column someone had written that lesbian comedian Ellen DeGeneres was out or uncloseted as the main gay model while the fashionable Tinky Winky was in or closeted Falwell said it was because of the Teletubbys purple color the purse and the triangle antenna which all represented homosexualityThis has caused many Christians to boycott Teletubbies because it makes them think that Teletubbies support homosexualityAlsoTinky Winky dances in a tu tu which supporters of the thought that Tinky Winky is gay may take as evidence A February 1999 article in the National Liberty Journal published by evangelical pastor Jerry Falwell warned parents that Tinky Winky could be a hidden homosexual symbol because he is purple the gay pride colour and his antenna is shaped like a triangle the gay pride symbol A spokesman for Itsy Bitsy Entertainment Co who licenses the characters in the United States said that it was just a magic bag The fact that he carries a magic bag doesnt make him a homosexual Its a childrens show folks To think we would be putting sexual innuendo in a childrens show is kind of outlandish he added In an unrelated incident reported in 2000 a girls Tinky Winky toy reportedly said I got a gun Kenn Viselman then chairman of the Itsy Bitsy Entertainment Company said the toy was actually saying Again again a catchphrase from the show

Teletubbies has been broadcast in many different countries thus involving a foreign title

FLAC is a way to encode audio files It makes those audio files smaller without affecting the sound quality It is unlike MP3 because when encoding audio using an MP3 encoder information is lost and cannot be recovered When a FLAC file is decoded it will be identical to the original raw audio

Lossy encoders such as MP3 encoders will generate smaller files than lossless encoders such as FLAC

The Enabling Act was passed by Germanys parliament on March 23 1933 It was the second major step after the Reichstag Fire Decree through which the Nazis obtained dictatorial powers using largely legal means The Act enabled Chancellor Adolf Hitler and his cabinet to enact laws without the participation of the Reichstag 

The formal name of the Enabling Act was Gesetz zur Behebung der Not von Volk und Reich

As with most of the laws passed in the process of Gleichschaltung the Enabling Act is quite short considering its consequences It is therefore reproduced in full in German and English

The Enabling Act was passed by the Reichstag on March 23 and proclaimed by the government the following day Following constitutional procedure for legislation the law was countersigned by President von Hindenburg Chancellor Hitler Minister of Interior Frick Foreign Minister von Neurath and Minister of Finance von Krosigk

The Nazis wrote the Enabling act to gain complete political power without the need of the support of a majority in the Reichstag and without the need to bargain with their coalition partners 

Within 24 hours of being appointed chancellor of Germany on January 30 1933 Hitler skillfully influenced the outcome by propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels who wrote

In the days leading up to the elections the Nazis organized street violence to intimidate the opposition and to build fear of communism The burning of the Reichstag six days before the election was the pivotal event of the campaign 

Later that day the Reichstag assembled under intimidating circumstances with SA men swarming inside and outside the chamber Hitlers speech which emphasised the importance of Christianity in German culture was aimed particularly at appeasing the Centre Partys sensibilities and almost incorporated Kaas requested guarantees

All parties except the SPD voted in favour of the Enabling Act With the Communist delegates removed and 26 SPD deputies arrested or in hiding the final vote was 441 supporting the Enabling Act to 94 opposed

The Communist Party deputies and a few Social Democratic deputies as well were already jailed and the Communist mandates were declared dormant by the government shortly after the elections The remaining free members of parliament were intimidated by the SA surrounding the parliament hall In the end only the Social Democrats voted against the bill

The British tabloid Daily Express described the Jewish reactions of boycott against Germany as Judea Declares War on Germany

President von Hindenburg seemed to be pleased with Hitlers firm hand During the cabinet conference on the Enabling Act von Hindenburgs representative stated that the aged president was withdrawing from day to day affairs of government and that presidential collaboration on the laws decreed as a result of the Enabling Act would not be required

Pulmonary hypertension or PH is a disease where there is high blood pressure in the lungs The disease makes it hard to breathe Some people with the disease need extra oxygen This disease can also make a person dizzy and become easily tired Some people with the disease faint easily The symptoms get worse when exercising or working hard Pulmonary hypertension is a serious disease and it can be fatal The disease makes it harder for the heart to pump blood Because the heart has to work harder it can also become sick Some people who are very sick may need a lung transplant or a heart lung transplant to live

People with pulmonary hypertension have difficulty breathing They also tire easily Some of them faint easily too They might have chest pain Some patients have swelling of the feet and ankles These symptoms get worse during exercise or hard work

When a person has pulmonary hypertension without any other cause this is called idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension or IPAH 

When a family history exists the disease is termed familial pulmonary arterial hypertension IPAH and FPAH are now considered to be genetic disorders linked to mutations in the BMPR2 gene which encodes a receptor for bone morphogenetic proteins as well as the 5 HT gene which codes for a serotonin receptor

There are three different time zones called Eastern Standard Time Zone

commonscatDecameron The Decameron is a collection of 100 short stories It was written by the Italian writer Giovanni Boccaccio around 1350 In the book ten friends seven young women and three young men leave the city of Florence because of the plague and stay in a large house in the countryside Each day they entertain each other by taking turns to tell stories The stories are of different types Some are romantic some are erotic some are comedies and some are tragedies 

Other writers have used the stories for ideas Many paintings have been done which illustrate the stories The picture to the right shows a scene from the story of The Pot of Basil in which Isabella buries the head of her murdered lover Ferdinand inside a potplant

A lung transplant is a type of surgery People who can not breathe without additional oxygen may need a lung transplant In this surgery the patients ill lung or lungs are removed A healthy lung or lungs are put into the patient The healthy lungs may come from a dead or from a living person When the person who gives or donates the healthy lung is still alive only one lung is removed Sometimes a healthy person can give just part of a lung to a sick person A healthy person can normally give a lung or part of a lung without becoming sick 

Commodity is a term with distinct meanings in both business and in Marxian political economy For the former it is a product that is traded solely on the basis of price For Marxian political economy it means wares offered for exchange 

In the world of business a commodity is an product good or service that is traded based solely on its price rather than quality and features Examples include electricity most users of electric power are only concerned with energy consumption only a minority of users are concerned with the quality and technical details of voltage and frequency deviations wheat bulk chemicals such as sulfuric acid metals and even orange juice 

In the original and simplified sense commodities were things of value of uniform quality that were produced in large quantities by many different producers the items from each different producer are considered as of the same value 

Wheat is an example of a soft commodity Wheat from many different farms comes together Generally it is all traded at the same price wheat from farm A has not another price than wheat from farm B Some uniform standard of quality is assumed

Markets for trading commodities can be very efficient particularly if the division into pools matches demand segments These markets will quickly respond to changes in supply and demand to find a price

In classical political economy and especially Karl Marxs critique of political economy a commodity is simply any good or service offered as a product for sale on the market Some items are also seen as being treated as if they were commodities eg human labour or labor power works of art and natural resources even though they may not be produced specifically for the market or be non reproducible goods 

Marxs analysis of the commodity is intended to help solve the problem of what establishes the economic value of goods using the labor theory of value This problem was extensively debated by Adam Smith David Ricardo and Karl Rodbertus Jagetzow among others Value and price are not equivalent terms in economics and theorising the specific relationship of value to market price has been a challenge for both liberal and Marxist economists

To understand the concept of a commodity consider a chair It is a commodity if the chair is a tradeable product of human work possessing a social use value By contrast a fallen log of deadwood sat upon in the forest is not a commodity as it was not produced by human work for the purpose of trade A chair created by a hobbyist as a gift to someone is not a commodity Nor is a chair a commodity if its only use would be as scrap firewood A chair that nobody could sit on has no use value and cannot be a commodity

Commodity markets are markets where raw or primary products are exchanged These raw commodities are traded on regulated commodities exchanges in which they are bought and sold in standardized contracts

This article focuses on the history and current debates regarding global commodity markets It covers physical product markets but not the ways that services including those of governments nor investment nor debt can be seen as a commodity Articles on reinsurance markets stock markets bond markets and currency markets cover those concerns separately and in more depth One focus of this article is the relationship between simple commodity money and the more complex instruments offered in the commodity markets

See List of traded commodities for some commodities and their trading units and places

The modern commodity markets have their roots in the trading of agricultural products While wheat and corn cattle and pigs were widely traded using standard instruments in the 19th century in the United States other basic foodstuffs such as soybeans were only added quite recently in most markets For a commodity market to be established there must be very broad consensus on the variations in the product that make it acceptable for one purpose or another

The economic impact of the development of commodity markets is hard to over estimate Through the 19th century the exchanges became effective spokesmen for and innovators of improvements in transportation warehousing and financing which paved the way to expanded interstate and international trade 

Historically dating from ancient Sumerian use of sheep or goats or other peoples using pigs rare seashells or other items as commodity money people have sought ways to standardize and trade contracts in the delivery of such items to render trade itself more smooth and predictable

Commodity money and commodity markets in a crude early form are believed to have originated in Sumer where small baked clay tokens in the shape of sheep or goats were used in trade Sealed in clay vessels with a certain number of such tokens with that number written on the outside they represented a promise to deliver that number This made them a form of commodity money  more than an IOU but less than a guarantee by a nation state or bank However they were also known to contain promises of time and date of delivery  this made them like a modern futures contract Regardless of the details it was only possible to verify the number of tokens inside by shaking the vessel or by breaking it at which point the number or terms written on the outside became subject to doubt Eventually the tokens disappeared but the contracts remained on flat tablets This represented the first system of commodity accounting

However the Commodity status of living things is always subject to doubt  it was hard to validate the health or existence of sheep or goats Excuses for non delivery were not unknown and there are recovered Sumerian letters that complain of sickly goats sheep that had already been fleeced etc

If a sellers reputation was good individual backers or bankers could decide to take the risk of clearing a trade The observation that trust is always required between market participants later led to credit money But until relatively modern times communication and credit were primitive

Classical civilizations built complex global markets trading gold or silver for spices cloth wood and weapons most of which had standards of quality and timeliness Considering the many hazards of climate piracy theft and abuse of military fiat by rulers of kingdoms along the trade routes it was a major focus of these civilizations to keep markets open and trading in these scarce commodities Reputation and clearing became central concerns and the states which could handle them most effectively became very powerful empires trusted by many peoples to manage and mediate trade and commerce

Commodity and Futures contracts are based on whats termed Forward Contracts Early on these forward contracts were used as a way of getting products from producer to the consumer These typically were only for food and agricultural Products Forward contracts have evolved and have been standardized into what we know today as futures contracts Although more complex today early Forward contracts for example were used for rice in seventeenth century Japan Modern forward or futures agreements began in Chicago in the 1840s with the appearance of the railroads Chicago being centrally located emerged as the hub between Midwestern farmers and producers and the east coast consumer population centers

Hedging a common practice of farming cooperatives insures against a poor harvest by purchasing futures contracts in the same commodity If the cooperative has significantly less of its product to sell due to weather or insects it makes up for that loss with a profit on the markets since the overall supply of the crop is short everywhere that suffered the same conditions 

Whole developing nations may be especially vulnerable and even their currency tends to be tied to the price of those particular commodity items until it manages to be a fully developed nation For example one could see the nominally fiat money of Cuba as being tied to sugar prices since a lack of hard currency paying for sugar means less foreign goods per peso in Cuba itself In effect Cuba needs a hedge against a drop in sugar prices if it wishes to maintain a stable quality of life for its citizens

In addition delivery day method of settlement and delivery point must all be specified Typically trading must end two business days prior to the delivery day so that the routing of the shipment can be finalized via ship or rail and payment can be settled when the contract arrives at any delivery point

US soybean futures for example are of standard grade if they are GMO or a mixture of GMO and Non GMO No 2 yellow soybeans of Indiana Ohio and Michigan origin produced in the USA and of deliverable grade if they are GMO or a mixture of GMO and Non GMO No 2 yellow soybeans of Iowa Illinois and Wisconsin origin produced in the USA Note the distinction between states and the need to clearly mention their status as GMO which makes them unacceptable to most organic food buyers

Similar specifications apply for orange juice cocoa sugar wheat corn barley pork bellies milk feedstuffs fruits vegetables other grains other beans hay other livestock meats poultry eggs or any other commodity which is so traded

The concept of an interchangeable deliverable or guaranteed delivery is always to some degree a fiction Trade in commodities is like trade in any other physical product or service No magic of the commodity contract itself makes units of the product totally uniform nor gets it to the delivery point safely and on time

Cotton kilowatt hours of electricity board feet of wood long distance minutes royalty payments due on artists works and other products and services have been traded on markets of varying scale with varying degrees of success One issue that presents major difficulty for creators of such instruments is the liability accruing to the purchaser

Unless the product or service can be guaranteed or insured to be free of liability based on where it came from and how it got to market eg kilowatts must come to market free from legitimate claims for smog death from coal burning plants wood must be free from claims that it comes from protected forests royalty payments must be free of claims of plagiarism or piracy it becomes impossible for sellers to guarantee a uniform delivery 

Generally governments must provide a common regulatory or insurance standard and some release of liability or at least a backing of the insurers before a commodity market can begin trading This is a major source of controversy in for instance the energy market where desirability of different kinds of power generation varies drastically In some markets eg Toronto Canada surveys established that customers would pay 10 15 more for energy that was not from coal or nuclear but strictly from renewable sources such as wind

However if there are two or more standards of risk or quality as there seem to be for electricity or soybeans it is relatively easy to establish two different contracts to trade in the more and less desirable deliverable separately If the consumer acceptance and liability problems can be solved the product can be made interchangeable and trading in such units can begin

Since the detailed concerns of industrial and consumer markets vary widely so do the contracts and grades tend to vary significantly from country to country A proliferation of contract units terms and futures contracts have evolved combined into an extremely sophisticated range of financial instruments 

These are more than one to one representations of units of a given type of commodity and represent more than simple futures contracts for future deliveries These serve a variety of purposes from simple gambling to price insurance

The underlying of futures contracts are no longer restricted to commodities 

Building on the infrastructure and credit and settlement networks established for food and precious metals many such markets have proliferated drastically in the late 20th century Oil was the first form of energy so widely traded and the fluctuations in the oil markets are of particular political interest

Some commodity market speculation is directly related to the stability of certain states eg during the Gulf War speculation on the survival of the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq Similar political stability concerns have from time to time driven the price of oil Some argue that this is not so much a commodity market but more of an assassination market speculating on the survival of Saddam or other leaders whose personal decisions may cause oil supply to fluctuate by military action

The oil market is however an exception Most markets are not so tied to the politics of volatile regions  even natural gas tends to be more stable as it is not traded across oceans by tanker as extensively

Developing countries have been moved to harden their currencies accept IMF rules join the WTO and submit to a broad regime of reforms that amount to a hedge against being isolated Chinas entry into the WTO signalled the end of truly isolated nations entirely managing their own currency and affairs The need for stable currency and predictable clearing and rules based handling of trade disputes has led to a global trade hegemony  many nations hedging on a global scale against each others anticipated protectionism were they to fail to join the WTO

There are signs however that this regime is far from perfect US trade sanctions against Canadian softwood lumber and foreign steel in 2002 signalled a shift in policy towards a tougher regime perhaps more driven by political concerns  jobs industrial policy even sustainable forestry and logging practices

Commodity thinking is undergoing a more direct revival thanks to the theorists of natural capital whose products some economists argue are the only genuine commodities  air water and calories we consume being mostly interchangeable when they are free of pollution or disease Whether we wish to think of these things as tradeable commodities rather than birthrights has been a major source of controversy in many nations

Most types of environmental economics consider the shift to measuring them inevitable arguing that reframing political economy to consider the flow of these basic commodities first and foremost helps avoids use of any military fiat except to protect natural capital itself and basing credit worthiness more strictly on commitment to preserving biodiversity aligns the long term interests of ecoregions societies and individuals They seek relatively conservative sustainable development schemes that would be amenable to measuring well being over long periods of time typically seven generations in line with Native American thought

However this is not the only way in which commodity thinking interacts with ecologists thinking Hedging began as a way to escape the consequences of damage done by natural conditions It has matured not only into a system of interlocking guarantees but also into a system of indirectly trading on the actual damage done by weather using weather derivatives For a price this relieves the purchaser of the following types of concerns

Will a freeze hurt the Brazilian coffee crop Will there be a drought in the US Corn Belt What are the chances that we will have a cold winter driving natural gas prices higher and creating havoc in Florida orange areas What is the status of El Nio

Weather trading is just one example of negative commodities units of which represent harm rather than good

Economy is three fifths of ecology argues Mike Nickerson one of many economic theorists who holds that natures productive services and waste disposal services are poorly accounted for One way to fairly allocate the waste disposal capacity of nature is cap and trade market structure that is used to trade toxic emissions rights in the United States eg SO2 This is in effect a negative commodity a right to throw something away

In this market the atmospheres capacity to absorb certain amounts of pollutants is measured divided into units and traded amongst various market players Those who emit more SO2 must pay those who emit less Critics of such schemes argue that unauthorized or unregulated emissions still happen and that grandfathering schemes often permit major polluters such as the state governments own agencies or poorer countries to expand emissions and take jobs while the SO2 output still floats over the border and causes death

In practice political pressure has overcome most such concerns and it is questionable whether this is a capacity that depends on US clout The Kyoto Protocol established a similar market in global greenhouse gas emissions without US support

This highlights one of the major issues with global commodity markets of either the positive or negative kind A community must somehow believe that the commodity instrument is real enforceable and well worth paying for

A very substantial part of the anti globalization movement opposes the commodification of currency national sovereignty and traditional cultures  The capacity to repay debt as in the current global credit money regime anchored by the Bank for International Settlements does not in their view correspond to measurable benefits to human well being worldwide They seek a fairer way for societies to compete in the global markets that will not require conversion of natural capital to natural resources nor human capital to move to developed nations in order to find work

Some economic systems by green economists would replace the gold standard with a biodiversity standard It remains to be seen if such plans have any merit other than as political ways to draw attention to the way capitalism itself interacts with life

While classical neoclassical and Marxist approaches to economics tend to treat labor differently they are united in treating nature as a resource 

The green economists and the more conservative environmental economics argue that not only natural ecologies but also the life of the individual human being is treated as a commodity by the global markets A good example is the IPCC calculations cited by the Global Commons Institute as placing a value on a human life in the developed world 15x higher than in the developing world based solely on the ability to pay to prevent climate change

Accepting this result some argue that to put a price on both is the most reasonable way to proceed to optimize and increase that value relative to other goods or services This has led to efforts in measuring well being to assign a commercial value of life and to the theory of Natural Capitalism  fusions of green and neoclassical approaches  which focus predictably on energy and material efficiency ie using far less of any given commodity input to achieve the same service outputs as a result 

Indian economist Amartya Sen applying this thinking to human freedom itself argued in his 1999 book Development as Freedom that human free time was the only real service and that sustainable development was best defined as freeing human time Sen won The Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel in 1999 and based his book on invited lectures he gave at the World Bank

Data 

Political economy was the original term for the study of production the acts of buying and selling and their relationships to laws customs and government 

It developed in the 17th century as the study of the economies of states which placed the theory of property in the theory of government Some political economists proposed the labour theory of value according to which labour is the real source of value Many political economists also looked at the accelerating development of technology whose role in economic and social relationships grew ever more important

In late 19th century the term political economy was generally replaced by the term economics which was used by those seeking to place the study of economy on a mathematical basis rather than studying the relationships within production and consumption 

In the present political economy means a variety of different but related approaches to studying economic and political behavior which range from combining economics with other fields to using different fundamental assumptions which challenge those of orthodox economics

Because political economy is not a unified discipline there are a variety of studies that use the term which have overlapping subject matter but radically different viewpoints

Sociology is the study of the effects of involvement in society on individuals as members groups and how this changes their ability to function Many sociologists begin from a framework of production determining relationship drawn from Karl Marx

Anthropology often studies political economy by studying the relationship between the world capitalist system and local cultures

Psychology is frequently the fulcrum around which political economy centers in that it deals with decision making not as being a black box whose effects are seen only in price decisions but as being a source of study and therefore the assumptions in a model of political economy

History since it documents change over time is often used as a means of arguing in political economy and often historical works have a framework of political economy which they assume or argue as the basis for the narrative structure 

Economics because it studies activity and price relationships and the effects of scarcity grew out of political economy It is often used in political economy to argue policy effects and study the results of actions and it is often in opposition to political economy in that many if not most practicing economists see political economy as being a hindrance to the operation of economic forces From the point of view of political economy economics is a branch of the entire study and economics has at its basis a theory of political economy which should be open to examination

Law since it concerns the creation of policy or the mediation of policy ends through political acts which have specific individual results is seen in political economy as both political capital and social infrastructure on one hand  and as the result of the sociology of a society on the other

Constitutional economics is the academic sub discipline of economics and constitutionalism It is often described as the economic analysis of constitutional law Constitutional economics tries to explain the selection of different constitutional rules limiting the choices and activities of economic and political agencies This is different from the approach of traditional economics Also constitutional economics studies how well economic decisions of the state agree with the existing constitutional economic rights of its citizens For example proper distribution of economic and financial resources of the state is a big question for every nation Constitutional economics helps finding a legal mechanism to solve this problem

Ecology is often involved in political economy because human activity is one of the single largest effects on the environment and because it is the suitability of the environment for human beings which is one of the central concerns of most human beings The ecological effects of economic activity on the environment have spurred the creation of a great deal of research studying means of changing the incentives balance of the market economy This work is particularly controversial in its interaction with economics since it questions the fundamental econometric assumptions of market economics and their basic validity

The My Lai Massacre was the killing of hundreds of civilians by United States troops at the village of My Lai Vietnam on March 16 1968 A memorial in My Lai lists the names of 504 victims

Before the massacre US troops were told that all of the true civilians would be at the market and the remaining people would be members of the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam When the soldiers got to the village they did not find any NLF troops Despite this many troopers began to kill the villagers mainly elderly people women and children 

The killings were stopped by an American helicopter pilot

The killings were covered up by the United States Army but eventually 26 soldiers were charged with being involved in the killings However only one Lieutenant William Calley was found guilty

The massacre caused public opinion in the United States to shift further towards wanting peace

Richard I the Lionheart

Henry was the son of Geoffrey of Anjou and Empress Matilda He married Eleanor of Aquitaine in 1152 and was crowned king in 1154 His children included the future kings Richard who would later lead many battles and John Although he was King of England he never learnt the English language because his family had come over from Normandy in 1066 They spoke Norman French Henry was intelligent and well educated He spoke Latin fluently which was the language of educated people in Europe at that time All documents and laws were written in Latin

Henry IIs succession to the English throne was agreed in 1153 He finally came to the throne in 1154 upon Stephen Is death He reduced the power of the barons who had become very powerful in Stephens reign and in 1166 introduced trial by jury

One of the big events that happened while Henry ruled was the killing of Thomas Becket Henry and Becket were old friends who found themselves in dispute once Becket became the Archbishop of Canterbury Their dispute was over the role of the Church in England Becket was trying to increase the power of church courts that had lost power when Henry had made major changes to the legal system Four knights killed Becket in Canterbury Cathedral Legend say that the knights had heard Henry say Who will rid me of this turbulent priest 

Henrys first son William Count of Poitiers died in as a baby In 1170 Henry and Eleanors fifteen year old son Henry was crowned king Young Henry never ruled and is not in the list of the kings and queens of England he became known as Henry the Young King so he was not confused with his nephew Henry III

Henry and his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine had five sons and three daughters William Henry Richard Geoffrey John Matilda Eleanor and Joan Henry tried to take Eleanors lands from her This led to conflict between Henry on the one side and his wife and sons on the other

Henry also had many children outside of his marriage including William de Longespee Earl of Salisbury whose mother was Ida Countess of Norfolk Geoffrey Archbishop of York son of a woman named Ykenai Morgan Bishop of Durham and Matilda Abbess of Barking

Guantnamo Bay is a bay located in Guantnamo province at the south eastern end of Cuba It is the largest harbour on the south side of the island It is surrounded by steep hills creating an enclave cut off from its immediate hinterland 

The bay was originally named Guantnamo by the Tano Christopher Columbus landed at the location known as Fishermans Point in 1494 naming it Puerto Grande On landing Columbuss crew found Tano fisherman preparing a feast for the local chieftain When Spanish settlers took control of the island the bay became a vital harbor on the south side of the island

The bay has been the focus of military activities for a long time In the colonial era British troops tried to land there during the War of the Jenkins Ear That war was between England and Spain It took place between 1739 and 1742 The troops could land in trhe bay and later tried to take the city Santiago de Cuba As it turned out this was impossible So the troops claimed the bay as theirs and named it Cumberland Harbour Later they left the island again because some of their troops had died from tropical diseases 

The United States tried to buy the whole island of Cuba In the Spanish American war US troops occupied the bay because there was a harbour thereThe Treaty of Paris between the  United States and Spain ended the war It gave Cuba its independence from Spain Spain also gave the territory of Puerto Rico the islands of Guam and the Philippines to the United States amongst others Cuba however came under the political and military infuence of the United States The US then put presidents and dictators at the head of the Cuban state These were of course favorable to the interests of the United States In 1902 the Platt Amendment was appended to the Constitution of the Cuban state It limited the freedom of Cuba very much It also said that some territory in the south should be ceded to the United States for a military base Bound by the amendment the Cubans granted the US a 99 year lease to the territory This treaty was made by Toms Estrada Palma an American citizen who became the first President of Cuba

The current Cuban government rejects the Cuban American Treaty because it violates article 52 of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties The Cuban government therefore considers the US presence in Guantnamo to be an illegal occupation of the area Article 52 declares a treaty void only if its conclusion has been procured by the threat or use of force in violation of international law refref

The pulmonary artery is a blood vessel that connects the heart to the lungs The pulmonary artery carries blood that does not have much oxygen The blood from throughout the body is taken into the heart by the right atrium into the right ventricle The blood is pumped into the pulmonary artery and into the lung capillaries When the blood passes through the capillaries slowly to absorb the oxygen from the lungs The oxygenated blood is taken through the pulmonary vein back into the heart through the left atrium and the left ventricle It is then pumped throughout the body

A heartbeat is the sounds that the heart makes when it pumps blood A change in heart sounds might mean illness There are normally four heart sounds Two of them S1 and S2 can be heard with a stethoscope Two other sounds S3 and S4 can not be heard but they can be seen using a machine called a phonocardiograph There are many other heart sounds which are abnormal and can be heard or seen The heartbeat can be normal until 100 beats per second

An artery is a blood vessel that carries blood away from the heart to other parts of the body Some arteries lead to your lungs Most of the time arteries carry oxygen rich blood within them Arteries have thick covering and are situated deep under the skin Valves are not available in these vessels

Warwickshire is a county in central England The county town is Warwick The shape of the administrative area Warwickshire differs considerably from that of the historic county Commonly used abbreviations for the county are Warks or Warwicks

Warwickshire is perhaps best known for being the birthplace of William Shakespeare from Stratford upon Avon The county has also produced other literary figures such as George Eliot Rupert Brooke and Michael Drayton from Hartshill

Warwickshire is bounded to the northwest by the West Midlands metropolitan county and Staffordshire by Leicestershire to the northeast Northamptonshire to the east Worcestershire to the west Oxfordshire to the south Gloucestershire to the southwest

The majority of Warwickshires population live in the north and centre of the county The market towns of northern and eastern Warwickshire were industrialised in the 19th century and include Atherstone Bedworth Nuneaton and Rugby Major industries included coal mining textiles engineering and cement production but heavy industry is in decline Of the northern and eastern towns only Nuneaton and Rugby are well known outside of Warwickshire The rich towns of central and western Warwickshire include Leamington Spa Stratford upon Avon Kenilworth Alcester and Warwick They have light to medium industries services and tourism as major employers

The south of the county is largely rural and has little population and includes a small area of the Cotswolds The only town in the south of Warwickshire is Shipston on Stour The highest point in the county at 261 m is Ebrington Hill on the border with Gloucestershire GR SP187426 at its southwest extremity

There are no cities in Warwickshire since both Coventry and Birmingham were incorporated into the West Midlands county in 1974 The largest towns in Warwickshire as of 2004 are Nuneaton Rugby Leamington Spa and Bedworth Stratford Warwick and Kenilworth all house populations with more than 20000 inhabitants the smaller towns of Atherstone Alcester Coleshill Southam Bulkington Polesworth Kingsbury Henley in Arden Studley Shipston and Whitnash have populations between 5000 and 12000

Historically much of western Warwickshire was covered by the ancient Forest of Arden For this reason the names of a number of places in the northwestern part of Warwickshire end with the phrase in Arden

Areas historically part of Warwickshire include Coventry Solihull and most of Birmingham These became part of the West Midlands metropolitan county following local government re organisation in 1974

Since 1986 Birmingham Coventry and Solihull have been effective unitary authorities but they still remain legally part of the West Midlands

Some organisations such as Warwickshire County Cricket Club which is based in Edgbaston in Birmingham still observe the historic county boundaries

Coventry is effectively in the centre of the Warwickshire area and still has strong ties with the county Coventry and Warwickshire are sometimes treated as a single area and share a single NHS trust and ambulance service as well as other institutions

The town of Tamworth was historically divided between Warwickshire and Staffordshire but since 1888 has been fully in Staffordshire

In 1931 Warwickshire got the town of Shipston on Stour from Worcestershire and several villages including Long Marston and Welford on Avon from Gloucestershire

This is a list of the main settlements in Warwickshire including towns or villages with a population of over 5000 For a complete list see List of places in Warwickshire

Doppler effect is a change in frequency and wavelength of a wave It is caused by the change in distance between the thing creating the wave and whatever is measuring seeing or hearing the wave

Another word for causer is sender Another word for change in distance is speed or relative velocity A common example is sitting in a car while another car goes by the watcher The watcher will hear a change in pitch while the sender will not

For waves read all the waves that can send out or reflected by a object And for reflection read change of direction of a wave

If watcher and causer get closer the wavelength is shorter and the frequency is higher

If the distance between watcher and causer gets longer the frequency is lower and the wavelength is longer

Lightwaves can also be read examples are

An extreme example of the doppler effect is an airplane flying at a faster speed than the speed of sound and how the wall of sound is heard on the ground

The Upper Cretaceous was a period in Earth history from 100 to 65 million years ago The Cretaceous is traditionally divided into Lower Cretaceous and Upper Cretaceous because of the different rocks 

The rocks reflect the conditions in which they were formed as sediment 

The Upper Cretaceous is the chalk It is composed of countless millions of calcareous plates called coccoliths They are so small they can only just be seen with a light microscope details require an electron microscope The plates are formed by single celled planktonic algae called coccolithophores and were laid down in the off shore seas 

The only other rock found in chalk is the flint which is siliceous This derives from those algae and animals which have skeletons of silica 

The Cretaceous was the last period when dinosaurs were the dominant land animals Triceratops Tyrannosaurus and Velociraptor lived at this time The huge Mosasaurus was the dominant marine predator In the Cretaceous period birds became more diverse Flowering plants developed more and became the dominant plants on land The Upper Cretaceous ended with the KT extinction event

Digenea are a type of flatworms They are parasites They have two suckers usually One of them is located ventrally and the other is located orally

The Aspidogastrea is a small group of flukes There are about 80 species The group is a subclass of the Trematoda and sister group to the Digenea Species are between approximately one mm to several cm long They are parasites of freshwater and marine molluscs and vertebrates Maturation may occur in the mollusc or vertebrate host None of the species has any economic importance but the group is of very great interest to biologists because it has several characters which appear to be archaic

Theropods are a group of bipedal saurischian dinosaurs 

Although they were primarily carnivorous a number of theropod groups evolved herbivory omnivory and insectivory 

Theropods first appear during the Carnian age of the Upper Triassic about 230 million years ago They were the sole large terrestrial carnivores from the Lower Jurassic until the close of the Cretaceous about 65 million years ago 

Today they are represented by the 9300 living species of birds which evolved in the Upper Jurassic from small feathered coelurosaurian dinosaurs 

Among the features linking theropods to birds are the three toed foot a furcula air filled bones and feathers and brooding of the eggs

From this beginning in the 1950s a good sized theory has been built up A basic connection was noticed between the module theory and the p adic L functions that were defined in the 1960s by Kubota and Leopoldt The latter begin from the Bernoulli numbers and use interpolation to define p adic analogues of the Dirichlet L functions It became clear that the theory might be able to move ahead finally from Kummers century old results on regular primes

The main conjecture of Iwasawa theory was formulated as an assertion that two ways of defining p adic L functions should coincide as far as that was well defined This was eventually proved by Barry Mazur and Andrew Wiles for Q and for all totally real number fields by Andrew Wiles These proofs were modeled upon Ken Ribets proof of the converse to Herbrands theorem

More recently also modeled upon Ribets method Chris Skinner and Eric Urban have announced a proof of a main conjecture for GL An easier proof of the Mazur Wiles theorem can be found by using Euler systems as developed by Kolyvagin Other generalizations of the main conjecture proved using the Euler system method have been found by Karl Rubin amongst others

In mathematics a ring is an algebraic structure consisting of a set together with 2 operations addition and multiplication The operations are used to combine two elements to form a third element There are a few rules the set and the operations must satisfy to qualify as a ring These are called ring axioms

The number of elements in a ring is called its order

Some rings have additional properties from those mentioned above these rings get special names

Commutative Ring If multiplication is commutative that is For all a and b in R the equation a b b a holds then the ring is called a commutative ring

Ring with Unity If there is a multiplicative identity element that is an element e such that for all elements a in R the equation e a a e a holds then the ring is called a ring with unity also this element is usually written as 1

Division Ring If every element of the ring has a multiplicative inverse that is for each a in R there exists an element a 1 in R such that a a 1 1 where 1 is the multiplicative identity element then the ring is called a division ring

Integral Domain In a ring it is possible to have 2 elements multiply together and get 0 without either element being 0 these elements are called 0 divisors If there are no 0 divisors then the ring is called an integral domain

Field A ring with all of the above properties is called a field

Neruda was born in the City of Parral in Chile on July 12 1904 born under the name Ricardo Neftali Reyes Nerudas mother died shortly after he was born but the child Neruda came to love his stepmother as if she had been his real mother Neruda started to write poetry as a young boy but his father wanted him to study mathematics so he could become a teacher Neruda was mainly interested in literature and writing poems which he would mail out to magazines to prevent his parents discovering that he was doing this he changed his name to Pablo Neruda 

In 1920 Neruda moved to Santiago to study French at the University of Chile which he did to please his parents who wanted him to become a teacher Soon Neruda became deeply involved in his poetry and in 1923 he published his first book Crepusculario

After a number of years Neruda became a very famous person in his country and the world and was assigned diplomatic posts in various countries for long periods of time such as Indonesia Spain and France

Neruda died from cancer at the age of 69 in Santiago Chile in 1973 He also had a sister that was born dead when he was 3 or 4 years old From his fathers second marriage he had a stepbrother Ricardo Reyes Candia and a stepsister Laura Reyes Candia both kids from his momother Trinidad Candia and his father Don Reyes

Some of Nerudas poetry is very difficult to understand because they are about events of World history such as the colonization of America the Spanish Civil War Nazi Germany and other conflicts Neruda also references important figures of World history In some of his poetry Neruda tends to link historical events from different eras and different parts of the world into one major conflict as in his Canto General 

But Neruda also wrote poetry that can be easily appreciated by all such as his odes which Neruda wrote on all sorts of common things such onions lemons and the common cat 

Neruda was very concerned in how his poetry sounded he liked rhythm and many have claimed he had a musical intelligence ie he wrote with music in his mind He would record many of his poems on a tape recorder and many of his recordings were sold like records in the Spanish speaking world 

Many academics and scholars consider Neruda to be one of the most important and widely read poets of the 1900s Many go as far as to place him alongside Shakespeare and Dante This is probably because Neruda wrote poems on all sorts of topics appealing to people of all ages and interests poems about love on historical events he wrote about native people about nature and about simple things 

Neruda was also an avid collector of all sorts of things He had one of the largest collections of seashells in the world and collected bottles and model ships

Many of Nerudas poems have been used in movies and in music such as in the classical music of the Greek composer Mikis Theodorakis and in the movies such as Il Postino or Patch Adams Many famous people have also recorded narrations of his poems such as Julia Roberts Madonna Andy Garcia and Glen Close

The Truth about Nanjing is a Japanese movie in the making It is thought to be made by fundamental Japanese nationalists In this movie they want to deny the fact of the Nanking Massacre

The Nanking Massacre is a genocide that took place in Nanjing China during the Second World War After the invasion of Nanjing tens of thousands of Chinese civilians were killed and raped by the Imperial Japanese Army The number of the people killed is thought to be over 350000 Some of the Japanese soldiers were executed after World War II by the Allies for their war crimes Even today many Japanese people believe that the Nanking Massacre was faked

Neoliberalism is a term for different social and economic ideas Originally the term was used by a group of liberals who helped shape social market economy in the mid 20th century Today this term is mostly used by people who are critical of the ideas of globalisation as well as trade unionists

The ideas were developed by the economists Friedrich Hayek Wilhelm Rpke Walter Eucken as well as other less prominent thinkers They were first presented at a conference in 1938

Neoliberals want a free market economy with everything it stands for They see however that in some cases the freedom of the market fails or it does not yield the results wanted In such cases the state should intervene The main focus of the state should therefore be measures to regulate the following

Neoliberals are openly against lobbying of groups state interventions that aim to protect national interests like import duties or subsidies Neoliberalism is also against a centrally governed economy What is more it frowns upon the Laissez faire of classical Liberalism

In economics a cartel is a group of formerly independent companies overtly agree to work together The objectives of cartels are to increase their profits or to stabilize market sales They do this by fixing the price of goods by limiting market supply or by other means Monopolies are not cartels because in a monopoly there is only one independent company Cartels are bad for the economy in general and for their customers who are overcharged Cartels usually occur in oligopolies where there are a small number of players that control the majority of supply in a market 

Besides the sellers cartel just described buyers may also form cartels to suppress the price of a purchased input Another type of cartel is the bidding ring In bid rigging potential suppliers form an agreement as to which of them will win a supply contract at a price above the competitive price and if one of them wins then agree to a rule for sharing the extra profits among themselves Bid rigging is most common among construction firms trying to get a government building project 

A survey was done of hundreds of published economic studies and legal decisions of antitrust authorities It found that the median price increase achieved by cartels in the last 200 years is 25 Private international cartels had an average price increase of 28 Domestic cartels averaged 18 Less than 10 of all cartels in the sample failed to raise market prices 

In general cartel agreements are difficult to negotiate because potential members typically have different ideal collusive prices Once formed cartels tend to be economically unstable primarily because there is a profit incentive for members to cheat by selling at below the agreed price or selling more than the production quotas set by the cartel Cheating on prices is difficult for cartel members to observe so more successful cartels often agree to fix their market quotas share verifiable information about those shares and agree in advance on some mechanism to punish members that exceed their quotas This has caused many cartels that attempt to set product prices to be unsuccessful in the long term Empirical studies of 20th century cartels have determined that the mean duration of discovered cartels is from 5 to 8 years However once a cartel is broken the incentives to form the cartel return and the cartel may be re formed Publicly known cartels that do not follow this cycle include the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries

Price fixing is often practiced internationally When the agreement to control price is sanctioned by a multilateral treaty or protected by national sovereignty no antitrust actions may be initiated Examples of such price fixing include oil whose price is partly controlled by the supply by OPEC countries Also international airline tickets have prices fixed by agreement with the IATA a practice for which there is a specific exception in antitrust law

International price fixing by private entities can be prosecuted under the antitrust laws of more than 100 countries Examples of prosecuted international cartels are lysine citric acid graphite electrodes and bulk vitamins

In economics an oligopoly is when a market is controlled by a small number of sellers Very often there are only 3 or 4 of them Oligopolies are very common The main feature of the oligopoly is that a decision made by one market player influences the whole market 

In many countries some country held companies were privatized Very often this privatization lead to oligopolies In many countries there are only a handful of companies providing networks for mobile phones They control the prices for accessing the network That is why using a mobile phone is often much more expensive than using a land line one

In economics market structure describes the state of a market with respect to competition

Most market forms given below talk about a homogeneous product This simply means that they all make the same kind of product and that the individual consumer does not care where he or she buys from They simply want to get the cheapest one since all kinds of sugars look the same anyway 

The major market forms are

The imperfectly competitive structure is quite identical to the realistic market conditions where some monopolistic competitors monopolists oligopolists and duopolists exist and dominate the market conditions

These somewhat abstract concerns usually determine some but not all details of a specific concrete market system where buyers and sellers actually meet and commit to trade

The correct sequence of the market structure from most to least competitive is perfect competition imperfect competition oligopoly and pure monopoly

The main criteria by which one can distinguish between different market structures are the number and size of producers and consumers in the market the type of goods and services being traded and the degree to which information can flow freely

Perfect competition is a market form In a market that has perfect competition there are many companies that sell a certain product A single company can not influence the market price as people would buy from other companies instead

Monopolistic competition is a market form Like with Perfect competition there are many buyers and sellers But the market is not perfect This is because the products are not homogeneous or because the buyers have explicit or implicit preferences

This market form is quite common As an example take a bakery There are many bakeries in the town but one of those bakeries can demand a slightly higher price for bread because it is the only one in a certain part of the town

Monopolistically competitive firms are able to gain a greater degree of market share and as a result increase prices If a particular bakery is known for selling the best pies and pasties in town they can increase their prices for pies and pasties as they know consumers will pay slightly more for a superior product This is known as establishing a brand name and brand loyalty

Supply and demand is a model of microeconomics It looks at how a price is formed This is done because producers and consumers interact with each other This will fix the price for a certain type of good In Perfect competition the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied will be equal This will fix the price There will be economic equilibrium

When there is more supply this will cause prices to fall because people will not want to pay more for items that can be found easily When there is more demand prices will go up because many people want to buy the same item but there is not enough supply for it 

When demands for new goods and services go up new markets come into being The greater the demand the faster this happens This greater number of providers makes the supply go up which forces the price down toward the cost of production and distribution

It was Alfred Marshall who first described the model

In economics people talk about elasticity of supply or demand or of price 

If the price for an item with an elastic demand goes up the demand for it will go down For example people will buy fewer DVDs if DVDs get more expensive DVDs have an elastic demand

If an item has inelastic demand the demand for it will not be affected by the price of it For example if the price of salt increases people will not buy less of it They need their daily salt intake The demand of salt is therefore inelastic

Metamorphosis in biology means the process of transformation from an immature form to an adult form in two or more distinct stages Good examples are insects and amphibians Life for most insects begins as a larva or nymph then progresses to the pupa stage and ends as an adult

There are two main types of metamorphosis in insects incomplete metamorphosis or hemimetabolism and complete metamorphosis or holometabolism

Insects change how they look and what they can do when they grow Some insectswith incomplete metamorphosis have three different life stages These insects start as eggs which are sometimes so small you cannot see them with the naked eye When the egg hatches a larva or nymph comes out Nymphs are just baby insects Most of the time the nymph looks similar to the adult but it is smaller may have different coloration and does not have wings The nymph grows through stages called instars shedding its skin at each stage Finally it changes finally into a mature adult with wings

Some insect nymphs are aquatic which means they live in water These nymphs usually have gills and look very different from the adults they will turn into Nymphs that live in water are called naiads

Some insects that have a life cycle of egg nymph adult are

When all insects grow they change how they look Insects that have complete metamorphosis have four different life stages These insects start as eggs which are very small The egg hatches and a larva comes out The larva looks like a worm and eats and eats so that it can grow much bigger When the larva has grown it changes into a pupa The pupa usually can not move or eat The pupa is a special time when the insect is changing into an adult that will look very different from the larva or the pupa Moth pupae are inside cocoons When the pupa opens the adult insect comes out

Many insects have a life cycle of egg larva pupa adult Some of these insects are

The Monarch Butterfly goes through four stages of development Life for a Monarch butterfly begins as an egg hatched from an adult This egg then develops into a worm like larva caterpillar In the pupa or chrysalis stage the caterpillar spins a silk pad on a twig or leaves and hangs from this pad by its last pair of prolegs It hangs upside down in the shape of a J and then molts leaving it encased in a green exoskeleton The mature butterfly emerges after about two weeks and feeds on a variety of flowers including milkweed flowers red clover and goldenrod

In typical amphibian development eggs are laid in water and larvae are adapted to an aquatic lifestyle Frogs toads and newts all hatch from the egg as larvae with external gills Afterwards newt larvae start a predatory lifestyle while tadpoles mostly scrape food off surfaces with their horny tooth ridges

Marine organisms with a larval stage usually release large numbers of larvae into the water column where these larvae develop and grow before metamorphosing into adults Most marine invertebrates and many fish have evolved a life cycle involving a pelagic larval stage or pelagic eggs that have the capacity to be transported long distances

Resilience generally means the ability to recover from some shock or disturbance 

There are different meanings for

Resilience is a term used in psychology to describe the capacity of people to cope with stress and catastrophe It is also used to indicate a characteristic of resistance to future negative events This psychological meaning of resilience is often contrasted with risk factors

An example of a biomaterial which has a high resilience is articular cartilage the substance lining the ends of bones in articulating joints such as the knee and hip

In ecology resilience has been defined in two competing fashions that emphasize two different aspects of stability 

One definition is the rate at which a system returns to a single steady or cyclic state following a perturbation This definition of resilience assumes that behavior of a system remains within the stable domain that contains this steady state

When a system can reorganize that is shift from one stability domain to another a more relevant measure of ecosystem dynamics is ecological resilience It is a measure of the amount of change or disruption that is required to transform a system from being maintained by one set of mutually reinforcing processes and structures to a different set of processes and structures

The second definition emphasizes conditions far from any steady states where instabilities can flip a system into another regime of behavior  ie to another stability domain In this case resilience is measured by the magnitude of disturbance that can be absorbed before the system changes its structure by changing the variables and processes that control behavior This type of resilience has been defined as ecological resilience

Economic resilence is the ability of a local economy to retain function employment and prosperity in the face of the perturbation caused by the shock of the loss of a particular type of local industry or employer

Within the broad domain of industrial safety the term resilience has come into use to emphasise that safety must be proactive as well as reactive Whereas conventional risk management approaches emphasise calculation of failure probabilities resilience engineering looks for ways to strengthen the ability of organisations to create processes that are robust yet flexible

Resilience is the ability of the network to provide and maintain an acceptable level of service in the face of various faults and challenges to normal operation

Resilient networks aim to provide acceptable service to applications

St Andrews is a town that has its name from Saint Andrew the Apostle and is a former royal burgh on the east coast of Fife Scotland and an important home of golf It has a population of about 18 000 and stands on the North Sea coast between Edinburgh and Dundee It is home to Scotlands oldest university the University of St Andrews

The town is called home of golf for two reasons First the Royal and Ancient Golf Club founded in 1754has authority over the game worldwide except in the USA and Mexico Second the beautiful links is the most frequent venue for The Open Championship the oldest of golfs four major championships 

Visitors travel to St Andrews in great numbers for several courses ranked amongst the finest in the world as well as for the sandy beaches

The Cathedral of St Andrew was at one time Scotlands largest building It was founded by Bishop Robert It was not completed and consecrated until 1318 in the reign of Robert the Bruce 

St Rules tower stands in the Cathedral grounds but is older than the cathedral Probably it was part of the Cathedral up to the early 12th century 

The ruins of St Andrews Castle stand on a rock at the sea It is said that Bishop Roger erected the first stone castle on the site about the beginning of the 13th century as an episcopal residence 

The University of St Andrews owed its origin to a society formed in 1410 by Lawrence of Lindores abbot of Scone and a few others 

The University library which now includes the older college libraries was founded about the middle of the 17th century rebuilt in 1764 and improved in 1829 and 1889  1890 

The modern buildings in the Jacobean style were erected between 1827 and 1847 University College Dundee became in 1890 affiliated to the University of St Andrews 

The element St Andrew St Andrews or St Andrews is found in the names of many places and institutions All of them are named after Saint Andrew a Christian saint and one of the New Testament Apostles

The Encyclopdia Britannica Eleventh Edition is one the most famous edition of the Encyclopdia Britannica Some of its articles were written by the best known scholars of this time The articles are still of value and interest to modern scholars as examples for the knowledge of the 19th and early 20th centuries They contain however a number of problematic areas for the modern scholar using them as a source The eleventh edition is no longer restricted by copyright and has become available online both in its original text and where parts of it have become part of other online encyclopedias and works

The 1911 eleventh edition was assembled under the leadership of American publisher Horace Everett Hooper and edited by Hugh Chisholm American marketing methods assisted sales Some 11 of the contributors were American and a New York office was established to run that side of the enterprise

Some articles were written by the best known scholars of the day such as Edmund Gosse J B Bury Algernon Charles Swinburne John Muir Prince Peter Kropotkin T H Huxley G K Chesterton Edmund Husserl and William Michael Rossetti and others well known to that era 

The eleventh edition introduced a number of changes to the format of the Britannica It was the first to be published complete instead of the previous method of volumes being released as they were ready The content of the encyclopaedia was made up as follows

The eleventh edition has become a commonly quoted source because of the reputation of the Britannica at that time and because it is now in the public domain and has been made available on the Internet The Encyclopdia Britannica of 1911 has been used as a source for many modern projects such as Wikipedia and the Gutenberg Encyclopedia

The Project Gutenberg Encyclopedia is actually the eleventh edition of the Encyclopdia Britannica renamed to address Britannicas trademark concerns

The 1971 Bangladesh atrocities refer to the murder of many people in Bangladesh and also unfair treatment carried out by the Pakistan National Army during the Indo Pakistani War III and Indo Pakistani War of 1971 Nationalists Bangladeshis call this a genocide However the Islamic Fundamentalists who own operate and run the country of Pakistan laugh at such the things calling it Bengali Lies Bangladeshi authorities and some independent organizations say that between 1 3 million people were killed Another 10 million ran away from the country to be safe in Indias West Bengal province

When the traitory Bengalis did not agree with Pakistan Pakistans soldiers picked out Hindus Bengali Muslims smart people students and politicians in order to kill them all They went to schools and killed everybody there A TIME magazine clearly said that The Hindus are three fourths of the refugees and most of the dead have most disliked by the Muslim soldiers 

Two Muslims called Al Shams and Al Badr were told by the Pakistanis to kill Bengali Hindus and traitory Bengali Muslims also There are many graves with a lot of people in Bangladesh and new graves with a lot of people are always being discovered 

A bad set of killings took place during Operation Searchlight a series of killings which began on March 25 1971 and ended on December 16 1971 and led to death of 3 million Bengalis in East Pakistan as well as other bad things like rape and looting Originally the Pakistanis wanted to take over the big cities in Bangladesh and control everybody in one month They did not expect that the Bengalis would fight back which they did Pakistanis got very angry and started to kill all the Bengalis

Eventually the Bengali freedom fighters under the Mukti Bahini would seek help from India to win against the Pakistanis India sent its army in and fought the Pakistanis with the Bengalis until Pakistan was totally defeated and went away from Bangladesh on December 16 1971

The number of people that died in this war is not known very well Pakistan says only 30000 people died India and Bangladesh say that nearly 3 million were killed Many media people outside the region also state numbers that do not always agree varying from 5000 to 35000 people in Dhaka and 200000 to 3000000 for Bangladesh as a whole 

In 1997 R J Rummel wrote a book called Statistics of Democide Genocide and Mass Murder Since 1900 In Chapter 8 called Statistics Of Pakistans Democide  Estimates Calculations And Sources he says

Rummel says this was an act of killing specific groups of people He writes that Consolidating both ranges I give a final estimate of Pakistans democide to be 300000 to 3000000 or a prudent 1500000

Iwao Takamoto was a Japanese American animator television producer and film director He was a production designer for Hanna Barbera Productions and the artistcharacter designer of Scooby Doo

Takamotos father moved from Hiroshima to the United States for his health He only went back to Japan once and that was to marry his wife Takamoto was born on April 19 1925 in Los Angeles California After the bombing of Pearl Harbor Takamotos family like many Japanese Americans had to move to an internment camp They spent the rest of World War II in the Manzanar internment camp While he was there Takamoto received basic illustration training from other people in the camp

Takamoto first started doing cartoons professionally after the end of the war He was hired as an assistant animator by Walt Disney Studios in 1947 Takamoto eventually became an assistant for the legendary Milt Kahl He worked as an animator on such titles as Cinderella Sleeping Beauty One Hundred and One Dalmatians and Lady and the Tramp

Takamoto left Disney in 1961 and joined Hanna Barbera Productions shortly afterwards He did many jobs there but is arguably best known as a character designer He was responsible for the original character design of such characters as Scooby Doo The Jetsons dog Astro and Penelope Pitstop He worked as a producer at Hanna Barbera supervising shows such as The Addams Family Hong Kong Phooey and Jabberjaw He directed several feature length animated films including Charlottes Web and Jetsons The Movie The inspiration for Scooby Doos creation as a Great Dane came from an employee of the Hanna Barbera company who bred this dog 

Takamoto was Vice President of Creative Design at Hanna Barbera and was responsible for overseeing Hanna Barberas product related merchandising In 2005 he received the Golden Award from the Animation Guild to honour his more than 50 years of service in the animation field

He died on January 8 2007 at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles from a heart attack at age 81

Palaeoheterodonta

Mussels are several families of bivalve molluscs Mussels live in lakes rivers and creeks The sometimes also live in intertidal areas along coastlines worldwide The freshwater mussels and saltwater mussels are not closely related despite the fact that they may look similar They are grouped in different subclasses The freshwater Zebra mussels and their relatives live attached to rocks in a manner similar to marine mussels but are classified with the Heterodonta the taxonomic group including most bivalves referred to as clams

From archeology it is known that humans have been eating mussels for thousands of years They can be cooked or eaten raw Care must be taken however as mussels quickly become poisonous after they die

The Gastropods or univalves are the largest and most successful class of molluscs 6000075000 known living species belong to it Most of are marine but many live in freshwater or on land Their fossil record goes back to the later Cambrian 

Slugs and snails abalones limpets cowries conches top shells whelks and sea slugs are all Gastropods The gastropods are in origin sea floor predators though they did evolve into many other habitats Many lines living today evolved in the Mesozoic era taking advantage of the huge supply of food on the sea floor 

Snails have torsion a process where the body broken wikt linkcoilcoils to one side during development The significance of this procedure is not yet clear

They have a well defined head with two or four sensory tentacles They also have a head foot which it moves on The eyes at the tip of the tentacles range from simple to more complex eyes 

Most members have a shell which is in one piece and coiled or spiralled it usually opens on the right hand side Some species have an operculum a lid or trapdoor to close the shell In some the slugs the shell is absent and the body is streamlined The best known gastropods are land slugs and snails but more than half of all species live in a marine environment Marine gastropods include herbivores detritus feeders carnivores and a few ciliary feeders in which the radula is reduced or absent The radula is usually adapted to the food that a species eats 

The simplest gastropods are the limpets and abalones both herbivores that use their hard radulas to rasp at seaweeds on rocks Many marine gastropods are burrowers and have siphons or tubes that extend from the mantle and sometimes the shell These act as snorkels enabling the animal to continue to draw in a water current containing oxygen and food into their bodies The siphons are also used to detect prey from a distance These gastropods breathe with gills Some freshwater species and almost all terrestric species have developed lungs 

Gastropods from several different families are called sea slugs They are often flamboyantly coloured This may be either as a warning if they are poisonous or to camouflage them on the corals and seaweeds where many of them live Their gills are often feathery plumes on their backs This is what gives the name to the nudibranchs Nudibranchs with smooth or warty backs have no visible gill mechanisms and respiration may take place directly through the skin A few of the sea slugs are herbivores and some are carnivores Many have distinct dietary preferences and regularly occur in association with certain species

The taxonomy of the Gastropoda is at present under constant revision Two major revisions have been published in the last twenty years and there will certainly be others Much of the old taxonomy is being abandoned The taxonomy of the Gastropoda can be different from author to author With the arrival of DNA sequencing further revisions of the higher taxonomic levels are to be expected

According to modern ideas the taxonomy of the Gastropoda should be written in terms of strictly monophyletic groups It will be difficult to do this and still have a practical taxonomy for working biologists There are differences between the older groupings got from morphology and those based on genome sequences Convergent evolution which has occurred often in Gastropods may account for these differences

This was the traditional classification into four subclasses

The first gastropods were exclusively marine The first of the group appeared in the Upper Cambrian By the Ordovician period the gastropods were a varied group present in a few aquatic habitats Commonly fossil gastropods from the rocks of the early Palaeozoic era are too poorly preserved for accurate identification Still the Silurian genus Poleumita contains fifteen identified species Fossil gastropods are less common during the Palaeozoic era than bivalves

Most of the gastropods of that era belong to primitive groups A few of these groups still survive today By the Carboniferous period many of the shapes seen in living gastropods can be matched in the fossil record Despite these similarities in appearance the majority of these older forms are not directly related to living forms It was during the Mesozoic era that the ancestors of many of the living gastropods evolved One of the earliest known terrestrial gastropods is Maturipupa which is found in the Coal Measures of the Carboniferous period in Europe In the case of the common fossil Bellerophon from Carboniferous limestones in Europe it is not known whether it is a gasropod or not

Relatives of the modern land snails are rare before the Cretaceous period The familiar Helix first appeared in that period 

In rocks of the Mesozoic era gastropods are more common as fossils and their shell is often well preserved Their fossils occur in beds of both freshwater and marine environments The Purbeck Marble of the Jurassic period and the Sussex Marble of the early Cretaceous period which both occur in southern England are limestones containing the tightly packed remains of the pond snail Viviparus

Rocks of the Cainozoic era have very large numbers of gastropod fossils in them Many of these fossils are closely related to modern living forms The diversity of the gastropods increased markedly at the beginning of this era along with that of the bivalves

Gastropods are one of the groups that record the changes in fauna caused by the advance and retreat of the Ice Sheets during the Pleistocene epoch

These pages illustrate the variety of gastropod forms Abalone Chiton Conch Cowry Limpet Nudibranch Sea slug Slug Snail Whelk 

The name Limpet is used for many marine and freshwater gastropod species which have a simple conical shell The phrase true limpets is used only for marine limpets in the ancient clade Patellogastropoda This article is mainly about the true limpets

True limpets are small marine gastropod molluscs with flattened cone shaped shells They live throughout the intertidal zone attached to rocks or other hard ground They attach themselves using mucus and a muscular foot which seals them against the rock and protects them from desiccation during low tide and from high energy waves action 

Limpets eat by grazing on algae found on rock surfaces They scrape films of algae from the rock with a radula a ribbon like tongue with rows of teeth Limpets move by rippling the muscles of their foot in a wave like motion Most limpets are less than 3in long but a West Mexican Limpet grows to be 8in

Some key hole limpets have a hole at the top through which gas exchange can occur 

There are many limpets in the Paleozoic fossil record from the lower Cambrian but none can be placed with certainty in the Patellogastropoda Some might be Monoplacophorans which is a separate mollusc class with a similar life style The earliest patellogastropod verified by shell microstructure is from the Triassic of Italy but it is in the Upper Cretaceous and Cainozoic periods that many of the living forms make their first appearance

The life style of limpets is sessile they stick fast to rocks or other hard substrates

Some species of limpets return to the same spot on the rock known as a home scar just before the tide ebbs It is though that they follow chemical trails In such species the shape of their shell often grows to precisely match the contours of the rock surrounding the scar This behaviour permits a better seal to the rock It is thought that they follow a mucus trail left as they move 

Where the limpets eat the algae off bare rocks it causes places where other organisms can grow and thrive Some species such as Lottia gigantea garden a patch of algae around their home scar They push other organisms out of this patch by ramming with their shell allowing their patch of algae to grow for their own grazing 

Limpets are prey for starfish shore birds fish seals and humans They have a variety of defences such as fleeing or clamping their shells against the substratum The defence response can be adjusted to the type of predator which can often be detected chemically by the limpet

Limpets can be long lived with tagged specimens surviving for more than 10 years If the limpet lives on bare rock it grows at a slower rate but can live for up to 20 years 

Limpets found on sheltered shores have a greater risk of desiccation because of the effects of sunlight water evaporation and the wind To avoid drying out they will clamp to the rock they inhabit minimizing water loss from the rim around their base As this occurs chemicals are released that promote the vertical growth of the shell

Limpets are hermaphrodites and undergo sex change during life They become male at about 9 months but after a couple of years they change sex to become female Spawning occurs once a year usually during winter and is triggered by rough seas which disperse the eggs and sperm Larvae are pelagic for a couple of weeks before settling onto a hard substrate

Abalone are a type of Gastropod shellfish

Abalone are known by their colorful inside shell This is also called ear shell ormer in Guernsey perlemoen in South Africa and pua in New Zealand

The meat of this shellfish is thought to be delicious in some parts of Latin America South East Asia and East Asia

Abalones live all over the world They can be seen along the waters of every continent except the Atlantic coast of South America the Caribbean and the East Coast of the United States Most abalones are found in cold waters along the coasts of New Zealand South Africa and Australia and Western North America and Japan in the Northern Hemisphere In the Chilean Pacific coast the species called loco has a hard black shell and is eaten by many people

Abalone have unique features the shell is round with two to three spirals The last spiral is grown into a large ear like shape which explains the name ear shell The inside of the shell is shiny from silvery white to green red mother of pearl

Abalones can start to give birth at a small size Their fertility is high and increases with size

Young albalones called larvae feed on plankton The adults eat plants and feed on algae They like to eat red algae Their size can be as small as 20 mm to as big as 200 mm 

The shell of the abalone is known for being very strong It is made of very tiny calcium carbonate tiles stacked like bricks Between the layers of tiles is a sticky protein substance Allergic skin reactions and asthma attacks can happen when breathing the dust made when these tiles are broken down

The colorful inside part of the abalone shell can be used for decorative inlays in guitars for example

Sport harvesting of Red Abalone is allowed with a California fishing license and an abalone stamp card Abalone may only be taken using breath hold techniques freediving or shorepicking SCUBA diving for abalone is strictly not allowed Abalone harvesting is not allowed south of the mouth of the San Francisco Bay There is a size minimum of seven inches measured across the shell and a limit of three per day and 24 per year that can be taken Abalone may only be taken in April May June August September October and November but they may not be taken in July December January February or March Transportation of abalone is only legal while the abalone is still attached to the shell Sale of sport caught abalone is illegal including the shell Only Red Abalone may be taken black white pink and flat abalone are protected by law

There have been a number of attempts to artificially grow abalone for the purpose of consumption

Shellfish is a culinary term for aquatic invertebrates used as food molluscs crustaceans and echinoderms Both saltwater and freshwater invertebrates are considered shellfish

See The Maryland Department of the Environments page for a discussion on why shrimp crab and lobster are not categorized as shellfish

Molluscs commonly used as food include the clam mussel oyster winkle and scallop

Some crustaceans commonly eaten are the shrimp prawn lobster crayfish and crab

Echinoderms are not eaten as commonly as mollusks and crustaceans In Asia sea cucumber and sea urchins are eaten

Edible cephalopods such as squid octopus and cuttlefish and terrestrial snails though all molluscs are sometimes considered to be shellfish and sometimes not

The term finfish is sometimes used to distinguish ordinary fish from shellfish

Jewish and Islamic dietary laws forbid the eating of some shellfish

In Japanese cuisine chefs often use shellfish and their roe Sushi and sashimi feature both raw and cooked shellfish

Alban Berg was an Austrian composer Alban Berg and Anton Webern were both pupils of Arnold Schoenberg All three composers in their own way changed the style of musical composition in the early 20th century They grew up at a time when most composers were still writing Romantic music but Schoenberg and his pupils started to write atonal music and then twelve tone music in which all 12 notes in an octave are of the same importance Although Berg wrote a lot of twelve tone music he still managed to make it sound quite Romantic at times more so than Schoenberg or Webern His most important works are his two operas Wozzeck and Lulu and his Violin Concerto

Berg was brought up in the centre of Vienna His family had plenty of money but when Bergs father died in 1900 life became much harder for them He did not do very well at school He also had a love affair with a kitchenmaid with whom he had a daughter

He was interested in music played the piano and had started to compose but he had not done well enough in his school exams to get into the music conservatory He was not interested in business like his father had been He got an unpaid job Then in 1904 he started to study with Schoenberg This was the first time he had been given proper music lessons Two years later his mother inherited some money and Berg was then able to give up his unpaid job and concentrate on music

Schoenberg taught him harmony counterpoint and music theory all the things one needs to know to compose well Berg had lessons from him from 1904 until 1911 His first proper pieces include a Piano Sonata and a String quartet Here he had already found the modern style which suited him He wrote harmonies which seemed to float He often wrote pieces with several movements which are all linked by a common theme He also liked themes which are heard upside down or palindromes where the tune sounds the same forwards as backwards He met a girl called Helene and they married in 1910

Berg liked to listen to all kinds of music In this way he was different to Schoenberg or Webern Berg was interested in French composers such as Debussy as well as jazz He liked the modern theatre and the political works of the playwright Bertolt Brecht and the composer Kurt Weill 

Berg was very grateful to Schoenberg for all that he had learned from him but he still continued to be quite afraid of him Schoenberg wrote many letters to him asking him to do things for him and often criticising him Only in the 1920s when Berg had become well known did Schoenberg start writing to him more like an equal friend

Berg wrote Five Orchestral Pieces It is one of the first important works he wrote without Schoenbergs help The music has some modern chords which must have sounded very shocking to the Viennese audience On 31 March 1913 Schoenberg conducted a concert in Vienna which included some songs by Berg People in the audience started to fight and the police had to be called When Schoenberg wrote to Berg criticising his music Berg lost all his self confidence Slowly he started to get more confidence again He wrote Three Orchestral Pieces op 6 The music sounds quite like Mahler There are a lot of musical ideas which grow into one another and make a rich sound

During World War I Berg spent some time in an army training camp This experience must have been in his mind when he wrote his opera Wozzeck This opera became very famous There were a lot of new ideas in it It is not about a great hero but about a simple man who is mistreated by people The music too is very different from opera music up to that time Although it was so modern it was a great success and made Berg world famous It gave him more money which together with a little teaching allowed him to spend most of his time composing

Wozzeck has a little twelve tone music in it but in his next works the twelve tone system is much more important He wrote Lyrical Suite for String Quartet and a Kammerkonzert in which the form is made up by mathematical rules He liked to hide things in his music eg favourite numbers or letters from peoples names These are like secret codes and in later years musicians have spent a lot of time trying to work out what Berg was trying to do

In 1928 Berg started work on his second and last opera Lulu He had thought about the opera for many years He had seen a play called Die Bchse des Pandora in 1905 Wedekind had played the part of Jack the Ripper People thought the play was obscene but it still became very popular especially after 1918 when there was no more censorship in Germany He worked on the opera until 1934 He then stopped work on it to write his Violin Concerto When he heard about the sad death from poliomyelitis of a young girl he knew called Manon Gropius he dedicated the concerto to her memory He wrote To the memory of an angel Manons mother Alma had been the wife of Gustav Mahler

Soon after he had finished the concerto Berg was stung by an insect Soon he had an abscess and he was rushed to hospital but he died The Violin Concerto had not yet been performed He had not finished Lulu The third act was only sketched in short score When the opera was first performed Act III was just acted out in mime while some other music by Berg was played Bergs widow Helene did not want anyone else to finish the opera so Act III was never performed until after Helene died in 1976 It was finished by a man called Friedrich Cerha and performed in 1977 although a court action had tried to stop it from being performed

Herefordshire is a county in the West Midlands region of England It borders the English counties of Shropshire to the north Worcestershire to the east Gloucestershire to the south east and the Welsh counties of Gwent to the south west and Powys to the west It is not to be confused with Hertfordshire a county north of London

It is pronounced herfd

The county town of Herefordshire is the cathedral city of Hereford

Historically the Rivers Wye and Lugg were navigable but the wide seasonal variations in water levels mean that few craft larger than canoes and coracles are now used There are canoe centres at The Boat House Glasbury on Wye the Hereford Youth Service and Kerne Bridge Ross on Wye as well as a rowing club in Hereford

The early nineteenth century saw the construction of two canals The Hereford Gloucester Canal and The Leominster  Stourport Canal but these were never successful and there are now few remains to be seen

A conch is a sea dwelling mollusc It is a marine gastropod The ch at the end of conch may be pronounced hard or soft

Many other gastropods have common names with conch in them They are however not true conches in the family Strombidae One such example is the Horse Conch The genus Strombus is made up of the true conches 

While most Strombid species are extinct at least 65 species still exist Of these most are in the Indo Pacific Oceans while six are in the greater Caribbean region Living true conch species include the Queen Conch Strombus gigas and the West Indian Fighting Conch 

Many conch such as the Queen Conch are found among beds of sea grass in warm tropical waters

Strombus gigas is included in Appendix II of the UNEPs CITES list of endangered species and international trade is heavily restricted

Conches have spirally constructed shells Depending on species shell growth can be sinistral or dextral

Conches have long eye stalks a long and narrow aperture and a siphonal canal with an indentation near the anterior end This indentation is called a stromboid notch They also have a foot ending in a pointed sickle shaped horny operculum They grow a flared lip on their shells upon reaching sexual maturity 

Conches have a characteristic leaping motion using their pointed sickle shaped horny operculum to propel themselves forward They lay eggs in long gelatinous strands

The animal inside the shell is eaten either raw as in salads or cooked as in fritters chowders gumbos and burgers In East Asian cuisines the meat is often cut into thin slices and then steamed or stir fried Conch meat is also often confused with Scungilli which is more accurately whelk meat

Conch shells are sometimes used as decoration as decorative planters and in cameo making As with other mollusk shells they are ground up into an ingredient in porcelain In classic Mayan art conches are shown being utilized in many ways including as paint and ink holders for elite scribes as bugle or trumpet and as hand weapons

In some countries cleaned Queen Conch shells or polished fragments are sold mainly to tourists as souvenirs or in jewelry Without a permit however export is a breach of CITES regulations and may lead to arrest This is most likely to occur on return to the tourists home country while clearing customs In the UK conch shells are the 9th most seized import 

Conch shells are occasionally used as a building material either in place of bricks or as bulk for landfill

Conch shells are sometimes made into crude bugles by removing the small tip of the shell to form a mouthpiece Such instruments are used in the Pacific Islands as well as in many parts of Asia While lacking the range capabilities and tonal quality of brass instruments the conch shell is still an interesting instrument to play As it has no mouthpiece or valves the embouchure in shell playing is critical Most shells will only naturally play one note but with pitch manipulations multiple sounds can be achieved The insertion of the hand and the placement of the fingers will also change the pitch of the shell The conch shell is said to be the musical instrument of mermaids and mermen Steve Turre is the leading innovator of the shell It is sometimes found in classical works such as the symphony piece La Noche de Los Mayas or Night of the Mayas which was premiered in 1939 with Jacob Watkins on percussion and conch

The conch shell is a major Hindu article of prayer used as a trumpeting announcement of all sorts The God of Preservation Vishnu is said to hold a special conch Panchajanya that represents life as it has come out of life giving waters In the story of Dhruva the divine conch plays a special part The warriors of ancient India would blow conch shells to announce battle such as is famously represented in the beginning of the war of Kurukshetra in the Mahabharata the famous Hindu epic The conch shell is a deep part of Hindu symbolic and religious tradition To this very day many Hindus use the conch as a part of their religious practices blowing it during worship at specific points accompanied by ceremonial bells

Buddhism also has incorporated the conch into its symbolism See Buddhist symbolism

William Goldings Lord of the Flies features frequent references to The Conch In the novel a conch shell is blown to call the other boys together It is held by whoever is speaking at meetings symbolically representing democracy and order When Roger Jacks lieutenant smashes the shell it is a sign that civilized order has collapsed and Jacks domination has begun

Cowry shells are marine snails of the family Cypraeidae

They are found chiefly in tropical regions There are about 200 different species of cowry

The shell itself is almost always very smooth and shiny They have with a long narrow slit like opening All varieties have a porcelain like shine and many have colorful patterns In life the shell is covered by the slippery mantle 

Shell sizes range from 5 mm for some tropical species to 15 cm for the tiger cowry Cypraea tigris

The slippery shell is very difficult for most animals to grip The very narrow toothed aperture of the cowry shell makes it difficult for predators to reach into However cowries are still vulnerable to predation

For nearly 200 years every species in the family Cypraeidae was placed in one genus Cypraea but in 2002 the cowries were divided into many different genera

Cowries were used as a currency in Africa and elsewhere such as in China where the shell or copies of the shell were in theory used as a means of exchange They are also worn as jewelry or otherwise used as ornaments or charms as they are viewed as symbols of womanhood fertility birth and wealth Many find the shiny porcelain like shells pleasing to look at

Cowry shells are sometimes used in a way similar to dice eg in board games like Pachisi or in divination A number of shells are thrown with those landing aperture upwards indicating the actual number rolled

Cowries have also been used in the recent past as a frame over which sock heels were stretched for darning The cowry ridges allowed the needle to get under the cloth more easily

The Ojibway aboriginal people in North America used the cowry shells in ceremonies and the Whiteshell Provincial Park in Manitoba Canada is named after this type of shell There is some debate about how they traded for or found these shells so far inland away from the natural sources Oral stories and birch bark scrolls seem to indicate that they were found in the ground andor washed up on the shores of lakes or rivers The cowry shells so far inland may indicate the use of them by an earlier tribe or group in the area and an extensive trade network in the ancient past 

The typewritten postage stamps of 1895 Uganda also are called Cowries

The County of West Midlands is a metropolitan county in western central England with a population of around 2600000 people The county contains three major cities these being Birmingham Coventry and Wolverhampton Other large settlements in the county include Sutton Coldfield Solihull and the Black Country towns of Dudley Walsall and West Bromwich

The name West Midlands is also used for the much larger West Midlands region which sometimes causes confusion

The West Midlands borders the counties of Warwickshire to the east Worcestershire to the south and Staffordshire to the north

The West Midlands is one of the most heavily urbanised counties in the UK Birmingham Wolverhampton the Black Country and Solihull together form the largest conurbation in the UK outside London with a combined population of around 227 million

The West Midlands is not entirely urban Coventry is separated from the Birmingham urban area by stretch of green belt land roughly 15 miles across known as the Meriden Gap which retains a strongly rural character

A smaller piece of green belt between Birmingham Walsall and West Bromwich includes Barr Beacon and the Sandwell Valley

The West Midlands contains 6 universities

Though Warwick and Birmingham are considered the most prestigious of the universities in the area all have a large intake of students from around the country

A conurbation is an urban area that includes a number of cities towns and villages which through population growth and expansion have physically merged to form one continuous built up area It is a sort of agglomeration

A metropolitan area usually combines one or several conurbations

Dunkirk is a harbour city in the northernmost part of France in the department of Nord 10 kilometres from the Belgian border

Population of the city at 1999 was 70850 inhabitants Population of the whole metropolitan area was 265974 inhabitants at the 1999 census 

Until the middle of the 20th century the city was situated in the Dutch language area today the local Dutch dialect still can be found but has been largely replaced by French

Dunkirk was first mentioned in 1067 as Dunkerk 

In World War II heavy fighting took place around Dunkirk during the German invasion in 1940 but a lull in the action unexpectedly allowed a large number of French and British soldiers to escape to England The British evacuation of Dunkirk through the English Channel was codenamed Operation Dynamo During the war Dunkirk was largely destroyed by bombing

On 14 December 2002 the Norwegian auto carrier Tricolor collided with the Bahamian registered Kariba and sank off Dunkirk harbour causing a hazard to navigation in the English Channel

Dunkirk has the third largest harbour in France after those of Le Havre and Marseille It is also an industrial city heavily dependent on the steel food processing oil refining ship building and chemical industries

Dunkirk has a ferry connection with Dover in England

Dunkirk is twinned with

Dunkirk has cooperation agreements with

Limburg Weilburg is a Landkreis in the west of Hesse Germany

1867 the Oberlahnkreis with the capital Weilburg was created In 1886 Limburg an der Lahn district was set up with the capital Limburg In 1974 both districts were joined together

The district is located between the two mountain areas Westerwald and Taunus The main river is the Lahn

Elz is a municipality and a village in Hessen Germany It is part of the Landkreis Limburg Weilburg It is along the river Lahn It has 8088 inhabitants

The elevation is between 110m and 291m above sea level Elz is in a valley called Limburger Becken which surrounds the town of Limburg Elz is also in the valley of the Elbbach which flows into the river Lahn after passing Elz The municipality of Elz borders the municipalities of Hundsangen Hambach Grgeshausen Niedererbach Obererbach and the towns of Hadamar and Limburg The municipality of Elz consists of two villages The village of Elz and the village of Malmeneich Average temperatures are 105 C in Elz and 99 C in Malmeneich Though this sounds quite moderate temperatures can vary between 20 C in winter and 40 C in summer In an average year there are 600mm of rain in Elz and 720mm in Malmeneich

Elz was first mentioned in a document from 933 AD which does not exist any more Political importance resulted from its position at the Hohe Strae the former most important road between Frankfurt am Main and Cologne which still exists and is now part of the Bundesstrae 8 which can be translated with Interstate 8 Elz got the town privileges in 1442 Soon a wall around the town was constructed but knocked down later

The council consists of 31 members 19 members are from the Christian Democrats seven are from the Social Democratic Party four from the Free Voters Community and one is from the Green Party The mayor Horst Kaiser is a Christian Democrat and was elected in 2005 with 848 of all votes

In Elz thaere are more than 600 businesses with much more than 2000 jobs The industrial area is at the B8 between Elz and Malmeneich

Elz is not only at the B8which goes from the Dutch border to Passau but also at the Autobahn 3 which connects WrzburgFrankfurt am Main and Cologne

In Elz there is a big outdoor swimming pool two gyms several sport and tennis fields and two old peoples homes

There are three kindergartens two primary schools and one Haupt und Realschule

Subclass Ammonoidea

The class has two living subclasses In the Coleoidea the mollusc shell has become smaller or is not there at all this subclass has the octopus squid and cuttlefish The Nautiloidea have a shell Nautilus is its only living genus 

There are at least 800 different living species of Cephalopods Two important extinct taxa are the Ammonites and the Belemnites Cephalopods are found in all the oceans of the world and at all pelagic levels None of them can live in freshwater but a few species live in brackish water

There are still discoveries of new species of cephalopods

There are many more fossil species It is thought there are around 11000 extinct taxa

Cephalopods are the most intelligent invertebrates and have good senses and large brains The nervous system of cephalopods is the most complex of the invertebrates and their brain to body mass ratio falls between that of warm and cold blooded vertebrates The giant nerve fibers of the cephalopod mantle have been a favourite experimental material for many years their large diameter makes them easier to study

Most cephalopods have broken wikt linkchromatophorechromatophores that is cells with different colours which they can use in a number of surprising ways As well as blending with their background some cephalopods bioluminesce shining light downwards to hide their shadows from any attackers The bioluminescence is made by bacterial symbionts the host cephalopod is able to find the light made by these animals Bioluminescence may also be used to attract prey and some species use colourful shows to get mates amaze predators or even signal to one another

Colouration can be changed in milliseconds as they adjust to their environment and the pigment cells can expand or contract Rapid colour change is usually more common in near shore species than those living in the open ocean Those in open ocean mostly use camouflage to make their body outline less easy to see

Evidence of original colouration has been found in cephalopod fossils as far back as the Silurian certain straight shelled species had lines round their shell which are thought to have used as camouflage of their body outline Devonian cephalopods bear more complex colour patterns whose function may be more complex

Cephalopods usually move by jet propulsion This uses a lot of energy to travel compared to the tail propulsion used by fish They use jet propulsion because they do not have fins or flippers The efficiency of jet propulsion goes down with larger animals This is probably the reason why many species use their fins or arms for moving if possible 

Oxygenated water is taken into the mantle cavity to the gills By contracting the mantles muscles the water is pushed out through the siphon made by a fold in the mantle Motion of the cephalopods is usually backward as water is forced out forwards but the siphon can be pointed in different directions Some cephalopods can adjust their body shape to move through the water more easily

Some octopus species are also able to walk along the sea bed Squids and cuttlefish can move short distances in any direction by moving a flap of muscle around the mantle

With the exception of the Nautilidae and the species of octopus of the suborder Cirrina all known cephalopods have an ink sac which can be used to push out a cloud of dark ink to confuse predators 

Like most molluscs cephalopods use haemocyanin a copper containing protein rather than haemoglobin to transport oxygen As a result their blood is colourless when deoxygenated and turns blue when placed in air

 Reproduction and life cycle  With a few exceptions Coleoideans live short lives with fast growth Most of the energy from their food is used for growing The penis in most male Coleoidea is a long and muscular end of the gonoduct used to transfer spermatophores to a modified arm called a hectocotylus That in turn is used to transport the spermatophores to the female In species where the hectocotylus is missing the penis is long and able to extend beyond the mantle cavity and transfers the spermatophores directly to the female The females lay many small eggs in one batch and die afterwards The Nautiloidea on the other hand make a few large eggs in each batch and live for a long time

The class developed during the late Cambrian and were the most common and varied marine life forms during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras Tommotia an early cephalopod had squid like tentacles but also a snail like foot it used to move across the sea floor Early cephalopods were at the top of the food chain

The old and modern coleoids as well as the ammonoids all diverged from the external shelled nautiloids during the middle Paleozoic Era between 450 and 300 million years ago Most ancient varieties had protective shells These shells at first were conical but later developed into the curved shapes seen in modern nautilus species Shells inside the body still exist in many living cephalopod groups such as cuttlefish The most famous group with external shells the ammonites became extinct at the end of the Cretaceous period

Cuttlefish are sea animals of the order Sepiida belonging to the Cephalopoda class Despite their common name cuttlefish are not fish but molluscs 

Cuttlefish have an internal shell large eyes and eight arms and two tentacles furnished with denticulated or finely toothed suckers with which they secure their prey

Cuttlefish eat small molluscs crabs shrimp fish and other cuttlefish but can be eaten by predators including sharks fish and other cuttlefish They live about 1 to 2 years

Cuttlefish have an internal structure called the cuttlebone This is composed of calcium carbonate It is porous or full of small holes in order to allow the cuttlefish the swim not sink Its buoyancy can change by changing the amount of gas and liquid in the chambers of the cuttlebone Each species has a distinct shape size and pattern of ridges or texture on the cuttlebone Cuttlebones are traditionally used by jewelers and silversmiths as molds for casting small objects They are probably better known today as the tough material given to parakeets and other pet birds as a source of calcium for their diets The cuttlebone is only found in cuttlefish and is one of the features that makes them different from squid and other molluscs

Cuttlefish are sometimes called the chameleon of the sea because they are able to change their skin color whenever they want Their skin can flash a colorful pattern in order to communicate with other cuttlefish and to camouflage them from predators This color changing function is produced by groups of red yellow brown and black pigmented chromatophores above a layer of reflective iridophores and leucophores all of these being parts of the cuttlefishs skin which help it change its color There are up to 200 of these special pigment cells per square millimeter The pigmented chromatophores have a sac of pigment and a large membrane that is folded when retracted There are 6 20 small muscle cells on the sides which can contract to squash the elastic sac into a disc against the skin Yellow chromatophores are closest to the surface of the skin red and orange are below and brown or black are just above the iridophore layer The iridophores reflect blue and green light which make them look blue and green Iridophores are plates of chitin or protein which can reflect the area around a cuttlefish They are responsible for the metallic blues greens golds and silvers often seen on cuttlefish All of these cells can be used in combinations For example orange would be produced by red and yellow chromatophores while purple could be created by a red chromatophore and an iridophore The cuttlefish could also use an iridophore and a yellow chromatophore to produce a brighter green As well as being able to influence the color of the light that reflects off their skin cuttlefish can also affect the lights polarization which can be used to signal to other sea animals many of whom can also sense polarization

Cuttlefish eyes are among the most developed in the animal kingdom The organogenesis of cephalopod eyes is fundamentally different from that of vertebrates like humans Superficial or insignificant similarities between cephalopod and vertebrate eyes are examples of convergent evolution The cuttlefish pupil is a smoothly curving W shape Although they cannot see color they can perceive the polarization of light which essentially enhances their ability to see contrast They have two spots of concentrated sensor cells on their retina one to look more forward and one to look more backwards The lenses instead of being reshaped as they are in humans are instead pulled around by reshaping the entire eye in order to change focus

The blood of a cuttlefish is an unusual shade of green blue because it uses the copper containing protein hemocyanin to carry oxygen instead of the red iron containing protein hemoglobin that is found in mammals The blood is pumped by three separate hearts Two of these are used for pumping blood to the cuttlefishs pair of gills and the third for pumping blood around the rest of the body A cuttlefishs heart must pump a more blood than most other animals because hemocyanin is not as good at carrying oxygen as hemoglobin is

Cuttlefish have mouths like squid and octopuses This ink was formerly an important dye called sepia Today artificial dyes have replaced natural sepia However there is an increased amount of Jews in modern times using the ink for the techelet dye on their Tallit strings

Cuttlefish are caught for food in Mediterranean and East Asian cultures Although squid is more popular as a restaurant dish all over the world in East Asia dried cuttlefish is a highly popular snack food

Cuttlefish is especially popular in Italy where it is used in Risotto Nero and in the Croatian Crni Riot which is almost the same and originated most probably from Venice then spread across both coasts of the Adriatic Nero and Crni mean black which is the color the rice turns because of the cuttlefish ink Spanish cuisine especially that of the coastal regions often uses cuttlefish and squid ink for cooking due to the marine flavor and smoothness that it provides to the meals and it is included in dishes such as rice pasta and fish stews

Cuttlefish made their most important literary appearance in the title of Eugenio Montales ground breaking debut collection of poetry entitled Cuttlefish Bones published in Turin in 1925 Montale who grew up in Liguria along the Mediterranean Sea was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1975 for his long and prolific career Cuttlefish Bones remains one of the best known and influential collections of 20th century poetry

In the science fiction novel Frek and the Elixir by Rudy Rucker an alien named Professor Bumby shows himself to the main character Frek in the form of a cuttlefish

There are over 120 species of cuttlefish currently recognized grouped into 5 genera Sepiadariidae contains seven species and two genera all the rest are in Sepiidae 

Nautilus is the common name of a group of cephalopods All of them are in the family Nautilidae The name chambered nautilus is also used for any species of the Nautilidae 

Nautilus is the only living members of the subclass Nautiloidea In appearance they have not changed much in millions of years Many biologists see them as living fossils

The name Nautilus originally referred to the Argonauta otherwise known as paper nautiluses because they allegedly use their two expanded arms as sails

The nautilus is similar in general form to other cephalopods with a prominent head and tentacles Nautilus have more tentacles than other cephalopods up to 90 These tentacles are arranged into two circles Unlike the tentacles of other cephalopods they have no suckers and are all the same and retractable 

The radula is wide and distinctively has nine teeth There are two pairs of gills

Nautilus pompilius is the largest species in the genus One form from western Australia may reach 268 mm in diameter However the majority of other nautiluses never exceed 20 cm The Bellybutton nautilus Nautilus macromphalus is the smallest species usually measuring only 16 cm

Nautiluses are the only cephalopods whose bony structure of the body is externalized as a shell The animal can withdraw completely into its shell It can the close the opening with a leathery hood formed from two specially folded tentacles The shell is coiled calcareous mother of pearl lined and pressure resistant It will implode at a depth of about 800 m The nautilus shell is made of 2 layers the outer layer is a matte white while the inner layer is a striking white with iridescence The innermost portion of the shell is pearlescent blue gray The osmena pearl contrarily to its name is not a pearl but a jewellery product derived from this part of the shell

The shell is internally divided into chambers The chambered section is called the phragmocone The phragmocone is divided into chambers All septa are pierced in the middle by a duct the siphuncle by which the animal can change the air pressure in the chambers As the nautilus matures its body moves forward sealing the chambers behind it with a new septum The last fully open chamber also the largest one is used as the living chamber The number of chambers increases from around four at the moment of hatching to thirty or more in adults

The shell coloration also keeps the animal cryptic in the water When seen from the top the shell is darker in color and marked with irregular stripes which makes it blend into the darkness of the water below On the contrary the underside is almost completely white making the animal indistinguishable from brighter waters near the ocean surface This mode of camouflage is named countershading

The nautilus shell is one of the finest natural examples of a logarithmic spiral It is sometimes incorrectly claimed to be a golden spiral as well

 ImageNautilusTopjpgA nautilus shell when viewed from above ImageNautilusBottomjpgThe same shell viewed from underneath ImageNautilusCutawayLogarithmicSpiraljpgHemishell showing the chambers in a logarithmic spiral 

In order to swim the nautilus draws water into and out of the living chamber and makes use of jet propulsion When water is inside the chamber the siphuncle extracts salt from it and diffuses it into the blood When water is pumped out the animal adjusts its buoyancy with the gas contained in the chamber Buoyancy can be controlled by the osmotical pumping of gas and fluid into or from the camerae along the siphuncles The control of buoyancy in this manner limits the nautilus they cannot operate under extreme hydrostatic pressures

The animal can also crawl on land or on the seabed

In the wild nautilus usually inhabit depths of about 300 m rising to around 100 m at night for feeding mating and egg laying The shell of the nautilus cannot withstand depths greater than approximately 800 m

Nautiluses are predators and feed mainly on shrimp small fish and crustaceans which are captured by the tentacles However due to the very little energy they devote to swimming they need only eat once a month Unlike other cephalopods they do not have good vision their eye structure is highly developed but lacks a solid lens They have a simple pinhole lens through which water can pass Instead of vision the animal is thought to use olfaction as the primary sensory means during foraging locating or identifying potential mates

Nautiluses are sexually dimorphic and reproduce by laying eggs Attached to rocks in shallow waters the eggs take twelve months to develop before hatching out at around 30 mm long Females spawn once per year and regenerate their gonads making nautiluses the only cephalopods to repeat reproduction The lifespan of nautiluses is about 20 years which is exceptionally long for a cephalopod

There are 6 species of Natuilus that still exist Several are extinct

Nautiluses are only found in the Indo Pacific from 30 N to 30 S latitude and 90 to 185 W longitude They inhabit the deep slopes of coral reefs

Fossil records indicate that nautiluses have not evolved much during the last 500 million years and nautiloids were much more extensive and varied 200 million years ago Many were initially straight shelled as in the extinct genus Lituites They developed in the Cambrian period and became a significant sea predator in the Ordovician period Certain species reached over 25 meters in size The other cephalopod subclass Coleoidea diverged from the Nautilidae long ago and the nautilus has remained relatively unchanged since Extinct relatives of the nautilus include ammonites such as the baculites and goniatites

A logarithmic spiral equiangular spiral or growth spiral is a special kind of spiral curve which often appears in nature The logarithmic spiral was first described by Descartes and later extensively investigated by Jakob Bernoulli who called it Spira mirabilis the marvelous spiral

with real numbers a and b

The derivative r is proportional to the parameter b In other words it controls how tightly and in which direction the spiral spirals In the extreme case that b 0 the spiral becomes a circle of radius a Conversely in the limit that b approaches infinity the spiral tends toward a straight line The complement of is called the pitch

Spira mirabilis Latin for miraculous spiral is another name for the logarithmic spiral While this curve had already been named by other mathematicians the name miraculous or marvelous spiral was given to this curve by Jakob Bernoulli because he was fascinated by one of its unique mathematical properties the size of the spiral increases but the shape stays the same with each added curve Maybe because of this property the spira mirabilis has evolved in nature seen in some living beings such as nautilus shells and sunflower heads Jakob Bernoulli wanted the shape on his headstone but by error an Archimedean spiral was placed there instead

Starting at a point P and moving inwards along the spiral one has to circle the origin infinitely often before reaching it yet the total distance covered on this path is finite This was first realized by Evangelista Torricelli even before calculus had been invented The total distance covered is rcos where r is the straight line distance from P to the origin

One can construct approximate logarithmic spirals with pitch about 1703239 degrees using Fibonacci numbers or the golden ratio as is explained in those articles Similarly the exponential function exactly maps all lines not parallel with the real or imaginary axis in the complex plane to all logarithmic spirals in the complex plane with centre at 0 The pitch angle of the logarithmic spiral is the angle between the line and the imaginary axis

In several natural phenomena one may find curves that are close to being logarithmic spirals Here follows some examples and reasons

The Small White is a small to mid sized butterfly of the Yellows and Whites Pieridae family It is also commonly known as the small cabbage white or just the cabbage white

It is common across Europe North Africa and Asia and has also been accidentally introduced to North America Australia and New Zealand where they have become pests on cultivated cabbages and other mustard family crops

It looks like a smaller version of the Large White The upperside is creamy white with black tips to the forewings Females also have two black spots in the center of the forewings Its underwings are yellowish with black broken wikt linkspecklespeckles 

Like its close relative the Large White this is a strong flyer and the British population is increased by continental immigrants in most years Like other White butterflies it hibernates as a pupa Along with the Large White it is sometimes known as the Cabbage White or Cabbage Butterfly 

It has two flight periods AprilMay and JulyAugust 

Its caterpillars can be a pest on cultivated cabbages but it will lay eggs as well on wild members of the cabbage family such as Charlock Sinapis arvensis and Hedge Mustard Sisybrium officinale The eggs are laid singularly on foodplant leaves

Known in the United States as Imported Cabbage Worms the caterpillars are green and well camouflaged Unlike the Large White they do not store the mustard oils from their foodplants and so are not distastful to predators like birds

The argonauts are a group of pelagic octopuses They are also called paper nautiluses by analogy with chambered nautiluses and referring to the paper thin eggcase that females secrete This structure lacks the gas filled chambers present in chambered nautilus shells and is not a true cephalopod shell but rather an evolutionary innovation unique to the genus Argonauta

Argonauts are found in tropical and subtropical waters worldwide they live in open ocean Like most octopuses they have a rounded body eight arms and no fins However unlike most octopuses argonauts live close to the sea surface rather than on the seabed Argonauta species are characterised by very large eyes and small distal webs The mantle funnel locking apparatus is a major diagnostic feature of this taxon It consists of knob like cartilages in the mantle and corresponding depressions in the funnel Unlike the closely allied genera Ocythoe and Tremoctopus Argonauta species lack water pores

In Argonauts males and females are quite different in size and lifespan Females grow up to 10 cm and make shells up to 30 cm while males rarely grow larger than 2 cm The males only mate once in their short lifetime but the females can get pregnant repeatedly The females have been known since ancient times while the males were only described in the late 19th Century The males use a modified arm the hectocotylus to transfer sperm to the female For fertilization the arm is inserted into the females pallial cavity then is detached from the male The hectocotylus was originally described as a parasitic worm The hectocotyl arm and its correct function were diagnosed by Aristotle but his account was disbelieved for over 2000 years It was rediscovered in the early 19th century

 ImageArgonauta nodosa lithographjpgMature female A nodosa ImageArgonauta hians femalejpgJuvenile female A hians ImageArgonauta hians malejpgImmature male A hians 

Female argonauts make a laterally compressed calcareous eggcase in which they reside The eggcase curiously resembles the shells of extinct ammonites It is secreted by the tips of the females two greatly expanded dorsal tentacles before egg laying After she deposits her eggs in the floating eggcase the female herself takes shelter in it often along with the males detached hectocotylus She is usually found with her head and tentacles protruding from the opening but she retreats deeper inside if disturbed These ornate curved white eggcases are occasionally found floating on the sea surface sometimes with the female argonaut still clinging to it It is made of calcite with a 3 layered structure Most other octopuses lay eggs in caves the argonauts may have evolved to use ammonite shells for their egg laying eventually becoming able to mend the shells and perhaps even make their own

The egg case also contains a bubble of gas used for buoyancy similar to shelled cephalopods although it does not have chambers as seen in other shelled cephalopods

Argonauta argo is the largest species in the genus and also produces the largest eggcase which may reach a length of 300 mm The smallest species is Argonauta bottgeri with a maximum recorded size of 67 mm

 ImageArgonauta nodosa with eggcase lithographjpgFemale A nodosa with its eggcase ImageArgonauta argo 001jpgThe eggcase of A argo ImageArgonauta nodosa 001jpgThe eggcase of A nodosa ImageArgonauta hians 001jpgThe eggcase of A hians 

The beaks of Argonauta species are distinctive They are characterised by a very small rostrum and a fold that runs to the lower edge or near the free corner The rostrum is pinched in at the sides This makes it much narrower than in other octopuses with the exception of the closely allied monotypic genera Ocythoe and Vitreledonella Argonaut beaks are most similar to those of Ocythoe tuberculata and Vitreledonella richardi They differ in leaning back to a greater degree than the former and because they have a more curved jaw angle than the latter

Feeding mostly occurs during the day Argonauts use tentacles to grab prey and drag it toward the mouth It then bites the prey to inject it with poison from the salivary gland They feed on small crustaceans molluscs but also jellyfish and salps If the prey is shelled the argonaut uses its radula to drill into the organism then inject the poison

Argonauts are capable of changing their color They can blend in with their surroundings to avoid predators They also produce ink which is ejected when the animal is being attacked This ink paralyzes the olfaction of the attacker providing time for the argonaut to escape The female is also able to pull back the web covering of her shell making a silvery flash which may deter a predator from attacking

Argonauts are preyed upon by tunas billfishes and dolphins Shells and remains of argonauts have been recorded from the stomachs of Alepisaurus ferox and Coryphaena hippurus

Male argonauts have been observed residing inside salps although little is known about this relationship

The genus Argonauta contains up to seven existing species Several extinct species are also known

The extinct species Obinautilus awaensis was originally assigned to Argonauta but has since been transferred to the genus Obinautilus

Camouflage is a visual disguise for something which usually can be seen easily 

If the natural colour of an animal makes it look like its surroundings that is camouflage A tigers stripes in the long grass and the battledress of a modern soldier are examples 

Camouflage is a form of deception The word camouflage comes from the French word camoufler which means to disguise

In nature most animals blend into their environment or conceal their shape They are very hard to see This way they survive and if they survive then they can reproduce There are exceptions animals which are dangerous to eat advertise with warning colouration 

Prey animals hide from predators Predators must search for prey without being seen Natural camouflage is one way to do this an animal can blend in with its surroundings Another way is for the animal to disguise itself as something harmless

Some camouflaged animals also copy movements in nature eg of a leaf blowing in the wind Other animals attach natural materials to their body for concealment A few animals change color in changing environments Seasonally Or quickly like the chameleon and the cuttlefish Some herd animals adopt a similar pattern to make it difficult to distinguish a single animal

Most animals are dark on top and light underneath With light coming from above this countershading makes them less visible

In biology the extant taxon is a term used to refer to species genera or families that are still in existence The opposite is extinct taxon Of the group of molluscs known as the cephalopods there are approximately 600 extant species and 7500 extinct species 

Echinoderms are a successful phylum of marine animals They include starfish sea urchins sea cucumbers and their relatives

Echinoderms have these features

Echinoderms live in all parts of the ocean but mostly on the sea floor Some are filter feeders and others are important predators of molluscs and other shell fish They are extremely common near the shore and on reefs 

They have a long and abundant fossil record This phylum appeared in the early Cambrian period it contains about 7000 living and 13000 extinct species The four or five main groups are called sub phyla by some authorities and classes by others 

Echinodermata is the largest animal phylum which is entirely marine no animals in this group live on land or in fresh or brackish water

For many purposes it is better to use the following classification It is easier to learn and understand and is based more on the living formsp19

Only with the crinoids is it necessary to deal with the fossil forms because the stalked crinoids were so important on the Palaeozoic sea floors

All echinoderms have fivefold radial symmetry in their body at some stage of life The holothurians have bilateral symmetry as adults and do not have so much of a skeleton as other groups

Echinoderms have a hydraulic water vascular system This network of fluid filled canals moves and feeds the animal and allows gas exchange There is also a complete digestive tube They have a simple radial nervous system that consists of a modified nerve net There are nerve rings with radiating nerves around the mouth extending into each arm The branches of these nerves coordinate the movements of the animal Echinoderms have no brain although some do have ganglia They usually move with their tube feet but brittle stars use their arms to pull against rocks Some feather stars and sea cucumbers can swim

The sexes are usually separate Sexual reproduction typically consists of releasing eggs and sperm into the water with fertilization taking place externally Their larvae are planktonic

Many echinoderms have remarkable powers of regeneration A starfish arm cut off will regenerate A section as small as a single arm with some central disk and neural tissue can regenerate the whole organism

Most of the adults have radial symmetry If they are not sessile or attached they are at least benthic In contrast echinoderm larvae are planktonic and have bilateral symmetryp119 Echinoderm larvae are ciliated free swimming organisms that have a bilaterally symmetry rather like embryonic chordates The first stage in all groups except the crinoids is the dipleurula which has a row of cilia winding round its body All the groups have second and third stage larvae The larvae grow and are carried away from their parents

Later the adult body grows into a radial form with the body arranged in five parts around a central axis This means they often have a star shaped pattern

There is no geological evidence about the origin of echinoderms The first undoubted fossils in the Lower Cambrian are already well developed and fall into five or six different groups Arkarua from the Ediacaran is thought to be an echinoderm Tribrachidium is another possible from the same period On general biological grounds it seems that echinoderms and some related phyla may have been derived from worm like ancestorsp311 

The word Argnoaut can mean

Das Rheingold is an opera by Richard Wagner It is the first of the four operas that together tell a story called Der Ring des Nibelungen

Das Rheingold is an opera in one act divided into four scenes It is a very long act lasting 2 hours but it is normally played without an interval as the music is continuous even between the scenes

The characters in the opera are Gods Giants Nibelungs and the Rhinedaughters The Nibelungs are a race of dwarfs They are cunning and evil and live underneath the surface of the earth

The first scene takes place in the river Rhine where the three Rhinemaidens Woglinde Wellgunde and Flosshilde are guarding the precious Rhine gold Alberich an evil Nibelung arrives and tries to catch the Rhinemaidens From what they say Alberich learns that the gold they are guarding has magic powers Alberich wants the gold but the Rhinemaidens say that anyone who wants to have it has to renounce love They think that Alberich will not do that because he is very fond of girls but Alberich does renounce love and so he gets the gold

The second scene takes place in Valhalla which is where the gods live Wotan the chief god is there with his wife Fricka Two giants have been building an enormous castle for the gods Wotan has promised them that he would pay them for their work by giving them Freia the Goddess of Youth and Beauty Fricka is worried about the promise that Wotan has made but Wotan tells his wife that he is not going to keep his promise He thinks he can find a way of tricking the giants Freia enters She is frightened because the giants are coming for her

The giants Fasolt and Fafner enter They want to have Freia in payment for having built the castle The problem for the gods is that Freia has a garden in which she grows golden apples If the gods no longer have these golden apples they will grow old and die Wotan does not know what to do

Loge the god of fire enters Wotan is cross with Loge for not having found something else to pay the giants with Loge says he has been all over the world looking for something He tells everyone that the gold from the Rhine has magic power and how Alberich renounced love so that he could steal it from the Rhinemaidens He tells them that a ring can be made from the gold and that whoever has the ring will have power over all the world The giants hear what Loge is saying and decide that they want the gold instead of Freia They take Freia as hostage saying that they will be back later to collect the gold If they do not get it then they will keep Freia forever

Wotan asks Loge how they are going to get the gold Loge tells them that they should steal it from Alberich After all Alberich stole it from the Rhinemaidens so it does not belong to him Wotan and Loge go down below the earth to the Nibelungs

Underneath the earth Alberich is forcing the Nibelungs to work for him They are hammering at the anvil Mime who is Alberichs son has used some of the gold to make a helmet This helmet is called the Tarn helmet Anyone who wears it can change their shape or become invisible Alberich treats his son very cruelly

Wotan and Loge tell Alberich that they have heard how clever he is They ask him to show them what he can do with the Tarn helmet Alberich puts on the helmet and changes himself into a huge dragon Wotan and Loge pretend to be impressed They ask him whether he can change himself into something small Alberich show off again changing himself into a frog Wotan immediately puts his foot on him and catches him Wotan and Loge take all the gold and go back to Valhalla

Wotan and Loge tease Alberich Alberich asks them what they want so that he can be free Wotan demands the gold The Nibelungs pile the gold up Alberich is not too worried because he still has the ring which gives him magic power He thinks he can use this power later to get the gold back Wotan sees the ring on Alberichs finger He tells him to give him the ring Alberich is terrified but Wotan tears it from his finger Before Alberich goes he puts a curse on the ring Whoever has had the ring will die This is very important to the whole story of the four operas

The two giants appear with Freia The gods have become very weak but once Freia returns they start to become stronger again Wotan tells the giants they can have their gold The giants say that they must pile up the gold in front of Freia until they cannot see her They do this but the giants say there is still a tiny hole through which they can see Freias eye They see the ring on Wotans finger and tell him to put it in the hole Wotan says they can have anything they want but not the ring

Erda appears Erda is the Earth Goddess She is very wise She reminds Wotan that there is a curse on the ring and that he should quickly give the ring to the giants Wotan has no choice He puts the ring in the hole Now the giants are happy

Immediately however the giants start to argue with one another and Fafner kills Fasolt The curse on the ring is working Loge tells Wotan he was wise to give up the ring However Fricka is still worried because Wotan did have the ring 

Donner the god of Thunder enters and swings his hammer There is a flash of lightning and a crash of thunder The clouds vanish a rainbow makes a bridge to Valhalla and the gods enter Valhalla The Rhinemaidens are heard crying out to Wotan to give the gold back but Wotan takes no notice The gods are now at the height of their glory We shall see at the end of the fourth opera that the curse will catch up with them and that they too will die

The music of Das Rheingold is beautifully written to fit every person and every situation The famous opening starts with a low chord of E flat which describes the bottom of the river Rhine At first the notes of the chords are held on then gradually a ripple of broken chords and arpeggios suggest the ripples of the water The harps make a sound like the waves The harmony just consists of the same E flat chord for the first 136 bars until the Rhine Maidens start to sing

Each character in the opera has his own musical leitmotif which can change and combine to show their changing moods and situations There are big heavy chords for the giants creepy chromatic winding music for Loge the god of fire who is supposed to be very crafty dignified music for the Earth Goddess Erda etc There is a special leitmotif for the curse which is heard at various times in all four operas

Wagner actually called Das Rheingold a prologue to the other three operas which he saw as the main operas of the cycle

Die Walkre is an opera by Richard Wagner It is the second of the four operas that together tell a story called Der Ring des Nibelungen The story continues from the first opera which was called Das Rheingold 

Die Walkre was first performed on 26 June 1870 in Munich The first performance that was part of the whole Ring cycle took place on 14 August 1876

The opera starts with a storm The young man Siegmund is out in the storm and comes to a house The house belongs to Hunding who lives there with his wife Sieglinde An ash tree is growing in the middle of the house Siegmund and Sieglinde are twins who were separated at birth so neither of them knows who the other one is Their father is Wotan the chief god but they dont know this either Their mother was a mortal

Sieglinde lets Siegmund into the house and gives him a drink of mead They start to fall in love Hunding arrives and asks Siegmund who he is Siegmund says that his name ought to be Woeful because he has had an unhappy life When he was small he came home once and found his house burned down his mother murdered and his twin sister had been abducted He then remembers that some years later he went to help a young lady who had been forced to marry a cruel man He had killed some of the mans friends Hunding realizes that he himself was this man so that he is Siegmunds enemy He says to Siegmund that he can sleep in his house tonight because this is a law of hospitality but in the morning he will have to fight him

Sieglinde goes to prepare a drink for her husband She puts a drug in it which will make Hunding sleep deeply Siegmund meanwhile is thinking about something his father had promised him He had told him that he would thrust a magic sword called Nothung into a tree No one would get that sword until one day when Siegmund found himself in great difficulty he would be able to pull it from the tree and use it

Sieglinde enters and tells Siegmund a story about how on the day she was forced to marry Hunding an old man had come into the house and thrust a sword into the ash tree in the middle of the room They start to realize that they are brother and sister but it does not stop them from falling in love and they sing passionately about their love for one another Siegmund pulls the sword from the tree and the two lovers embrace

Wotan is the chief god whom we heard in Das Rheingold He is trying to get rid of the curse of the Rheingold and has built a grand plan around Siegmund Wotan tells his daughter Brnnhilde that she must make sure that Siegmund wins the fight with Hunding Brnnhilde is a half goddess so she has the power to do this She is one of eight daughters of Wotan who are Valkyries Their job is to collect the dead bodies of brave heroes who have died in battle and take them back to Valhalla the house of the gods 

Wotans wife Fricka arrives in a chariot pulled by a ram Brnnhilde disappears and there follows a big argument between husband and wife Fricka says to Wotan that Siegmund and Sieglinde must be punished for breaking Hundings marriage and for loving one another because brothers and sisters are not allowed to be lovers She says that she herself is the goddess of marriage and must make sure that marriage laws are obeyed Fricka says that the gods will all be disgraced Wotan says that he went to the world to have children with mortal women because the gods needed a race of heroes who would protect them But Fricka says to Wotan that he is wrong Siegmund cannot be a free hero if he is being protected by Wotan Giving in Wotan now tells Brnnhilde that she must leave Siegmund to his fate

Sieglinde tells Siegmund that she feels guilty and that he ought to leave her but they are desperately in love When she hears Hundings horn she imagines that Siegmund will be torn apart by the dogs and she faints Brnnhilde pities Siegmund She tells Siegmund that he must follow her to Valhalla When Siegmund asks whether he can take Sieglinde with her Brnnhilde says that he cannot do this Siegmund refuses to go Brnnhilde tells him that he cannot escape his fate Siegmund continues to plead with Brnnhilde and in the end she is so moved that she changes her mind She breaks Wotans order and says that she will protect Siegmund in battle Hunding appears and the two men fight Brnnhilde protects Siegmund with her shield Siegmund is nearly winning when suddenly Wotan appears and smashes Siegmunds sword into pieces Hunding kills Siegmund

The other Valkyries are wondering where Brnnhilde is They see her coming on her horse but instead of a hero she is carrying a woman The Valkyries are angry with Brnnhilde because she disobeyed Wotan Sieglinde wants to die but when she is told that she has a baby in her womb she asks Brnnhilde to save her She escapes into the forest with bits of Siegmunds sword One day the baby she is now bearing will grow up become a hero and use the bits to make another sword

Wotan goes to the Valkyries He is furious with Brnnhilde because she disobeyed him He punishes her He tells her that she is no longer a Valkyrie She will fall asleep on a rock and any man who finds her can have her Brnnhilde pleads with Wotan She asks him whether he could at least put a fire round her so that the only man who could get her would be a hero In the end Wotan agrees Loge the god of fire arrives and lights the fire At the end of the opera Brnnhilde is asleep on the rock surrounded by the fire There she will stay until one day a hero comes to rescue her

The music contains many wonderful moments The most famous bit is the beginning of Act Three where the Valkyries are riding on their horses This music is known as The Ride of the Valkyries It is very dramatic music The very beginning of Act One is also very dramatic The music describes a storm The orchestra is a very large one including special tubas which are known as Wagner tubas There are no separate arias in these operas all the sections flows into one another Sometimes a character has a section when they are telling a story There are beautiful sections like the one in Act One where Siegmund is remembering about his father and the sword or the love music between Siegmund and Sieglinde By using leitmotifs he gets many subtle effects When Siegmund looks at the ash tree we hear the sword motive because the sword is in the tree although at that moment he does not know about it We also hear Wotans theme when Siegmund talks about his father We know who his father is but Siegmund does not The music tells us lots of things that the characters in the story may not understand This makes the music very powerful and exciting

Siegfried is an opera by Richard Wagner It is the third of the four operas that together tell a story called Der Ring des Nibelungen The story continues from the end of the second opera which was called Die Walkre 

The first performance of Siegfried took place when the whole Ring cycle were performed in the Festspielhaus in Bayreuth on 16 August 1876

The first part of the opera takes place in a forest where the giant Fafner lives He has used the magic tarn helmet to change himself into a dragon so that he can guard the treasure of the gold and the ring Siegfried who was not yet born at the end of the second opera Die Walkre is now a young lad He has been brought up by the dwarf MimeAlberichs brother Mime is just as horrible as his brother

Mime is hammering away at the anvil trying to repair the sword that was smashed to pieces by Wotan in Act Two of Die Walkre He wants to make the bits into a strong sword but every time he thinks he has managed it Siegfried picks up the sword and breaks it with his strength The reason that Mime wants to make the sword is so that he can give it to Siegfried and tell him to fight the dragon Then Mime will be able to get the ring from him so that he can have power over all the world When Siegfried enters he brings a bear from the forest The bear chases Mime and Siegfried laughs Then he lets the bear go free 

Mime says to Siegfried that he should be thankful to him for looking after him as a child and bringing him up He has never told Siegfried who his parents were Siegfried does not understand anything about how babies are born He has never seen a woman before He only knows Mime who is pretending to be is father Siegfried has noticed that young birds look like their parents and he asks Mime why he does not look like him In the end Mime is forced to tell Siegfried about his parents and about the sword that was smashed by Wotan Siegfried tells Mime to forge the sword so that he can kill the dragon Siegfried goes off

Wotan the chief god appears He is disguised as a wanderer Mime says he wants to ask him three questions and if he cannot answer them he can chop off his head Wotan agrees First Mime asks him the name of the race of people who live below the earth Wotan says they are the Nibelungs Then Mime asks who are the people who live on the earths surface Wotan says they are the giants Then he asks him who lives in the sky Wotan says they are the gods He has answered all three questions correctly He now tells Mime it is his turn to ask Mime three questions which he must answer if he wants to keep his head Mime is terrified but has to agree

First Wotan asks him who are the people whom Wotan loves a lot although he has to be harsh with them Mime answers the Valkyries Then Wotan asks him the name of the sword that Wotan left for Siegfried Mime answers Nothung Finally Wotan asks him who can put the pieces of the sword together Mime is now terrified because he does not know the answer Wotan tells him the answer it is the person who does not know fear He says to Mime that he can keep his head for the moment He will leave it to the fearless person to chop it off later

When Mime and Siegfried are together again Mime tries to frighten Siegfried so that he knows what fear is He tells him all about the huge dragon in the cave Does that not frighten you he asks him Not a bit answers Siegfried who likes the thought of fighting a dragon Siegfried works at the anvil and starts to make the sword Mime is thinking of how he will trick Siegfried after the dragon has been killed so that he can get the sword and kill Siegfried At last Siegfried manages to make the mighty sword He calls out its name Nothung Then he crashes the sword down on the anvil which splits into two pieces

Outside the dragons cave Wotan still disguised as a wanderer meets Alberich Alberich hates Wotan for having snatched the ring from him Wotan does not care and even wakes the dragon up but the dragon does not want to fight them

Mime and Siegfried appear Siegfried is not frightened at all He just wants to know where the dragons heart is so that he can kill it Mime leaves him alone Siegfried sits down in the forest and thinks He is glad to know now that the ugly Mime is not his father He hears a bird singing and he tries to imitate the birds song with a pipe he has made from a reed He blows his horn and the dragon appears Siegfried plunges the sword into the dragons heart Siegfried instinctively puts his hand in the dragons mouth and tastes its blood Suddenly he can understand what the bird is saying The bird tells him to take the ring and the tarn helmet He takes them

Mime and Alberich appear They are arguing about who shall have the ring and the tarn helmet Siegfried appears with both Mime offers Siegfried a drink which is drugged The bird warns Siegfried not to drink it Siegfried kills Mime by chopping his head off with the sword The bird then tells Siegfried about his beautiful bride Brnnhilde who is lying on a rock protected by fire waiting to be rescued by him 

Erda the wise Earth Goddess tells Wotan about the Norns who are weaving the rope of destiny She is surprised to hear how Wotan has punished Brnnhilde Wotan says he now looks forward to the end of the gods and wants Siegfried to take his place

Siegfried arrives He tells Wotan about his heroic deed with the dragon He finds Wotan annoying and smashes Wotans sword He goes to the rock where Brnnhilde is lying

Siegfried bursts through the flames and finds the sleeping Brnnhilde He gently takes off her helmet then her breastplate Suddenly he sees that she is a woman He has never seen a woman before For the first time in his life he is frightened yet he very much wants to wake her up He kisses her lips and she opens her eyes and sits up She tells him that she has always loved him even long before he was born Siegfried feels his passion growing and tries to put his arms round her but now it is Brnnhilde who is frightened She tells him not to spoil the purity of their love Finally they embrace

It took Wagner more than 15 years to write this opera which is one reason why the music of Act Three is slightly different in style Some ideas from the love music of Siegfried and Brnnhilde were later re used by Wagner in a separate orchestral piece called the Siegfried Idyll Many of the leitmotifs are ones that were heard in the Das Rheingold or Die Walkre One unusual instrument in the orchestra is the anvil It is played when Mime and later Siegfried are hammering on the anvil trying to forge the pieces of the sword together The rhythm of this music is the same rhythm heard earlier in the Nibelung scene in Das Rheingold

When Wagner started working on the opera he called it Der junge Siegfried but by 1856 he had changed the title to Siegfried

The German word Sieg means victory and Fried or Friede means peace It is a good name for a hero The role of Siegfried is sung by a tenor The singer needs a very strong voice often called a Heldentenor in German He is on stage for most of the opera which lasts about four hours

Gtterdmmerung is an opera by Richard Wagner It is the fourth and last of the cycle of operas that together tell a story called Der Ring des Nibelungen The story continues from the end of the third opera which was called Siegfried Gtterdmmerung is the German name for Ragnark

Gtterdmmerung is the longest of the four operas It takes about five hours to perform It consists of a prologue and three acts Wagner finished composing the opera in the autumn of 1874 It was first performed on 17 August 1876 as part of the complete Ring cycle

The three Norns daughters of Erda the Earth Goddess are spinning the rope of destiny This rope is a symbol of what has to happen in the end They take it in turns to tell the story of the past spinning as they sing and passing on the rope to the next one The first Norn tells how Wotan went to drink from the Well of Wisdom for which he lost an eye He then cut a spear from a tree which then died The second Norn tells how a young hero broke Wotans spear and how the gods were sent from Valhalla to chop down the World Ash The third Norn tells how the logs from the ash tree have been piled round Valhalla ready for a fire that will burn everything The Norns have visions of the future The rope breaks The Norns disappear into the earth

Brnnhilde and Siegfried come out of a cave by the rock where they were left at the end of the third opera Siegfried has to go off to do heroic deeds He gives Brnnhilde the ring as a token of his love for her She gives him her horse which is called Grane Siegfried travels down the river Rhine

Act One takes place in the Hall of the Gibichung palace Gunther is the chief of the Gibichungs His half brother Hagen tells him he would look more important if he got married He also says that Gunthers sister Gutrune ought to get married He tells him about Brnnhilde who he thinks is still asleep on the rock surrounded by fire that no one except Siegfried would be able to get through He says that if they manage to get Siegfried to marry Gutrune then she could persuade him to go and catch Brnnhilde for Gunther He says that they could give Siegfried a potion which would make him forget that he loved Brnnhilde

They hear Siegfrieds horn outside and the great hero arrives Siegfried asks Hagen whether he knows him Of course Hagen does Siegfried is carrying the magic tarn helmet which allows a person to change their shape or become invisible Siegfried however does not know what the tarn helmet can do and Hagen has to explain it to him Gutrune appears and offers Siegfried a drink It is the potion which is going to make him forget any other woman He drinks to the health of Brnnhilde As soon as he has drunk it he looks at Gutrune and is in love with her He agrees to marry her and he agrees to get a wife for Gunther Hagen tells him about Brnnhilde on the rock Siegfried has forgotten about her He agrees to put on the tarn helmet and disguise himself as Gunther and to go and get Brnnhilde He goes off leaving Hagen guarding the palace

The next scene takes place on the top of the Valkyrie rock Her sister Waltraute arrives on a flying horse She says that Wotan returned to Valhalla with his spear broken She says he told the gods to pile up the logs from the World Ash for a fire which will burn everything Wotan desperately wants the ring to be given back to the Rhine Maidens Brnnhilde refuses to give her the ring that Siegfried had given her as a token of their love Waltraute disappears

After the weather calms the flames flicker again Siegfried arrives disguised as Gunther Brnnhilde is horrified to see a person she thinks is a stranger Siegfried says she is his bride forces the ring from her finger and drags her into a cave for the night although placing the sword between them

Back at the palace Alberich tries to persuade his son Hagen to get the ring Hagen wants to get the ring but only for himself Siegfried arrives He no longer wears the tarn helmet so he looks like himself Hagen blows his horn to call his vassals for a celebration Gunther is to marry Brnnhilde and Siegfried is to marry Gutrune Brnnhilde cannot understand why Siegfried is doing this She sees the ring on his finger and asks him how he got it as she thinks Gunther snatched it from her Siegfried says that he won it by killing a dragon He tells people how he tricked Brnnhilde and swears that a sword lay between them during the night although Brnnhilde tries to make people think otherwise

Brnnhilde is left alone with Gunther and Hagen She tells them that although Siegfried is so strong and impossible to kill in battle he has one weak spot on his back Gunther does not like the idea of having Siegfried killed but Hagen promises him that he can then have the ring They decide to kill Siegfried and to tell Gutrune that he was killed by a wild boar

The last act takes place in a wild forest Siegfrieds hunting horn is heard and then the hunting horn of the Gibichungs By the river Siegfried happens to meet the Rhine Maidens and teases them by showing them the ring but does not let them have it They tell him about the curse on the ring but Siegfried does not believe them He meets Hagen They drink together Siegfried tells the men all about his life how he was brought up by Mime about the sword the dragon and the bird singing Then he cannot remember any more Hagen gives him another drugged drink which makes him start to remember what actually happened He remembers Brnnhilde and how he found her surrounded by fire He gradually realizes how he has been tricked and feels unbearable sadness Two ravens fly overhead and Hagen plunges his spear into Siegfrieds back He dies while speaking the name of Brnnhilde His body is carried off to a funeral march

Back at the palace his body is brought in Gutrune accuses Gunther of murdering him but Gutrune says Hagen did it Hagen says he did it because Siegfried when disguised as Gunther had slept with Brnnhilde He tries to snatch the ring from the dead Siegfrieds finger Gunther tries to stop him but is murdered by Hagen He tries again to snatch the ring but to everybodys horror the arm of the dead hero rises in the air

Brnnhilde enters and tells everyone how she promised Siegfried her love Gutrune curses Hagen and falls onto her brothers dead body Brnnhilde orders a funeral pyre to be prepared She sings to Wotan that Siegfried is now at peace in death and that she understands more now She takes the ring and promises to return it to the Rhine Maidens She lights the fire which flares up and she rides on her horse Grane into the flames The whole building catches fire the Rhine overflows Hagen jumps into the water trying to get the ring from the Rhine Maidens who drown him The flood dies down and Valhalla is lit up by the fire The gods and the heroes die in the flames The Twilight of the Gods has now happened

The music of this long opera is extremely cleverly linked so that musical ideas flow into one another and combine to comment on the drama Many of the themes have been heard in the other three operas It is a very exhausting opera to sing especially for Brnnhilde There are usually two long intervals during a performance The orchestra is very large and includes eight harps

Der Ring des Nibelungen is a cycle of four operas by Richard Wagner 

The story of each opera can be found in the separate articles

Sometimes it is known as a tetralogy meaning four works that belong together

Wagner took the story of the operas from a book called the Nibelungenlied which was written in the 12th century by a German poet We do not know the name of the poet The story is about the ancient gods from German mythology

Wagner made a lot of changes to the story in order to make it suitable for his four operas Wagners story tells of a hoard of gold which is being guarded by the Rhinemaidens The dwarf Alberich steals the gold and uses some of it to make a ring which makes the owner powerful over all the world When Wotan the chief god steals it from him Alberich puts a curse on the ring The ring will bring death to whoever has it The ring goes through the hands of several characters all of whom die in the end

Alberich belongs to a race of dwarfs called the Nibelungs The word Nibelungen in the title of the cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen refers to Alberich

The story of Wagners Ring cycle sounds quite fantastic and strange like a fairy tale Although the characters seems very different from real people the story tells us all about basic human emotions It is a story about greed love lust intrigue etc This is what makes it so powerful

Wagners music matches each character and situation beautifully It develops continuously there are no breaks in the music during the acts Wagner used what he called leitmotifs These are tunes or chords or little musical phrases which are linked to particular people in the opera In this way he can hint at things very cleverly in the music For example there is a leitmotiv for the curse Whenever we hear this curse motive we know that the curse of the ring is working

Wagner spent about twenty years writing the Ring cycle He started in the 1850s when he was living in Switzerland He wrote all the libretto himself as he always did for his operas By 1857 he had finished the first two operas and two thirds of Siegfried It was many years later that he finally finished Siegfried and wrote the final opera as well

In Finnish mythology Vki means races of Haltijas and their magical powers Different things in nature had their own vki guarding them For example Vki of water lived in and protected water Vki is the name of both the magical power and Haltijas Vki could sometimes be seen They looked like little man like creatures Sometimes Vki went inside people and made people ill Vki makes people ill if they behave badly in their kingdom For example if someone shouted in a forest without reason then the Vki of forest may make then ill Shaman could heal these illnesses by telling the vki to leave the person and go back to its original place

Desalinisation is a name used for various processes These processes take most of the salt or minerals out of seawater They are used to make fresh water which is either good for irrigation or as drinking water for animals and humans 

The United States desalinized the brackish water in rivers that flow into Mexico The United States has signed treaties with Mexico that oblige the United States to desalinize the water

Several Middle Eastern countries have so much energy that they use desalinated water for agriculture Saudi Arabias desalination plants account for about 24 of total world capacity The worlds largest desalination plant is the Jebel Ali Desalination Plant in Saudi Arabia It can produce 300 million cubic meters of water per year

There are three basic ways to treat the water so it contains less salt and minerals

In 2004 the two leading methods for desalinization were Reverse Osmosis and Multi Stage Flash

The traditional process used in these operations is vacuum distillation which means boiling of water at less than atmospheric pressure and thus a much lower temperature than normal Due to the reduced temperature energy is saved

In the last decade many desalization plants have begun using membrane processes Reverse Osmosis has taken nearly half the worlds installed capacity Membrane processes use semi permeable membranes to filter out dissolved material or fine solids from the water The systems are usually driven by high pressure pumps

Forward Osmosis uses a membrane filter Water is driven across the membrane by osmotic pressure Forward osmosis systems require no energy inputs They are used for emergency desalination purposes in seawater and floodwater settings

Some desalization plants use the same energy more than once With  In the Middle East and North Africa some facilities to produce both electricity and fresh water The combined facility consumes less fuel than would be needed by two separate facilities

The building and operation costs of a desalination plant depend on many factors such as the desalinization method employed size of the facility and its location relative to an ocean or other salt water source The characteristics of the particular market in which its product is consumed will also influence its costs and profitability Desalination technologies are expensive and energy intensive making the cost of energy another factor in the costs of desalinization    

For this reason very large desalination plants may employ Nuclear powered desalinization There is currently a pilot plant in the former USSR

Another cost of desalinization is the management of wastes produced by a desalination plant Marine pollution may result if the saline brine produced is discharged into an ocean or other body of water

All desalinization methods produce a toxic waste product that the US Environmental Protection Agency has classified as industrial wastes This toxic waste can harm ecosystems and marine animals

Gmez Pereira was a Spanish philosopher doctor and humanist from Medina del Campo He was most famous for his work in medicine but he did many different things such as business engineering and especially philosophy As a doctor he was in favor of using the empirical method instead of more medieval ideas about medicine

His ideas in philosophy may have helped Ren Descartes come up with the famous idea cogito ergo sum This is Latin for I think therefore I am

Little is known about his life He was the second of five brothers his father Antonio had a small store that sold clothes and his mother Margarita died when he was 15 so the children were raised by his aunt Ana de Avila Some of his ancestors were Jews from Portugal who had become Christians

He studied philosophy at the University of Salamanca His professor Juan Martinez was later the archbishop of Toledo Spain He also studied medicine and graduated in 1520 He then settled down as a doctor in his home town Medina living with his wife Isabel Rodriguez and becoming quite successful in business even having his own warehouses of wine and renting rooms to other merchants He never had children 

He became famous as a doctor being well known in other cities of Spain He even went to the court of Philip II of Spain and saved the life of the prince Don Carlos when he had an accident He was also famous as an inventor and in 1563 he and another inventor named Francisco Lobato got a patent for a type of flour mill powered by water 

Spore is a computer game made by Will Wright He also made The Sims and SimCity It consists of five phases of gameplay the cell creature tribal civilization and space phases It is a game in which the player is able to create and evolve a species from a germ into a galactic superpower It is due to be released on September 7 2008 in America and September 5 in Europe Initially it was going to be 6 different phases but they merged the city and civilization phases so its only 5 phases now

One of the biggest parts of the game is the different editors Almost all things in the game can be made by the player from buildings in the civilization phase to the creature in the creature phase The player uses different parts that he can place as he wants He can also change things like size and stretch the parts All these things made by players can be uploaded as pictures to the sporepedia A picture has all the info needed for the game to make the thing and is very small in size usually less than 30 kilobytes This means that a player can find a picture of a car made in Spore that he likes copy it and put it in the Spore folder Then they can play with it

All the different phases of the game offer many choices Roughly the player can choose to be peaceful aggressive or both For example in the creature phase there is a choice to eat other animals just fruit or both And in the civilization phase there is a choice to be military religious economic or a little of all of them 

Tilia is a genus of between 30 and 45 species of trees in the Northern Hemisphere in Asia Europe and eastern North America it is absent from western North America 

The trees are generally called linden in North America and lime in Britain Both names are went from the Germanic root lind The modern forms in English went from linde or linne in Anglo Saxon and old Norse and in Britain the word transformed more recently to the modern British form lime In the United States the modern German name Linde from the same root became more common partly to avoid confusion with any other uses of the name 

Tilia species are large deciduous trees reaching typically between 20m and 40m tall some species grow as shrubs Plants of this genus are found through the north temperate regions

The Germanic tribes associated the Linden tree with the goddess Freya Very often these tribes held their assemblies called Thing near or under such a tree Often trees that were standing alone somewhere were chosen These assemblies were used to make laws They usually lasted three days 

The tree produces fragrant and nectar producing flowers the medicinal herb lime blossom They are very important honey plants for beekeepers producing a very pale but richly flavoured monofloral honey The flowers are also used for herbal tea and this infusion is particularly popular in Europe

In mathematics the Cartesian coordinate system is used to determine each point uniquely in a plane through two numbers usually called the x coordinate and the y coordinate of the point To define the coordinates two perpendicular directed lines are specified as well as the unit length which is marked off on the two axes Cartesian coordinate systems are also used in space and in higher dimensions

Using the Cartesian coordinate system geometric shapes can be described by algebraic equations Such equations are satisfied by the coordinates of the points lying on the shape For example the circle of radius 2 may be described by the equation x y 4

Cartesian means relating to the French mathematician and philosopher Ren Descartes who among other things worked to merge algebra and Euclidean geometry This work was influential in the development of analytic geometry calculus and cartography

The idea of this system was developed in 1637 in two writings by Descartes In part two of his Discourse on Method Descartes introduces the new idea of specifying the position of a point or object on a surface using two intersecting axes as measuring guides In La Gomtrie he further explores the above mentioned concepts

The concepts of angle and radius were already used by ancient peoples of the 1st millennium BCE The astronomer Hipparchus created a table of chord functions giving the length of the chord for each angle and there are references to his using polar coordinates in establishing stellar positions In On Spirals Archimedes describes the Archimedean spiral a function whose radius depends on the angle The Greek work however did not extend to a full coordinate system

There are various accounts of the introduction of polar coordinates as part of a formal coordinate system The full history of the subject is described in Harvard professor Julian Lowell Coolidges Origin of Polar Coordinates Grgoire de Saint Vincent and Bonaventura Cavalieri independently introduced the concepts in the mid seventeenth century Saint Vincent wrote about them privately in 1625 and published his work in 1647 while Cavalieri published his in 1635 with a corrected version appearing in 1653 Cavalieri first used polar coordinates to solve a problem relating to the area within an Archimedean spiral Blaise Pascal subsequently used polar coordinates to calculate the length of parabolic arcs

In Method of Fluxions Sir Isaac Newton examined the transformations between polar coordinates which he referred to as the Seventh Manner For Spirals and nine other coordinate systems In the journal Acta Eruditorum Jacob Bernoulli used a system with a point on a line called the pole and polar axis respectively Coordinates were specified by the distance from the pole and the angle from the polar axis Bernoullis work extended to finding the radius of curvature of curves expressed in these coordinates

The actual term polar coordinates has been attributed to Gregorio Fontana and was used by 18th century Italian writers The term appeared in English in George Peacocks 1816 translation of Lacroixs Differential and Integral Calculus Alexis Clairaut was the first to think of polar coordinates in three dimensions and Leonhard Euler was the first to actually develop them

Singing means making music with the voice Singing is probably the way that music started many thousands of years ago When people sing they make their voices go high or low If they do this in a way that uses notes of a scale then they make tunes

Some animals such as many types of bird and whale sing Other animals such as many types of cats make musical purring sounds

When people sing they use the air in the lungs The speed that the air comes out of the lungs can be controlled with the muscle called the diaphragm which goes across the front of the body below the ribs People who have singing lessons spend a lot of time practising breath control

The air comes through the throat where the larynx is like a reed on a clarinet it vibrates and this makes the note higher or lower depending on how it is controlled

The sound comes into the mouth which is space where the sound can be made bigger Professional singers even learn to think of the whole head as a resonator They sometimes talk about the mask ie they imagine a mask in front of the face and this makes the sound bigger The sound then comes out of the mouth so that it can be heard

Singing is different from speaking because of the special way the vocal cords in the throat are used

Most people can sing notes which cover more than an octave People who sing a lot will probably be able to sing over two octaves Singers can be called according to whether they have higher or lower voices soprano mezzo soprano and contralto for women tenor baritone or bass for men Some men are able to train their voices to sing alto by using a falsetto voice Childrens voices are often called treble

There are lots of different singing styles in the world Each one has a different technique In Western classical music singers learn to sing in a bel canto voice which uses lots of resonance in the head and makes a smooth sound Bel canto was used in Italian opera Later in the 19th century Richard Wagner wrote operas in which the singers needed to be more dramatic Opera singers today can have different kinds of voices bel canto lyrical dramatic coloratura etc

In church choirs the singers are often trained to use a lot of head voice because this sounds beautiful in large cathedrals

Pop singers generally have a different technique their singing is more from the throat They do not need to develop powerful voices like opera singers because they sing into microphones so that their voices are electronically amplified

Voices singing music from different parts of the world may sound very different Chinese singing sounds nasal In Mongolia there is a technique of overtone singing which sounds rather like a finger being rubbed against the rim of a wineglass In Switzerland men often yodel

Rap is a kind of singing in which the rhythm is the most important thing The pitch is high and low but not to any particular notes Scat singing is rather like rap

Acappella singing is vocal music specifically without instrumental accompaniment The name is from Latin a and cappella

Cantata is a term that exclusively refers to accompanied singing which is the exact opposite of Acappella

Singing is something that can be enjoyed by everybody A group of people singing together is often called a choir People can sing in choirs or smaller groups or on their own People can sing for their own enjoyment or they can practise hard and sing in concerts to an audience

Singing can be unaccompanied or it can be with musical instruments

Some people say they are tone deaf meaning that they cannot sing in tune But almost everybody can learn to sing if they try hard enough

The brain stem is the rear part of the brain It connects the other parts of the brain to the spinal cord

It has three sections the hindbrain pons and midbrain

Though the brainstem is small it is an extremely important part of the brain as the nerve connections of the motor and sensory systems from the main part of the brain to the rest of the body pass through the brain stem Also the brain stem provides the main motor and sensory nerves to the face and neck These are the cranial nerves

The hindbrain is the medulla oblongata which is an extension of the spinal cord It contains many neurons that serve as the control centre of bodily functions such as breathing and blood pressure

The brain stem controls many bodily functions of which we are not normally aware such as breathing and sweating It is important for that reason The brainstem controls functions which are unconscious but necessary for life

An ideology is a collection of beliefs shared by a group of people

There are two main types of ideologies political ideologies and epistemological ideologies Political ideologies are sets of ethical ideas about how a country should be run Epistemological ideologies are sets of ideas about the philosophy the Universe and how people should make decisions

There are many different types of ideologies Communism socialism and capitalism are the biggest politicaleconomical ideologies

Many political parties base their political action and program on an ideology In social studies a Political Ideology is a certain ethical set of ideals principles doctrines myths or symbols of a social movement institution class or large group that explains how society should work and offers some political and cultural blueprint for a certain social order A political ideology largely concerns itself with how to allocate power and to what ends it should be used Some parties follow a certain ideology very closely while others may take broad inspiration from a group of related ideologies without specifically embracing any one of them

Political ideologies have two dimensions

An ideology is a collection of ideas Typically each ideology contains certain ideas on what it considers to be the best form of government and the best economic system Sometimes the same word is used to identify both an ideology and one of its main ideas For instance socialism may refer to an economic system or it may refer to an ideology which supports that economic system

Ideologies also identify themselves by their position on the political spectrum though this is very often controversial Finally ideologies can be distinguished from political strategies and from single issues that a party may be built around Philosopher Michael Oakeshott provides a good definition of ideology as the formalized abridgment of the supposed sub stratum of the rational truth contained in the tradition

Today many commentators claim that we are living in a post ideological age in which redemptive all encompassing ideologies have failed and this is often associated with Francis Fukuyamas writings on the end of history

The war began when Iraq invaded Iran on 22 September 1980 after a long history of border disputes and demands for the overthrow of Saddam Husseins regime Iraqi forces did well at the beginning of the war but before long they were stopped and forced out of Iran The war continued for years and neither side gained much ground Despite several calls for an end to the fighting by the United Nations Security Council the two countries fought until 20 August 1988 the last prisoners of war were exchanged in 2003 The war changed politics in the Middle East and world wide

The Iran Iraq War is also noted for Iraqs use of chemical weapons and biological weapons against Iranian troops and civilians many of which were supplied by the United States The role of the United States in the war was very important In 1953 the US launched a coup against Mohammed Mossadeq who was the Prime Minister of Iran The US put Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi back in power supporting his military and his government This triggered the Iranian Revolution in 1979 as the people of Iran were unhappy with the monarchy of the Shah Later on the United States sold weapons to the Iraqis This move was largely due to Americas interest in containing the revolutionary Ayatollah Khomeini In summary the United States supplied Iraq with weapons to use against Iran

Serenity is a 2005 science fiction space western movie It was written and directed by Joss Whedon The movie takes place in the universe of the cancelled FOX science fiction television series Firefly It takes place about two months after the final episode Objects in Space Taking place 500 years in the future Serenity is the story of the captain and crew of a transport and cargo spacecraft The captain and first mate fought together on the losing side of Unification War Their lives of small crime are interrupted by a passenger with mental abilities who has a dangerous secret

The movie was released in North America on September 30 2005 by Universal Pictures It received good reviews It made 101 million during its first weekend The movie made 255 million in the United States and 133 million in other countries 

Fans call the movie the Big Damn Movie or abbreviated BDM This is a reference to a line from the Firefly episode Safe in which Mal and Zoe call themselves big damn heroes after rescuing River and Simon 

The movie is based on Firefly a television series that was cancelled by Fox in December 2002 Fox stopped the show after 11 of its 14 episodes had been shown After trying to get another network to show the series creator Joss Whedon tried to sell it as a movie He was introduced to Mary Parent with Universal Pictures who agreed to make the movie after watching the episodes on DVD 

After Universal Studios got the movie rights to Firefly from Fox Whedon began writing the screenplay Universal wanted to start making the movie in October of 2003 but problems with the script made them have to wait until June of 2004 to start of shooting the movie Universal did not want to spend the normal amount of money for a story set in space Whedon told them he could do it for less He also told them he could do it in 50 days instead of the usual 80 days On March 3 2004 the movie was greenlighted to start being made It was shown to have budget of only 40 million 

They started filming the movie on June 3 2004 Joss Whedon said that the movie would be called Serenity to keep it separate from the TV series All nine of the main actors from the television series returned for the movie On September 17 2004 Joss Whedon said on the movies official site that shooting was done

Whedon had to take a television series that not many people had seen and explain the idea of the movie He had to do this without boring the audience or the fans of the television series He did this by doingcn things in the beginning of the movie At first it is a just a voice telling what has happened It then is shown to be a school room where the voice was that of the teacher They next showed that this was all just memories in one of the characters mind 

Since the budget was not very large physical special effects were used as much as possible They made as sets and props as they could to use less CGI effects The most technically challenging scene was the mule skiff chase Because it would cost too much a gimbal and CGI like the pod race scene in Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace could not be used The production team to find other ways to do things They built a trailer connected to the hover craft in the movie and shot the scene while riding up a highway north of Santa Clarita Serenity visual effects supervisor Loni Peristere said in a Los Angeles Times article Traditionally this would have been like a 30 day shoot I think we did it in five

One item from the television show that could not be used again was the original set of the inside of the ship Serenity It had to be built for the movie using images from the Firefly DVD set The company that did the graphics for the series also had to change the computer model of Serenity The television model was not good enough for high definition cinema screens and HD DVD

Five hundred years into the future mankind has left Earth All the people moved to a new large star system The system is controlled by the Alliance Away from the core planets people like the crew of the cargo ship Serenity can make a living if they stay away from Alliance ships and the Reavers  space faring cannibals who raid the planets of the Rim One of the Alliances projects is the creation of a group of warriors with mental powers The star of this project is teenager River Tam After her older brother Simon rescues her the Alliance Parliament sends The Operative a man with no name rank or official existence after them 

About eight months after River and Simon have joined Serenitys crew the ships captain Malcolm Mal Reynolds takes River with him to rob a bank While they are robbing the bank Reavers attack After they escape back to Serenity Simon argues with Mal Mal decides to leave Simon and River at their next stop While at their next stop River starts a fight that is started by a subliminal message broadcast by the Alliance in a commercial Mal lets Simon and River keep traveling on Serenity while the crew talks to a techno geek known as Mr Universe Mr Universe lives on a planet inside a giant cloud of objects in space that does not let people see there is a planet there Mr Universe watches a video of the fight and finds the subliminal message He also sees that River said the name Miranda Mal gets a call from Inara a former passenger He knows it is a trap but also knows that she must be in danger Mal goes to her He is confronted by the Operative The Operative tells Mal that he will let him go if Mal turns River over to him Mal refuses and they escape from the Operative and go back to Serenity The crew finds out that Miranda is an unknown planet near the edge of the solar system To get to Miranda they would have to cross into Reaver territory They think this is too dangerous Serenity instead goes to Haven which is home to another former passenger Shepherd Book When they get to Haven the crew sees that it has been attacked by the Alliance They also see that Shepherd Book was hurt very bad and dying The Operative sends a message saying he did it He said he will keep doing things like it until River is given to him

Mal orders that Serenity be made to look like a Reaver ship They get the disguised ship through a fleet of Reaver warships When they get to Miranda the crew finds everyone that lived there is dead There are dead bodies everywhere but they can not tell how the people died The crew finds a video made after the disaster by an Alliance ship It tells them that the Alliance made a chemical that was susposed to stop aggression and make the planet free of violence The chemical worked so well that the people stopped doing everything including eating and let themselves die In a tenth of a percent of the people the chemical had the opposite effect It turned them very aggressive and caused mental problems they became the Reavers Mal wanted to show this secret to all the worlds by using Mr Universes equipment The Operative figures out where they are going and waits just outside of Reaver space with an Alliance fleet Knowing that the Operative is likely to be waiting for them Serenity opens fire on one of the Reaver ships while coming back The other Reaver ships chase after them Serenity leaves Reaver space and pass through the cloud around Mr Universes planet while being chased by the entire Reaver fleet There is a large fight between the Alliance and the Reavers The fight lets Serenitys pilot Wash to fly down to the planet The Operatives ship is destroyed and he also goes to the planet in an escape pod

Serenity crashs on the planet While the ship is damaged very badly the crew has survived Just as everyone begins to relax a Reaver harpoon hits Wash and kills him The crew leaves Serenity and finds a place to fight off the Reavers while Mal goes to get to Mr Universe and send the message Mal finds Mr Universe has been killed and his equipment is destroyed He finds a message that tells him about a hidden backup transmitter The Reavers attack the crew and make them move back The crew tries to close a blast door but it will not shut all the way River dives through the hole in the door and closes it from the other side This traps her with the Reavers Mal gets to the other transmitter The Operative gets there also and they fight Mal wins but does not kill the Operative He leaves him to watch the video from Miranda as it is being broadcast Mal goes back to his crew As he is told what River did the blast door opens to reveal River standing unhurt on an large pile of dead Reavers A group of Alliance soldiers show up but the Operative orders them not to fight because of what he has seen on the video The crew buried their dead and fixed Serenity Serenity leaves the planet with Mal in Washs seat as the pilot and River as his copilot

While the movie shows the Alliance as an all powerful regime Whedon is careful to point out that it is not that simple The Alliance isnt some evil empire he says but a largely benevolent bureaucratic force The Alliances main problem is that it cannot and should not try to control all the different cultures that are a part of it The crew of Serenity and specifically Mal show the idea that people should have the right to chose for themselves even if those choices are bad

The Operative is all that the Alliance stands for He is as Whedon described the perfect product of whats wrong with the Alliance He is someone who is a force for good who wants to help make his image of a world without sin The Operative believes so much in this idea that he do anything to make create that world Mal is the opposite At the movies beginning he is a man who has lost all faith By the end of the movie however Mal finally believes in somethingfreedom of choiceso strongly that he is willing to die to preserve it Whedon has said that the most important line in the movie is Mals to the Operative at its end Im going to show you a world without sin Whedons point is that a world without sin is a world without choice and that choice is what defines humanity The Operative who does only what he is told to do and the inhuman Reavers created by the Alliances need to control people are only two examples of this theme

Joinery often refers to the part of woodworking that involves the joining together of parts of wood 

Traditional wood joinery techniques use the distinctive material properties of wood often without mechanical fasteners There are different types of joinery for different structures for example the joinery used to build a house is different from that used to make puzzle toys although elements overlap

Wood is strong when stressed along the grain but weak across it It expands and contracts in response to humidity This change is very small longitudinally It is considerable but unequal in the radial and tangential directions

Glue is highly effective for joining wood when both surfaces of the joint are edge grain A properly glued joint may be as strong as a single piece of wood However glue is ineffective on end grain surfaces

Two of the most common traditions of joinery are Japanese and European The Japanese in particular developed hundreds of types of joints and their furniture was often held together without glue or nails

Wire rope consists of several strands laid together like a helix Each strand is likewise made of metal wires laid together like a helix Initially wrought iron wires were used but today steel is the main material used for wire ropes

Modern wire rope was invented by the German mining engineer Wilhelm Albert in the years between 1831 and 1834 for use in mining in the Harz Mountains in Clausthal Lower Saxony Germany It was quickly accepted because it proved superior to ropes made of hemp or to metal chains such as had been used before

Wilhelm Alberts first ropes consisted of wires twisted about a hemp rope core six such strands then being twisted around another hemp rope core in alternating directions for extra stability Earlier forms of wire rope had been made by covering a bundle of wires with hemp

In America wire rope was later manufactured by John A Roebling forming the basis for his success in suspension bridge building Roebling introduced a number of innovations in the design materials and manufacture of wire rope

Manufacturing a wire rope is similar to making one from natural fibres The individual wires are first twisted into a strand then six or so such strands again twisted around a core This core may consist of steel but also of natural fibres such as sisal manila henequen jute or hemp This is used to cushion off stress forces when bending the rope

The specification of a wire rope type including the number of wires per strand the number of strands and the lay of the rope are is documented using a commonly accepted coding system consisting of a number of abbreviations

This is easily demonstrated with a simple example The rope shown in the figure Wire rope construction is designated

6x19 FC RH OL FSWR

Each of the sections of the wire rope designation described above is variable There are therefore a large number of combinations of wire rope that can be specified in this manner The following abbreviations are commonly used to specify a wire rope

Liekki or Ihtiriekko is a ghost of a bastard child in Finnish mythology

Stories tells that a woman had sex with someone else than her husband Maybe she did not even have a husband She then get pregnant and gave birth to a baby This way to make a baby was not accepted by church and society  that kind of baby is called bastard Mother had to kill her bastard child to avoid being blamed by priests or other people Mother then buried child outside graveyard and without priests blessing the body Soul of baby could not go to heaven because hisher body was not at graveyard and was not blessed by a priest This is why she became a ghost

This ghost could make terrible noise until somebody dugs up hisher body and buries it in graveyard Such ghost people call Ihtiriekko Ghosts could also be quiet but shehe might be seen as a flame in forest like will o the wisp Such ghost people call Liekki

A bastard is a person who was born of parents who are not married to one another It is considered by some cultures and individuals as a nasty or insulting word today or sometimes even profanity with the term illegitimate being a little more polite Some cultures see illegitimate children as dirty or bad and only accept sexual relations between married couples

In formal number theory a Gdel numbering is a function which assigns to each symbol and formula of some formal language a unique natural number called a Gdel number The concept was first used by Kurt Gdel for the proof of his incompleteness theorem 

A Gdel numbering can be interpreted as an encoding where a number is assigned to each symbol of a mathematical notation and a stream of natural numbers can then represent some form or function A numbering of the set of computable functions can then be represented by a stream of Gdel numbers Rogers equivalence theorem states  criteria for which those numberings of the set of computable functions are Gdel numberings 

In mathematics logic and computer science a formal language is a language that is defined in a precise mathematical way A language is defined using a set called the alphabet of the language The members of the alphabet are usually called symbols of the language The language is a set of sequences of symbols of the alphabet The sequences usually have finite length The sequences that are members of the language are called the words of the language or strings

Formal languages have lots of uses A formal language is often thought of as 

A question often asked about formal languages is how difficult is it to decide whether a given word belongs to a particular language This is the kind of question that computability theory and complexity theory ask

A formal language can be specified in a great variety of ways such as

In computer science an alphabet is a set of symbols It is like listing all the letters that can be used to make a word Each symbol is only listed once An alphabet has a finite number of symbols That means you can finish writing down every symbol in an alphabet

For example if we use the binary alphabet 01 the strings would all be in the Kleene closure of the alphabet

Alphabets are important in the use of formal languages and automatons Automatons such as Deterministic Finite Automatons require an alphabet in the formal definition All states in a DFA must have a transition on every element in an alphabet

The empty string is the unique string of no characters over some alphabet It is written as or The length of this empty string is 0 

In simple words given some characters of an alphabet the empty string is the word that can be made if no letters are used There is of course only one such word

Under concatenation the empty string is the identity element of the free monoid on That is for any string s s s s

In many programming languages the empty string is written with two double quotes The empty string is also sometimes noted by the Greek letter 

In C the empty string is represented by a character array with a null character in the zeroeth position Note that all strings in C are terminated by a null character

Concatenation is a simple concept from computer science It is a way of making a new word by putting together two other Strings Given the words foo and bar the two new words foobar and barfoo can be made that way 

In mathematics the identity element of a set is a special element of that set It is special because if it is combined with another element of that set it does not change the other element

With addition the identity element is 0 because adding 0 to some number does not change the number With multiplication it is 1

An inverse function is a concept of mathematics A function will calculate some output y given some input x This is usually written fy The inverse function does the reverse Lets say g is the inverse function of f then gx Or otherwise put fx

Not all functions have inverse functions Finding the inverse of a function can be very difficult to do

If you can count the things in a set it is called a countable set A set with one thing in it is countable and so is a set with one hundred things in it A set with all the natural numbers in it is countable too Its infinite but if someone counted forever they wouldnt miss any of the numbers Sometimes when people say countable set they mean countable and infinite Georg Cantor coined the term 

The rational numbers are also countable but it becomes tricky We cant just list the fractions as since we will never get to 12 this way However we can list all of the rational numbers in the form of a table The horizontal rows are the numerators while the vertical columns are the denominators We can then zigzag through the list starting at 11 then 21 then 12 then 13 then 22 then 31 etc If we keep this up we will get to all of the numbers on the table in due time Each time we hit a number we do not have we add it We dont need to add numbers we already have Thus we have a way of listing all of the rational numbers

A Computable function is a notion from computer science A function is computable if there is an algorithm that can calculate its result in a finite number of steps

Computability theory is all about such functions

Perch is a type of fish Perch are the fish in the genus Perca

Perch have rough scales When looking through a microscope the scales look like a plate with growth rings and spikes on the top edges On the top side of the fish there is a mouth a pair of nostrils and two lidless eyes On the bottom sides are the operculum which are used to protect the gills Also perch have a lateral line system which a set of sense organs that are sensitive to vibrations in the water They have a pair of pectoral and pelvic fins On the front end of the fish there are two dorsal fins The first one is spiny and the second is soft There is also an anal fin which is also considered spiny and a caudal fin 

Puce is a deep rose or brownish purple colour Chinese dried plums can also be said to be puce coloured

The name is from the French word puce which means flea Some people say that the colour name comes from the colour of a squashed flea or the colour of a flea full of blood Other people say that colour name comes from the fleas droppings of digested blood which spread out in deep red stain when water contacts them Still others say that the colour name means the colour of the belly of a flea 

On the other hand the colour name may refer to blue lavender of the Pennyroyal flower also named puce in French The name may come from the use of strong smelling Pennyroyal to ward off fleas

The Oxford English Dictionary dates the use of pucein English from 1787 The first recorded use of puce as a color name was in the 14th century in the French language

Britannicus Nero royal house   Julio Claudian house type    Imperial Dynasty father Nero Claudius Drusus mother Antonia Minor date of birth 1 August 10 BC place of birth Lugdunum Gaul date of death Death date541013dfy place of burial Mausoleum of Augustus 

Claudius was the fourth Roman Emperor He ruled from 24 January 41 AD to his death in 54 AD His uncle was the second Emperor Tiberius and Mark Antony was one of his grandfathers

He had some kind of disability in speech and walking and his family kept him from public office until he was 38 Claudius infirmity may have saved him from the purges of Tiberius and Caligulas reigns enemies did not see him as a serious threat His survival led to his being declared emperor after Caligulas assassination He was then the last adult male of his family

Despite his lack of experience Claudius proved a good administrator and a great builder of public works His reign saw an expansion of the Empire and the conquest of Britain He took a personal interest in the law and he presided at public trials Claudius suffered setbacks in his personal life one of which may have led to his murder He married four times and the marriages did not turn out well Claudius relative and adopted son Nero succeeded him as Emperor and undid much of his good work

On 24 January 41 AD Caligula was assassinated by a broad based conspiracy There is no evidence that Claudius had a direct hand in the assassination although it has been argued that he knew about the plot In the chaos following the murder Claudius witnessed the German guard cut down several uninvolved noblemen including many of his friends He fled to the palace to hide According to tradition a Praetorian named Gratus found him hiding behind a curtain and suddenly declared him Emperor A section of the guard may have planned to seek out Claudius perhaps with his approval They reassured him that they were not one of the groups looking for revenge He was put under their protection

The Senate quickly met and began debating a change of government When they heard of the Praetorians claim they demanded that Claudius be delivered to them for approval He refused sensing danger Eventually the Senate was forced to give in and in return Claudius pardoned nearly all the assassins

Under Claudius the empire expanded for the first time since the reign of Augustus The provinces of Thrace Judea and three other provinces were annexed during his term The annexation of Mauretania begun under Caligula was completed after the defeat of rebel forces and divided into two provinces The most important new expansion was the conquest of Britannia In 43 AD Claudius sent four legions to Britain Britain was an attractive target for Rome because of its wealth particularly mines and slaves It was also a haven for Gallic rebels and the like and so could not be left alone much longer Claudius himself traveled to the island after the completion of initial offensives bringing with him reinforcements and elephants 

The Senate granted him a Roman triumph for his efforts in the Roman Empire only members of the imperial family were allowed such honors Claudius later lifted this restriction for some of his generals When the British general Caractacus was captured in 50 Claudius granted him his life Caractacus lived out his days on land provided by the Roman state an unusual end for an enemy commander

Claudius conducted a census in 48 AD that found 5984072 Roman citizens an increase of about a million since the census conducted at Augustus death

Claudius married four times His first marriage to Plautia Urgulanilla occurred after two failed betrothals During their marriage she gave birth to a son Claudius Drusus Unfortunately Drusus died of asphyxiation in his early teens shortly after becoming engaged to Junilla the daughter of Sejanus Claudius later divorced Urgulanilla for adultery and on suspicion of murdering her sister in law Apronia When Urgulanilla gave birth after the divorce Claudius repudiated the baby girl Claudia as the father was one of his own freedmen 

Soon after Claudius married Aelia Paetina a relative of Sejanus if not Sejanuss adoptive sister During their marriage Claudius and Paetina had a daughter Claudia Antonia 

Some years after divorcing Aelia Paetina in 38 or early 39 AD Claudius married Valeria Messalina who was his first cousin once removed and closely allied with Caligulas circle Shortly thereafter she gave birth to a daughter Claudia Octavia A son first named Tiberius Claudius Germanicus and later known as Britannicus was born just after Claudius accession This marriage ended in tragedy Messalina was regularly unfaithful to Claudius and manipulated his policies in order to amass wealth In 48 AD Messalina married her lover Gaius Silius in a public ceremony while Claudius was at Ostia The result was the execution of Silius Messalina and most of her circle Claudius made the Praetorians promise to kill him if he ever married again

Despite this declaration Claudius did marry once more his niece Agrippina the Younger

The attempted coup detat by Silius and Messalina had probably made Claudius realize the weakness of his position since he did not have an obvious adult heir Britannicus being just a boy Agrippinas son Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus was one of the last males of the imperial family Future coup attempts could rally around the pair and Agrippina was already showing such ambition In any case Claudius accepted Agrippina and later adopted the newly mature Nero as his son

Nero was made joint heir with the underage Britannicus married to Octavia and heavily promoted Nero was popular with the public as the grandson of Germanicus and the direct descendant of Augustus

The consensus of ancient historians was that Claudius was murdered by poison and died in the early hours of 13 October 54 AD Accounts vary greatly but nearly all implicate his last wife Agrippina as the instigator Agrippina had motive in ensuring the succession of Nero before Britannicus could gain power

Claudius was described as physically repulsive weak and easily manipulated by his wives and companions by Suetonius but this historian cannot be entirely trusted The surviving works of Claudius present a different view They paint a picture of an intelligent scholarly well read and conscientious administrator with an eye to detail and justice Thus Claudius becomes an enigma Since the discovery of his letter to the Alexandrians in the last century much work has been done to rehabilitate Claudius and determine where the truth lies

Claudius wrote copiously throughout his life Besides the history of Augustus reign his major works included an Etruscan history and eight volumes on Carthaginian history as well as an Etruscan dictionary and a book on dice playing Claudius is the last person known to have been able to read Etruscan His first wife was Etruscan Finally he wrote an eight volume autobiography 

Unfortunately none of these major works survive They do live on as sources for the surviving histories of the Julio Claudian dynasty Suetonius quotes Claudius autobiography once and must have used it as a source numerous times Tacitus may have used him for some of the more antiquarian passages in his annals Claudius is the source for numerous passages of Plinys Natural History Pliny credits him by name in Book VII 35p83

Many of the public works instituted in his reign were based on plans first suggested by Julius Caesar Levick believes this emulation of Caesar may have spread to all aspects of his policies

The best known fictional representation of the Emperor Claudius were the books I Claudius and Claudius the God by the poet Robert Graves They were both written in the first person as if they are Claudius autobiography Graves plot suggested there were recently discovered genuine translations of Claudius writings Claudius genuine surviving letters speeches and sayings were incorporated into the text in order to add authenticity

Gravess two books were the basis for an I Claudius TV series by the BBC The series starred Derek Jacobi as Claudius and was broadcast in 1976 on BBC2 It was a substantial critical success and won several BAFTA awards The series was later broadcast in the United States on Masterpiece Theatre in 1977 The DVD release of the television series contains the The Epic that Never Was documentary

Claudius has been portrayed in film on several occasions I Claudius unfinished Charles Laughton as Claudius was a great performance The surviving reels were featured in the BBCtv documentary The Epic that never was revealing some of Laughtons most accomplished acting Also minor portrayals in Demetrius and the Gladiators and Caligula

Nero was the fifth and last Roman Emperor of the Julio Claudian dynasty 

Nero was the adopted son of his grand uncle Claudius He became emperor on 13 October 54 after Claudius died Claudius was probably assassinated by Neros mother Agrippina the Younger Agrippina had motive in ensuring the succession of Nero before Britannicus could gain power

During his reign Nero focused much of his attention on diplomacy trade and increasing the cultural capital of the empire He ordered the building of theatres and promoted athletic games 

His reign included a successful war and negotiated peace with the Parthian Empire the suppression of a revolt in Britain and the beginning of the First RomanJewish War

In 64 most of Rome was destroyed in the Great Fire of Rome In 68 the rebellion of Vindex in Gaul and later the acclamation of Galba in Hispania drove Nero from the throne Facing assassination he committed suicide on 9 June 68

Neros rule is often associated with tyranny and extravagance He is known for a number of executions including those of his mother and stepbrother

Nero is known as the emperor who played a fiddle while Rome burned but actually he played the lyre and sang He also persecuted Christians However some ancient sources show that Nero was popular with the common people during and after his reign

A trade union is an organisation or group of workers who join together to get better pay hours benefits and working conditions Union members and supporters of unions claim that they are necessary because the people that run companies want to pay as little as possible

Unions do many things for their members This includes

If collective bargaining does not work unions often use strikes to get their demands However the threat of a strike is usually enough over 98 of union contracts are renewed without a strike 

Trade unions are close to trade guilds in Medieval times These guilds were made up of independent skilled workers who joined together

A trade union is a collection of people who all want to keep and improve their jobs as well as their working and living conditions Member of trade unions will usually working in the same industry

Trade unionism eventually became accepted as a fact of life by British governments and employers but with much struggle The acceptance of trade unions was no coincidence it took place when British industry was at its most confident steady economic growth had dampened revolutionary enthusiasm At the same time providing the means whereby employers could buy off discontent with higher wages and improved conditions of work

This did not mean that unions were will liked by the Establishment In fact trade unions had to take care to create a good image in mid Victorian terms in order to win tolerance and acceptance

However in the early part of the nineteenth century the future of Trade Unionism was not certain 

Trade unions developed slowly in Britain but they can be traced right back to the Middle Ages In medieval towns and villages trade guilds started to develop With both the master and the employees assigned to the guild of their particular craft

In 1563 The Statute of Artificers was passed by Elizabeth 1s government The Statute had some negative effects such as not allowing apprentices to look for work outside of their parish but it had positive effects as well such as requiring justices of the peace to maintain living standards and to monitor apprentices in their district This meant that craftsmen received some protection from the state

By the 19th century attitudes had changed People now hated government interference in their businesses As the population increased so did the size of businesses and it was no longer possible for employers to have a personal relationship with each employee Due to this in 1813 the Statute was repealed

Now workers began to form trade clubs and associations to protect industrial and personal interests 

Early trade unions were only for skilled artisan trades These craft trade unions or societies were mainly formed amongst cobblers printers and mechanics Craft trade unions were distinctive because they had 1Welfare benefits 2Apprenticeship regulations new entrants to the trade were strictly limited 3Entry fees 4Collective bargaining with employees to fix wage levels Craft societies had small amounts of members and were restricted to a certain trade in a certain town Members were usually literate and rationalist The actual society was usually based on a public house with meetings etc convened there 

These were different to trade unions but had some functions in common Friendly societies were self help organisations In exchange for a subscription fee they would provide financial supports for workers in the event of for example death or illness They were usually locally based Tyneside in the 1820s had 165 societies with a total of 10000 members Gradually the societies or groups of workers formed into larger bodies called combinations Instead of just paying out benefits they became more militant and begun to lobby for better conditions and better pay etc Workers were also able to petition parliament when they ahd a particular grievance for example over working conditions or wages Over the 18th century these trade clubs became more aggressive and powerful Small groups joined together into combinations and campaigned to improve working conditions and for higher wages Some combinations organised local strikes 

The government realised that something had to be done about combinations The Aristocracy were worried about the number and power of combinations The French Revolution only scared them more Due to all of this the Combination Acts of 1799 and 1800 were introduced The acts forbid labourers from combining to campaign for better working conditions and increased wages If workers broke this new law they could be sent to prison for up to 3 months The act was strictly enforced

The combination acts had little success trades unions simply carried on in secret EP Thomson claimed that the number of trade unions had even increased Some unions called themselves friendly societies and thus continued to work In 1823 a London tailor called Francis Place led the movement for repeal With the support of MP Joseph Hume the government was convinced to set up a parlimentary committee to look into the question of repeal The government no longer feared revolution combinations and peaceful bargaining now seemed acceptable The committee recommended the repeal of the Combination Acts and parliament acted accordingly The combination acts were repealed in 1824 Trades unions were now legal

Strikes quickly occurred across the country The government then decided to bring in the Amending Combination Act in 1825 which allowed the existence of trade unions but refused them the right to stage protests

Trade Unions faced quite a few problems in their creation and organisation

1Preventative legislation most notably the Combination Acts 1799 1800 2The prevalence of the domestic system of working 3an identity of interest between employer and the domestic employee 4Factory works was undeveloped in the early 19th century As soon as factories had taken off the working classes emerged The traditional bond of trust between employer ad employees was later eroded and working people began to club together 5Government fears The government believed that all working people could club together and react en mass to social change scared the government The ruling classes associated combinations with revolution The many Combination acts of 1700 1800 aimed to prevent trade unions from being formed 

In the 1820s the idea of creating a national union was spreading

A cotton spinner from Manchester named John Doherty summoned a conference on the Isle of Man in 1829 to discuss the idea of a national trade union He then formed the Grand General Union of Operative Spinners of Great Britain and Ireland The following July he formed National Association for the Protection of Labour which was to be made of most trades In 1831 the association had disintegrated mainly due to poor communication links which made it impossible to organise events

In February 1834 the Grand National Consolidated Trade Union was formed largely as a result of Robert Owen Owen dreamed of a socialist society he hoped that a national union would help this happen

Robert Owen was an important figure in the formation of the GNCTU Owen and Doherty were associates and the GNCTU was based on Dohertys Grand General Union The union was heavily influenced by Owenite socialism 

The objectives of the GNCTU were straightforward and traditionalist thus strike action was to be used

1To improve wages andor conditions

2To protect workers from any erosion of wages andor conditions

It is disputed whether of not his union succeeded It lasted just six months Owen claimed that there was around half a million members but other estimates put the figure at around 16000 members

The union failed for a number of reasons Owen did not really understand or empathise the suffering of the workers who had genuine and immense concerns The general body or workers favoured militant action but Owen preferred a steady more legalistic approach The size of the GNTCU also made any strikes difficult to organise A further problem was the fact that many employers forbade their employees from joining the GNTCU and refused to let them work if they had not signed a document which renounced the organisation

In February 1834 six workers for Tolpuddle in Dorset formed a union 13 shillings was what the average family need to survive but the men were being paid just 9 shillings Led by George Loveless the farm labourers fought for increased wages James Frampton the landowner was determined to stop industrial action he reported the group to the Home Secretary Lord Melbourne The men were arrested tried and sentenced to seven years transportation The judge said that he made he did this to make an example of them for the sake of the stability of the nation The men became known as the Tolpuddle Martyrs the judges wishes were carried out Support for the GNCTU fell dramatically and by August 1834 it had collapsed

The orthodox view is that trade unionism virtually stopped for the next 15 years after the collapse of the GNCTU with many workers becoming involved in the alternative reforms adopted by Chartism However in the skilled trades unions were flourishing with trade unions having an estimated 100 000 memberships in the early 1840s

The tachi was worn hung to the belt with the cutting edge down unlike the katana which was worn with the cutting edge pointing upwards Not all tachi were the standard size Small ones were called ko dachi If the sword was longer than the standard one it was called o dachi

The tachi that can be seen in museums have one or more chips along the back of the sword while the cutting edge looks almost untouched and mirror polished The experts explain that Samurai made the smallest possible moves with their tachi to kill the enemy Thus when both swords were about to collide the samurai both turned their swords and let only the blunt back of the blades hit one another The cutting edge was used for finish touches namely for cutting the human body

Its rocks form in Europe the Lias group of marine strata consisting mostly of limestone with some clays and siltstone It was in this formation on the Dorset Jurassic Coast that Mary Anning did much of her work The mudstones of the earliest Jurassic give way to carbonate rocks as the water deepens in the Middle Jurassic

The Jurassic period was one of the time periods when dinosaurs were on the Earth By this time many groups of the Triassic period had become extinct

At the start of the Jurassic Britain was warm temperate to subtropical between 30 and 40 north of the equator Temperature would have been in the range of 1229C 

Shallow seas were over southern England higher ground like the the Mendip Hills were a string of islands stretching westwards South Wales

A personal digital assistant is a handheld computer Personal digital assistants were designed to replace non electronic day planners Many PDAs can work as an address book a calculator a clock and a calendar Some also have games on them Newer PDAs are now called smartphones and have Wi Fi touch screens can read e mail record video play music and make phone calls

PDAs processor is a chip which makes the device work PDAs can have different processors depending on their speed If access to the Internet GPS or video recording are needed the PDA needs to have a fast processor

PDA stores data and applications on RAM memory It is a memory card inside the device PDAs can also use SD SDIO and MMS cards These are easy to remove and are called flash memory cards USB flash drives can be used to add more memory

Most PDAs have touch screens This means that the device has less buttons or has no buttons at all Usually PDAs come with removable pen with which the screen is touched The pen acts like a mouse for desktop PCs or like a touch pad for laptops For other PDAs a finger is used instead of the pen

PDAs are powered by batteries There are two types of batteries removable and fixed Older PDAs used alkaline batteries which the user would have to take out and replace when they ran out Most new PDAs have Li ion batteries These batteries are rechargeable PDAs use more battery power when playing video accessing Internet or transferring data using Bluetooth Large and bright screens also take more power This makes the battery run out faster

A PDA can communicate with other devices PDAs PCs etc This is made with the help of infrared port or with Bluetooth Due to this ability the devices can transfer data download music images video games etc

Synchronization means having the same data on both the PDA and a PC When changes are made on either the PDA or the PC when they are synchronized these changes made to data on one of them are also made the data on the other The synchronization also prevents the loss of the stored information

Customization is adding more memory miniature keyboards etc to the PDA Customization also can be putting other software on the PDA device

In Computer Science a data structure is a way of organizing information so that it is easier to use Data structures determine the way in which information can be used If the focus of use is on the operations that can be performed people often talk about an abstract data type Data structures are often optimised for certain operations Finding the best data structure when solving a problem is an important part of programming Programs that use the right data structure are easier to make and perform better

An array holds several values of the same kind Accessing the elements is very fast It may not be possible to add more values than defined at the start without copying all values into a new array

A List can hold several values Each item in the list has a way of telling where the next element is some lists can also tell where the previous element is It is very easy to add a new element at the start of the list telling whether an element is already in the list is more difficult and needs going through all elements of a list

A stack is like a list but elements can only be added and removed at one end In addition to adding or removing an element theres often an operation to look at top of the stack without removing the element

A queue is like a list but the elements can only be accessed in the same order they were added

A graph allows to associate several elements The elements are usually called vertices the connections called edges 

Trees are special Graphs where there is only one way between any two vertices

XHTML stands for eXtensible HyperText Markup Language It is markup used to design websites and webpages

XHTML is much more strict than ordinary HTML and is based on both XML and HTML Due to the lax nature of HTML different web browsers can sometimes display websites incorrectly since there is more than one way to interpret poorly written HTML The strict and formal nature of XHTML once fully adopted will allow for web browsers to display the same page correctly between them Proper XHTML is also easier to read for humans

For example the below code shows one of the differences between HTML and XHTML

Incorrect HTML version  

Correct XHTML version 

The line break tag in HTML does not have a closing tag you just type it once and it creates a line break In XHTML the rule is that tags that do not have an closing tag must close themselves within the initial tag These tags are called empty tags Another empty tag is hr which inserts a horizontal rule or dividing line

Once found in Asia Europe and North America tarsiers are now only found on several Southeast Asian islands including the Philippines Sulawesi Borneo and Sumatra 

They also have the longest continuous fossil record of any primate The fossil record suggests that their dental pattern and shape has not changed in 45 million years 

Unlike many nocturnal animals tarsiers lack a light reflecting area of the eye They also have a fovea atypical for nocturnal animals 

The tarsier is also known to be the inspiration for the famous movie character Yoda of Star Wars due to its small size but excellent hunting skills Tarsiers can catch prey like birds even if they are in motion as the tarsiers jump from tree to tree to catch their prey

One tarsier species Dians Tarsier is listed by on the IUCN Red List as being lower risk  conservation dependent Two other speciessub species Horsfields Tarsier are listed as lower risk  least concern The Spectral Tarsier is categorized as lower risk not threatened All other tarsier species are listed as data deficient

A pedestrian is a person travelling on foot whether walking or running In modern times the term mostly refers to someone walking on a road or footpath but this was not the case historically

The main way humans get around is by walking The first humans walked out of Africa about 60000 years ago We walked across India to reach Australia We walked across Asia to reach the Americas We walked from the fertile crescent area to reach Europe

Nowadays roads often have a designated footpath attached especially for pedestrian traffic called the sidewalk in American English and the pavement in British English There are also footpaths not associated with a road which are used only by pedestrians especially ramblers hikers or hill walkers and there are roads not associated with a footpath These footpaths in mountains or forests are called trails 

Efforts are underway by pedestrian advocacy groups to make it easy to be a pedestrian in new developments especially to counteract newer developments where 20 to 30 percent do not include sidewalks Some activists advocate large auto free zones where pedestrians only or pedestrians and some non motorised vehicles are allowed 

Patti Deutsch is an American actress who is best known for appearing the television game show Match Game in the 1970s She is also known for doing voices in animated movies

A body double is a person who works in the movie or television production industry Body doubles are models that act in scenes that actors or actresses do not want to do For example body doubles sometimes act in love scenes or scenes of nudity where a persons body is shown 

Body doubles are usually models that have developed very good bodies by exercising and by eating well Often movies or television shows that use body doubles do not admit that a body double model was used 

In the popular American movie Pretty Woman a fashion and parts model named Donna Scoggins posed for the infamous movie poster in thigh high boots while another body double Shelley Michelle filmed nude scenes that actress Julia Roberts did not want to do 

Another job in the movie and television production industry where people do actions that the actors or actresses do not want to do is the job of stuntman A stuntman is a person who does dangerous actions in movies for example jumping falling getting in a car accident or pretending to fight with knives

What distinguishes a stunt person from a stunt double is the particular character they portray If the character in question is a main character andor central to the plot and uniquely identifiable the stuntman is then typically referred to as a stunt double in the credits

An intergenerational conflict is either a conflict situation between teenagers and adults or a more abstract conflict between two generations which often involves prejudices against another generation

Furthermore intergenerational conflict describes cultural social or economic discrepancies between generations These can be caused by value shift or conflict of interest between younger and older generations An example are changes to an intergenerational contract that may be necessary to reflect a change in demographics

An intergenerational contract is an agreement between different generations It assumes that future generations will honor the contract and provide a service to a generation that has done the same service for an older generation

The most common use of the term is in social security and refers to the consensus to provide pensions for the retired generations through payments made by the working generations

The use of the word contract is not entirely accurate as the next generation enters the agreement without consent

Inca rope bridges were simple suspension bridges over canyons and gorges to provide access for the Inca Empire Bridges of this type were suitable for use since the Inca people did not use wheeled transport  traffic was limited to pedestrians and livestock These bridges were an important part on the Inca road system and are an excellent example of Inca innovation in engineering They were frequently used by runners delivering messages throughout the Incan empire

Ewoks are a fictional race of small bear like creatures from George Lucas Star Wars universe They first appeared in the film Return of the Jedi 

The Inca road system of Peru was the most extensive among the many roads and trails that were constructed in pre Columbian South America 

It went across the Andes mountains and reached heights of over 5000 m above sea level The Inca road system covered approximately 22500 km and provided access to over three million km of territory

Because the Incas did not make use of the wheel for transportation and did not have horses until the arrival of the Spanish in Peru in the 16th century the trails were used almost exclusively by people walking sometimes accompanied by pack animals usually the llama

The trails were used by the Inca people as a means of relaying messages carried via knotted cord quipu and by memory and for transporting goods Messages could be carried by runners covering as much as 240 km per day working in relay fashion much like the Pony Express of the 1860s in North America

There were approximately 2000 inns or tambos placed at even intervals along the trails The inns provided food shelter and military supplies to the tens of thousands who traveled the roads 

The most important Inca road was the Camino Real as it is known in Spanish with a length of 5200 km It began in Quito Ecuador passed through Cusco and ended in what is now Tucumn Argentina The Camino Real went across the mountain ranges of the Andes with peak altitudes of more than 5000 m El Camino de la Costa the coastal trail with a length of 4000 km ran parallel to the sea and was linked with the Camino Real by many smaller routes

By far the most popular of the Inca trails for trekking is the Capaq Nan trail which leads from the village of Ollantaytambo to Machu Picchu the so called Lost City of the Incas There are many well preserved ruins along the way and hundreds of thousands of tourists from around the world make the three or four day trek each year accompanied by guides

The Inca Trail to Machu Picchu is actually three routes which all meet up near Inti Pata the Sun Gate and entrance to Machu Picchu The three trails are known as the Mollepata Classic and One Day trails with Mollepata being the longest of the three Passing through the Andes mountain range and sections of the Amazon rainforest the Trail passes several well preserved Inca ruins and settlements before ending at the Sun Gate on Machu Picchu mountain The two longer routes require an ascent to beyond 12000 ft above sea level which can result in altitude sickness

A color code is a system for displaying information by using different colors Color codes are often difficult or impossible for blind and color blind people to understand

Examples of color codes

The Color Code is also the title of a book combined with a nutritional practice by the same name in another book publication The Color Code combines food science medical knowledge and nutritional practices to encourage consumer intake of colourful plant foods for achieving optimal health

Complementary colours are pairs of opposite colours What is meant by opposite can be different between colour science and art and the printing process

An anvil is a hard piece of metal which is used as a workbench when making things out of iron or steel An anvil is used by a blacksmith when he needs to hammer hot iron to bend it into the shape he wants A blacksmith can make new shoes for horses

Anvils were known in the Bronze Age and possibly earlier They were used in Ancient Greece and Ancient Egypt They are still in use today although not nearly as much as 100 years ago when there were many more horses 

Anvils are extremely heavy They are made in different sizes The 17th century writer John Bunyan was a tinker He walked around the villages of Bedfordshire with a small anvil and a few tools on his back His anvil was wedge shaped so that he could knock it into the ground when he needed to do a repair His anvil is now in the John Bunyan museum in Bedford

The anvil has sometimes been used as a percussion instrument because it makes a very loud sound when hit by the hammer Usually musicians use a metal bar mounted on a sound box This sounds just as good as a real anvil

Verdi wrote some famous music called the Anvil Chorus in his opera Il Trovatore Wagner asked for 18 anvils in Das Rheingold in the scene which takes place below the earth where the Nibelungs are working at their forges Johann Strauss II wrote an Anvil Polka Varse used an anvil in Ionisation Walton uses an anvil in Belshazzars Feast and there is an anvil in the orchestra in Howard Shores music for the The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy

The Inca Empire was the largest empire in pre Columbian America and was large even by world standards The administrative political and military center of the empire was located in Cuzco The Inca Empire began in the highlands of Peru around 1197 From 1438 to 1533 the Incas used conquest and peaceful assimilation to gain a large portion of western South America that centered on the Andean mountain ranges and included large parts of modern Ecuador Peru Bolivia Argentina and Chile

In 1533 Atahualpa the last Inca sovereign emperor was executed by the conquistador Francisco Pizarro That meant the beginning of Spanish rule in South America The Inca Empire was supported by an economy based on the broken wikt linkcollectivecollective ownership of the land 

The pre Columbian era means the history and prehistory of the Americas before there were important European influences on the American continent 

The word pre Columbian refers to the era before Christopher Columbus but sometimes it can include the history of American indigenous cultures as they continued to develop after the Christopher Columbus first landing in 1492 until they were conquered or influenced by Europeans even if this happened decades or even centuries after the arrival of Columbus

Pre Columbian can also mean cultures of any one of the great native civilizations of the Americas such as those of Mesoamerica and of the Andes ImageYaxchilan 1jpgAn image of one of the pyramids in the upper level of Yaxchiln ImageTelamones TulajpgAtlantes at Tula Hidalgo ImageUxmal mexicojpgMaya architecture at Uxmal 

Duct tape is a very strong adhesive tape with a cloth backing Usually duct tape is grey or black but it is made in other colors including transparent red orange yellow green blue purple flames zebra stripe lepaord spot tye dye and others People use duct tape to repair many things for example a broken handbag or a broken chair

Duct tape was designed during World War II It was first used to keep water out of ammunition cases It was found to work so well that people started using it to fix many other things Duct tape was also called 100 mph tape by the military because it is said the tape will still stick in winds at speeds of 100 miles per hour Duct tape got its name from its use on heating and air conditioning ducts but oddly enough that is the one use that the tape is not very good for It is illegal in California to use duct tape on ducts and most professional builders in the United States are not allowed to use it either

In the United States people use duct tape in many action movies and television shows Strips of duct tape can be used to tie a person up because it is very hard to get them off

Duct tape is also great for making things like wallets purses clothes and sometimes even sculptures The use of it as an art medium is fairly new though 

A text editor is a program that is run on a computer that can create and change text The text can be saved into a file that is called a text file Text editors can be used for a lot of things Many people use them to write documents Some people write code using a text editor 

Some text editors can edit rich text Rich text allows the person that is editing text to have bold text italic text and other things

Most text editors today support search and replace A computer will quickly find some text the user wants The user can tell the computer to replace the found text with something else This can be in part or all of the document

Copy cut and paste are other common options in text editors Copy allows users to instantly add a copy of text in one place to another place Cut and paste are similar except that the text is moved from one place to another instead of being copied This is very useful when a writer wishes to put his paragraphs in a different order for example

Sometimes users make mistakes or need to do the same thing over and over without getting bored This is what the undo and redo features do Users can reverse their mistakes or quickly repeat their actions Some text editors allow many mistakes in a row to be reversed others allow only one or two

In Chemistry Valence is the number of chemical bonds the atoms of a certain element can form

For a long time people though that this number was a fixed property of the element in question They thought that carbon always has four bonds oxygen always has two and hydrogen always has one The problem was seen only later For example phosphorous sometimes behaves as if it had three bonds a valence of three At other times though it seems to have five bonds 

IUPAC saw this problem and proposed oxidation numbers This means there is one number per chemical element The problem of this approach is that it leaves aside most chemical properties of the elements in question

Valence sur Base is a city in the Gers department of the Midi Pyrnees region in France It is near Condom en Armagnac It was founded in 1274 by Gerald V Count of Armagnac and the Cistercian Abbey of Flaran as a Bastide In 1999 1151 people lived there There is a old cisercian abbey at the place Today the abbey serves as a cultural center There is also a public washing basin and a port where ships can land 

A bastide is a fortified town They were built mainly in the south of France in the Middle Ages Bastides were built mainly between 1229 and 1373 between the Albigensian Crusade and the Hundred Years War Today there are about 400 bastides They all have a central square and a rectangular street layout On the market square the houses have arcades They were usually built in places that were easy to defend such as the top of a hill or on a plain

Well known bastides today are Carcassonne and Andorra la Vella

Bastides are medieval cities There is an act of foundation There are often historic documents written about them Some times they are planned cities and are usually only one architect designs it They were often built where there was already a village or at a place of historical importance They were sometimes also built where people bought and sold things a lot

The Treaty of Paris is sometimes seen as the foundation act which made the construction of modern cities and bastides possible The treaty itself ended the Albigensian Crusade One of the first bastides built was Montauban Montauban became a city in 1144 However some consider Mont de Marsan which was founded in 1133 to be a bastide

Most bastides where built in the countryside They were basically to serve the needs of local trade A few of them were built in places which were very easy to defend Others were built where it was possible to defend them but most bastides were simply built where they were needed The time when they were built was a peaceful one in the region

Bastides were built by people who had a high social status such as

The main feature of all bastides is a central open place or square It was used for markets but also used for political and social gatherings A typical square can be found in Montauban

Generally there is just one square Saint Lys and Albias are different because they have two squares one for the market and one square for the church

The square is also used to divide the city into quarters Generally it lies outside the main street which carried the traffic There are three possible layouts

Generally the flattest place in the bastide was used for the square

Except in very rare cases the church was not on the central square Usually it was at an angle and faced the square diagonally One of the rare exceptions is Villefranche de Rouergue

There were clear rules how houses could be built in the bastide The front of the houses  the faades  had to line up Also there had to be a small space between the houses The different housing lots were all alike convert8mft0abbron by convert24mft0abbron was a common size There were only a limited number of lots This varied between 10 and several thousand

The streets were usually convert6mft0abbron convert10mft0abbron wide so a chariot could pass through They ran alongside the faades of the houses Alleys run between streets these are usually only convert5mft0abbron convert6mft0abbron wide Sometimes they are only convert2mft0abbron convert25mft0abbron wide In a bastide there were usually between one and eight streets

When bastides were founded most had no city walls or fortifications This was because it was a peaceful time in history Such things were added later This was done either through a special tax or through a law that required that the people of the city helped build the walls A good example is Libourne Ten years after the city was founded the people asked for money to build city walls Once they had received the money they spent it on making their city prettier rather than building walls

At the beginning of the Hundred Years War many bastides that had no city walls were destroyed Some of the others quickly built stone walls to protect the city

There are different base layouts for bastides Often for each type of layout there was a bastide that was an example for other bastides The most common layout started from two perpendicular streets New streets were made parallel to the two original streets This led to a usually rectangular grid layout

There seems to have been no plan when these bastides were built This may have been for the following reasons

An example of such a bastide is La Bastide de Bousignac

The circle layout for a bastide was very rare The only surviving example is in Fourcs

Enclosing bastides were built around an existing small village or hamlet There already was a church or a small group of houses When new houses were built they were added around the original buildings

There is one main street that links the two gates This makes the axis around which the bastide was built These are quite common with about 3040 of all bastides using this design Very often they are found on flat land The square is often made by making the main street bigger Very often there are alleys which run perpendicular to the main street This layout is very easy to change to fit in with the local landscape

An example of a one axis bastide is Gimont Gimont is convert1000myd0lkon long and only convert300myd0abbron wide Sometimes there is another street which runs parallel to the main axis The city square is made between the two streets

There are two main streets axes which are perpendicular All other streets are at a right angle or parallel to one of the two main streets The city square is very often in the centre or very near the centre The whole city is either rectangular square hexagonal or oval shaped This layout was the plan used at the height of the bastide movement

A few steps are necessary to make a new bastide these are

Once all this steps are done the bastide is not yet founded The next step is to attract people to come live in the new city This is done by making a Charta of customs This Charta does not tell so much about customs but rather about the privileges those that live there get These privileges can be of different kinds

Bastides wanted to attract people who should come to live there They therefore offered equality to those who came to live there They made it look like citizens had equal rights and were free

The social system was very fixed and unchanging during the Middle Ages The system of laws of the Middle Ages was built on the fact that society did not change Everyone had their place in the system and they stayed there The lords who built the bastide did not want to change the social system All they wanted was small local improvements Usually the land where the bastide was built was not developed The lords that owned the land were not making much money from it They built the bastide because they hoped they would get more profits from the land

For these reasons people who already had a social status could not settle in the bastide A few poor noblemen gave their land to the city and started a career as a trader because that way they could earn more money than before

The people who lived in the city looked free but this freedom had limits

Men and women did not have equal rights Women are often mentioned in the Charter and have some rights

Lepers were usually not welcome in the city Certain bastides had special places which would treat them but they were generally excluded from social life They had to wear special badges to show they were ill and they could not come close to normal people

Another group of people that was generally not welcome were the Jews In the beginning there was no problem but later Jews were persecuted Philip IV of France did not allow any Jews to live in France in 1306 He confiscated their belongings and sold them

A number of bastides were successful and still exist today Many others have failed and most of their population left them

The bastides had three stages of development or change

Camouflage can mean

Camouflage is a type of clothing fabric covering or painted pattern used by militaries and armies to make it harder to see soldiers and weapons such as artillery guns and military vehicles Camouflage clothes fabric coverings and paint use a colored pattern of several colors that is designed to blend in with the surroundings Camouflage patterns are also used for hunting clothes 

Camouflage patterns used in desert areas are beige and light brown Camouflage patterns used in forested areas mix different green and brown colors Camouflage patterns used in urban areas mix grey white and black colors Camouflage for snowy areas use white colors to blend in with the snow

Camouflage became an important part of modern military tactics when the accuracy of rifles and cannons improved at the end of the 1800s But armies continued to use bright colours and designs until the 20th century During World War II camouflage became a common feature in military uniforms As well many military vehicles such as planes and trucks were painted with camouflage patterns

Different countries use different types of military camouflage patterns

The SyriacAramaic Genocide was a genocide by the Ottoman Empire the estimates ranged from 650000 and higher Syriacs that were killed during the raids and massacres

The name goven to this is the Sayfo which is the Aramaic word for sword Many Syriacs were considered unpure by the Turks and were massacred for not submitting their Christian identity The Syriacs lost their homes and possessions to the Sultan Adulhamed the Red and even before the genocidethey were persecuted and forced to pay high taxes

Since ancient times and conquest by the Babylonian the Syriacs have not have had their own nation It was called a diaspora and they have spread over to many different countries Under the Arabs and Turks they were oppressed and assimilated to society and many lost their independence Those that survive continue to have a common unity especially in their deep Christian faith

The Syriac Genocide was committed against the AramaicSyriac population of the Ottoman Empire during the First World War by the Young Turks The Syriac population of northern Mesopotamia was forcibly relocated and massacred by Ottoman and Kurdish forces between 1914 and 1920 under the regime of the Young Turks Scholars have placed the number of Syriac victims at 500000 to 750000

The Syriac genocide took place in the same context and time period as the Armenian and Greek genocides But unlike these no official national or international recognition of the Syriac genocide has been made and many accounts discuss the Syriac genocide as a part of the larger events subsumed under the Armenian genocide

A herd is a large group of animals The term is used for mammals particularly hoofed animals Herding is a good example of collective animal behavior Other terms are used for similar phenomena in other types of animal For example a large group of birds is usually called a flock and a large group of carnivores is usually called a pack 

In addition special collective nouns may be used for particular taxa for example a flock of geese if not in flight is sometimes called a gaggle However in theoretical discussions in behavioural ecology the term herd is used for all these kinds of assemblage A herd may also refer to one that tends and cares for such groups

When an association of animals is described as a herd that means that the group tends to act together but that this does not occur as a result of planning or co ordination Rather each individual is choosing behaviour that corresponds to that of the majority of other members possibly through imitation or possibly because all are responding to the same external circumstances A herd can be contrasted with a co ordinated group where individuals have distinct roles Many human groupings such as an army detachments or sports teams show such co ordination and differentiation of roles but so do some animal groupings such as those of eusocial insects which are co ordinated through pheromones and other forms of animal communication Conversely some human groupings may behave more like herds

Ungulates are several groups of mammals most of which use the tips of their toes usually hoofed to sustain their whole bodyweight whilst moving

This article is about the visible spectrum For all other uses see Spectrum

A spectrum plural spectra is a band of several colours violet indigo blue green yellow orange and red A spectrum can be seen if the Suns light is passed through a prism and allowed to gather on a white screen A natural example of a spectrum is a rainbow The word spectrum was first used by scientists studying optics They used the word to describe the rainbow of colors in visible light when separated using a prism The spectrum seen when light passes through a prism is an example of the dispersion of light The material from which the prism is made has a different refractive index n than air Usually nprism is greater than nair and nair is taken to be approximately one This implies that light travels a little slower in the material of the prism than in the space surrounding it The angle of refraction can be determined from the angle of incidence and the refractive indexes using Snells law The reason why the white light separates into in its component colors instead of remaining white is because the shorter wavelengths are refracted or bent more than the longer wavelengths Thus red having the longest visible wavelength will appear closest to the line perpendicular to the surface of the material that is it will be bent the least Violet light with the smallest wavelength in the visible spectrum will be bent the most The rainbow produced will always be in the same order red orange yellow green blue indigo violet

The International Phonetic Alphabet is a system for writing down sounds It was created by the International Phonetic Association in 1886 so that people could write down sounds of languages in a standard way Linguists language teachers and translators use it to write words and phonemes

Wikipedia also uses the IPA to show how certain words are meant to be spoken Most symbols are letters in the Latin alphabet or variations of it for example the palatal approximant is written with j In IPA symbols can be written between slashes or in square brackets Narrow tranlsation is more precise than broad 

The IPA has symbols only for sounds that are used normally in spoken languages The Extended IPA is used to write down other sounds

The IPA is sometimes changed and symbols are added or taken away Right now there are 107 different letters in the IPA and 52 diacritics which are used with the letters

In 1886 a group of French and British language teachers formed the International Phonetic Association These teachers used the Romic alphabet at first They later changed the alphabet so that different languages would all write the same sounds with the same letters

The IPA is made to have one symbol for each sound For example the letter in English normally is spoken as two sounds but could also mean gz or z

The International Phonetic Alphabet has letters for three types of sounds pulmonic consonants non pulmonic consonants and vowels

Pulmonic consonants are made by obstructing air coming from the lungs Most consonants are pulmonic The symbols for these sounds are arranged in a table The rows show how the sound is made and the columns show where it is made

Sophene was a province of the Armenian Kingdom and of the Roman Empire located in the south west of the kingdom It currently lies in the in modern day southeastern Turkey 

According to Anania Shirakatsis Ashkharatsuyts Tsopk was the 2nd among the 15 provinces of Greater Armenia It consisted of 8 cantons Khordzyan Hashtyank Paghnatun Balahovit Tsopk Andzit Degiq and Gavreq

Tsopk was part of the kingdom of Urartu in the 8th 7th cc BC After unifying the region with his kingdom in the early 700s BC king Argishtis I of Urartu resettled many of its inhabitants to his newly built city of Erebuni Around 600 BC Tsopk became part of the newly emerged ancient Armenian Kingdom of Orontids

After Alexander the Greats campaigns in 330s BC and the subsequent collapse of the Achaemenid Empire Tsopk remained part of the newly independent kingdom of Greater Armenia In the early 200s BC at the instigation of the Seleucid Empire which was trying to weaken the Armenian kingdom Tsopk along with Commagene split from Greater Armenia forming the Hellenistic kingdom of Tsopk Commagene The kingdom was ruled by a branch of the Armenian royal dynasty of Orontids Tsopk later split from the Tsopk Commagene kingdom as well forming an independent kingdom

Around 200 BC in his attempt to finally subjugate Armenia Seleucian king Antiochus III conquered both Greater Armenia and Tsopk installing Armenian generals Artaxias I and Zariadres as governors strategoses respectively in each kingdom Following Antiochus defeat by Romans at the battle of Magnesia in 190 BC both Zareh and Artashes declared themselves independent kings Zareh and his descendants ruled the kingdom of Tsopk until it was reunified with Greater Armenia by Tigranes the Great in the 80s BC

The counties of England are territorial divisions of England for administrative political and geographical purposes Most current counties have foundations in older divisions such as the Anglo Saxon shires and duchies

The names boundaries and functions of these divisions have changed considerably over their history A series of local government reforms from the 19th century onwards has left the exact definition of the term county ambiguous 

The term counties of England does not therefore refer to a unique set of names or boundaries in formal use the type of county relevant to the specific task is explicitly stated eg ceremonial county registration county historic county or former postal county

The 39 historic ancient or traditional counties developed from the 12th to the 16th centuries though many of the specific areas are much older They were not used for census reporting since 1841 Most of the historic counties continue to form part of the local government structure often with reformed boundaries 

Registration counties existed from 1851 to 1930 and were used for census reporting from 1851 to 1911 

Elected county councils were set up in England in 1889 taking over many of the administrative functions of the Quarter Sessions courts as well as being given other powers over the years A County of London was created from parts of Kent Middlesex and Surrey The counties were divided into administrative counties and independent county boroughs Some counties were covered by several administrative counties they were Suffolk Sussex Northamptonshire Hampshire Cambridgeshire Yorkshire and Lincolnshire

1965 saw a minor change as the original County of London became instead the administrative area of Greater London

On 1 April 1974 the Local Government Act 1972 came into force This broken wikt linkabolishabolished the existing local government structure in England and Wales and replaced it with a new entirely two tier system It abolished the previously existing administrative counties and county boroughs and created a new set of 46 counties in England 6 of which were metropolitan and 40 of which were non metropolitan

Some of the counties established by the Act were entirely new such as Avon Cleveland Cumbria Hereford and Worcester and Humberside along with the new metropolitan counties of Greater Manchester Merseyside South Yorkshire Tyne and Wear West Midlands and West Yorkshire The counties of Cumberland Herefordshire Rutland Westmorland and Worcestershire were abolished and the county boroughs as well

A further local government reform in the 1990s grouped the counties into regions created many small unitary authorities with county level status and restored Herefordshire Rutland and Worcestershire as administrative entities

There are now 81 county level entities outside Greater London Of these 34 are so called shire counties with both county councils and district councils and 40 are unitary authorities Six are metropolitan counties The remaining one is Berkshire whose county council has been abolished and its districts have become unitary authorities

Because of the local government reforms in the 1990s the distinction between the counties used for local government and those used for Lieutenancy abolished in 1974 was revived and a new term ceremonial county coined Most unitary authorities remained associated with the same county for Lieutenancy and in a few areas the old ceremonial counties were restored

These are also known as the geographic counties and are generally used to describe a places location in England They are also taken into consideration by the boundary commission when they draw up boundaries for constituencies for example

The former postal counties as used by the Post Office are no longer required on addresses They included most of the 1974 changes but did not acknowledge Greater Manchester or Greater London as postal counties They went out of official use in 1996

The title Lord Lieutenant is given to the British monarchs personal representatives around the United Kingdom usually in a county with varying tasks throughout history Usually a retired local notable senior military officer peer or business person is given the post honourarily Both men and women are eligible for the post

In England and Wales and Ireland the lord lieutenant was the principal officer of his county His creation dates from the Tudors 

Lieutenants were first appointed to a number of English historic counties by Henry VIII in the 1540s when the military functions of the sheriff were handed over to him He raised was responsible for the efficiency of the local militia units of the county and afterwards of the yeomanry and volunteers He was Commander of these forces and appointed their officers 

Lieutenancies became more organised soon probably in the reign of his successor Edward VI their establishment being approved by the English parliament in 1550 It was not until the threat of invasion by the forces of Spain in 1585 that lieutenants were appointed to all counties After the defeat of the Spanish Armada the need for lieutenants was reduced and the lieutenancies of some counties were left vacant in the 1590s 

The three ridings of Yorkshire each got their own

The official title of the office at this time was His or Her Majestys lieutenant for the county but as almost all office holders were peers they were referred to as lord lieutenant

The Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 established County Territorial Force Associations of which the lord lieutenant was to be head So the combination of counties and county corporates as lieutenancy counties was restored 

Local Government reform in England in 1965 led to the appointment of lord lieutenants to Greater London and Huntingdon and Peterborough and the abolition of those of the County of London Middlesex and Huntingdonshire

A more fundamental reform of local government throughout England and Wales created a new structure of metropolitan non metropolitan and Welsh counties in 1974 Section 218 of the Local Government Act 1972 that established the new system stated Her Majesty shall appoint a lord lieutenant for each county in England and Wales and for Greater London The Act appears to be the first broken wikt linkstatutorystatutory use of the term lord lieutenant for lieutenants to counties 

In 1975 counties ceased to be used for local government purposes in Scotland The Local Government Act 1973 replaced the counties with regions and each region was to have one or more lord lieutenants appointed The areas to which they were appointed approximated to the counties and were based and were defined in terms of the new local government districts

In 1996 Scottish regions and districts were abolished on further local government reorganisation and since that date lord lieutenants have been appointed to lieutenancy areas 

Partial reform of local government in England since 1995 has led to the creation of so called ceremonial counties to which lord lieutenants are now appointed The Lieutenancies Act 1997 is the most recent piece of primary legislation dealing with Lieutenancies in England and includes the definitive list of the current areas used Ceremonial counties may be comprised of combinations of county council areas and unitary authorities

Since the local government re organisation of 1996 in Wales lord lieutenants are now appointed to preserved counties 

The City of London was unaffected by changes introduced since 1882 It has a Commission of Lieutenancy rather than a single Lord Lieutenant The Head of the Commission is the Lord Mayor of London

The modern responsibilities of lord lieutenants include

As the sovereigns representative in his or her county the Lord Lieutenant remains non political and holds no office in any political party The usual age of retirement is 75 They are appointed for life although the sovereign may remove them 

The Lord Lieutenant is supported by a Vice Lord Lieutenant and Deputy Lieutenants which he or she appoints They are unpaid but receive minimal allowances for secretarial help mileage allowance and a driver Male Lord Lieutenants receive an allowance for the ceremonial uniform worn when receiving members of the royal family and on other formal occasions 

There is no uniform for a female Lord Lieutenant but there is a badge which can be worn on ceremonial occasions Male Lord Lieutenants wear a dark blue uniform in the style of an Army No 1 dress along with a cap and sword with a steel scabbard The uniform for a male Vice Lord Lieutenant and Deputy Lieutenants is of a similar style but with features to distinguish it from a Lord Lieutenant

Metroid is a series of video games made by the video game company Nintendo The series started in Japan in 1986 Its main character in the game is Samus Aran Almost all of the games in the series have a certain kind of fictional creature called a Metroid This is where the name of the series comes from Metroids look a lot like jellyfish except they can fly They also have teeth instead of tentacles They attack creatures and people by charging quickly towards them and sucking out all their life force

The main character in the series is Samus Aran She always wears a very powerful space suit This suit lets her do things that normal humans cannot do such as jump very high and fall long ways without being hurt The right arm on Samus suit has a large gun built into it She is seen in this space suit almost all of the time In many of the games if the player finishes the game fast enough or collects enough items they can see her without the suit on When this happens she is either wearing a tight jumpsuit or something resembling a bikini 

The main enemies of the Metroid games are the Space Pirates They are tall creatures who look like lizards that walk on two legs The Space Pirate commander is a dragon named Ridley who is Samus worst enemy

The Michelson Morley experiment was a scientific experiment to find the presence and properties of a substance called Aether Aether was believed to fill empty space The experiment was done by Albert Michelson and Edward Morley in 1887 

Since waves in water need something to move in and sound waves do as well it was believed that light also needed something to move in Scientists in the 18th century named this substance aether after the Greek god of light They believed that aether was all around us and that it also filled the vacuum of space Michelson and Morley created this experiment to try and prove the theory that aether existed They did this with a device called an interferometer

The Earth travels very quickly around the Sun If aether exists the Earth moving through it would cause a wind in the same way that there seems to be a wind outside a moving car To a person in the car the air outside the car would seem like a moving substance In the same way aether should seem like a moving substance to things on Earth 

The interferometer was designed to measure the speed and direction of the aether wind by measuring the difference between the speed of light traveling in different directions It measured this difference by shining a beam of light into a mirror that was only partially coated in silver Part of the beam would be reflected one way and the rest would go the other Those two parts would then be reflected back to where they were split apart and recombined By looking at interference patterns in the recombined beam of light any changes in speed because of aether wind could be seen

They found that there was in fact no substantial difference in the measurements This was puzzling to the scientific community at the time and led to the creation of various new theories to explain the result The most important was Einsteins Special Theory of Relativity

Hydrogen sulfide H2S is a colorless toxic flammable gas that is responsible for the foul smell of rotten eggs and flatulence It often results when bacteria break down organic matter in the absence of oxygen This happens in swamps and sewers It also occurs in volcanic gases natural gas and some well waters This is the smell that people often think to be that of sulfur But sulfur itself does not smell

Hydrogen sulfide is also known as sulfane sulfur hydride sour gas sulfurated hydrogen hydrosulfuric acid sewer gas and stink damp IUPAC accepts the names hydrogen sulfide and sulfane When people speak of more complicated compounds they always use the term sulfane

Small amounts of hydrogen sulfide can be found in crude petroleum Sour natural gas can contain up to 28 But sour natural gas must be cleaned before it can enter a long distance pipeline Pipelines limit hydrogen sulfide to 3 grains per thousand cubic feet of natural gas Volcanoes and hot springs give off some H2S where it probably is made by the hydrolysis of sulfide minerals ie MS H2O to give MO H2S

Normal average concentration in clean air is about 00001 00002 ppm

Hydrogen sulfide is a highly toxic and flammable gas Because it is heavier than air it tends to accumulate at the bottom of poorly ventilated spaces 

Hydrogen sulfide is considered a broad spectrum poison meaning that it can poison several different systems in the body although the nervous system is most affected The toxicity of H2S is comparable with that of hydrogen cyanide

Feudalism is a system of land ownership and duties It was used in the Middle Ages Under feudalism all the land in a kingdom was the kings However the king would give some of the land to the lords or nobles who fought for him These presents of land were called manors Then the nobles gave some of their land to vassals The vassals then had to do duties for the nobles The lands of vassals were called fiefs

When talking about places other than Europe the idea of feudalism is normally only used by analogy most often in discussions of Japan under the shoguns and sometimes medieval and Gondarine Ethiopia Some people have seen situations like feudalism in places as far away as Ancient Egypt Parthian empire India to the American South of the nineteenth century 

Under feudalism taxes were not paid in money They were paid in products and services Presents and taxes had to be given to the lords by their vassals At harvest time the vassals gave shares of their crops to the lords The vassals would grind their grain at the nobles grainaries They would give part of the grain to their lord When animals were killed for food part of the meat was given to the lords The lords promised to give protection peace and safety to their vassals

Manors were completely owned by the nobles They were given from one generation to another The nobles firstborn son took it all when his father died Each manor had its own pasture lands mill wine press church and village A manor had to let many people live there Lords gave their servants food and a place to sleep but they did not pay their servants money

The villein was in a poorer class He had to serve the lords but free in other things He had work to do for the lord or the town Then he went back to his little house with floors made of earth and a broken wikt linkthatchthatched roof On the walls of his house the villein hung meats tools and dried vegetables

A villein was freer than the slaves or serfs but he could still want to be completely free He could not move or marry if the lord did not say yes He could not even leave the manor lands if the lord said no If he escaped he could run away to a town where he would try to live quietly without being known for a year and a day If he could do this he became a free man If he wanted to help the Catholic Church he needed special permission As a member of the church his position could get higher However if this did not work he could join a band of outlaws

The serf was in the lowest class He was only a little better than slaves He could not be sold away from the land but was always sold with the land

Armens were Armenian tribes the people are called as Arman Armenic or Armanen They correspond with the Hayasa Azzi Tribes The Armans united with the tribes of Hayasi Recent linguistic studies present strong evidence that the Indo European language group originates in Anatolia  According to most accounts the Armens were generally tall blond haired and blue eyed in appearance in contrast to their Urartian cousins who tended to be slighter with black hair and black eyes The Urartian state which existed there prior to the coming of the Indo European speaking Armen tribes from the west was a federation of many peoples

At the end of the second millennium BC another Indo European ethnic group closely related to Thracians and Phrygians and referred to by the Greeks as Armens migrated to the Armenian Highland from Northern Balkans 

One theory suggests that the Armens were of Thracian origin and related to the Phrygians The Armens were near the head waters of the Halys to the west of the Euphrates The Armens seemed to have mixed blood with another Asiatic element whose patronymic Hai became in time their national designation The country where the Armens settled were a mountainous region traversed by deep valleys and smiling plains

The word Armani an early form of Armen Armin or Arman denotes the national affiliation as with many cultures standing for the particular nation thus the God AR being the primary deity in the Indo European pantheon  thus AR MAN denotes  Men of Ar or Children of Ar again initially AR standing for ARAREL ARARICH hence Ar Ar At the Place of ARAR  Create Creator also Sun Light Life and Love 

The history of Armenia and Armenians is very ancient and can go back at least 2000 BC Archaeologists say the Shulaveri Shomu culture of the central Transcaucasus region and Armenia today as the earliest known prehistoric culture in the area carbon dated to around 6000  4000 BC But a newer discovered tomb has been dated to 9000 BC Another early culture in the Armenian Highlands and surrounding areasthe Kura Araxes culture is in the period of ca 4000  2200 BC and is believed to have to go into the Trialeti culture and meaning Armenians are one of the oldest Indo European subgroups

Urartu was an ancient kingdom in the Armenian Highlands

Some experts say that the Armenians started as a mixture of the different peoples to move through the area in history The Hurrians Urarteans Luvians and Mushki This last group also knowns as Phrygians may have brought their Indo European language to Armenia The Armenian language today is Indo European but shows a lot of influence from the earlier languages especially Urartean 

The Democratic Republic of Armenia 19181920 was the first modern establishment of an Armenian republic The country was created after the Russian Tsarist empire that began with the Russian Revolution of 1917 that lost power Its creation with borders were the Democratic Republic of Georgia in the north the Ottoman Empire to the west the Persian Empire to the south and Azerbaijan Democratic Republic to the east

Armenia gave way to communist power in late 1920 In September 1920 the Turkish revolutionaries moved in on the capital First an armistice was concluded on November 18 and then a full peace treaty  Treaty of Alexandropol on 2nd andor 3rd of December 1920

During that time the Soviet 11th Red Army invasion started on the 29th of November 1920 The actual transfer of power took place on December 2 in Yerevan Armenian leadership approved a ultimatum presented to it by the Soviet plenipotentiary Boris Legran  who was at work as one of major Russian diplomats on Caucasus at that time Armenia decided to join the Soviet sphere while the Soviet Russia agreed to protect its remaining territory from the advancing Turkish army Soviets also pledged to take steps to rebuild the army protect the Armenians not to pursue non communist Armenians None of these promises were kept

On December 4 1920 the Red Army entered Yerevan the government of Armenian Republic effectively stopped working On December 5 the Armenian Revolutionary Committee also entered the city Finally on the following day December 6 Felix Dzerzhinskys dreaded secret police the Cheka entered Yerevan thus effectively ending the existence of the Democratic Republic of Armenia The rest of Armenia was under control of the communist government The part by Turkey remained for the most part theirs  by the subsequent Treaty of Kars Soon the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic was proclaimed under the leadership of Aleksandr Miasnikyan It was to be included into the newly created Transcaucasian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic

The oldest settlement still remaining is the village of Lorient although scattered in every cemetery on the island can be found Swedish grave markers Lorients sister village on the French mainland is the city of Lorient on the northern coast of Brittany

Of the 20 beaches on the small island several are seen as especially inviting On the southern side of the island Saline and Governor beaches are pristine beaches with no development on them On the western edge of the island is Colombier beach This beach is only reachable by boat or a hike St Jean Flammands and Grand Cul de Sac beaches are also popular and attractive beaches which have hotels and other establishments on them Shell Beach is popular for families with kids as it has little surf and lots of tide pools

Hispaniola is an island in the Caribbean Sea It is the second largest island of the West Indies east of Cuba and west of Puerto Rico

The Republic of Haiti occupies the western third the Dominican Republic the rest Hispaniola is one of two Caribbean islands in which there are two countries the other is Saint Martin

When Columbus arrived to America some groups of native people coming from northern South America had lived in the Caribbean Islands since a very long time That movement from South America to the Caribbean islands was not continuous but it happened in several waves during almost twelve centuries

Archeological studies suggests that those people from South America came to the Caribbean islands during four periods

The first period began around 5000 BC For most Caribbean islands this period ended around 2000 years ago except in Cuba and Hispaniola where there were some small populations in western Cuba and southwestern Hispaniola when the Europeans arrived to these islands They were called Ciboney or Siboney by the Tanos meaning man that lives among rocks

The second group was the Igneri the first Arawak Indians to come to the Caribbean Islands They displaced the Ciboney people and later they were displaced by another group of Arawak Indians the Tanos Tanos occupied all the Greater Antilles and they developed a culture different from the culture of the Arawaks of South America They were the first people that the Spanish met in the Americas

The fourth and last group was the Carib The Carib were also Arawaks but with a different language Even if they used to go to Puerto Rico and the Hispaniola to fight against the Tanos they lived only in the Lesser Antilles when Columbus got to America

At the moment when the Spanish came to the Hispaniola most of the island was occupied by Tanos only in the western tip of the Southern Peninsula there were some small groups of Ciboney In the northeastern part of the island there was a group called Ciguayos and sometimes Macorix with the same culture of the Tanos but a different language It seems that they were Carib that took the Tano culture They were the first Indians that fought against the Europeans

Christopher Columbus arrived to the island on December 5 1492 naming it as La Espaola meaning The Spanish Island When Peter Martyr dAnghiera wrote in latin about this island he wrote Hispaniola meaning Small Spain that was not correct Because the book of Anghiera was translated into English very soon the name Hispaniola is the most used in English speaking countries and in scientific works

For centuries other names were used for the island The most common were Santo Domingo Island and Haiti

Hispaniola was the only island that Columbus visited in all his four travels to the Americas He saw the island for the first time on December 5 1492 but he stayed on his ship during the night the next day he went to land The Spaniards spent the rest of December traveling along the north coast of Haiti on December 12 Columbus took possession of the island in the name of the King and Queen of Spain and named the island as La Espaola

On Christmas Eve December 24 the main ship was badly damaged The next day Christmas Day Columbus gave orders to use the wood of the ship to build a small fort on what is now Mle Saint Nicolas Haiti That fort was named La Navidad and was the first European building on American soil Columbus left 39 men there because there was not space in the other two ships for all the people

From La Navidad they traveled east along the north coast of the island and in Saman they had a small fight with some natives and named the bay as Golfo de las Flechas but now is called Saman Bay From there they went back to Spain

In 1493 Columbus found when he returned in his second trip that La Navidad was destroyed by the Indians and all Spaniards killed Then he went to the east founding the first European city in the American continent near the present city of Puerto Plata he named the city La Isabela in honor of Queen Isabella of Castile The first Catholic mass in America was celebrated at La Isabela on January 6 1494 From La Isabela Columbus sent groups of persons to explore and take control of the island

Because La Isabela was an unhealthy site Bartholomew Columbus brother of Christopher established a new city La Nueva Isabela on the south coast of the island on the left side of the Ozama river Because a hurricane destroyed the city it was built again but on the right side of the river and with the new name of Santo Domingo It is the oldest permanent European city in the Americas

The Tano population of the island decreased very fast because a combination of new diseases like smallpox and abuses by the Spaniards Even if some black slaves were brought from Spain since 1501 the colony began to import African slaves when the colony began to grow sugar cane around 1516 to produce sugar

Spain kept conquering new regions of the Americas and for the Spanish people those new regions were more interesting because there was more gold the population of the island grew very slowly By the early 17th century the island and its smaller neighbors became places often visited by Caribbean pirates In 1606 the king of Spain gave the order that all inhabitants of Hispaniola had to move close to the city of Santo Domingo to avoid interaction with pirates and Protestant people This resulted in French British and Dutch pirates establishing bases on the abandoned north and west coasts of the island

In 1665 the presence of French people on the island had the official approval of the French king Louis XIV and he named Bertrand dOgeron as the governor of the western part of Hispaniola By the Treaty of Ryswick Spain gave the western third of the island to France and kept the eastern part The development of the French Saint Domingue was very fast both in wealth and population and it became the richest colony in the Caribbean The eastern Spanish colony of Santo Domingo remained poor and with a very low population

The Hispaniola has an area of 76480 km There are two countries the Republic of Haiti is in the western part of the island and the Dominican Republic in the eastern part These two countries are separated by an artificial border except in the northern and southern extremes where they are separated by the rivers Dajabn and Pedernales respectively

The island is separated from Cuba by the Windward Passage from Jamaica by the Jamaica Channel and from Puerto Rico by the Mona Channel

The maximun length east to west is 650 km from Cape Engao to Cape Irois The maximum width north to south is 265 km from Cape Isabela to Cape Beata The highest point of the island and of the Caribbean is Duarte Peak in the Dominican Republic with 3087 m the lowest point is in the Enriquillo Lake which is about 46 meters under sea level

There are many smaller islands around the Hispaniola The largest are

The Hispaniola is an island with many mountains and the highest peaks of the West Indies are here The chains of mountains show a direction northwest southeast except in the Southern peninsula where they have a direction west east The mountains are separated by valleys with the same general direction

From north to south the mountain ranges and valleys are

The sources of the longest rivers of Hispaniola are in the mountains of the Cordillera Central  Massif du Nord

The 10 longest rivers of the island are

The largest lake of the Hispaniola and of the West Indies is the Lake Enriquillo It is in the Hoya de Enriquillo with an area of 265 km There are three small islands within the lake It is around 40 meters below sea level and is a saline lake with a higher concentration of salt than the sea water

The second largest lake tang Saumtre is close to Lake Enriquillo but in Haiti in the Cul de Sac It is also a saline lake with an area of around 170 km

Others lakes are Rincn Oviedo Redonda Limn tang de Miragone

Hispaniola has a tropical climate but modified by elevation and the trade winds At sea level the average temperature is 25 C with small changes from one season to another In the highest mountains the temperature in winter can be as low as 0 C

There are two wet seasons April June and September November The most dry period is from December to March

Rainfall varies greatly eastern regions like the Saman Peninsula get an average of over 2000 mm in a year but less than 500 mm fall in the southwest

From June to November hurricanes are frequent and can do much damage in the island

Hispaniola has a total population estimated for July 2007 of 18072 315 inhabitants for a density of 23630 inhabitants per km

In Haiti 95 of the population belongs to the black ethnic group but in the Dominican Republic the black group is the most common with 75 of the population

In the Dominican Republic only Spanish is spoken even if Haitian Creole is gaining importance because the massive immigration from Haiti Both French and Creole are spoken in Haiti and both are official languages

In both countries the main religion is Roman Catholicism Protestant groups are important more in Haiti than in the Dominican Republic

The most important cities in the island are Santo Domingo Port au Prince Santiago Carrefour

Carcharodontosaurus was a giant carnivorous dinosaur of the Cretaceous period 10093 million years ago It was about 135 meters long and had a weight of about six tons Fossils of Carcharodontosaurus were found in Africa

Carcharodontosaurus was closely related to Giganotosaurus they are both carcharodontosaurid carnosaurs Recent discoveries of Carcharodontosaurus put its adult length at 39 44 feet making it the largest carnivorous dinosaur in Africa after Spinosaurus 

Carcharodontosaurus may be smaller than Spinosaurus It was larger than Tyrannosaurus but smaller than its cousin Giganotosaurus from Argentina 

Only two Carcharodontosaurus fossils have been found Two teeth were found in the 1920s Other parts were found in Egypt in the 1930s They were destroyed in bombing raids on Munich in World War II while they were on display 

A skull was uncovered in 1996 its length estimates were larger than the older ones and so was its skull which measured 55 feet 110 meters Its jaws are narrow like those of Giganotosaurus Its huge teeth were up to 7 inches long

Astika and Nastika are technical terms in Hinduism used to classify philosophical schools and persons according to whether they accept the authority of the Vedas as supreme revealed scriptures or not By this definition Nyaya Vaisheshika Samkhya Yoga Purva Mimamsa and Vedanta are classified as astika schools while Charvaka Jainism and Buddhism are considered nastika schools 

In non technical usage the term astika is sometimes loosely translated as theist while nastika is translated as atheist  However this interpretation is distinct from the use of the term in Hindu philosophy Notably even among the astika schools samkhyaand the early mimamsa school do not accept a God while accepting the authority of the Vedas they thus are atheistic astika schools 

The three main heterodox schools of Indian philosophy do not base their beliefs on Vedic authority

The use of the term nastika to describe Buddhism and Jainism in India is explained by Gavin Flood as follows At an early period during the formation of the Upaniads and the rise of Buddhism and Jainism we must envisage a common heritage of meditation and mental discipline practiced by renouncers with varying affiliations to non orthodox and orthodox traditions These schools such as Buddhism and Jainism are understandably regarded as heterodox by orthodox Brahmanism 

The Tantric traditions in Hinduism have both astika and nastika lines as  Banerji writes in Tantra in Bengal

 Tantras are also divided as stika or Vedic and nstika or non Vedic In accordance with the predominance of the deity the stika works are again divided as kta aiva Saura Gapatya and Vaiava 

Capsicum is a genus of plants from the nightshade family Some of these plants are used as spices vegetables or drugs The fruit of Capsicum plants have a variety of names The names vary depending on place and type They are commonly called Chili pepper red or green pepper or just pepper in Britain and the US the large mild form is called bell pepper in the US capsicum in Australian English and Indian English and paprika in some other countries

Capsicums originated in the Americas but are now grown worldwide

The fruit of most species of Capsicum contains capsaicin Capsaicin is a chemical that can produce a strong burning sensation in the mouth of the unaccustomed eater Most mammals find this unpleasant however birds are unaffected The plants developed the secretion of capsaicin to protect the fruit from being eaten by mammals At the same time the bright colors attract birds These birds will spread the seeds The amount of capsaicin in peppers is highly variable and dependent on genetics This means that almost all types of peppers have varied amounts of heat felt by those consuming them The only pepper without capsaicin is the bell pepper Chili peppers are of great importance in Native American medicine Capsaicin is also used in modern Western medicine to stimulate blood circulation or to relieve pain 

Black pepper and Sichuan pepper cause similar burning sensations These are caused they by different substances though piperine and hydroxy alpha sanshool respectively

Capsicum fruits and peppers can be eaten raw or cooked Those used in cooking are generally varieties of the C annuum and C frutescens species though a few others are used as well They are suitable for stuffing with fillings such as cheese meat or rice

They are also frequently used both chopped and raw in salads or cooked in stir fries or other mixed dishes They can be sliced into strips and fried roasted whole or in pieces or chopped and incorporated into salsas or other sauces

They can be preserved by drying or pickling Dried peppers may be reconstituted whole or processed into flakes or powders Pickled or marinated peppers are frequently added to sandwiches or salads Extracts can be made and incorporated into hot sauces

In 2005 a poll of 2000 people revealed the capsicum pepper to be Britains 4th favourite culinary vegetableFactdateFebruary 2007

Many varieties of the same species can be used in many different ways for example C annuum includes the bell pepper variety which is sold in both its immature green state and its red yellow or orange ripe state 

This same species has other varieties as well such as the Anaheim chiles often used for stuffing the dried Ancho chile used to make chili powder the mild to hot Jalapeo and the smoked ripe Jalapeo known as a Chipotle

Most of the capsaicin in a pepper is found in the interior ribs that divide the chambers of the fruit and to which the seeds are attached At the stem end of the pod glands secrete the capsaicin which then spreads throughout but is concentrated on the ribs and seeds The amount varies very significantly by variety and is measured in Scoville heat units ranging from the mild bell pepper to the scorching Habanero chile

The name given to the fruits varies between English speaking countries 

In Australia New Zealand and India heatless species are called capsicums while hot ones are called chillichillies The term bell peppers is rarely used usually in reference to C annuum and other varieties which look like a capsicum or bell but are fairly hot

In the United Kingdom Ireland and Canada the heatless varieties are called peppers sweet peppers or capsicums while the hot ones are chillichillies or chilli peppers 

In the United States the common heatless species is referred to as bell peppers sweet peppers redgreenetc peppers or simply peppers while the hot species are collectively called chilechiles chilichilies or chilichile peppers hot peppers or named as a specific variety In many midwestern regions of the United States the Sweet Bell Pepper is commonly called a mango With the modern advent of fresh tropical fruit importers exposing a wider latitude of individuals to the tropical fruit variety of the Mango this definition is becoming archaic However many menus still call a stuffed Bell Pepper a Mango

The name pepper came into use because the plants were hot in the same sense as the condiment black pepper Piper nigrum But there is no botanical relationship with this plant nor with Sichuan Pepper

In Spanish speaking countries there are many different names for each variety and preparation In Mexico the term chile is used Several other countries such as Chile whose name is unrelated Per and Argentina use aj In Spain heatless varieties are called pimiento and hot varieties guindilla

In Indian English the word capsicum is used exclusively for bell pepper All other varieties of chili peppers are called chili In northern India and Pakistan bell pepper is also commonly called Shimla Mirch in the native languages Shimla incidentally is a popular hill station in India 

In Israel capsicum is commonly called pilpel meaning pepper in Hebrew

You can test how hot a hot pepper can be by using the Scoville scale

Silicon Valley includes the northern part of Santa Clara Valley and adjacent communities in the southern parts of the San Francisco Peninsula and East Bay It reaches from Menlo Park and the FremontNewark area in the East Bay down to San Jose 

The term Silicon Valley was coined by journalist Don Hoefler in 1971 He used it as the title of a series of articles Silicon Valley USA in a weekly trade newspaper Electronic News which started with the January 11 1971 issue Valley refers to the Santa Clara Valley located at the southern end of San Francisco Bay while Silicon refers to the high concentration of semiconductor and computer related industries in the area These and similar technology firms slowly replaced the orchards which gave the area its initial nickname the Valley of Hearts Delight

The San Francisco Bay Area had long been a major site of US Navy work as well as the site of the Navys large research airfield at Moffett Field A number of technology firms had set up shop in the area around Moffett to serve the Navy When the Navy moved most of its West Coast operations to San Diego NASA took over portions of Moffett for aeronautics research Many of the original companies stayed while new ones moved in The immediate area was soon filled with aerospace firms

However there was almost no civilian high tech industry in the area Although there were a number of excellent schools in the area graduating students almost always moved east or south to find work This was particularly annoying to Frederick Terman a professor at Stanford University He decided that a vast area of unused Stanford land was perfect for real estate development and set up a program to encourage students to stay in the area by enabling them to easily find venture capital One of the major success stories of the program was that it convinced two students to stay in the area William Hewlett and David Packard In 1939 they founded Hewlett Packard in Packards garage which would go on to be one of the first high tech firms in the area that was not directly related to NASA or the US Navy

A signal in biology is any kind of coded message sent from one organism to another or from one place in an organism to another place

In biology especially in electrophysiology a signal or biopotential is an electric quantity that is caused by chemical reactions of charged ions Biological signals can also be seen as an example of signal

Another use of the term lies in the transfer of information between and within cells as in signal transduction 

Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoyne Cecil 3rd Marquess of Salisbury was a Prime Minister of the United Kingdom He was known as Lord Robert Cecil before 1865 and as Viscount Cranborne from 1865 until 1868

Salisbury resigned on July 11 1902 He died on August 22 1903

Electrophysiology is the study of the electrical properties of biological cells and tissues It involves measurements of voltage change or electrical current flow on a wide variety of scales from single ion channel proteins to whole tissues like the heart In neuroscience it includes measurements of the electrical activity of neurons and particularly action potential activity

Classical electrophysiology involves placing electrodes into various preparations of biologic tissue The principle types of electrodes are 1 simple solid conductors such as discs and needles 2 tracings on a printed circuit boards and 3 hollow tubes filled with an electrolyte such as glass pippettes The principal preparations include 1 living organisms 2 excised tissue 3 dissociated cells from excised tissue 4 artificially grown cells or tissues or 5 hybrids of the above

If an electrode is small enough in diameter then the electrophysiologist may choose to insert the tip into a single cell 

Many particular electrophysiological readings have specific names

Ion channels are pore forming proteins that help to establish and control the small voltage gradient across the plasma membrane of all living cells by allowing the flow of ions down their electrochemical gradient They are present in the membranes that surround all biological cells

An ion channel is an integral membrane protein or more typically an assembly of several proteins

The 2003 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Peter Agre and Roderick MacKinnon for their discovery of ion channels

The United States Census Bureau is a part of the United States government that is responsible for the United States Census The Census Bureau is a part of the United States Department of Commerce 

The Constitution of the United States says that the population must be counted at least once every ten years This is done to calculate how many Federal Representatives in Congress each state should have The Census Bureau is charge of doing this It collects statistics about the nation its people and its economy The Census Bureaus legal authority is listed in Title 13 of the United States Code The first census bureau was in 1790

Since 1903 The Bureau of the Census has been the census taking organization of the United States government The Bureau is led by a Director who is helped by a Deputy Director and associate directors

The Census Bureau also use real time extrapolation of information on population birth and death to give their estimates of the number of people in the United States and the world

Signal processing is the analysis interpretation and manipulation of signals Signals of interest include sound images biological signals such as ECG radar signals and many others

Processing of such signals includes storage and reconstruction separation of information from noise compression and feature extraction

For analog signals signal processing may involve the amplification and filtering of audio signals for audio equipment or the modulation and demodulation of signals for telecommunication For digital signals signal processing may involve the compression error checking and error detection of digital signals

Signal processing is the analysis interpretation and manipulation of acquired signals Acquired signals must to be processed depending on the purpose of measurement a method of measurement and a property of acquired signals

When signals are processed statistics is used because its essential to know a distribution of data and represent data by numerical formulas In other words to study signal processing its demanded to study statistics

In most cases signals are regular as it is acquired from electric instruments like telemeter or communications equipment etc But there are also many accidentally occurred irregular signals which make it difficult to find formulas that fit exactly Here the irregular means its hard to predict the result which is not yet occurred When irregular signals are acquired photon is necessary so it is measured and caculated

Hello there seems to be agreement that using a second person is a bad thing to do in an article This is partly so because it makes assumptions on the part of the person reading it In the how to write simple English articles an excample is given that a passive form canshould be replaced by a first person Personally I think this is problematic because it again makes an assumption about the reader This lead to a short discussion between UserRimshot and myself the user replaced the passive as directed on the page Information Both of us have again reached agreement The question is now how the community sees this practice  Eptalon 1234 2 February 2007

Rondnia is a state in Brazil It is located in the north western part of the country To the west is the state of Acre to the north is the state of Amazonas in the east is Mato Grosso and in the south is Bolivia Its capital is Porto Velho The state was named after Candido Rondon

Other cities include

The state has a part that is covered mostly by jungle of the Amazon Rainforest About three fifths of the state has had the jungle removed since the 1970s Most of the people living in the state now live in urban areas It is a main exporter of wood The state also makes both coffee and cocoa The breeding of cattle is also important here

The flag was designed by Silvio Carvalho Feitosa It was made the flag of the state on December 22 1981 The flag uses the same colors as the flag of Brazil The big star in the middle of the flag is a symbol for the new state The star is shown rising into the blue sky that is stretching over Brazil

The Akuntsu tribe is one of the tribes of Rondnia They are one of the indigenous peoples of Brazil They were first contacted in only 1995 At that time there were only seven people in the tribe As of 2006 their population was down to six They live in the Igarape Omere region to the southwest of Rondnia The tribe consists of chief Kunibu Baba Pupak Ururu and three women with ages from 23 35 The seventh member of the tribe died in 1995 The only child born after that died in 2000 in a storm With his death the only hope of the tribe not becoming extinct lessened

The 26 cantons of Switzerland are the states of the country of Switzerland

Switzerland is divided into 26 different areas Each area is called a canton A canton is like a state in the United States

In the past each canton had its own army and money This changed in 1848 when Switzerland changed to the structure it has now

The cantons Uri Schwyz Unterwalden are called Urkantone An Urkanton is a canton that existed since the foundation of Switzerland in 1291 With time other cantons joined Switzerland Jura is the newest canton in Switzerland since 1978 In that year it split from the canton of Berne after some rioting

The cantons of Basel Stadt Basel Landschaft Appenzell Innerrhoden Appenzell Ausserrhoden Obwalden and Nidwalden are different from the others in one way For historical reasons their voting is counted differently in national elections Other than that they are the same as the others

In Switzerland the individual municipalities and cantons are very free Usually there is a Swiss law Very often this states general things and says that the cantons must follow this rule The cantons then makes detailed rules each in the way it sees fit Sometimes this leads to strange situations There are 26 different schooling systems

Drug abuse is an offense at the federal level Punishment is usually 1 to 3 years but can also only be a fine The problem is Consumption itself is not punishable Also in light cases the police can say that there will be no fine This has led to the fact that in each canton this law is applied differently In one canton smoking a joint will mean a fine in another it can mean a prison term

The word for that is called federalism That means that each canton has its own government So all cantons have their own constitution The constitution is the highest law in a state

The cantons are listed in the order given in the federal constitution 

Notes 1 As of 31 December 2001 National Statistics 2 km 3 per km based on 2000 population 4 seat of government and parliament the seat of the judicial authorities is Trogen

The two letter abbreviations for Swiss cantons are widely used eg on car license plates and in the ISO 3166 2 codes

The nervous system is a system in the body which sends signals around the body It lets people and animals respond to what is around them The central nervous system is the brain the spinal cord and nerves It is present in most animals It is there to coordinate movement to process the input of the senses and to make the animals act a certain way It is made up of neurons nerve cells among other things The structure of the system includes the brain and spinal cord which together are called the central nervous system The brain has billions of nerve cells to help think walk and breathe The nervous system can react in 1100 seconds to stimulusThe stimulus is the messenger that sends letters to the part of your body that is experiencing or has experienced danger or surpriseIt also sends these signals to your brain for help to think of other ideas to protect andor absorb the danger andor surprise in that area of the body

Alexandre Dumas fils was the son of Alexandre Dumas pre Like his father Alexandre Dumas fils was a celebrated author and playwright

Alexandre Dumas fils was born in Paris France the illegitimate child of Marie Catherine Labay a dressmaker and novelist Alexandre Dumas In 1831 his father legally recognized him and ensured the young Dumas received the best education possible at the Institution Goubaux and the College Bourbon At that time the law allowed the elder Dumas to take the child away from his mother Her agony inspired Dumas fils to write about tragic female characters In almost all of his writings he emphasized the moral purpose of literature and in his 1858 play Le fils naturel he wrote about the belief that if a man fathers an illegitimate child then he has an obligation to legitimize the child and marry the woman

Dumas paternal great grandparents were a white French nobleman and a young black Haitian woman In the boarding schools Dumas fils was constantly taunted by his classmates These issues all profoundly influenced his thoughts behaviour and writing

In 1844 Dumas fils moved to Saint Germain en Laye to live with his father There he met Marie Duplessis a young courtesan who would be the inspiration for his romantic novel La dame aux camlias Adapted into a play it was titled in English as Camille and is the basis for Verdis 1853 opera La Traviata Although he admitted that he had done the adaptation because he needed the money he had a huge success with the play With this work began the playwriting career of Dumas fils which not only eclipsed that of his father during his lifetime but also dominated the serious French stage for most of the second half of the nineteenth century After this he virtually abandoned the novel

In 1864 Dumas married Nadeja Naryschkine with whom he had a daughter After Naryschkines death he married Henriette Regnier

In 1874 he was admitted to the Academie francaise and in 1894 he was awarded the Lgion dHonneur

Alexandre Dumas the son died at Marly le Roi Yvelines on November 27 1895 and was interred in the Cimetire de Montmartre in Paris It was perhaps coincidentally only some 100 metres away from Marie Duplessis

A siege is what happens when a group of people surround another group of people and stop them from escaping or getting food and water Without supplies those inside will have to surrender at some point There were many sieges in Medieval times normally at a castle or town Sieges took a long time perhaps months but were almost always successful unless another group of people came to rescue those inside by fighting the besiegers

A hull can be

In mathematics

There are several people named Hull

There is also

The River Hull is a river in Yorkshire in the north of England

It has its source in the Yorkshire Wolds It joins the Humber estuary in the centre of Kingston upon Hull

The river separates the industrial area of the city and several opening bridges have been constructed These continue to cause traffic delays during high tides though river traffic is not so heavy any more in recent years

These are the bridges in the Hull area 

A hull is the body of a ship or boat It is a central concept in floating vessels as it provides the buoyancy that keeps the vessel from sinking 

Nearly all watercraft from small boats to the largest ships have a general form that is necessary for stability and efficient propulsion which includes

Archimedes a Greek doctor inventor and mathematician made the science of hydrostatics the study of liquids and pressure The Archimedes principle says that the force holding up an object that is inside a liquid in part or totally So a ship actually does sink until it moves an amount of water that is the same weight of the weight of the ship The weight must be over a wide area to work This explains why ships and boats float An objects weight pulls down in the direction of gravity but the waters buoyant force pushes it up Because these forces counteract each other the object seems to lose weight NASA uses this principle to prepare their astronauts for the weightlessness of space so they had the astronauts work on parts of the space ship inside water tanks 25 feet deep

Bow is the frontmost part of the hull

Stern is the rear most part of the hull

Portside is the left side of the boat when facing the Bow

Starboard is the right side of the boat when facing the Bow

Waterline is an imaginary line circumscribing the hull that matches the surface of the water when the hull is not moving

Midships is the midpoint of the LWL  It is half way from the forwardmost point on the waterline to the rear most point on the waterline

Baseline an imaginary reference line used to measure vertical distances from It is usually located at the bottom of the hull

Hull forms are defined as follows 

In physics buoyancy is a force on an object making that object rise or move upward It comes from the Spanish word for float boyar Buoyancy is made by the difference in pressure put on the object by the Fluid or air that the object is in

The net upward buoyancy force is equal to the magnitude of the weight of fluid that is displaced by the body This force enables the object to float or at least to seem lighter Buoyancy is important for many vehicles such as boats ships balloons and blimps 

If the object has exactly the same density as the liquid then its buoyancy is the same as its weight It will not sink or float

An object with a higher average density than the fluid has less buoyancy than weight and it will sink 

A ship floats because although it is made of steel which is more dense than water it encloses a volume of air and the resulting shape has an average density less than that of the water

The Asura are a group of supernatural creatures in Hinduism and Buddhism

In todays Hinduism the Asuras are demons But this was not always that way The idea of the Asuras is very very old from long before the time people learned how to read and write The Asuras only became demons much time had passed Buddhism also has Asuras These are from Hinduism but have also changed a lot in their own way

Some of the Asuras are very important and have been worshiped for thousands of years The most important of these are Varuna and Mitra Varuna is the god of the ocean which in olden times was thought to be flowing under the earth So Varuna came to be seen as god of the underworld In ancient times water was thought to be where wisdom came from So Varuna is considered very wise and he gives his wisdom to those who honor him Varunas closest companion is Mitra Mitra mostly means friend in Hinduism but it originally meant promise And so Mitra is the god of friendships and promises He protects people who honor the truth and punishes those who tell lies The Mi in Mitra means to tie tightly Friendship and promises tie people to one another

In Hinduism the Asura are a group of creatures looking for more power sometimes called demons They went against the devas The devas and asuras are the children of Kashyapa 

Hinduism has many stories of Asuras and Devas fighting each other Mostly they fight about who will get the best prayers from the worshipers

In Hinduism the Asuras are said to be beings of moral and social things Like truth and marriage The Daevas are said to be beings of natural things Like the sun and the rain In Hinduism the Asuras are said to be older And the daevas are said to be younger There are very many Asuras and Daevas Two hundred years ago someone counted them and said there were over 2000 Daevas and Asuras So naturally not all Asuras are very important But some names have been forgotten since then and others have been added This is why Hinduism is called a living religion It is changing all the time 

The Asuras are partly  but not completely  demonic in Buddhism Buddhism takes the basic idea from Hinduism

Mostly the Asuras of Buddhism represent some mental state of humans that is not nice For example anger or pride or violence There are many different kinds of Asuras They are always angry with everyone and are always fighting Their leaders are called the Asurendra which means Lord of Asuras

The Asuras are almost human in their emotions On the Buddhist scale of supernatural beings the Asuras are almost at the bottom

Buddhism is very popular in the far east So many of the Asuras also have Japanese Chinese and Korean names

The Vedas are the most holy books of the Indian religions especially of Hinduism There are four Vedas and they are all very very old The oldest of the Vedas is called the RigVeda and it is more than 3000 years old 

In the RigVeda the Asuras are not yet demons At that time the Asuras and the Devas were both still groups of gods In fact many of the figures of the RigVeda are both asuras and daevas This is because at that time the two words were not yet names of groups They were just names of characteristics Asura means life and so the gods who were called asuras were thought to give life And the daevas were shining This is the original meaning of the names In later books they became different 

In the RigVeda many of the devas are called asuras and many of the asuras are called devas Sometimes they are also called both at the same time Like daevic asuras or asuric devas The ic makes those words a part of the other word There are some beings who are both ahuric daevas and daevic ahuras This shows that there was no big difference between ahura and daeva in the RigVeda

The forefathers of the people who wrote the Vedas spoke Sanskrit Sanskrit is the source of many Indian languages The stories in the Rig Veda are seen in the books of various North Indian peoples and also in the books of some Iranian peoples like the Zoroastrians

One of the books of the Iranian peoples is called the Avesta It is not really one book but a collection of many books but together they are called the Avesta The Avesta is the holy book of Zoroastrianism The language of the Avesta is very similar to the language of the RigVeda The Avesta also has asuras and devas But in Iran they are written as ahura and daeva

The old part of the Avesta is almost as old as the RigVeda In this old part of the Avesta the ahuras and the daevas are almost like they are in the RigVeda In both books they are groups of supernatural beings But they are very different in character

Some time after the RigVeda was written stories were told about the asuras and devas that made them not friends any more A similar thing also happened in the Avesta Only that the two groups had been switched The Asuras became demons in regions where North Indian languages were spoken and the Daevas became demons in regions where Iranian languages were spoken

It is not known for sure why this happened It was a very very long time ago 

One possible reason why the Asuras became demons in India is this Some time after the RigVeda was written Indians started to think that asura means a sura which means not a hero So maybe that way the asuras got a bad name 

One possible reason why the Daevas became demons in Iran is this At about the same time as the Indians were writing the last part of the RigVeda a very thoughtful man named Zoroaster appeared in Iran He thought and thought a lot about why there was goodness and badness in the world Finally he told everyone what he had been thinking about And one of those things was that Daevas were not to be trusted because they could not tell the difference between truth and lies After some time Zoroaster became very popular for his ideas And so with time the Daevas became demons in Iran 

In both cases the one side did not know what the other side was thinking So in India only the Asuras became demons And in Iran only the Daevas became demons

Many many centuries before the RigVeda and before Zoroaster a name that sounds like Asura was the proper name of a very mighty god Some scholars say his name was Ansu but this is not sure So that is why they write the name as Ansu That means it is not sure Ansu was the god of life from which the name asura and ahura comes We know that this god existed because far far away in Northern Europe there was also a god named Aesir who was also a giver of life It sometimes can happen that a similar name appears in two or three places But it is very rare that the same name with the same function appears So that is why Asura and Ahura and Aesir must be all come from Ansu And we know that such a god must have been very powerful because he was very popular for so very long

Although the Asuras and the Ahuras are related they should not be mixed up This is not only because their names are slightly different It is also because they are very different But the most important thing is that they are from different cultures Even if they came from the same place that was very long ago After such a long much time people have very different ideas about them

ICBM is an acronym It stands for Intercontinental Ballistic Missile It is a missile that can travel such distances so it can be used from one continent to another The missile can then carry a bomb This can be a conventional or nuclear warhead Today most of the time it will be a nuclear warhead

When talking about geography the elevation of a certain point is how high it is compared to some reference point Very often the reference point is mean sea level the level of the ocean midway between high and low tide on an average day 

Sometimes elevation is measured against the center of the earth The problem there is that the earth does not really look like a ball it looks more like a potato This means that while still at mean sea level some points are father away from the center of the earth than others That way the peak of Chimborazo a volcano in Ecuador is farther away from the center of the earth than the peak of Mount Everest Yet Mount Everest is higher above sea level

In statistics a sample is part of a population The sample is carefully chosen It should represent the whole population fairly without bias The reason samples are needed is that populations may be so large that counting all the individuals may not be possible or practical

Therefore solving a problem in statistics usually starts with sampling Sampling is about choosing which data to take for later analysis As an example suppose the pollution of a lake should be analysed for a study Depending on where the samples of water were taken the studies can have different results As a general rule samples need to be random This means the chance or probability of selecting one individual is the same as the chance of selecting any other individual

In practice random samples are always taken by means of a well defined procedure A procedure is a set of rules a sequence of steps written down on paper and followed to the letter Even so some bias may remain in the sample Consider the problem of designing a sample to predict the result of an election poll All known methods have their problems and the results of an election are often different from predictions based on a sample If you collect opinions by using telephones or by meeting people in the street the sample always has bias Therefore in cases like this a completely neutral sample is never possible In such cases a statistician will think about how to measure the amount of bias and there are ways to estimate this

A similar situation occurs when scientists measure a physical property say the weight of a piece of metal or the speed of light If we weigh an object with sensitive equipment we will get minutely different results No system of measurement is ever perfect We get a series of estimates each one being a measurement These are samples with a certain degree of error Statistics is designed to describe error and carry out analysis on this kind of data

If a population has obvious sub populations then each of the sub populations needs to be sampled This is called stratified sampling 

Suppose an experiment set out to sample the incomes of adults Obviously the incomes of college graduates might differ from that of non graduates Now suppose the number of male graduates was 30 of the total male adults Then you would arrange for 30 of the total sample to be male graduates picked at random and 70 of the total to be male non graduates Repeat the process for females because the percentage of female graduates is different from males That gives a sample of the adult population stratified by sex and college education The next step would be to divide each of your sub populations by age groups because graduates might gain more income relative to non graduates in middle age 

Another type of stratified sample deals with variation Here larger samples are taken from the more variable sub populations so that the summary statistics such as the means and standard deviations are more reliable

Lexington is the second largest city in Kentucky with around 268080 people living there It is called the Horse Capital of the World 

Lexington was first named by a party of Virginians who camped here in June 1775 after they heard the news about the Battle of Lexington Massachusetts in April of that year starting the American Revolution against the British government A fort was begun at the same spot in 1779 and by 1782 there was a town here known as Lexington Virginia This is because Kentucky was still part of Virginia then and was not made into a state of its own until 1792

Redhead is a person with red or reddish tinted hair Approximately 1 to 2 of the worlds population has red hair

Red hair is made by genes The gene for red hair is recessive meaning to be weaker than other genes like the brown hair gene for example Because of this in order to have natural red hair a person needs to have red haired ancestors present on both the maternal and paternal side of the family 

Red hair is said to be most common close to the Northern European coasts and islands of the Atlantic Ocean in particular the British Isles

Scotland has the most red headed people in Europe with 13 of Europes redheads living there Ireland has the second highest amount of redheads in Europe with 10 of Europes redheads living there despite Ireland being the country most associated with red hair 

Depite all this the US has the largest number of redheads living there in the world

In some countries particularly the British Isles despite the high proportion of redheads there redheads are sometimes given rude names such as carrot top and ginga and are in some cases heavily ridiculed by their peers In some extreme cases people have been harassed for having red hair

The West Midlands is an official Region of England covering the western half of the Midlands 

The official region contains the large conurbation that includes Birmingham and Wolverhampton and includes also the mainly rural shire counties of Herefordshire Shropshire Staffordshire Warwickshire and Worcestershire 

There is some confusion in the use of the term West Midlands as the name is also used for the much smaller West Midlands county and is still used by various organisations within that area such as West Midlands Police and West Midlands Fire Service

The highest point in the region is Black Mountain at 703 metres

Major towns and cities in the West Midlands region include

The official representative body of the region is the West Midlands Regional Assembly which has limited administrative functions such as regional planning and economic development The assembly is not an elected body but is made up of members appointed from local councils across the region and members from regional interest groups such as business and environmental groups and trade unions

The official region consists of the following subdivisions

Key shire county  metropolitan county 

Coal mining used to be the main industry of the Black Country Nationally famous companies in the West Midlands are Cadburys in Bournville Birmingham the brewing companies such as Coors Brewers in Burton on Trent as well as Marmite JCB is based in Staffordshire

Midlands could be in general the central region of any territory In Britain and Ireland the term is reseved for the middle in the North South direction

In the United Kingdom Scotland and England both have midland areas that are famous enough to be called the Midlands In Wales the term for the central region is Mid Wales

The rest of this article deals with the English Region known simply as The Midlands which is more or less the territory of the early medieval kingdom of Mercia

The area lies between Southern England Northern England East Anglia and Wales and includes the counties of Derbyshire Herefordshire Leicestershire Lincolnshire Northamptonshire Nottinghamshire Rutland Shropshire Staffordshire Warwickshire the West Midlands and Worcestershire The 2001 census also included Norfolk Suffolk and Cambridgeshire in the Midlands but these are not generally considered to be part of the Midlands but East Anglia

There are two administrative regions of England in the Midlands West Midlands and East Midlands Taken together these regions do not fully cover the traditional Midlands

The midland status of Cheshire is often debated South Cheshire has strong links with North Staffordshire and North Cheshire with Merseyside and Manchester Officially Cheshire is now part of the North West region

The largest Midlands conurbation which includes the cities of Birmingham and Wolverhampton is approximately covered by a metropolitan county also called the West Midlands Thus there are two West Midlands a Region and a County

Parts of the East Midlands are also densely populated particularly the triangle formed by the cities of Leicester Nottingham and Derby

The South Midlands have an own government for development They include Northamptonshire and Bedfordshire with northern Buckinghamshire In other context Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire are not considered part of the Midlands They are in the administrative regions of the South East and the East of England

There are several regions in the world known as the Midlands These include

The volt is the SI derived unit of electric potential difference or electromotive force It is named in honor of the Italian physicist Alessandro Volta who invented the voltaic pile the first chemical battery 

In the hydraulic analogy sometimes used to explain electric circuits by comparing them to water filled pipes voltage is likened to water pressure  it determines how fast the electrons will travel through the circuit Current in the same analogy is a measure of the volume of water that flows past a given point the rate of which is determined by the voltage and the total output measured in watts The equation that brings all three components together is volts amperes watts

Nominal voltages of familiar sources

In 1800 as the result of a professional disagreement over the galvanic response advocated by Luigi Galvani Alessandro Volta developed the so called Voltaic pile a forerunner of the battery which produced a steady electric current Volta had determined that the most effective pair of dissimilar metals to produce electricity was zinc and silver In the 1880s the International Electrical Congress now the International Electrotechnical Commission approved the volt for electromotive force The volt was defined as the potential difference across a conductor when a current of one ampere dissipates one watt of power

A music competition is an event in which people compete for prizes by performing music Music competitions can be for solo performers or for small or large groups such as orchestras bands or choirs Some competitions are for young people who are starting to make a professional career in music Other music competitions may be for amateurs which means that professional musicians are not allowed to compete 

The person who decides who is the winner is called the adjudicator Some big festivals have a team of several adjudicators who decide together on the winner

The British and International Federation of Music Festivals organizes music competitions for amateurs in many parts of the British Isles Children and adults can take part competing in classes for music speech and drama and dance Competitions like these are often called festivals because the main reason for taking part is to enjoy performing rather than just to win

There are many big international competitions for some of the most talented musicians from all over the world Winning a big competition can help a young musician to start a successful career Some people think it can also be a bad thing to win a big competition especially for musicians who are still very young It may make them a star for a short time but they still have to get better and mature as a musician and a person

Some of the most famous international music competitions are

In popular music one of the great European events is the Eurovision Song Contest

An adjudicator is someone who decides on a winner at a competition for music or theatre The adjudicator will always be somebody who has a lot of experience in what he is adjudicating In big international festivals a team of several adjudicators may decide together on the winners In amateur competitions the adjudicator may also talk to the competitors after they have performed and give them advice Competitors are often given first second and third prizes

In Law an adjudicator is someone who decides who is right when a group of people cannot agree on something

Eduard Hanslick was a famous music critic He wrote about music that was being composed in his time He liked the music of composers like Brahms and Schumann but hated the music of Wagner and Liszt Their music sounded too modern for his taste

He was born into a German speaking family His father was a music teacher When he was 18 Hanslick went to study music with Tomek one of Pragues most important musicians He also studied law at Prague University He did not study music at university but he knew a lot about music and played the piano very well He started writing music reviews For many years he wrote reviews in a paper called Neue freie Presse He became professor of history and music at the University of Vienna and was an adjudicator at lots of music festivals His most famous book was called Vom Musikalisch Schnen

Hanslicks tastes were conservative We remember him today for writing good things about Brahms and bad things about Wagner A lot of musicians took sides on this matter It is sometimes called The War of the Romantics Musicians had long arguments in the music journals about which kind of music was better

Although in some ways he was narrow minded he had a lot of influence on music His books on music are very interesting showing great knowledge He knew most of the great musicians of his day

Hassium is a chemical element It has been named unniloctium and eka osmium It has the symbol Hs It has the atomic number 108 It is a transuranium element 

Hassium is a radioactive element that does not exist in nature It has to be made

Hassium oxidises like osmium the element above it in the periodic table Hassium oxidises to hassium tetroxide It is less volatile than osmium tetroxide

Hassium was first made in 1984 It was made at the Gesellschaft fr Schwerionenforschung in Darmstadt Germany The team that made darmstadtium was led by Peter Armbruster and Gottfried Mnzenberg 

The element was named from the Latin name for the German state of Hessen Hessen is the state that the Gesellschaft fr Schwerionenforschung is in 

Before it was named Hassium scientists could not decide what the name should be There was an element naming controversy The temporary IUPAC systematic element name was unniloctium The symbol with the name was Uno In 1994 a committee of IUPAC recommended that element 108 be named hahnium The name hassium was adopted internationally in 1997

Isotope 270 of Hassium was found in December 2006 An international team of scientists led by the Technical University of Munich found it It is a doubly magic isotope It has an long half life of 22 seconds Scientists had thought that heavy and stable isotopes should exist Some theories said Hassium 270 may be part of an island of stability

European colonies began with the Spanish settlement of Santa Catarina island in 1542 The Portuguese took control in 1675 The captaincy of Santa Catarina was created in 1738 Large numbers of European immigrants especially from Germany began arriving in the early 19th century Immigrants from Italy Poland Russia Ukraine Japan and other parts of Europe later came This led to many small family held farms in the state 

In late March 2004 the state was hit by the first ever hurricane recorded in the South Atlantic Because there is no naming system for such an event in Brazil Brazilian meteorologists called it Catarina after the state

Santa Catarina is one of the Brazilian states that shows the most signs of recent European colonization Most of the population are descendants of European settlers

The Portuguese started arriving in the 1750s The came mainly from the Azores islands and colonized the coast In the late 18th century half of Santa Catarinas population was Portuguese born These Portuguese created many important towns of the State such as Florianpolis the capital

Germans started arriving in 1828 They were peasants that came to Brazil to get their own lands They did this since Germany had many people and many people had no lands to work German immigration was very low until the 1850s when many Germans started arriving in Southern Brazil To create more German colonization in Southern Brazil the Brazilian government created many German colonies Many of these German colonies became big towns such as Blumenau and Joinville the largest city in Santa Catarina 

Germans had kept to themselves in these communities for decades They did not have much contact with other people of Brazil For generations they were able to speak German and keep their German traditions in Brazil This changed in the 1930s when Brazil declared war against Germany in 1942 The German immigrants learned Portuguese and followed a Brazilian way of life

Nowadays the German influence in the State of Santa Catarina is still very strong Many towns still have many parts of the German culture For example Pomerode is a small town where 90 of the people are German Brazilian Most of the people speak German fluently Another example is the Oktoberfest of Blumenau and many other towns in the region The architecture and food also show German influence

Italian settlers started arriving in Santa Catarina in 1875 They came in large numbers until the 1910s They were peasants from Northern Italy They created Italian colonies close to the coast In the beginning the Italian settlement had failed This was because many Italians died of tropical diseases or left the colonies to find better conditions However in southern Santa Catarina they found cooler weather and better lands and the colonies did very well Many Italians worked in the coal industry 

A trail is a pedestrian path or road mainly used for walking but often also for cycling cross country skiing or other activities Some trails are off limits to everyone other than hikers and few trails allow motorized vehicles 

In the United States the word footpath is also used to mean a trail however in Australian English New Zealand English Indian English and Irish English this word means sidewalk or pavement

In Australia the word track can be used interchangeably with trail and can refer to anything from a dirt road to a pedestrian walkway The term trail gained popularity during World War II when many servicemen from the United States were stationed in Australia which probably influenced its being adopted by elements of the Australian media at the time In New Zealand the word track is used almost exclusively except in reference to cross country skiing where trail is used

Trail use has become very popular for a wide variety of users Some trails are meant as nature trails and are used by people learning about the natural world Many trails are day trails what means that they are generally used by people out for a short hike less than a day Some trails are backpacking trails or long distance trails and are used by both day hikers and by backpackers Some of the trails are over a thousand miles long and may be hiked in sections by backpackers or completed in one trip by dedicated hikers Some trails are specifically used by other outdoor enthusiasts to gain access to another feature such as good climbing sites Many runners also favor running on trails rather than pavement as giving a more vigorous work out and better developing agility skills as well as providing a more pleasant exercise environment See trail running

Stairway is another way to ascend higher slopes Stairway trails are usually for walking only The stairs are constructed using cuts in dirt rocks or concrete Popular stair way trails include Stairway Trails in Bernal Heights East  San Francisco Stairs at many hill top Hindu temple used during Pilgrimage Machu Picchu

Recent decades have seen an explosion of interest in cycling both street type and off road type A common term for these facilities is simply bike trail These trails may be built to a different set of standards than foot trails requiring more stable harder surfaces less strenuous grades longer sight visibility and less sharp changes in direction On the other hand the cross slope of a bike trail may be significantly greater than a foot trail and the actual treadway may be narrower in some cases

Horseback riding has continued to be a popular activity for many trail users Again horse trails must be built to different standards than other trails Sight distance is an important issue with horse trails as is overhead and side clearance While trail surface types are a relatively unimportant issue with hikers they may be an important issue with horses 

In cross country skiing a trail refers to the parallel grooves cut into the snow one for each ski

Motorized trail use also remains very popular with some people Such terms as ORV four wheeling all terrain vehicle and others actually have highly specific meanings 

The Pardoners Prologue and Tale is a story that is a part of the The Canterbury Tales by English writer Geoffrey Chaucer

The Pardoner went on a journey to the town of Canterbury from Rouncivalle with his friend the Summoner

The Pardoner had hair as yellow as wax which fell on his head smoothly wisp by wisp He has piercing black eyes and his face was as smooth as he had just shaved He had a thin and feeble voice yet he was hardly an old spiritual man

Although the Pardoner was a priest he lived a life that was far from the word of Jesus Christ He often broke many of the seven deadly sins including greed gluttony and pride He earned a living through preaching and selling fake relics to his supporters He lies to people and promises them salvation and prosperity for a price He has even taken money from a poor widow with starving children in order buy himself more luxuries The tale describes him getting money from the crowd as he cared more about money than a holy life

The host asks the Pardoner to tell a happy story after the sad tale that the Franklin told The other people object to this and hope that he will tell a tale that is rich in morals 

He starts his tale by talking about three young men who like him do sinful things like drink alcohol and sleep with prostitutes The Pardoner goes on to talk about the sins of the men in detail especially gambling drunkenness and gluttony These three young men are rioters from the town of Flanders 

One night the three drunken men were at a tavern when they saw a corpse being carried to a grave They ask who had died and find out it is one of their friends who has been killed by a murderous thief named Death The three men plan to avenge their friends death and kill Death themselves 

On their way to find Death they see an old man that says Death will not take him even in his old age and suffering The man says that he had left Death under an oak tree and that he was sure to still be there They run to the tree and instead of seeing Death they see lots of gold under the tree They want to bring the gold back under the cover of night so that nobody will think they have stolen it They are weak and need drinks so they send the youngest of them to the town 

The remaining two come up with a plan to kill the third when he comes back so that the money could be split between only the two of them The third man has the same thoughts as the other two and wants to have all of the money for himself He gets poison and puts it in their drinks and goes back to the tree At the tree the two men jump out and kill the third They then drink in celebration and die from the poison 

In the end gold was the Death that the old man said was beneath the tree

The love of money is the root of all evil

Irony  The irony in this story has to do with the person telling it

Anton Bruckner born Ansfelden Austria 4 September 1824 died Vienna 11 October 1896 was an Austrian composer He is especially famous for his nine symphonies They are all very long and are written in a late Romantic style for a large orchestra He was also an organist and teacher

Bruckners father was an organist and schoolmaster in a small village in Austria By the age of four Bruckner was showing musical talent He played hymn tunes on a tiny violin and then found the chords to go with them on the family spinet When he was ten he sometimes played the village organ for services After his fathers death in 1837 he became a choirboy at the monastery school of St Florian where in 1848 he became the organist of the abbey church He started composing at this time and wrote a Requiem in d minor He liked the music of Schubert and Mendelssohn and they influenced the way he composed

Although he was happy at St Florian his friends told him he ought to look for a better job They made him apply for the job of organist at the cathedral of Linz which he got easily Meanwhile he was trying to learn more about harmony and took a course with a famous teacher Simon Sechter He then took a course in orchestration with the teacher Otto Kitzler He became very interested in the music of Romantic composers like Liszt Berlioz and especially Wagner In 1864 he wrote a Mass in d minor for chorus and orchestra which clearly showed Wagners influence In 1866 he finished the first of his nine symphonies He also wrote some very beautiful motets which are among the best music of the 19th century written for the Roman Catholic church

In 1866 he spent three months in a sanatorium after a nervous collapse During his later years he often suffered from depression

In 1868 he became professor at the Vienna Conservatoire where he taught harmony and counterpoint This was an excellent job The last 25 years of his life he spent his time teaching and composing his symphonies He also travelled and gave organ recitals at Notre Dame in Paris and the Royal Albert Hall and Crystal Palace in London 

His music was very modern for its time and some people including the famous music critic Eduard Hanslick did not like it Hanslick said that Bruckner composed like Wagner but although Bruckner had learned from Wagner he did not simply copy him Bruckners music shows his own strong personality Hanslick who preferred the symphonies of Brahms did Bruckner a lot of harm by writing bad reviews of his music He was Dean of the Music Department at the university in Vienna and did not want Bruckner to be appointed lecturer at the University However Bruckner did get that job in 1875 He became more and more famous especially after the great conductor Arthur Nikisch conducted the first performance of his Symphony no 7 in the Leipzig Gewandhaus in 1884 He was given many honours At the time of his death he had not yet finished his Symphony no 9 He was buried in St Florian

Bruckner always remained a simple person who dressed and behaved like someone from a small village He never felt very self confident and was always asking other people whether he was good enough for his job He never married or had a proper relationship with anyone although he fell in love with several young women

Bruckners symphonies show a wonderful ability to develop ideas slowly over a long period of time Some of the slow movements last about 30 minutes His music builds up in stages to big climaxes in a similar way to organ music His scherzos are tuneful dance movements which often sound like country dances His music shows great harmonic and polyphonic skills Bruckner often made revisions to his music This often makes a problem for conductors today as they have to decide which version to use Many musicians think that often Bruckners first versions were the best The revisions were often cuts to make a symphony shorter so that orchestras would be more likely to play it but the cuts spoil the flow of the music Nowadays we recognize Bruckner as one of the greatest writers of symphonies as well as a great composer of choral music

In music a Rondo is a piece of music which has one main theme which is heard several times and other musical ideas in between each time If we give the main theme a label A and the other musical ideas B C D etc then the form of a rondo can be described as ABACADA The sections in between the main A section are called episodes Rondos can vary in length eg a rondo might be ABACADAEAFA Each episode is normally in a different key from the main key

The word rondo is sometimes given the French spelling rondeau

Composers from the Baroque period onwards often write movements which are in rondo form In the Classical music period the last movement of a symphony or sonata is very often a rondo Rondos are normally fast and lively They are a good way of finishing a long piece of music with something that is happy

The word rondo is related to the word ritornello meaning something that keeps returning

Rondo form is sometimes combined with sonata form to make something which is called sonata rondo form In sonata rondo form the second tune is treated like the second subject in sonata form where it comes back in the main key the second time

A military engineer uses his skills in construction to build many different structures for warfare These different structures can be made for either offense or defense Other jobs include building and taking apart minefields and bridges In some cases an engineer may have to destroy something that he has built before This may be to stop the enemy soldiers following them across the river for example In many armies the military engineers are also called pioneers or sappers

Today a military engineer that operates during battle is called a combat engineer

Perhaps the first people who had a special force of military engineering specialists were the Romans Roman military engineering was very good in its time So they were able to build a double wall of fortifications that was thirty miles long in total in just six weeks when they wanted to broken wikt linkencircleencircle a besieged city in Gaul

In music a melisma is the technique of singing one syllable to a lot of notes They are often called vocal runs or simply runs Music which uses melismas can be called melismatic

In Western music melismas are often used in operas or any other music which is written for the singer to show off the voice Melismatic music is the opposite of music where each syllable has its own note In the Alleluia Chorus from Handels Messiah each syllable of the word Alleluya has its own note But in other parts of the Messiah there are often melismas eg in Thus saith the Lord the word shake is set to a run of 25 fast notes This example can also be described as word painting Handel uses the melisma to make it sound like someone shaking something

Melismas are used a lot in music from many different cultures

A spinet is a small kind of harpsichord In Renaissance and Baroque times and even later people often had a spinet in their homes The advantage of a spinet was that it was cheaper than a harpsichord and it also took up less room

Sometimes the word used to be spelt differently eg spinnet or spinnit

The spinet is different from a harpsichord because of the angle of the strings which run at an angle to the right The whole instrument is a bit like a triangle in shape The strings are arranged in pairs and the jacks are also in pairs in the wider gaps plucking the string next to them

Harpsichords may have several sounds in the same way that an organ has several stops making different sounds This is not possible on a spinet which has one sound only It is always an 8 foot sound Spinets were useful for accompanying

A bushranger was a thief who lived in the Australian bush Bushrangers often stole expensive things from banks or coaches There were more than 2000 bushrangers during Australias past Most were simply criminals and thieves A few bushrangers became famous and were seen as heroes They are part of a long history that has men such as Robin Hood and Dick Turpin in England or Jesse James and Billy the Kid in the US

The word bushranger was first used in Australia in 1805 It described three men who had stopped a cart near Sydney Then the word was used for criminals who attacked people on the roads or in the bush

The first bushrangers were escaped convicts One of the last bushrangers was Ned Kelly who was captured in 1880

Criminals who escaped stole things from farms far away and people walking on the roads Sometimes they sold the stolen things to other free settlers

John Black Caesar was the first bushranger He ran away from Sydney Cove many times before he was shot dead in 1796

Bold Jack Donahue appeared in newspapers around 1827 for bushranging on the road between Sydney and Windsor In the 1830s he was seen as the worst bushranger in the colony Leading a gang of escaped criminals Donahue became an important person in Australian folklore as the Wild Colonial Boy

Bushranging happened all over Australia but Van Diemens Land produced the most violent and serious bushrangers Hundreds of criminals were at large in the bush farms were given up and the army was brought in to try and capture the bushrangers Indigenous Australian bushranger Musquito led attacks on settlers

The bushrangers were busiest during the Gold Rush years of the 1850s and 1860s Gold can be easily carried and also it can easily be turned into cash The goldfields were in remote places and there were not very many police to guard the gold

George Melville was killed by hanging in front of many people for stealing from the McIvor gold escort near Castlemaine in 1853

Bushranging numbers grew in New South Wales with the rise of the colonial born sons of poor often ex convict farmers who wanted a more exciting life than mining or farming

Much of the bushranging in these years was in the Lachlan Valley around Forbes Yass and Cowra

Frank Gardiner John Gilbert and Ben Hall led the most notorious gangs of the period Other active bushrangers included Dan Morgan based around the Murray River and Captain Thunderbolt killed outside Uralla New South Wales

The increasing push of settlement increased police efficiency better rail transport and communications such as telegraphy made it increasingly difficult for bushrangers to evade capture

Among the last bushrangers was the Kelly Gang led by Ned Kelly who were captured at Glenrowan Victoria in 1880 two years after they were outlawed

In 1900 the Governor Brothers scared many people in the north of New South Wales

In Australia bushrangers often attract public sympathy 

In the same way that outlaws feature in many films of the American western genre bushrangers regularly feature in Australian literature film music and television

Jack Donahue was the first bushranger to have inspired bush ballads

Robbery Under Arms a novel by Thomas Alexander Browne was published in serial form in the Sydney Mail from 1882 to 1883 It is an early description of the life and acts of fictional bushrangers It has been the basis of several films and a television series

Ned Kelly was the subject of the worlds first feature length film The Story of the Kelly Gang released in 1906 In the 1970 release Ned Kelly he was portrayed to limited popular acclaim by Mick Jagger of The Rolling Stones Kelly has been the subject of many more movies television series written fiction and music 

Dan Mad Dog Morgan was the subject of a feature film Mad Dog Morgan starring Dennis Hopper

Ben Hall and his gang were the subject of several Australian folk songs including Streets of Forbes

Some bushrangers became famous as a result of their activities They include

The bush is a phrase used to describe land where people do not live land a long way from cities or forests The word is mainly used in Australia New Zealand Africa Canada and Alaska 

In Australia the phrase the bush has a special symbolic meaning in Australian life When used to describe the land the bush means a wooded area but not dense forest It is usually dry and nitrogen poor soil mostly grassless with thin to thick woody shrubs and bushes with some eucalypt trees

When talking about people the bush means any populated areas outside of the major metropolitan areas This can include mining and farming areas It is not unusual to have a mining town in the desert such as Port Hedland Western Australia called the bush in the media

The word bush is also added to any number of other words things or activities to describe their rural country or folk nature eg Bush Cricket Bush Music etc

Moondyne Joe real name Joseph Bolitho Johns is the most famous bushranger from Western Australia He became famous not for his crimes but for his many escapes from gaol

Johns was born in Cornwall England around 1826 his father Thomas Johns was a blacksmith He might have had smallpox in his youth as later his face is said to be pockmarked After his father died Johns and his three brothers worked in the copper mines In 1841 the family was living at Illogan Penwith Cornwall By 1848 Johns had moved to Wales working as an iron ore miner at the Clydach Iron Works

On 15 November 1848 Johns and a friend John Williams were arrested near Chepstow for stealing from the house of Richard Price three loaves of bread one piece of bacon several cheeses and other goods They were charged with burglary and stealing but they said they did not steal anything On 23 March they were tried in court with Sir William Erleas the judge Newspaper reports say that the men were very determined to prove their innocence but Johns was not polite and did not follow the normal court rules The men were convicted and sent to gaol for ten years Johns must have made the judge angry In other cases before the same judge that day people on the same type of charges were sent to gaol for times between three weeks to three months

Johns and Williams spent the next seven months working on a government work party in the local area before being sent to Millbank Prison On 1 January 1850 they were sent to Pentonville Prison to serve six months of solitary confinement On 21 October 1851 they were sent to Dartmoor Prison Johns was sent to the Woolwich prison hulk Justitia probably for bad behavior When the Justitia was destroyed by fire he was moved to the Defence About a year later he was put on convict transport ship the Pyrenees and sent to the British penal colony of Western Australia

The Pyrenees sailed for Western Australia on 2 February 1853 and arrived in Fremantle on 30 April He was a well behaved prisoner and as a reward Johns was given a ticket of leave On 10 March 1855 he was given a conditional pardon He moved to the Avon Valley which was a remote valley in the Darling Range The Aboriginal name for the area was Moondyne Johns put a fence around a natural water spring in the area and trapped lost sheep cattle and horses when they came to drink Farmers would pay a reward to get their animals back

In August 1861 Johns trapped a horse without a brand He put his own brand on it which was really stealing He was soon arrested by the police The horse was taken as evidence and Johns was placed in the Toodyay gaol During the night Johns escaped from his cell took the horse and the magistrates new saddle and bridle He was caught the next day but he had killed the horse and cut out the brand to destroy the evidence Without the proof he was only sent to gaol for three years for escaping not the ten years he would have been given for horse stealing

Johns was a well behaved prisoner so he was let out early with a ticket of leave in February 1864 He worked on a farm at Kelmscott In January 1865 a bullock was killed and eaten and the police said that Johns had done it He said he had not killed the animal but in court he was sent to gaol for ten years At this time the only things he owned were one pair of trousers one shirt one pair of boots one strap and one old hat Johns decided he would not stay in gaol because he had not done anything wrong In November he and another prisoner escaped from a work party During the next month they robbed a few houses Johns began calling himself Moondyne Joe They were captured convert37kmmi0lkonabbron east of York by the police with help from a black tracker Tommy Windich Black trackers were Indigenous Australian who had very good skills for finding things in the bush For escaping and for having a gun Moondyne Joe was sent to prison for 12 months He had to wear iron chains around his legs

Moondyne Joe did not think he had been treated properly In April 1865 he wrote a letter to the Chief Justice The Chief Justice cut his gaol time by four years but Joe was still not happy A few weeks later he tried to cut the lock out of his door He was given another six months in leg irons In August he escaped again cutting off his leg irons He met up with three other escaped convicts and together they robbed people in the bush around Perth At the end of August one of the gang was taken prisoner by the police 

Moondyne Joe came up with a plan to get away from Western Australia by going overland to South Australia This would be a long and difficult journey through the desert On 5 September Moondyne Joe stole boots blankets clothing guns and ammunition knives and food from a shop at Toodyay owned by an old convict James Everett The gang went east following the track made by the explorer Charles Hunt Their tracks were discovered by police on 26 September about convert160kmmi0lkonabbron east of York The police set out after them and they were captured on 29 September about convert300kmmi0lkonabbron north east of Perth This is near where the town of Westonia is now

Moondyne Joe was sent back to gaol and given an another five years with hard labour This meant that he had to do hard work as well To make sure that he could not escape again he was sent to Fremantle Prison where a special cell was made built It was made with stone and lined with very thick pieces of wood He was set to work in the prison yard breaking up rocks into small stones He was watched all the time by a prison guard The Governor of Western Australia John Hampton said to Johns If you get out again Ill forgive you 

However the rocks broken up by Joe were not taken away and soon a large amount of stones blocked the guards view of Joes legs Partly hidden behind the stones he sometimes hit his hammer against the prison wall On 7 March 1867 Moondyne Joe escaped through a hole he had made in the prison wall The police searched everywhere but he could not be found He did not rob anymore people and he did not go any place where someone might know who he was Many prisoners heard about Moondyne Joes escape and tried to escape themselves After two years Moondyne Joe was forgotten

In March 1867 Moondyne Joe tried to steal some wine from the cellars at Houghton Winery The owner had been helping the police on another search and brought the policemen to the winery for a drink Joe thought he had been seen and ran out of the cellar right into the policemen He was sent back to prison and given four more years as well as having to wear chains around his legs He tried to escape but was quickly captured The new Governor Weld heard about Hamptons promise and said the extra punishment was not fair Moondyne Joe was given another ticket of leave in April 1871

Moondyne Joe did not rob anyone else though he did do some wrong things and was sent back to gaol a few more times In January 1879 he married a widow named Louisa Hearn and they spent some time looking for gold near Southern Cross In 1881 while looking around Karridale he discovered Moondyne Cave In his later years he began acting strangely and became mentally ill He died of senile dementia in the Fremantle Lunatic Asylum on 13 August 1900 He was buried in Fremantle Cemetery

Every year on the first Sunday of May the small town of Toodyay remembers the life of Moondyne Joe with the Moondyne Festival This festival takes place in the main street with street theatre street markets and performances The most recent Moondyne Festival was on May 4 2008

While Moondyne Joe was bushranging in 1869 an Irish prisoner named John Boyle OReilly was in Fremantle Prison He must have heard many stories about Joes escapes In September 1869 OReilly escaped with help from an American ship After he got to the United States he wrote a novel about convict life called Moondyne An Australian Tale whose main character was called Moondyne Joe The book is not a true story and the character and the story are different to the life of Joseph Johns 

In 1913 OReillys book was made into a movie called Moondyne Directed by W J Lincoln it starred George Bryant Godfrey Cass and Roy Redgrave

Randolph Stow wrote a funny childrens book Midnite The Story of a Wild Colonial Boy in 1967 This told the story of an Australian bushranger based on the lives of Moondyne Joe and a Queensland bushranger Captain Starlight

In 2002 Cygnet Books published The Legend of Moondyne Joe by Mark Greenwood and pictures by Fran Lessac The book won the award in the Childrens Books section at the 2002 Western Australian Premiers Book Awards

Fremantle is a port city in Western Australia It is the main city on the ocean and is near Perth The city has a population of 26000 people It is at the place where the Swan River runs into the Indian Ocean

It was established by English people who arrived there in 1829 and established the Swan River Colony The city is named after Charles Fremantle who was the captain of the first ship to arrive there

Standard deviation is a number used to tell how measurements for a group are spread out from the average or expected value A low standard deviation means that most of the numbers are very close to the average A high standard deviation means that the numbers are spread out

Standard deviation is also used to measure how close a reported number is to being exactly right For example the standard deviation is used to find margin of error in opinion poll numbers The reported margin of error is usually two times the standard deviation and gives the range for the true poll number Scientists commonly report the standard deviation of numbers from the average number in experiments They often decide that only differences bigger than two or three times the standard deviation are important Standard deviation is also useful in money where the standard deviation on interest earned shows how different one persons interest earned might be from the average

Many times only a sample or part of a group can be measured Then a number close to the the standard deviation for the whole group can be found by a little bit different equation called the sample standard deviation explained below

The answer is the population standard deviation The formula is only true if the eight numbers we started with are the whole group If they are only a part of the group picked at random then we should use 7 instead of 8 in the bottom of the second to last step Then the answer is the sample standard deviation 

A slightly harder real life example The average height for grown men in the United States is 70 with a standard deviation of 3 A standard deviation of 3 means that most men have a height 3 taller to 3 shorter than the average one standard deviation Almost all men have a height 6 taller to 6 shorter than the average two standard deviations Three standard deviations include all the numbers for 997 of the sample population being studied This is true if the distribution is normal

If the standard deviation were zero then all men would be exactly 70 tall If the standard deviation were 20 then some men would be much taller or much shorter than the average with a typical range of about 5090 

For another example each of the three groups 0 0 14 14 0 6 8 14 and 6 6 8 8 has an average of 7 But their standard deviations are 7 5 and 1 The third group has a much smaller standard deviation than the other two because its numbers are all close to 7 The basic idea is the standard deviation tells us how far from the average the rest of the numbers tend to be It will have the same units as the numbers themselves If for example the group 0 6 8 14 is the ages of a group of four brothers in years the average is 7 years and the standard deviation is 5 years

Standard deviation may serve as a measure of uncertainty In science for example the standard deviation of a group of repeated measurements helps scientists know how sure they are of the average number When deciding whether measurements from an experiment agree with a prediction the standard deviation of those measurements is very important If the average number from the experiments is too far away from the predicted number then the theory being tested may not be right See prediction interval

The use of understanding the standard deviation of a set of values is in knowing how large a difference from the average is expected

As a simple example consider the average daily high temperatures for two cities one inland and one near the ocean It is helpful to understand that the range of daily high temperatures for cities near the ocean is smaller than for cities inland These two cities may each have the same average high temperature However the standard deviation of the daily high temperature for the coastal city will be less than that of the inland city 

Another way of seeing it is to consider sports teams In any sport there will be teams that are good at some things and not at others The teams that are ranked highest will not show a lot of differences in abilities They do well in most categories The lower the standard deviation of their ability in each category the more balanced and consistent they are Teams with a higher standard deviation however will be less predictable For example a team that is usually bad in most categories will have a low standard deviation A team that is usually good in most categories will also have a low standard deviation However a team with a high standard deviation might be the type of team that scores many points but also lets the other team score many points 

Trying to know ahead of time which teams will win may include looking at the standard deviations of the various team statistics Numbers that are different from expected can match strengths vs weaknesses to show what reasons may be most important in knowing which team will win 

In racing the time a driver takes to finish each lap around the track is measured A driver with a low standard deviation of lap times is more consistent than a driver with a higher standard deviation This information can be used to help understand how a driver can reduce the time to finish a lap

In money standard deviation may mean the risk that a price will go up or down It can also mean the risk that a group of prices will go up or down Risk is one reason to make decisions about what to buy Risk is a number people can use to know how much money they may earn or lose As risk gets larger the return on an investment can be more than expected However an investment can also lose more money than expected 

For example a person had to choose between two stocks Stock A over the past 20 years had an average return of 10 percent with a standard deviation of 20 percentage points Stock B over the past 20 years had an average return of 12 percent but a higher standard deviation of 30 pp Thinking about the risk the person may decide that Stock A is the safer choice Even though they may not make as much money they probably will not lose much money either The person may think that Stock Bs 2 point higher average is not worth the additional 10 pp standard deviation

Most math equations for standard deviation assume that the numbers are normally distributed This means that the numbers are spread out in a certain way on both sides of the average value  The normal distribution is also called a Gaussian distribution because it was discovered by Carl Friedrich Gauss It is often called the bell curve because the numbers spread out to make the shape of a bell on a graph 

Numbers are not normally distributed if they are grouped on one side or the other side of the average value Numbers can be spread out and still be normally distributed The standard deviation tells how widely the numbers are spread out

The average and the standard deviation of a set of data are usually written together Then a person can understand what the average number is and how widely other numbers in the group are spread out 

The way a group of numbers is spread out can also be given by the coefficient of variation which is the standard deviation divided by the average It is a dimensionless number Coefficient of variation is often multiplied by 100 and written as a percentage

The term standard deviation was first used in writing by Karl Pearson in 1894 following his use of it in lectures This was as a replacement for earlier alternative names for the same idea for example Gauss used mean error

Deflation means that generally the prices of products are going down It is the opposite of inflation It is said that deflation happens when there is less money than there are goods It is also said that deflation is a sign of a weak state of that countrys economy because deflation usually happens during an economic collapse Deflation is thought to be even worse than inflation

Deflation starts when people are waiting for prices to go down even more They will then spend less money Because of that companies can not afford to keep up the amount of goods that are made and have to lower that amount as well as fire workers to make even a small profit

Even if an economy is growing there can be some amount of deflation  if the amount of money going around grows slower than the making of goods There has not been much deflation in the world after 1930s except for one in Japan in the 1990s

Deflation can be helped by the countrys own government by lowering the companies tax levels so they can lower their prices while getting the same profit This way normal people are more encouraged to buy the cheap goods they were waiting for and slowly the companies can make more profit Governments do not like deflation because it means that they can collect less tax

Snuff is a kind of tobacco which is sniffed instead of smoked People take a bit of snuff between their fingers and put it in their nostrils to smell it Not many people use snuff now but a century or more ago it was very common In the novels of 19th century authors like Charles Dickens we often read about people taking snuff They kept it in a snuffbox

The Nose is an opera by Dmitri Shostakovich It was written in 1927 At this time a lot of exciting new movies were being made in the Soviet Union There were also some very interesting new plays in the theatres The famous theatre director Vsevolod Meyerhold had many new ideas  However operas that were being written then were mostly quite uninteresting

Shostakovich who was only just twenty years old started to make Soviet operas interesting again He took the story called The Nose which was written by Nikolai Gogol It is about a man who wakes up one day to find his nose has gone

The opera was first performed in 1930 Unfortunately by then the music critics had changed their ideas because of the political situation in the Soviet Union which was being ruled by the dictator Stalin  They wrote bad things about the opera and the performances soon had to stop It was not until 1974 that it was performed again in the Soviet Union

The opera is a satire It pokes fun at bureaucrats people in official jobs who think they are more important than they really are

In the opera the barber Ivan Yakovlevich is seen shaving the Major In the morning Ivan wakes up and his wife gives him some fresh bread and onion When he cuts the bread open he finds a nose inside His wife screams and yells at her husband She chases him out of the house He runs along the street with the nose feeling very embarrassed He throws the nose in the river but a policeman catches him He tries unsuccessfully to bribe him

In the next scene the Major wakes up and finds he has no nose He goes to tell the police He goes to the cathedral and sees his nose who is dressed up as an important person The Major is not sure what to say to his nose because his nose is now more important than he is He cant speak properly and the nose does not understand him The nose speaks very confidently like a person of high rank The Major cannot find the Chief of Police so he goes to the newspaper office The people there laugh at him and say that they cannot put a notice in the newspaper about a lost nose because it would make their newspaper look silly He is told to see a doctor When the Major takes his handkerchief away from his face to show that he really has lost his nose the newspaper staff become interested because they think they have a good story for the newspaper They offer him some snuff Of course he cannot sniff it and gets very cross

The police who are looking for the lost nose are watching people who are getting into a coach They think the nose might be trying to leave the city As the coach leaves the nose runs in tries to stop the coach frightens thehorses the driver tries to shoot the nose and everyone starts to fight the nose beating and hitting it until it is back to its normal size The policeman wraps it in a piece of paper He returns it to the Major and asks for payment The Major tries to stick his nose back on his face but he cant Even the doctor cant do it The nose escapes into the crowd The Major thinks that Madame Podtochina who tried to make him marry her daughter has used witchcraft on him He writes to her asking her to stop the spell but she writes back thinking that he wants to marry her daughter Large crowds appear on the street to try to see the nose

In the last part of the opera the Major has got his nose back where it belongs He is shaved by the barber and then walks along the street proudly showing everyone his nose

The music is just right for telling a story which is a satire The policeman for example sings in a high squeaky voice The music at the beginning sounds rather like circus music At the end of the scene when he is unable to bribe the police officer there is music just for percussion instruments This bit is very famous and often played as a separate piece One of the barbers songs is accompanied by four balalaikas Madame Podtochinas daughter sings like a romantic opera singer The waltz which is sung as the people get on the coach is a parody waltz

A video game developer is a person who makes games on computers and other game systems Some developers make games for only one or two types of game systems others might even make one kind of game Some games are only for one system Developers might try and make a copy of such game to another different system Some translate games from one language to another

Video game developers work in development companies There are over 1000 development companies today A big part of that thousand is very small companies that usually only have one or two workers  these kind of small companies make games for the Internet or mobile phones Some development companies are big too They have buildings in many places and hundreds of workers

There are three types of video game developers

Third party developers are video game developers that make deals with big publishers to make one game at a time The developers are not part of the company when the game is complete the developers do not have to make another game for the publisher if they do not want to Publishers will tell them exactly what they want third party developers to do and the developers do not have very much power to do something else

In house developers work directly to the publisher They have more freedom on the making of the game than third party developers have Sometimes publishers buy third party developers and so they become in house developers workers for the publisher This is an easy way for the publisher because the developers are workers for the publisher and so the publisher has more control

Independent developers are usually small groups of people that are not owned by any publisher or another company Because of that most independent developers publish their games themselves If they do that the games usually will not get much attention or money Still independent developers can make exactly the game they want when there is no publisher to tell them what to do

A video game publisher is a company that publish games that they have made or that they have bought to be made by a video game developer The publisher pays for the development of the game Because of that they can tell the developers exactly what kind of game they want The publisher is responsible for the making and marketing of the game Big publishers also distribute the games that they publish Smaller ones pay for other companies to distribute the game for them Publishers also usually design and make the copies of the games and write the manual

The weapon used in kendo is a bamboo sword called shinai The kendo armour which the players must wear is called bogu and is made of a helmet breastplate waist protector and special gloves You may hit your opponent on seven legal places both sides and top of helmet on either hand or either side of the body breastplate There is also one legal thrust on throat You must also shout the name of the place where you are hitting at the same time You get a point for a successful hit

One who does kendo is called a kendoka Kendo is also popular in western Europe and North America

Palaeontology or Paleontology is the study of fossils of living things and their phylogeny It depends on basic sciences such as zoology botany and historical geology The term palaeobiology implies that the study will investigate the palaeoecology of the groups in question

In palaeozoology the evolution of those phyla with fossil records are studied see List of animal phyla In palaeobotany fossil plants are studied In historical geology the formation sequence and dating of rock strata give information about past environments

A fossil is any kind of life that is more than ten thousand years old and preserved in any form that we can study today The fossil record is always incomplete and later discoveries may extend the known survival of a group See Lazarus taxon

Atahuallpa or Atawallpa was the 13th and last sovereign emperor of the Tahuantinsuyo or Inca empire He became emperor after defeating his younger half brother Huscar in a civil war that followed the death of their father Inca Huayna Capac from an infectious disease During the civil war the Spaniard Francisco Pizarro arrived and captured Atahuallpa and used him to control the Inca empire Eventually the Spanish executed Atahuallpa So ended the Inca Empire 

On the death of their father the Emperor Huayna Capac and their older brother Ninan Cuyochi who had been the heir the empire was divided between the two surviving brothers Huscar and Atahualpa Huascar got the major part of it with the capital Cusco and Atahualpa the northern parts including Quito For a couple of years the two brothers reigned without problems But Huascar demanded that Atahuallpa swear an oath to him Atahuallpa refused and the civil war began 

The final battle took place at Quipaipan where Huascar was captured Atahuallpa had dxfygt in the city of Cajamarca in the Andes with his army of 80000 troops on his way to the south and Cusco to claim his throne 

By this time the Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro had established the city of Piura the first Spanish settlement in Peru on July of 1532 After two months on the march Pizarro had arrived at Cajamarca with just 168 men under his command and sent Hernando de Soto friar Vicente de Valverde and native interpreter Felipillo to speak with Atahuallpa about the Spanish presence 

The Spanish envoys returned to Pizarro who prepared a surprise attack against Atahuallpas army in what became the Battle of Cajamarca on November 16 1532

According to Spanish law the Spanish officially declared war on the Inca people When Atahuallpa coldly asked the priest Valverde by what authority he and his people could say such things Valverde offered him a Bible saying that the authority came from the words in it He examined it and then asked why did it not speak to him He then threw it to the ground That gave the Spaniards the excuse they needed to wage war on the Incas They opened fire and over the course of 2 hours more than two thousand Inca soldiers were killed The Spanish then imprisoned Atahuallpa in the Temple of the Sun 

Atahuallpa still could not believe the Spanish intended to take control of his kingdom He thought that if he gave them the gold and silver they sought they would leave In exchange for his release he agreed to fill a large room with gold and promised the Spanish twice that amount in silver Although he was stunned by the offer Pizarro had no intention of releasing the Inca because he needed the rulers influence over the native people to maintain order in the surrounding country

But then Pizarro decided to have him executed because he feared he could be freed by an Inca General Pizarro staged a mock trial and found Atahuallpa guilty of revolting against the Spanish and murdering Huscar his own brother Atahuallpa was sentenced to execution by burning He was horrified since the Inca believed that the soul would not be able to go on to the afterlife if the body were burned Friar Vicente de Valverde who had earlier offered the Bible to Atahuallpa intervened again telling Atahuallpa that if he agreed to convert to Christianity he would convince the rest to commute the sentence Atahualpa agreed to be baptized into the Christian faith He was given the name Juan Santos Atahualpa and then was strangled with a garrote instead of being burned Atahuallpa died on August 29 1533 Atahuallpa was succeeded by his brother the puppet Inca Tupac Huallpa and later by another brother Manco Inca Yupanqui

Die Meistersinger von Nrnberg is an opera by Richard Wagner It is the only comic opera that Wagner wrote Wagner wrote the libretto in 1862 and composed the music in 1867 It was first performed in Munich in 1868

The story is set in the town of Nrnberg in 16th century Germany  It is about a group of Mastersingers The Mastersingers were a guild of singers in Germany many centuries ago The most famous of them was a man called Hans Sachs who lived in the 16th century Although Hans Sachs was a real person the story of the opera was made up by Wagner  It is a story about a song contest

The prelude to the opera is very famous and is often played by itself at concerts It has several tunes which are sometimes cleverly played at the same time These tunes are used during the opera and are associated with particular people or ideas

The young knight Walther is in church and sees a beautiful young girl Eva He wants to know whether she is married She tells him that she will be married to the person who wins the singing contest the next day Walther tries to learn the art of the Mastersingers from David who works for Hans Sachs the cobbler David himself is in love with Magdalene The apprentices start to prepare the stage for the contest

If Walther is to win the contest he will have to compose his own mastersong and sing it He will have to compose it according to a lot of strict rules When he meets the other Mastersingers he introduces himself saying that he learned the art of singing from the ancient poet Walther von der Vogelweide and from nature itself He sings this in a song which is very beautiful but it does not obey the rules of the Mastersingers The Mastersingers are not able to understand the beauty of his song

One of the Mastersingers is the town clerk His name is Beckmesser He is a comic figure and Wagner makes him look very silly Beckmesser is the marker This means something like an adjudicator When a singer makes a mistake the marker puts a chalkmark on the board When Walther sings his song Beckmesser makes lots of chalkmarks Hans Sachs is the only person who realizes the beauty of his song There is a lot of shouting and Walther has to stand on a chair to finish his song

A street in Nuremberg at night Evas grand house is opposite Hans Sachs simple house Evas father realizes she is in love with Walther Hans is thinking about the young knight and how well he sings Eva asks Hans who he thinks will be likely to win the song contest Then she is called back by her father Beckmesser has come and would like to serenade her Walther meets up with Eva and they wonder whether they should elope Eva changes clothes with her maid Hans Sachs stops them as they are about to elope Beckmesser is tuning his lute ready to sing Walther would like to argue with him but Eva gets him to sit quietly while Beckmesser sings Hans Sachs who is mending Beckmessers shoe has other ideas he sings a song himself and this annoys Beckmesser who is trying to sing to the girl he thinks is Eva He tells Hans to stop singing Hans says that he will stop but he will hammer on his shoe every time he hears Beckmesser make a mistake Beckmesser starts singing again and Hans hammers lots of times All the neighbours wake up and come into the street and argue and fight In the end the night watchman comes and everybody goes back into their houses

David is preparing a song for the midsummer festival Then Walther arrives and tells Hans that a song came to him in a dream Hans helps him to prepare the song for the contest When they have left the workshop Beckmesser comes in and sees the piece of paper with the song He picks it up when Hans returns and says that it is obvious that he Hans wants to enter the contest Hans tells Beckmesser that he can have the song Beckmesser is delighted and thinks he can now win Eva in marriage

At the song contest Beckmesser tries to sing the song but he sings it to his own tune which does not fit the words and he gets the words all muddled up Everyone laughs and he leaves the stage angrily saying that Sachs wrote the song Walther now sings his prize song This time people realize how beautiful it is although it does not obey the usual rules Walther can marry Eva

Wagners operas have continuous music which develops is very logical ways using leitmotifs In the prelude we hear several tunes which are leitmotifs that are to be important during the opera a theme that represents the dignity of the mastersingers a theme for passion which later becomes Walthers prize song the chattering of the apprentices etc The music at the beginning of Act Three is also often played separately in the concert hall

There are many beautiful moments in the opera Wagner cleverly changes the style to suit the action for example when Evas father is talking about the Mastersingers reputation in Germany we hear an old fashioned recitative Beckmesser is made to look stupid through his music which contrasts with Walthers romantic music

People have explained the meanings behind this opera in several ways The basic story is about the wonderful German art of singing It is also about the fact that composers should be able to write music which is beautiful without having to obey rules that were made up long ago and have become old fashioned Wagner was trying to bring lots of changes to opera making the drama the most important thing Some people found his new ideas quite difficult to follow and this may be why he chose for once to write a comic opera instead of a serious one based on mythology  The character of Beckmesser is a caricature of Eduard Hanslick a famous music critic who did not like the music of Wagner and Bruckner but preferred the more traditional music of Brahms and Antonn Dvok

Allahu Akbar is a Muslim saying It is often used in situations ranging from a greeting to an expression of strong sentiments It is most correctly translated as God is greater but in many instances God is great is an equally correct translation Allahu Akbar is the first part of the Adhan which is heard 5 times daily in Muslim communities The saying is a very strong expression that summarizes the entire core of Islam

The viol is a kind of string instrument that was played with a bow The viol was a popular instrument from the 15th to the 18th century Viols were held between the knees and played with a bow The bow was held with the palm of the hand facing upwards the other way round from todays bowhold for violins violas or cellos

A set of viols of different sizes  perhaps four or five instruments  were sometimes kept together in a chest which is why they were called a chest of viols When they were played together people talked of a consort of viols A consort would normally have at least one treble tenor and bass instrument A broken consort meant a mixture of different instruments viols recorders etc Lute and bass viol were often played together

The viol like the vihuela from which it developed had a bridge that was flatter than the bridge of a modern violin This made it easier to play chords There were six strings The strings of a bass viol were tuned to D  G  C  E  A D The tenor viol was often called a viola da gamba It was the most popular size for solo music and many composers wrote sonatas for the viola da gamba

Although most instruments had six strings the number did vary during the centuries The strings were made of gut On the fingerboard there were frets These frets helped the player to find the exact place to put the fingers Sometimes the top of the scrolls were beautifully decorated

The viol was a gentle sounding instrument When the violin family became popular in the 17th century and people started to go to concerts in large concert halls and to operas the viols became less important They were never members of the orchestra 

The biggest viol was called the violone It developed into the modern double bass This is why the double bass is a little different in shape from the violin viola and cello Some double bass players today hold the bow with the palm of the hand facing upwards like viol players

The viol was popular in the houses of rich people and at court In the times of Elizabeth I and later King Charles I composers such as William Byrd John Dowland Orlando Gibbons and later John Jenkins and William Lawes wrote viol music Solo sonatas were written by many composers including Marin Marais Johann Sebastian Bach and Karl Friedrich Abel Some of the last and greatest fantasies for viol consort were written by Henry Purcell

After the mid 18th century people forgot about the viol until the 20th century when there was a new interest in early music and people like Arnold Dolmetsch started making them again so that Renaissance and Baroque viol music could be played Today there are many societies for people who are interested in playing the viol

There are now many societies for people with an interest in the viol One of these The Viola da Gamba Society has a worldwide membership Some modern composers have also written for the viol eg John Tavener Sally Beamish Thea Musgrave Tan Dun and Poul Ruders There is a group called Fretwork which perform viol music

A color wheel is a circular chart that shows primary and secondary colors 

The color wheel most commonly used today is called the HSV color wheel which means hue saturation value The HSV color wheel is described below There are two versions one in which red green and blue are regarded as the primary colors and one in which magenta yellow and cyan are regarded as the primary colors The primary colors always appear on the color wheel There are three primary colors on the printers color wheel They are magenta yellow and cyan 

The primary colors can be mixed together to make secondary colors A long time ago people used to think that the primary colors were red yellow and blue Now we know they were wrong The secondary colors are on most color wheels There are three secondary colors They are green red and blue Secondary colors are made by mixing primary colors together The secondary colors can be mixed with the primary colors to make tertiary colors The tertiary colors are made by mixing a secondary and primary color together The tertiary colors are orange made by mixing red and yellow chartreuse green made by mixing green and yellow spring green made by mixing green and cyan azure made by mixing blue and cyan violet made by mixing blue and magenta and rose made by mixing red and magenta

In the electronic color wheel used for electronic devices such as televisions and computers red green and blue are regarded as the primary colors and  magenta yellow and cyan are regarded as the secondary colors The tertiary  colors are the same for both the printers color wheel and the electronic color wheel    

The 12 major colors of the color wheel at 30 degree intervals on the HSV color wheel are the following red orange yellow chartreuse green green spring green cyan azure blue violet magenta and rose This constitutes the complete set of primary secondary and tertiary color names

Note Red is shown twice so it can be compared to both orange and rose  RED ORANGE YELLOW CHARTREUSE GREEN GREEN SPRING GREEN CYAN  AZURE BLUE VIOLET MAGENTA ROSE RED 

On the old fashioned now obsolete red yellow blue pigment color wheel the tertiary colors on a red yellow blue color wheel were called red violet blue violet blue green yellow green yellow orange and red orange 

The RYB color wheel is still often used to teach color to children

The SPL began in 1998 when a group of teams decided to split from the Scottish Football League and create their own league The idea of splitting from the league was from a similar event in 1992 with the start of the English Premiership 

The SPL had 10 clubs playing until the 200001 season when the league was expanded to 12 teams The increase from 10 clubs to 12 was part of the deal offered to get approval from SPL member clubs Since the 200102 season the table is split in half near the end of the season with the teams playing the other clubs from their half of the table once more This sometimes results in the seventh placed team having more points than the sixth placed team but they do not move up to the top half In the 200506 season the seventh placed team had more points than the fourth placed team but still did not move up to fourth place due to the split

The SPL has been home to many important events For example when Hearts goalkeeper Craig Gordon moved to Sunderland for a fee of 9 million a record fee for a British goalkeeper It is also the most amount of money paid for a Scottish player but Alan Hutton shared this record when he moved from Rangers to Tottenham Hotspur for the same fee Tore Andr Flos move from Chelsea to Rangers was also a record for the most amount paid for a player by a Scottish club when he moved for 12 million The most amount of money paid by a Scottish club to another Scottish club is 45 million for Scott Brown when he moved from Hibernian to Celtic

The SPL is in a league format a team gains points by playing another team in the league Three points are awarded for a win and one point for a draw No points are awarded for a loss Once all the games have been played the team at the top of the league wins the SPL trophy If two or more teams are equal on points then the difference between of goals scored and goals against is considered The season runs from August until May each year Each club will play each other at least three times before the table splits in half for the last part of the competition Each club will then play five more games against clubs in their half of the table Each team plays a total of 38 games

Once every team has played each other three times the league splits into two halves for another five games This means that the top six teams play each other once and the bottom six teams play each other once Many people do not like the SPL splitting Many managers such as Jim Jeffries the manager of Hearts at the time has publically asked for the split to be removed The man in charge of the SPL the Chief Executive said that 11 out of the 12 SPL teams would need to agree and out of eight teams asked five said that they wanted the split kept 

Teams cannot move between the two splits meaning that even if a team in seventh place has more points than the team in sixth they will not move above them in the league This happens often for example in the 200506 season the seventh placed club Inverness Caledonian Thistle gained more points than the fourth placed club Hibernian but finished the league in seventh

In the 200001 season the SPL decided to stop the winter break forcing teams to play through January This means that many games are stopped because of the damage to the pitch and very bad weather Former Celtic manager Martin ONeill former Dundee manager Jim Duffy and former Rangers manager Walter Smith are among those who have asked to start the winter break again Former Rangers manager Alex McLeish accused the SPL of taking Scottish football back to the dark ages after its decision to stop the winter break meaning that they were going back to an old outdated system

A total of four clubs can qualify for European competitions The teams who finish first and second in the SPL qualify for the UEFA Champions League The third placed team and the winner of the Scottish Cup qualify for the UEFA Cup

Rangers and Celtic have recently played in the final of the UEFA Cup with neither club winning in the final match In 2003 Celtic played FC Porto in Seville Spain but Porto won 3 2 More recently in 2008 Rangers played FC Zenit St Petersburg in Manchester England but lost 2 0 More than 200000 Rangers fans went to Manchester to watch the game on several large televisions

Normally the team who finishes last in the SPL is relegated to the Scottish First Division and the team who finishes first in the First Division is promoted to the SPL However there are some criteria that the team must meet in order to be promoted In 2003 Falkirk finished first in the Scottish First Division but their stadium did not meet the agreed criteria Instead they asked if they could share a stadium with Airdrie United while their own stadium was expanded This caused arguments as the chairmen of the SPL clubs voted against this idea Because Falkirks stadium was too small they were not promoted into the SPL and the team who finished last in the SPL was not relegated

This situation almost happened again in 2004 There were many votes and threats of legal action from Partick Thistle the team who finished last in the SPL The situation was solved and Inverness Caledonian Thistle were allowed promotion as long as they shared a stadium with their rivals Aberdeen at Pittodrie a stadium over 100 miles away 

In 2005 the stadium size criteria was reduced A team playing in the SPL must now have at least 6000 seats Standing room is not allowed in SPL grounds for safety reasons This then allowed Inverness Caledonian Thistle to return to their home stadium during the 200506 season

In the SPL there are no restrictions on clubs signing players The only rule on signing players is with general Scottish employment law There are no salary caps or age restrictions There are no restrictions on the size of the playing squad or restrictions on the number of players from other countries 

The only rule is the Under 21 rule This means that every club must name at least three players under the age of 21 in their match day squad They do not need to play There has been some criticism over this rule Walter Smith Gus MacPherson and Jim Jeffries all showed their disapproval

Between the 199899 season and the 200102 season the right to show SPL matches on television was held by Sky Sports with highlights being shown by STVs Scotsport Sky Sports withdrew from the SPL when their offer for 45 million to continue showing live games on TV was declined by the SPL The SPL asked for more money Discussions began in 2002 for a new pay per view satellite television channel called SPL TV However Rangers and Celtic did not like the idea and rejected it Because of this the remaining 10 SPL clubs announced their intention to resign from the league 

Even though a two year television deal had been agreed with BBC Scotland in July 2002 the 10 non Old Firm clubs confirmed their resignation from the SPL in August 2002 because they were unhappy with how the league voted which allowed the Old Firm clubs to stop any attempts to change SPL rules The ten clubs withdrew their resignations in January 2003 after an agreement was reached to change the voting rules and to change the way the money from TV was given out to the SPL teams

With BBC Scotlands television contract due to expire after the 200304 season the SPL agreed a new television deal with Irish company Setanta Sports in February 2004 in a four year deal worth 54 million In June 2008 it was announced that a further four year deal would start for the 201011 season with the deal worth 125 million However Setanta went bankrupt in June 2009 In July Sky Sports and ESPN agreed a 65 million five year deal with the SPL

The right to broadcast SPL games on radio is currently held by BBC Radio Scotland who have held the rights since the SPL started in the 199899 season BBC Radio Scotland also provide internet webcasts to all Scottish Premier League matches having became the first broadcaster to introduce such a service in June 2000

As with many sport competitions the name of the SPL has been sold to a sponsor currently the Clydesdale Bank a Scottish Bank The Clydesdale Bank bought the name in the 200708 season for 8 million taking over from another Scottish bank the Bank Of Scotland The SPL is now known as the Clydesdale Bank Premier League

The two Glasgow football clubs known as the Old Firm play in the SPL Rangers and Celtic The Old Firm has been criticised by some due to the fact that they hold such a strong position in Scottish football The amount of money they make is very large compared to the other teams in Scotland In 2001 their income was 90 million almost double the income of the other ten teams whose income was 48 million combined Every year since the SPL started one of the Old Firm has won the league Only once in the 200506 season did the Old Firm clubs not come first and second in the SPL

Although the two teams have a strong position over other Scottish teams they still cannot compete with other leagues for players because other leagues particularly the English Premiership have a lot more money to spend There has been rumours about the Old Firm splitting from the SPL and joining the English Premiership but this was stopped by FIFA

These teams play in the SPL as of the 201011 season

These are previous members of the SPL in reverse order of when they were relegated

St Mirren are the only club to have been promoted into the SPL twice Dunfermline Athletic are the only club to have been relegated from the SPL twice

There are six metropolitan counties in England which each cover large urban areas typically with populations of 12 to 28 million They were created in 1974 and are each divided into several metropolitan districts 

There are no county councils any more since 1986 Most of their functions were taken over by the individual boroughs So the boroughs became unitary authorities The remaining functions were taken over by so called joint boards

The metropolitan counties have population densities of between 838 and 28 peoplekm Individual metropolitan districts range from 4 peoplekm in Liverpool to only 500 peoplekm in Doncaster

The six metropolitan counties and their metropolitan districts are

The structure of Greater London is similar to the metropolitan counties but it is not one It was created earlier in 1965 by the London Government Act 1963 The idea for creating administrative areas based upon the large conurbations outside London based on the model of the County of London or Greater London 

The metropolitan counties were established by the Local Government Act 1972 the county councils were first elected in 1973 and were formally established in April 1974

Since the 1995 the cities of Birmingham Bristol Leeds Liverpool Manchester Newcastle Nottingham and Sheffield have come together in the English Core Cities Group This organisation has no distinct legal status but seems to move towards a role of these cities as regional capitals outside of London

A unitary authority is a type of local authority that is responsible for all local government functions within its area This is different from a system where local government functions are divided between different authorities

Typically unitary authorities cover large towns or cities which are large enough to be independent of county or regional administration Sometimes they consist of counties which have no lower level of administration

In the United Kingdom Unitary Authorities are English councils which are responsible for almost all local government functions within their areas

This is opposed to the system of local government which still exists in most of England where local government functions are divided between county councils and district councils

Until 1996 a similar system existed in Scotland and Wales but this has now been replaced by a fully unitary system A unitary system has existed in Northern Ireland since 1973

Some cities large towns and groups of neighbouring towns are unitary authorities and independent from county councils and some English counties such as Rutland Herefordshire and the Isle of Wight have so small populations that the entire county is a unitary authority

In practice most unitary authorities in the UK are not entirely unitary as they often run some services on a joint basis with other authorities these typically include policing fire services and sometimes waste disposal and public transport In addition some unitary authorities contain civil parishes which effectively form another limited broken wikt linktiertier of local government

When the metropolitan councils were abolished in 1986 their functions were given to the boroughs These became unitary authorities in all but name

Similar institituions exist in other countries which although not called unitary authorities are similar in concept

In the United States an Independent city or a consolidated city county is roughly equivalent to a unitary authority The city might be separate from any county government as in Virginia or merged with a county government as in San Francisco California or as is common in Florida Another type of local government that is roughly equivalent to a unitary authority is a county when there are no municipal or township governments in the county That is the case in Arlington County Virginia and Baltimore County Maryland

Unitary authorities or single tier municipalities exist as a single level of government in a province that otherwise has two levels of local government One should not confuse municipalities in provinces with no upper level of local government as single tier municipalities as these are the only level of local government in that province

In Germany a kreisfreie Stadt is the equivalent term for a city which is responsible for the local and the Kreis administrative level

Administrative division is a term for an administrative region within a country on a level below that of the sovereign state typically with a local government with a certain degree of autonomy 

A County council is the elected administrative body governing an area known as a county This term has slightly different meanings in different countries

County councils were responsible for more strategic services in a region with smaller urban district councils and rural district councils responsible for other activities The new system was a major modernisation which became necessary because of the increase of functions carried out by local government in late Victorian Britain 

In England and Wales a county council is the local government that governs a county

County Councils were introduced in 1889 in England and Wales by the Local Government Act 1888 They took over the administrative functions of the unelected Quarter Sessions 

The system was soon extended to Scotland by the Local Government Act 1889 and the island of Ireland by the Local Government Act 1898 Except in Scotland the areas they covered were called administrative counties and were not always the same as the traditional shire counties

In the United States most of the individual states have counties as a form of local government in nine states they are headed by a county council In other states each county is headed by a county commission or a county board of supervisors

Little Red Riding Hood is a fairy tale for young children It is a story about a young girl and a wolf The story comes from a folktale which means that it was a spoken story for a long time before it was a written story It was first written down in the late 1600s The best known version of Little Red Riding Hood is by the Brothers Grimm and dates from the 19th century

The most common version of the story is the one written by the Brothers Grimm in the 19th centuryfact The Brothers Grimm listened to many traditional stories from old people and wrote them into a bookfact Many fairy stories as they are usually called were made better known by the Grimms bookfact The title of the story is properly translated as Little Red Cap even though it is usually known in English as Little Red Riding Hood

A girl has been given red cap to wear Her mother sends her to take food to her sick grandmother The mother tells her she must not stop on the way A wolf sees the girl walking through the woods and makes a plan to eat her The wolf politely asks the girl where she is going The girl answers him because he seems friendly The wolf tells the girl to pick some flowers for her grandmother While she is picking flowers the wolf goes to grandmothers house and eats her He puts on the grandmothers night cap and gets into her bed When the girl goes into grandmothers house the wolf eats the girl too A woodcutter comes and cuts opens the wolfs body He saves the grandmother and the girl who are still alive Then stones are put in the wolfs body to kill the wolf

The story of Little Red Riding Hood seems to have been told for hundreds of years in different countries under different names In France the story has probably been told for at least 700 years In Italy there are several versions One is called The False Grandmother There is a story from China which is like this called The Grand Aunt Tigerfact

In the old versions of the story the wolf is sometimes a monster or a werewolf In one version of the story the wolf gives the girl some food to eat It is part of the body of her grandmother The wolf tells the girl to throw all her clothes in the fire and get into bed She says that she needs to use the toilet first The wolf ties her with a long string so that she cannot run away without him knowing But the girl puts the rope around something else and escapes

The story was first written and published in a book in 1697 by the French Writer Charles Perrault The name of the book in English is Tales and Stories of the Past with Morals Tales of Mother Goose The story is called The Little Red Capfact The story is a little different from the way that the Brothers Grimm tell itfact This is because Perrault wanted to make a strong point about wise and foolish behaviourfact He wanted to show that a beautiful young woman was in danger of having men with bad morals try to trick her into wrong behaviour In Perraults story the girl gets eaten and there is no happy ending 

Little Red Riding Hood often appears as a picture book or in collections of stories for very young children Like a folktale these books are for telling and listening not for reading alonefact In many re tellings of the story for very young children having grandmother get eaten is thought of as too frighteningfact So grandmother hides in the cupboard In these tellings Red Riding Hood is rescued by a hunter or the woodcutter just as the wolf is catching at her apronfact

An important part of the story is the questions and answers A young child can learn and say these parts with the person who is reading the story In the story the wolf knocks at the grandmothers door fact The story goes 

The second section of repeating parts of the story happens when Red Riding Hood sees the wolf in her grandmothers bed 

These lines are the best known part of the story and are often quoted They are thought of as an important part of good story telling which makes the story more exciting for young children fact

This has led to a series of jokes which are called Knock knocks fact It has also led to a feeding time game for little children in which the parent opens the childs mouth by using the nose as a latch and pops a spoonful of food in the childs mouth at walk in

There are manyfact stories in which a hungry wolf threatens a young person or animal In most of these stories the young one escapes by cunning One story is the Russian folktale Peter and the Wolf The Brothers Grimm told the story of the Little Kids and the Wolf Another story like this is The Three Little Pigs first published by James Orchard Halliwell Phillipps 

There is a Norse Legend which has a question and answer part that is like the questions that Red Riding Hood asks the wolf In this story Thor is pretending to be a giants beautiful bride The giant asks the same sort of questions about Thor who is really a man in disguise

As with many fairy tales hidden messages can be found in Little Red Riding Hoodfact People have very different interpretationsfact There are two main ways that the story of Little Red Riding Hood can be interpretedfact 

The first type of interpretation is about morality It is about what is right and what is wrong 

The second way of seeing the stories has nothing to do with peoples behaviour or feelings These interpretations have to do with the cycle of the sun and the seasons and with the cycle of life with people dying and being born

Franois Adrien Boieldieu made an opera from the story The opera is called Le petit chaperon rouge Its first performance was in Paris in the year 1818 

In 1927 Sir Compton MacKenzie used Little Red Riding Hood as the central character of a novel for children Santa Claus in Summer Red Riding Hood in this re telling is the daughter of a highway man called Riding Hood

The story has been adapted to various media Tex Avery made a cartoon out of it Red Hot Riding Hood He adapted the story to be more appealing to adults Little Red Riding Hood works at a striptease club The wolf dressed in a suit goes after the stripper

Roald Dahl re told the story in a funny poem about Little Red Riding Hood It is in his collection Revolting Rhymes abd francis perrault was the original writer

Lon Po Po is an ancient Chinese version of Little Red Riding Hood which won the 1990 Randolph Caldecott Medal for its watercolour and pastel illustrations by Young

Many paintings have been done of Little Red Rding Hood Artists who have painted pictures of this story are George Frederick Watts Samuel Albrecht Anker and Franois Richard Fleury

A demonym or gentilic is a word used for people or the inhabitants of a place The name of a peoples language is usually the same as this word for example the English Some places may not have a word for the people that live there 

The English language has many ways to create demonyms The most common is to add a suffix to the end of the locations name These may use Latin Semitic or Germanic suffixes such as 

In many cases both the locations name and the demonym are created by using a suffix for example England and English and Englishman This is not always true for example France French

In a few cases the name of the country is not at all related to the name of the people This is usually because the two words come from different languages 

Demonyms can be nouns or adjectives In many cases the noun and adjective forms are the same in other cases they are different

In the case of Canadian provinces and territories and US states demonyms are not usually used as adjectives

Some peoples mainly cultures that were taken over by European colonists have no demonym They may also have a demonym that is the same as the name of their nation Examples include Iroquois Aztec Mori and Czech Often the native languages of these people have forms that did not get used in English In Czech for example the language is etina the nation is esko or esk republika and the people are ei 

The demonym for people of the United States of America has a similar problem American refers to both the United States and to the two American continents United Statian is not used in English but it exists in Spanish French Portuguese Italian and also in Interlingua US American and US American can be used and is a common demonym in German

Similarly there is no demonym for the citizens of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland

The Gettysburg Address is a speech by US President Abraham Lincoln It was delivered on the afternoon of Thursday November 19 1863 This speech was made during the American Civil War at the dedication of the Soldiers National Cemetery in Gettysburg Pennsylvania This was four and a half months after the Union armies had a victory over those of the Confederacy at the Battle of Gettysburg

The address is one of the greatest speeches in the history of the United States Lincoln spoke of how humans were equal as it said in the Declaration of Independence He also said the Civil War was a fight not simply for the Union but a new birth of freedom that would make everyone truly equal in one united nation

The speech famously begins with Four score and seven years ago referring to the American Revolution in 1776 Score in this case is an old word meaning twenty Lincoln used the ceremony at Gettysburg to encourage the people to help Americas democracy so that the government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth

The speech is very important in the popular culture of the United States However people are not sure about the exact words of the speech The five known manuscripts of the Gettysburg Address are different from one another in some details They are also different from the words of the Gettysburg Address that have been printed in modern newspapers

About 172000 American soldiers fought in the Battle of Gettysburg from July 13 1863 The Battle of Gettysburg was an important influence on the American Civil War and on the town of Gettysburg Pennsylvania where only 2400 people lived The battlefield had more than 7500 bodies of dead soldiers and 5000 horses Sarah Broadhead a wife and mother living in the town feared that they would be visited with pestilence Eliza Farnham a nurse called the place one vast hospital An army medical officer spoke similarly The ten days following the battle of Gettysburg was the greatest amount of human suffering known in this nation since its birth

The people of Gettysburg wanted to bury the dead properly At first they planned to buy land for a cemetery and ask the families of the dead to pay for the burial However David Willis a rich 32 year old lawyer did not like this idea He wrote to the Governor of Pennsylvania Andrew Gregg Curtin asking that a National Cemetery be supported by the states Wills was allowed to buy 17 acres for a cemetery to honor the people who died in the battle He paid 247587 for the land

At first Wills wanted to dedicate this new cemetery on Wednesday October 23 He asked Edward Everett to be the main speaker Everett was a very famous orator at that time He had also served as Secretary of State US Senator US Representative Governor of Massachusetts president of Harvard University and Vice Presidential candidate However Everett replied that he would not be able to prepare a good speech so quickly and wanted to move the date of the dedication The organizing committee agreed and the dedication was moved to Thursday November 19

Wills and the event committee then asked President Lincoln to join in the ceremony Wills letter said It is the desire that you as Chief Executive of the nation formally set apart these grounds by a few appropriate remarks Lincoln was officially asked to join only 17 days before the ceremony while Everett had received his invitation 40 days earlier Although there is some evidence Lincoln expected Willss letter its late date makes the author appear presumptuous Seventeen days was extraordinarily short notice for presidential participation even by nineteenth century standards Also Willss letter made it equally clear to the president that he would have only a small part in the ceremonies

Lincoln came by train to Gettysburg on November 18 He spent the night in Willss house on the Gettysburg town square There he finished the speech he had written in Washington DC There is a popular story that Lincoln completed his address on the train on the back of an envelope but it is not true There are several early copies on Executive Mansion paper and reports of Lincoln finishing his speech while he was a guest of David Wills at Gettysburg On the morning of November 19 at 930 am Lincoln riding a brown horse joined the townspeople and widows marching out to the grounds to be dedicated

About 15000 people went to the ceremony This included the governors of six of the 24 Union states They were Andrew Gregg Curtin of Pennsylvania Augustus Bradford of Maryland Oliver P Morton of Indiana Horatio Seymour of New York Joel Parker of New Jersey and David Tod of Ohio Canadian politician William McDougall came as Lincolns guest Historians do not agree about the exact place where the dedication ceremony was held inside the cemetery Moving all the bodies to the graves in the cemetery was less than half complete on the day of the ceremony

By August 1863 millions of people had been killed or hurt because of Civil War battles This made people in the North begin to dislike Lincoln and the war Lincolns 1863 drafts were not popular and people became angriest with them around the time of the New York Draft Riots This was just ten days after the Battle of Gettysburg In September 1863 Pennsylvanias Governor Curtin told Lincoln that people were turning against the war effort

If the election were to occur now the result would be extremely doubtful and although most of our discreet friends are sanguine of the result my impression is the chances would be against us The draft is very odious in the State the Democratic leaders have succeeded in exciting prejudice and passion and have infused their poison into the minds of the people to a very large extent and the changes are against us

In the summer of 1864 Lincoln was worried that the peoples bad feelings would make him fail the Presidential election In the fall of 1863 he grew very concerned about keeping up the Unions spirits toward the war effort That was the greatest purpose of Lincolns Address at Gettysburg

The program organized for that day by Wills and his committee included

Lincolns short speech became known in history as one of the best examples of English public speeches Everetts two hour oration was called the Gettysburg address that day but his oration is not well known today It began

It ended two hours later with

After Everett finished his speech Lincoln spoke for two or three minutes Lincolns few appropriate remarks summarized the war in ten sentences

Gabriel Urbain Faur was a French composer organist pianist and music teacher He was the most important French composer of his time The way he wrote music especially his harmonies had a big influence on many 20th century composers Most French composers at the time became famous by writing operas but Faure only wrote one opera His most important works are his French songs chamber music and piano music His Requiem is one of the most popular of all requiems and can be performed with quite a small orchestra and choir Other very popular pieces are his Bereuse from the Dolly Suite for piano duet the Sicilienne from the music for Pellas et Mlisande and the song Aprs un rve which is sometimes also played by a solo instrument eg the cello

Faur came from the south of France He was born into a large family and was sent to live with a foster nurse for four years When he was quite small he often played the harmonium at the small chapel attached to the school where his father was director A blind lady heard him and told his father that he ought to send him to a good music school His father did not want to at first but when the boy was nine he was sent to study at the Ecole Niedermeyer in Paris This was a school which trained young people to become church organists and choir directors He spent eleven years there and had a good musical education One of his teachers was the great composer Camille Saint Sans 

At first he held several jobs in churches playing and accompanying the choirs During the Franco Prussian War Faure served in the army and did some teaching When he returned to Paris in October of 1871 he got the job of choir accompanist at a big church in Paris called Saint Sulpice He often met up with Saint Sans and his friends who included the composers Lalo Duparc dIndy and Chabrier Several of these musicians including Faur himself formed a music society called Socit Nationale de Musique in 1871

In 1874 Saint Sans retired from the church called the Madeleine and Faur became choirmaster In the same year he became engaged to Marianne Viardot daughter of the singer Pauline but then Marianne broke off the engagement He travelled to Weimar to hear Richard Wagners Der Ring des Nibelungen Faur liked Wagners music but it did not influence him 

In 1883 Faur married Marie Fremiet They had two sons He had to spent a lot of time earning money by teaching to keep his family and so he did not have much time to compose except during the summer His publishers did not pay him much money for his compositions 

In 1892 he became inspector of the music conservatories in the French provinces which meant he no longer had to teach amateur students In 1896 he finally became chief organist at the glise de la Madeleine He also became professor of composition at Paris Conservatoire Here he taught several students who became important French composers including Maurice Ravel Nadia Boulanger and Charles Koechlin In 1905 he became director of the conservatoire 

As he became older he became deaf High and low pitches sounded muddled to him He retired from the Conservatoire in 1920 at the age of 75 In that year he received the Grand Cross of the Lgion dHonneur It was unusual for a musician to have such a high honour His health became poor partly because he smoked heavily He died in Paris from pneumonia in 1924 and was given a state funeral 

Gabriel Faur is the greatest composer of French art song or mlodie He learned a great deal at the cole Niedermeyer about how to write beautiful flowing harmonies He also studied the church modes This can be heard in a lot of his music He wrote several song cycles including one called La Bonne Chanson Faurs piano works are mostly short works such as barcarolles nocturnes and impromptus They are often full of arpeggiated figures with the melody going from one hand to the other His chamber works include piano quartets and quintets a string quartet a piano trio two sonatas for violin and piano and two for cello and piano His lgie for cello and piano is especially well known He never showed a great deal of interest in writing for the orchestra His orchestral works mostly consist of incidental music His Requiem is popular both with amateur and professional choirs

A music critic is someone who writes about concerts that have taken place or new music that has been written They write reviews about this in newspapers or journals What they write is called musical criticism

Music critics can have a lot of influence on a musicians success If a musician gets a bad review people may not bother to go and hear him If he has a very good review people will think he must be good and they will all want to hear him

Occasionally it can happen that a new piece of music has such a terrible review that everyone wants to go and hear how terrible it is They may then find that they like it and the music might become famous This is called a succs de scandale Stravinskys Rite of Spring is a good example

Music critics will spend a lot of time listening to music They often do other jobs with music such as teaching Some famous music critics include

the German composer Robert Schumann He published a music journal called Neue Zeitschrift fr Musik He wrote an article which has become famous called Neue Bahnen in which he said that there was a young man called Johannes Brahms who would become a great composer Schumann was right

Wordsworth was born as second of five children in the Lake District After the death of his mother in 1778 his father sent him to Hawkshead Grammar School In 1783 his father who was a lawyer and the solicitor died Although many aspects of his boyhood were positive he remembered times of loneliness and anxiety It took him many years and much writing to recover from the death of his parents

Wordsworth Dorothy and Coleridge then traveled to Germany in the autumn of 1798 The main effect on Wordsworth was that he became homesick But he began to work on the important autobiographical piece The Prelude He also wrote a number of famous poems including the Lucy poems He and his sister moved back to England now to Dove Cottage in Grasmere in the Lake District and this time with the poet Robert Southey nearby Wordsworth Coleridge and Southey came to be known as the Lake Poets Through this period many of his poems speak of death endurance separation and grief

Two of his children Thomas and Catherine died in 1812 In 1813 his family including Dorothy moved to Rydal Mount Ambleside where he spent the rest of his life

The Short Parliament in English history lasted from April 13 to May 5 1640 It is called Short because it only lasted for three weeks

Charles I of England who was also king of Scotland was having problems with the Church of Scotland and war with them was breaking out again Charles had spent the last 11 years ruling directly without calling a Parliament even once He did this because he had little use for elected representatives trying to decide policy But now with the problems with the Scots Charles needed money to pay for his war  To get more money for war meant he had to call a Parliament so they could vote on it

The problem was that the members of Parliament were unhappy about the things he had done since 1629 when he was ruling without them They wanted to talk about these things instead of giving the king his money John Pym member for Tavistock gave fiery speeches refusing to give money unless the abuses were talked about Charles responded by closing the Parliament and sending them home again and he tried to fight the Scots without the money But when this did not work and as a result of his defeat had to agree to pay the Scots he was forced to call Parliament again This became known as the Long Parliament and the Constitutional crisis that followed led to the bloody English Civil War

Annals are a short form of historical writing which record events chronologically year by year 

Cicero tells that from the earliest period down to the pontificate of Publius Mucius Scaevola it was usual for the pontifex maximus to record on a white tablet which was exhibited in an open place at his house so that the people might read it On this tablet were written down the name of the consuls and other magistrates and then the important events of the year 

In Ciceros time these records were called Annales Maximi The practice of writing annals was carried on by several unofficial writers Cicero speaks of Cato Pictor and Piso 

In the Middle Ages in the Western Church there were written tables to show that date of Easter for a certain number of years or even centuries These Paschal tables were thin books in which each annual date was separated from the next by a more or less considerable blank space In these spaces some monks wrote down the important events of the year The writing of these Annals was begun at the end of the 7th century and among the Irish see the Annals of the Four Masters the Annals of Ulster the Annals of Innisfallen and the Annales Cambriae or Annals of Wales one of the earliest sources for King Arthur The Anglo Saxon Chronicle is also in annalistic year by year form

He received his doctorate in 1911 

Bohr did experiments in the Trinity College in Cambridge under the direction of JJ Thomson After it he went to the University of Manchester under the direction of Ernest Rutherford On the basis of the theories of Rutherford he published his theory of electrons He introduces the theory of electrons traveling in orbits around the nucleus of the atom in 1913 and the chemical properties of the orbit

He introduced the idea that an electron can drop from a higher energy orbit to a lower one Then it can emit a photon of discrete energy This is the basis of quantum theory 

Niels Bohr and his wife Margrethe Nrlund Bohr had six sons Their oldest died in a tragic boating accident and another died from childhood meningitis The others went on to lead successful lives including Aage Bohr who became a very successful physicist and like his father won a Nobel Prize in physics in 1975

A Requiem is a eucharist service in the Roman Catholic church to remember someone who has died There are special words for a requiem mass They are in Latin The best known part of the requiem mass starts with the words Requiem aeternam dona eis Domine This is why it is called a requiem

Many composers throughout the centuries have composed music to these words The word requiem can mean a piece of music which sets the words of the requiem mass

Celebration of the eucharist in honour of people who have died goes back at least as far as the 2nd century

In the Middle Ages the words of the requiem mass were sung to Gregorian chant

In the Renaissance church music was generally polyphonic This sort of music which has several voices weaving in and out of one another is the kind of music used at the time for requiems The composer Johannes Ockeghem is an example of a composer who wrote such music

Polyphonic settings of the requiem continued during the Baroque period even although other musical forms had developed a much more modern style

The most famous Requiem from the 18th century is the one by Mozart Many musicians think it was one of the greatest pieces of music ever written It was left unfinished when Mozart died

In the 19th century many composers wrote requiems Most of these were written for performance at concerts not for church services but they still used the Latin words of the Roman Catholic requiem mass

Luigi Cherubini wrote a Requiem in C minor for the annual remembering of the execution of Louis XVI He wrote another Requiem in D minor which he wrote for himself It was performed at his own funeral

Giuseppe Verdi wrote a very exciting Messa da Requiem which sounds very operatic Verdi rearranged some of the text of the traditional requiem mass

Bruckner Saint Sans and Dvok all wrote requiems

Brahms wrote a work which he called Ein Deutsches Requiem It is unusual because instead of setting the traditional Latin words he took some words from the German translation of the Bible

In 1888 Gabriel Faur wrote a requiem which uses an orchestra without violins except for a solo violin in the movement called Sanctus In 1900 he made some changes and added an important baritone solo

In the 20th century many composers continued to write requiems The most famous one is Brittens War Requiem The message of this work is that war is cruel and pointless Britten uses the Latin words of the requiem mass but also some English poems by Wilfred Owen who was killed in the First World War The baritone and tenor soloists who sing these English words represent the German and the English soldiers The work was written for Coventry cathedral which had been rebuilt after the old cathedral had been totally destroyed in World War II

For example Mozarts Requiem follows this In his requiem the Lux aeterna is the same as the Introitus with different words

Thes sequence has been fixed in the Council of Trent in the 16th century It was slightly modified in the Second Vatican Council

Middle C is the name given to the musical note C which is in the middle of the piano keyboard It is not actually quite the middle note of the keyboard but very nearly and of all the Cs on the piano it is the one nearest to the middle

When writing Middle C in music notation it is just below the stave when using the treble clef and just above the stave when using the bass clef This is shown in the first and last notes of the musical example below The Middle C sits on a leger line

On the piano the Middle C key is C4 

When starting to learn the piano most books make their easiest pieces start on Middle C This is because the right hand can then play tunes using 5 notes using white notes only It is also easy to recognize Middle C in notation It is also a help to find the correct place to sit at the piano One problem can be that young children learning the piano may think that all pieces start on Middle C Pieces can start anywhere on the keyboard

Middle C is the lowest note of the flute It is a fairly low note for a child or woman to sing but a fairly high note for a man to sing

Middle C vibrates at 262Hz

A principality is a country which is ruled by a prince or princess Principalities were common in the Middle Ages Some principalities that still remain today are Andorra Monaco and Liechtenstein Examples of subnational principalities are Asturias and Wales

Some states claim to be principalities but are not recognised by other countries Sealand Seborga the Principality of Hutt River in Australia and the Principality of Minerva in the Pacific These states are examples of micronations

Sometimes the word is also used to mean dependent territories in Africa Asia and India pre Columbian America and Oceania For these the word princely states is generally preferred especially if they came under the authority of a European colonial power

Vlad III Prince of Wallachia more commonly known as Vlad the Impaler was Prince of Wallachia Wallachia used to be a state which is now part of Romania He ruled three times in 1448 1456 1462 and 1476 

In the English speaking world Vlad is best known for the legends of the very cruel punishments he gave These may have given ideas for the vampire main character in Bram Stokers popular Dracula novel FactdateMarch 2007

As Prince he was fighting against the Turkish expansion

Wallachian royalty and family background 

The rulers of Wallachia did not give the crown to their sons The leader was chosen by the Romanian aristocrats boyars and had to be at least partly noble It did not matter if a prince was illegitimate or born outside of marriage This method often resulted in instability family disputes and murders There was also a struggle between the prince and the high nobility for control over the country The two powerful neighbors of Wallachia the Kingdom of Hungary and the Ottoman Empire were fighting for control of southeastern Europe This made Wallachia a battle ground

His father Vlad II Dracul born around 1395 was an illegitimate son of Mircea the Elder an important early Wallachian ruler As a young man he had joined the court of Sigismund of Luxemburg Holy Roman Emperor and King of Hungary who was supporting Vlad II for the throne of Wallachia A sign of this support was the fact that in 1431 Vlad II was made knight of the Order of the Dragon Who Vlad Draculas mother was is not sure Most likely she was a niece or daughter of the Moldavian prince Alexandru cel Bun Vlad III had three brothers The oldest probably named Mircea born before 1430 was at his fathers throne in 1442 He was sent by Vlad II to fight in his place during the war against the Turks in 1444 This war at Varna was lost Mircea and his father died in 1447 Vlad IV also known as Vlad Clugarul was born around 1425 to 1430 and was Vlads half brother Vlad the Monk spent many years in Transylvania waiting for a chance to get the throne of Wallachia Vlad the Monk was a monk until he became prince of Wallachia in 1482 Radu known as Radu cel Frumos the youngest brother was also Vlads most important rival as he continuously tried to replace Vlad on the throne He had the support of the Turks which he had strong connections Radu also was favoured by the Turkish Sultan Mehmed II

From his first marriage Vlad III had a son later prince of Wallachia as Mihnea cel Ru Mihnea the Evil His first wife whose name we do not know died during the war 1462 The legend says that the Turkish army surrounded Vlads castle the Poienari Castle led by his brother Radu the Handsome Vlads wife throw herself off the tower into the Arge River below the castle According to legend she remarked that she would rather have her body be eaten by the fish of the Arge than be captured by the Turks Vlad had another two sons with his second wife a relative of King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary

Vlad was very likely born in the city of Sighioara in Transylvania then a part of the Kingdom of Hungary during the winter of 1431 Sighioara was a military fortress at that time He was born as the second son to his father Vlad Dracul He had an older brother Mircea and a younger brother Radu the Handsome Although his native country was Wallachia the family lived in exile in Transylvania because his father had been chased away by pro Ottoman boyars

Vlads father was under considerable political pressure from the Ottoman sultan He gave a promise to be the vassal of the Sultan and gave up his two younger sons as hostages so that he would keep his promise

Vlad suffered much at the hands of the Ottoman and was locked up in an underground prison however his younger brother Radu caught the eye of the sultans son Radu was released and converted to Islam and he was allowed into the Ottoman royal court 

These years had a great influence on Vlad They shaped Vlads character He was often whipped and beaten by the Turks for being stubborn and rude He developed a well known hatred for Radu and for Mehmed who would later become the sultan

 Short reign and exile   Vlads father and Vlads older brother Mircea was dead at this point The Turks invaded Wallachia and the Sultan put Vlad III on the throne as his puppet ruler His rule at this time was short Hunyadi invaded Wallachia and chased him away the same year Vlad fled to Moldavia and was put under the protection of his uncle Bogdan II

Bogdan was assassinated Vlad took a chance and fled to Hungary Impressed by Vlads knowledge of the Ottoman Empire Hunyadi pardoned him and took him in as an adviser Later Hunyadi made him the Kingdom of Hungarys candidate for the throne of Wallachia

In 1456 Hungary invaded Serbia to chase away the Turks and at the same time Vlad III invaded Wallachia Both invasions were successful Hunyadi suddenly died of the plague Vlad became prince of Wallachia

Vlad was spending most of his time at the court of Trgovite He made laws met foreign ambassadors made public appearances and juged trials He reinforced some castles and probably enjoyed hunting with his friends The constant state of war since the death of his grandfather Mircea the Elder in 1418 led to increased crime levels and less agricultural production Trade had almost disappeared in Wallachia 

Vlad tried to solve these problems with severe methods He needed an economically stable country 

Vlad wanted to eliminate all threats to his power mainly the rival nobility groups for example the boyars This was done mainly by killing them and reducing the economic role of them

The Wallachian nobility had connections with the Saxon merchants The Saxons populated the free towns of Transylvania making trade to flourish Vlad was eliminating these towns trade privileges with Wallachia and he started war against them

The he gave key positions in the Princes Council to obscure individuals but who manifested loyalty towards Vlad Vlad preferred to knight men from the free peasants Vlad III was always on guard against the Dneti clan Some of his attacks into Transylvania may have been efforts to kill or capture Dneti princes Several members of the Dneti clan died at Vlads hands Rumors say that thousands of citizens of the free towns that sheltered his rivals were impaled by Vlad One captured Dneti prince was forced to read his own funeral speech while he kneeled before an open grave before his execution

There was a war between the Ottoman Empire and the Hungarian Kingdom Following family traditions Vlad decided to side with the Hungarians To the end of the 1450s there was once again talk about a war against the Turks in which the king of Hungary Matthias Corvinus would play the main role Knowing this Vlad stopped paying money to the Ottoman in 1459 and around 1460 made a new alliance with Corvinus The Turks did not like this and tried to remove him from power but they failed In the winter of 1461  Vlad attacked and devastated the area between Serbia and the Black Sea leaving over 20000 people dead

In response to this the Sultan Mehmed II headed towards Wallachia with an army of 60000 men in the spring of 1462 With his army of 20000 30000 men Vlad was not able to stop the Turks from entering Wallachia The Turks occupied the capital Trgovite and chased Vlad away Vlad was hiding and made small attacks on the Turks On the night of June 16 Vlad and some of his men entered the main Turkish camp wearing Turkish clothing and attempted to kill Mehmed Later the Turkish army retired and left Vlads brother Radu the Handsome as the new ruler prince Radu the Handsome gathered support from the nobility and Vlad fled to Hungary In August 1462 Radu made a deal with the Hungarian Crown

Vlad escaped to Hungary but he got imprisoned there The exact time of Vlads captivity is not sure Apparently his imprisonment was not too dangerous He was able to gradually win his way back into the graces of King Matthias He was able to meet and marry a member of the royal family however some believe that it is not likely that a prisoner was permitted to marry into the royal family He had two sons with his new wife Vlad also adopted Catholicism Diplomatic correspondence from Buda during this time show that Vlads actual period of imprisonment was short

The openly pro Turkish policy of Vlads brother Radu was probably a cause in Vlads rehabilitation It is interesting to note that the Russian texts normally very favorable to Vlad epe tells that even in captivity he could not give up his favorite games he often captured birds and mice which he to tortured and mutilate some were impaled on tiny spears

The years before his final release in 1474 Vlad lived with his new wife in a house in the Hungarian capital His sons were about ten years old when he reconquered Wallachia in 1476

Around 1475 Vlad and Stefan Bthory of Transylvania invaded Wallachia with a mixed force of Transylvanians some dissatisfied Wallachian boyars and Moldavians sent by Prince Stephen III of Moldavia Vlads cousin Vlads brother Radu the Handsome died a couple of years earlier and had been replaced on the Wallachian throne by another Turkish candidate Prince Basarab the Elder a member of the Dneti clan When Vlads army arrived Prince Basarabs army fled some to the Turks others in the mountains After placing Vlad epe on the throne Stephen Bthory and his forces returned to Transylvania leaving Vlad in a very weak position Vlad had little time to get support before a large Turkish army entered Wallachia to put back Prince Basarab on the throne Vlads cruelties over the years made the boyars to believe that they had a better chance to survive under Prince Basarab Even the peasants tired of the cruelty of Vlad abandoned him Vlad had to meet the Turks with the small forces at his disposal less than four thousand men

There are several variants of Vlad III the Impalers death Some sources say he was killed in battle against the Turks near Bucharest in December of 1476 Others say he was killed by disloyal Wallachian boyars in the war against the Turks or during a hunt Others believe Vlad was killed in the war surrounded by the bodies of his loyal Moldavian bodyguards Still other reports claim that Vlad was accidentally killed by one of his own men Vlads body was decapitated by the Turks and his head was sent to Istanbul preserved in honey The sultan had it displayed on a stake as proof that Kazkl Bey was dead The exact place of his grave is unknown

Romanian tales and legends about Vlad stayed a part of folklore among the Romanian peasants By constant retelling they have become confused and created an ideal picture of a big national hero Among the Romanian peasants Vlad epe was sometimes remembered as a prince who defended his country But the Romanian tales also remember Vlad as a very cruel and often capricious ruler There are several events that are common to all tales There is a tale about some foreign ambassadors received by Vlad epe at Trgovite and all versions agree that Vlad in response to some real or imagined insult had their hats nailed to their heads

A good description of Vlad Dracula survives courtesy of Nicholas of Modrussa who wrote He was not very tall but very stocky and strong with a cruel and terrible appearance a long straight nose distended nostrils a thin and reddish face in which the large wide open green eyes were enframed by bushy black eyebrows which made them appear threatening His face and chin were shaven but for a moustache The swollen temples increased the bulk of his head A bulls neck supported the head from which black curly locks were falling to his wide shouldered person 

His famous portrait was rediscovered in the late 1800s in the gallery of horrors at Innsbrucks Ambras Castle

Vlad III epe has been characterized by some as very cruel Impalement was epes preferred method of torture and execution His method of torture was a horse attached to each of the victims legs as a sharpened stake was gradually forced into the body 

Vlad often had the stakes arranged in various geometric patterns The most common pattern was a ring outside of a city that was his target The height of the spear indicated the rank of the victim The corpses were often left there for months 

Some say that thousands of people were impaled at a single time One such tale says 10000 were impaled in the Transylvanian city of Sibiu in 1460 Another tale says that on Saint Bartholomews Day Vlad the Impaler had 30000 of the merchants and officials of the free Transylvanian city of Braov impaled One of the most famous woodcuts of the period shows Vlad the Impaler feasting amongst a forest of stakes outside Braov while a nearby executioner cuts apart other victims

Impalement was Vlad the Impalers favorite but not his only method of torture The list of tortures include nails in heads cutting off of limbs strangulation burning cutting off of noses and ears mutilation of sexual organs scalping skinning exposure to the elements or to animals and boiling alive No one was immune to Vlad the Impalers attentions His victims included women and children peasants and great lords ambassadors from foreign powers and merchants However the vast majority of his European victims came from the merchants and boyars of Transylvania and his own country Wallachia Many have tried to justify Vlads actions on the basis of nationalism Most of the merchants in Transylvania and Wallachia were the German speaking Saxons who were seen as bad people because they were not Romanians He saw the boyars as people who were not loyal 

Almost as soon as he came to power he gave a party for his boyars and their families to celebrate Easter Vlad was aware that many of these nobles were part of the conspiracy around his fathers death Vlad to revenge his fathers death had all the assembled nobles arrested The older boyars were impaled on the spot The younger nobles and their families were marched north from Trgovite to the ruins of Poienari Castle in the mountains above the Arge River The boyars and their families were forced to work for months rebuilding the old castle According to the reports they worked until the clothes fell off their bodies and then were forced to continue working naked Very few survived the building of Vlads castle Vlad epe is believed to committed even more impalements and other tortures against the Turkish forces It was reported that an invading Ottoman army turned back when they saw thousands of rotting corpses impaled on the banks of the river Danube It has also been said that in 1462 Mehmed II returned to Constantinople after being sickened by the sight of 20000 impaled corpses outside of Vlads capital of Trgovite Many of the victims were Turkish prisoners of war

Much of the information we have about Vlad III epe comes from pamphlets published in the Holy Roman Empire and texts written in Russian The first known German texts dates from 1488 and it is possible that some were printed during Vlads lifetime The texts were also a form of mass entertainment in a society where the printing press was new The texts were reprinted many times over the thirty years following Vlads death The German texts painted Vlad epe as someone who terrorized the land and killed innocents The Russian texts took a somewhat different view The princes of Muscovy were also having trouble with boyars They preferred to see Vlads actions as justified Despite the differences in interpretation the texts regardless of their land of origin agree on details This make most historians to believe that some events actually occurred 

Vlads cruelty against his own people of Wallachia were seen as attempts to make them behave better According to the texts he was particularly cruel against women Young unmarried girls who lost their virginity unfaithful wives and widows who had sex were all targets of Vlads cruelty Such women often had their sexual organs cut out They were also often impaled FactdateFebruary 2007 Vlad wanted his people to work hard Merchants who cheated their customers were likely to be killed

 The vampire legend  It is unclear why Bram Stoker chose this Wallachian prince as the model for his fictional vampireFactdateFebruary 2007 Stoker was a friend of a Hungarian professor from Budapest and many have suggested that Vlads name might have been mentioned by this friend Regardless of how the name came to Stokers attention the cruel history of the Impaler was suitable for Stokers purposes The events of Vlads life happened in a region of the world that was still basically medieval in Stokers time There have always been vampire like creatures in various stories from across the world However the vampire as he became known in Europe largely originated in Southern Slavic and Greek folklore The vampire tale is virtually absent in Romanian culture A veritable epidemic of vampirism swept through Europe beginning in the late 17th century Philosophers in the West began to study the phenomenon It was during this period that Dom Augustine Calmet wrote his famous text on vampirism in Hungary It was also during this period that authors and playwrights first began to explore the vampire legend Stokers novel was a work in a long series of works that were inspired by the reports coming from the Balkans 

Perhaps it is natural that Stoker should place his great vampire in the heart of the region that gave birth to the story

The Fertile Crescent is a historical region in the Middle East that includes the Levant Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt These countries on a map together have a shape that is similar to a crescent so archaeologist James Henry Breasted spoke of the Fertile Crescent because he wanted to show the similarities of the cultures of this region in ancient times

All these lands are watered by important rivers Nile Jordan Euphrates and Tigris Together they cover some 400 500000 square kilometers and the region extends from the eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea around the north of the Syrian Desert and through the Jazirah and Mesopotamia to the Persian Gulf These areas are in present day Egypt Israel West Bank Gaza strip and Lebanon and parts of Jordan Syria Iraq south eastern Turkey and south western Iran The population of the Nile River basin is about 70 million the Jordan River basin about 20 million and the Tigris and Euphrates basins about 30 million giving the present day Fertile Crescent a total population of around 120 million or at least a quarter of the population of the Middle East

The Fertile Crescent has a very long record of past human activity

In art and symbolism a crescent is generally the shape produced when a circular disk has a segment of another circle removed from its edge so that what remains is a shape enclosed by two circular arcs of different diameters which intersect at two points

Crescent is a shape form or symbol

The Levant is a term in geography that refers to an area in the Middle East which includes the historic areas of Palestine Israel and Syria 

The Levant is bounded by the Taurus Mountains to the north the Mediterranean Sea to the west the northern Arabian Desert to the south and Upper Mesopotamia to the east 

The word Levant entered the English language in the 16th century together with the first English merchant adventurers in the region English ships appeared in the Mediterranean in the 1570s and the English merchant company signed its agreement with the Grand Turk in 1579

Today the word Levant is usually used by archaeologists and historians who are talking about the prehistory and the ancient and medieval history of the region as when discussing the Crusades The term is also used sometimes to refer to modern or contemporary events peoples states or parts of states in the same region such as Israel Jordan Lebanon Syria and the Palestinian territories

The Jordan River is a river in Southwest Asia that flows through the Great Rift Valley into the Dead Sea Many people think it is one of the worlds most broken wikt linksacredsacred rivers

It is 251 kilometers long Its tributaries are 

The four rivers join to form the Jordan in northern Israel near kibbutz Sede Nehemya The Jordan drops quickly in a 75 kilometer run to Lake Hula which is a little below sea level in the Galilee sea Then it drops much more in about 25 kilometers to the Sea of Galilee The last section has less gradient and the river begins to twist before it enters the Dead Sea which is about 400 meters below sea level and has no outlet Two major tributaries enter this last section from the east the Yarmouk River and Jabbok River

In 1964 Israel began operating a dam that takes water from the Sea of Galilee a major Jordan River water provider to the national water carrier Also in 1964 Jordan built a channel that takes water from the Yarmouk River a main tributary of the Jordan River This caused great damage to the ecosystem Syria has also built reservoirs that catch the Yarmouks waters

Muslim history began in Arabia when Muhammad broken wikt linkreciterecited the Quran in the 7th century The historical development of Islam has affected political economic and military trends both inside and outside the Islamic world

As with Christianity the concept of an Islamic world is useful when one looks at different periods of human history

After Muhammad died the Muslim leadership was assumed by Abu Bakr He was followed by Umar Uthman ibn Affan and then Ali These four are called the Rashidun caliphs which means The Righteous Caliphs The word caliph means religious and spiritual leader Under these caliphs Islam became one of the most important religions of the middle East Administrative offices of the Muslim nation were established Under Umar more than two thirds of the Eastern Roman Empire was conquered by the Muslims Umar also started the Muslim calendar

The first civil war in Islam also known as the broke out in Islam during the rule of the fourth caliph Ali and lasted throughout his caliphate The third caliph Uthman ibn Affan had been murdered by rebel Muslim groups who had political motives After Ali took over the most important problem he faced was that of punishing those responsible for murder However many people felt that before accepting the position of the caliph Ali should have focused his attention on finding and punishing the murderers A group of people led by Muhammads wife Aisha her brothers in law Talhah and Zubair ibn al Awam refused to recognize Alis caliphate They instead raised an army which met Alis army at Basra in Iraq originally for the purposes of negotiations In the night some fighting broke out probably out of confusion or due to rebel groups who were involved in the infamous murder This led to the Battle of Bassorah in which Alis party emerged victorious Aisha was escorted back to Medina honorably after the battle by Ali

This battle however did not entirely finish the tension in the Muslim empire Ali was soon challenged by Muawiyah the governor of the Muslim provinces of Syria He too raised the issue of punishing Uthmans murderers and refused to acknowledge Ali as caliph until the issue had been solved Muawiyah was a kinsman of Uthman and his army pledged to bring to justice the murderers and those who sheltered them This reference to people who are sheltering the murderers was towards Ali and his followers Accordingly the two groups met and fought a battle called the Battle of Siffin This battle ended in a draw and so both groups decided on arbitration which also did not lead to any concrete decision Another group of Muslims The Kharijites who had previously been with Ali meanwhile rejected him because they felt that he was not following true Islam and conducting business over the caliphate as if it were his own property

In the following years Alis governors could not prevent his losing provinces to Muawiyah who increased his strength by further expanding his army Ali had shifted the capital of the caliphate from Medina to Kufa in 656 He was killed by a Kharijite assassin in Kufa in 661

The history of Christianity is the history of the Christian religion and the Christian church from Jesus and his apostles to our times Christianity is the monotheistic religion that is based on the life and teaching of Jesus

Christianity began in the 1st century AD as a Jewish sect but quickly spread throughout the Greco Roman world Although it was originally persecuted under the Roman Empire it became the state religion in the end In the Middle Ages it spread into Northern Europe and Russia During the Age of Exploration Christianity expanded throughout the world it is the largest religion of the world

The religion had schisms and theological disputes that had as result three main branches the Roman Catholic Church the Eastern Orthodox churches and Protestant churches

The first Christians were more or less all ethnically Jewish or Jewish proselytes An early difficulty came from non Jewish converts There was the question if they had to become Jewish before becoming Christian The decision of St Peter was that they did not and the matter was further addressed with the Council of Jerusalem 

The doctrines of the apostles brought the Early Church into conflict with some Jewish religious authorities and this eventually led to the martyrdom of SS Stephen and James the Great and expulsion from the synagogues Thus Christianity got an identity distinct from Judaism The name Christian was first used for the disciples in Antioch as recorded in

The sources for the beliefs of the apostolic community include the Gospels and New Testament Epistles The very earliest reports are in these texts early Christian creeds and hymns and reports about the Passion the empty tomb and appearances of Jesus after his Resurrection There reasons to suppose that they were written within a few years of the crucifixion of Jesus and came from the Jerusalem Church

Christianity kept many practices from Jewish tradition Christianity thought the Jewish scriptures to be sacred and used mostly the Septuagint edition and translation as the Old Testament and added other texts as the New Testament canon developed Christians professed Jesus to be the God of Israel having taken human form and considered Jesus to be the Messiah who had been prophesied about in the Old Testament and so was expected by the people of Israel Christianity also continued other Judaic practices liturgical worship including the use of incense an altar a set of scriptural readings adapted from synagogue practice use of sacred music in hymns and prayer and a religious calendar as well as other typical features an exclusively male priesthood and broken wikt linkasceticascetic practices

The time when most of the apostles had died and their jobs as leaders of the Christian communities in the cities had been taken over by bishops is called post apostolic period It includes the time of persecutions until Christian worship was legalized under Constantine the Great The earliest recorded use of the term Christianity is from this period The term was used by Ignatius of Antioch c 107

Until the late fourth century when they became the dominant political force of the Roman Empire Christians were subject to various persecutions This meant even death That was the case with Stephen and James son of Zebedee Persecutions in lager scale by the authorities of the Roman Empire began with the year 64 when the Emperor Nero blamed them for the great Fire of Rome as the Roman historian Tacitus reported 

According to Church tradition it was under Neros persecution that the saints Peter and Paul became martyrs in Rome Similarly several of the New Testament writings mention persecutions and that they had very difficult times For 250 years there were times when Christians suffered from persecutions because they refused to worship the Roman emperor That was seen as treason and punished by execution But the Christian religion continued to spread throughout the Mediterranean region

Galerius issued an edict permitting the practice of the Christian religion under his rule in April of 311 In 313 Constantine I and Licinius announced toleration of Christianity in the Edict of Milan Constantine became the first Christian emperor By 391 under the reign of Theodosius I Christianity had become the state religion of Rome

The Emperor Constantine I had learnt about Christianity of his mother Helena But it is not clear if he adopted his mothers humble Christianity in his youth or if he adopted it later on in his life

When Christianity was legalized the Church took the same provinces for administration as the imperial government and called them dioceses

The Bishop of Rome claimed to be the highest amongst all others and chose the title pope 

During this era there were several Ecumenical Councils These were mostly concerned with Christological disputes The two Councils of Niceaea condemned the Arian heresy and produced a creed The Council of Ephesus condemned Nestorianism and affirmed the Blessed Virgin Mary to be Theotokos Perhaps the most important council was the Council of Chalcedon that affirmed that Christ had two natures fully God and fully man at the same time That meant that Monophysitism was condemned

The Church in the Early Middle Ages saw a transformation of the Roman world rather than a fall of the Roman Empire With the Muslim invasions of the seventh century the Western and Eastern areas of Christianity began to take on distinctive shapes and the Bishops of Rome were more interested in barbarian kings than in the Byzantine Emperors This led to the coronation of Charlemagne as Emperor of the Romans by Pope Leo III in Rome on Christmas Day 800

The city of Rome was affected very much by warfare in Italy during the Early Middle Ages Emperor Justinian I tried to restore imperial dominion in Italy against the gothic aristocracy The following campaigns were more or less successful and the Imperial Exarchate was established in Ravenna for Italy but imperial influence was often limited Then came the invasion of the Lombards and Rome had to take care of itself Thus the popes out of necessity found themselves feeding the city with grain from papal estates negotiating treaties paying protection money to Lombard warlords and failing that hiring soldiers to defend the city Eventually the failure of the Empire to send aid resulted in the popes turning for support from other sources most especially the Franks

The High Middle Ages is the period from the coronation of Charlemagne in 800 to the close of the fifteenth century which saw the fall of Constantinople the end of the Hundred Years War the discovery of the New World and thereafter the Protestant Reformation 

The Investiture Controversy also known as the lay investiture controversy was the most important conflict between secular and religious powers in medieval Europe It began as a dispute in the 11th century between the Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV and Pope Gregory VII The question was who would control appointments of bischops The end of lay investiture meant an important loss of royal power for the benefit Church reform as the pope intended and for ambitious noblemen as well 

Bishops collected revenues from estates attached to their bishopric Noblemen who held lands hereditarily passed those lands on within their family However because bishops had no legitimate children when a bishop died it was the kings right to appoint a successor So while a king had little recourse in preventing noblemen from acquiring powerful domains via inheritance and dynastic marriages a king could keep careful control of lands under the domain of his bishops Kings would bestow bishoprics to members of noble families whose friendship he wished to secure Furthermore if a king left a bishopric vacant then he collected the estates revenues until a bishop was appointed when in theory he was to repay the earnings The infrequence of this repayment was an obvious source of dispute The Church wanted to end this lay investiture because of the potential corruption not only from vacant sees but also from other practices such as simony Thus the Investiture Contest was part of the Churchs attempt to reform the episcopate and provide better pastoral care 

Pope Gregory VII issued the Dictatus Papae which declared that the pope alone could appoint or depose bishops or translate them to other sees Henry VIs rejection of the decree lead to his excommunication and a ducal revolt eventually Henry received absolution after dramatic public penance barefoot in Alpine snow and cloaked in a hairshirt though the revolt and conflict of investiture continued Likewise a similar controversy occurred in England between King Henry I and St Anselm Archbishop of Canterbury over investiture and ecclesiastical revenues collected by the king during an episcopal vacancy The English dispute was resolved by the Concordat of London 1107 where the king renounced his claim to invest bishops but continued to require an oath of fealty from them upon their election This was a partial model for the Concordat of Worms which resolved the Imperial investiture controversy with a compromise that allowed secular authorities some measure of control but granted the selection of bishops to their cathedral canons As a symbol of the compromise lay authorities invested bishops with their secular authority symbolized by the lance and ecclesiastical authorities invested bishops with their spiritual authority symbolized by the ring and the staff

The Crusades were a series of military conflicts conducted by Christian knights for the defense of Christians and for the expansion of Christian domains Generally the crusades refer to the campaigns in the Holy Land against Muslim forces sponsored by the Papacy There were other crusades against Islamic forces in southern Spain southern Italy and Sicily as well as the campaigns of Teutonic knights against pagan strongholds in Eastern Europe and crusades within Christendom against heretical groups

The Holy Land had been part of the Roman Empire and thus Byzantine Empire until the Islamic conquests of the seventh and eighth centuries Thereafter Christians had generally been permitted to visit the sacred places in the Holy Land until 1071 when the Seljuk Turks closed Christian pilgrimages and assailed the Byzantines defeating them at the Battle of Manzikert Emperor Alexius I asked for aid from Pope Urban II for help against Islamic aggression He probably expected money from the pope for the hiring of mercenaries Instead Urban II called upon the knights of Christendom in a speech made at the Council of Clermont on 27 November 1095 combining the idea of pilgrimage to the Holy Land with that of waging a holy war against infidels

The East West Schism or Great Schism separated the Church into Western and Eastern branches ie Western Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy It was the first major division since certain groups in the East rejected the decrees of the Council of Chalcedon and was far more significant Though normally dated to 1054 the East West Schism was actually the result of an extended period of estrangement between Latin and Greek Christendom over the nature of papal primacy and certain doctrinal matters like the filioque but intensified by cultural and linguistic differences

The official schism in 1054 was the excommunication of Patriarch Michael Cerularius of Constantinople followed by his excommunication of papal legates Attempts at reconciliation were made in 1274 and in 1439 but in each case the eastern hierarchs who consented to the unions were repudiated by the Orthodox as a whole though reconciliation was achieved between the West and what are now called the Eastern Rite Catholic Churches More recently in 1965 the mutual excommunications were rescinded by the Pope and the Patriarch of Constantinople though schism remains 

Both groups are descended from the Early Church both acknowledge the apostolic succession of each others bishops and the validity of each others sacraments Though both acknowledge the primacy of the Bishop of Rome Eastern Orthodoxy understands this as a primacy of honor with limited or no ecclesiastical authority in other dioceses

The Western Schism or Papal Schism was a prolonged period of crisis in Latin Christendom from 1378 to 1416 when there were two or more claimants to the See of Rome and thus it was difficult to discern who the true Pope was The conflict was political rather than doctrinal in nature

The Renaissance was a period of great cultural change and achievement marked in Italy by a classical orientation and an increase of wealth through mercantile trade The City of Rome the Papacy and the Papal States were all affected by the Renaissance On the one hand it was a time of great artistic patronage and architectural magnificence where the Church pardoned such artists as Michelangelo Brunelleschi Bramante Raphael Fra Angelico Donatello and da Vinci On the other hand wealthy Italian families often secured episcopal offices including the papacy for their own members some of whom were known for immorality such as Alexander VI and Sixtus IV

In the early 16th century movements were begun by two theologians Martin Luther and Ulrich Zwingli that aimed to reform the Church these reformers are distinguished from previous ones in that they considered the root of corruptions to be doctrinal and thus they aimed to change contemporary doctrines to accord with what they perceived to be the true gospel The Protestant Reformation is so called because the movements leaders protested against the ecclesiastical hierarchy and the pope essentially electing to institute their reforms separately from it The term Protestant however was not originally used by these leaders instead they called themselves evangelical emphasizing the return to the true gospel 

The beginning of the Protestant Reformation is generally identified with Martin Luther and the posting of the 95 Theses on the castle church in Wittenburg Germany Early protest was against corruptions such as simony episcopal vacancies and the sale of indulgences The Protestant position however would come to incorporate doctrinal changes such as sola scriptura and sola fide The three most important traditions to emerge directly from the Protestant Reformation were the Lutheran Reformed and Anglican traditions though the latter group identifies as both Reformed and Catholic and some subgroups reject the classification as Protestant 

The Protestant Reformation may be divided into two distinct but basically simultaneous movements the Magisterial Reformation and the Radical Reformation The Magisterial Reformation involved the alliance of certain theological teachers such as Luther Zwingli Calvin Cramner etc with secular magistrates who cooperated in the reformation of Christendom Radical Reformers besides forming communities outside state sanction often employed more extreme doctrinal change such as the rejection of tenants of the Councils of Nicaea and Chalcedon Often the division between magisterial and radical reformers was as or more violent than the general Catholic and Protestant hostilities

The Protestant Reformation spread almost entirely within the confines of Northern Europe but did not take hold in certain northern areas such as Ireland and parts of Germany By far the magisterial reformers were more successful and their changes more widespread than the radical reformers The Catholic response to the Protestant Reformation is known as the Counter Reformation or Catholic Reformation which resulted in a reassertion of traditional doctrines and the emergence of new religious orders aimed at both moral reform and new missionary activity The Counter Reformation reconvered approximately 33 of Northern Europe to Catholicism and initiated missions in South and Central America Africa Asia and even China and Japan Protestant expansion outside of Europe occurred on a smaller scale through colonization of North America and areas of Africa

Martin Luther was an Augustinian friar and professor at the University of Wittenberg In 1517 he published a list of 95 Theses or points to be debated concerning the illicitness of selling indulgences Luther had a particular disdain for Aristotelian philosophy and as he began developing his own theology he increasingly came into conflict with Thomistic scholars most notably Cardinal Cajetan  Soon Luther had begun to develop his theology of justification or process by which one is made right in the eyes of God In Catholic theology one is made righteous by a progressive infusion of grace accepted through faith and cooperated with through good works Luthers doctrine of justification differed from Catholic theology in that justification rather meant the declaring of one to be righteous where God imputes the merits of Christ upon one who remains without inherent merit In this process good works are more of an unessential byproduct that contribute nothing to ones own state of righteousness Conflict between Luther and leading theologians lead to his gradual rejection of authority of the Church hierarchy In 1520 he was condemned for heresy by the papal bull Exsurge Domine which he burned at Wittenburg along with books of canon law

John Calvin was a French cleric and doctor of law turned Protestant reformer He belonged to the second generation of the Reformation publishing his theological tome the Institutes of the Christian Religion in 1536 and establishing himself as a leader of the Reformed church in Geneva which became an unofficial capital of Reformed Christianity in the second half of the sixteenth century He exerted a remarkable amount of authority in the city and over the city council such that he has been called a Protestant pope Calvin established an eldership together with a consistory where pastors and the elders established matters of religious discipline for the Genevan population Calvins theology is best known for his doctrine of predestination which held that God had from all eternity providentially foreordained who would be saved and likewise who would be damned Predestination was not the dominant idea in Calvins works but it would seemingly become so for many of his Reformed successors

Unlike other reform movements the English Reformation began by royal influence Henry VIII considered himself a thoroughly Catholic King and in 1521 he defended the papacy against Luther in a book he commissioned entitled The Defense of the Seven Sacraments for which Pope Leo X awarded him the title Fidei Defensor However the king came into conflict with the papacy when he wished to annul his marriage with Catherine of Aragon for which he needed papal sanction Catherine among many other noble relations was the aunt of Emperor Charles V the papacys most significant secular supporter The ensuing dispute eventually lead to a break from Rome and the declaration of the King of England as head of the English Church England then experienced a period of frenetic and eclectic reforms some more radical and others more traditional under monarchs such as Edward VI and Elizabeth I and Archbishops of Canterbury such as Thomas Cranmer and William Laud What emerged was a state church that considered itself both Reformed and Catholic but not Roman and other unofficial more radical movements such as the Puritans

The Counter Reformation or Catholic Reformation was the response of the Catholic Church to the Protestant Reformation The essence of the Counter Reformation was a renewed conviction in traditional practices and the upholding of Catholic doctrine as the source of ecclesiastic and moral reform and the answer to halting the spread of Protestantism Thus it experienced the founding of new religious orders such as the Jesuits the establishment of seminaries for the proper training of priests renewed worldwide missionary activity and the development of new yet orthodox forms of spirituality such as that of the Spanish mystics and the French school of spirituality The entire process was spearheaded by the Council of Trent which clarified and reasserted doctrine issued dogmatic definitions and produced the Roman Catechism

Though Ireland Spain France and elsewhere featured significantly in the Counter Reformation its heart was Italy and the various popes of the time who established the Index Librorum Prohibitorum and the Roman Inquisition a system of juridical tribunals that prosecuted heresy and related offences The Papacy of St Pius V was known not only for its focus on halting heresy and worldly abuses within the Church but also for its focus on improving popular piety in a determined effort to stem the appeal of Protestantism Pius began his pontificate by giving large alms to the poor charity and hospitals and the pontiff was known for consoling the poor and sick and supporting missionaries The activities of these pontiffs coincided with a rediscovery of the ancient Christian catacombs in Rome As Diarmaid MacCulloch stated Just as these ancient martyrs were revealed once more Catholics were beginning to be martyred afresh both in mission fields overseas and in the struggle to win back Protestant northern Europe the catacombs proved to be an inspiration for many to action and to heroism

The First Great Awakening was a wave of religious enthusiasm among Protestants in the American colonies c 1730 1740 emphasizing the traditional Reformed virtues of Godly preaching rudimentary liturgy and a deep sense of personal guilt and redemption by Christ Jesus Historian Sydney E Ahlstrom saw it as part of a great international Protestant upheaval that also created Pietism in Germany the Evangelical Revival and Methodism in England It centered on reviving the spirituality of established congregations and mostly affected Congregational Presbyterian Dutch Reformed German Reformed Baptist and Methodist churches while also spreading within the slave population The Second Great Awakening unlike the first focused on the unchurched and sought to instill in them a deep sense of personal salvation as experienced in revival meetings It also sparked the beginnings of Restorationist groups such as the Mormons and the Holiness movement The Third Great Awakening began from 1857 and was most notable for taking the movement throughout the world especially in English speaking countries The final group to emerge from the great awakenings in North America was Pentecostalism which had its roots in the Methodist Wesleyan and Holiness movements and began in 1906 on Azusa Street in Los Angeles Pentecostalism would later lead to the Charismatic movement

Restorationism refers to various unaffiliated movements that considered contemporary Christianity in all its forms to be a deviation from the true original Christianity which these groups then attempted to Reconstruct often using the Book of Acts as a guidebook or sorts Restorationism developed out of the Second Great Awakening and is historically connected to the Protestant Reformation but differs in that Restorationists do not usually describe themselves as reforming a Christian church continuously existing from the time of Jesus but as restoring the Church that they believe was lost at some point The name Restoration is also used to describe the Latter day Saints and the Jehovahs Witness Movement

Fascism describes certain related political regimes in 20th century Europe especially the Nazi Germany of Hitler In his encyclical Non Abbiamo Bisogno Pope Pius XI declared that Fascist governments had hidden pagan intentions and expressed the irreconcilability of the Catholic position and Fascism which placed the nation above God and fundamental human rights and dignity Many Catholic priests and monastics were persecuted under the Nazi regime most notable the concentration camp victims Maximilian Kolbe and Edith Stein Furthermore many Catholic laypeople and clergy played notable roles in sheltering Jews during the Holocaust including Pope Pius XII Various incidents such as giving aid to downed Allied airmen nearly caused Nazi Germany to invade the Vatican before the liberation of Rome in 1944

The relationship between Nazism and Protestantism especially the German Lutheran Church is complex Though the majority of Protestant church leaders in Germany made little comment on the Nazis growing anti Jewish activities some such as Dietrich Bonhoeffer were strongly opposed to the Nazis Bonhoeffer was later found guilty in the conspiracy to assassinate Hitler and executed 

Fundamentalist Christianity is a movement that arose mainly within British and American Protestantism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in reaction to modernism and certain liberal Protestant groups that denied doctrines considered fundamental to Christianity yet still called themselves Christian Thus fundamentalism sought to reestablish tenants that could not be denied without relinquishing a Christian identity the fundamentals the Bible as Gods word viewed as the sole source of authority the virgin birth of Christ the doctrine of atonement through Jesus the bodily resurrection of Jesus and the imminent return of Christ

Ecumenism broadly refers to movements between Christian groups to establish a degree of unity through dialogue Ecumenism is derived from Greek which means the inhabited world but more figuratively something like universal oneness The movement can be distinguished into Catholic and Protestant movements with the latter characterized by a redefined ecclesiology of denominationalism

Concerning the Greek Orthodox Church steady movement was made to reconcile the East West Schism On 30 November 1894 Pope Leo XIII publishes the Apostolic Letter Orientalium Dignitas safeguarding the importance and continuance of the Eastern traditions for the whole Church On 7 December 1965 a Joint Catholic Orthodox Declaration of His Holiness Pope Paul VI and the Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras I was issued lifting the mutual excommunications of 1054

Concerning Catholic relations with Protestant communities certain commissions were established to foster dialogue and documents have been produced aimed at identifying points of doctrinal unity such as the Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification produced with the Lutheran World Federation in 1999

Ecumenical movements within Protestantism have focused on determining a list of doctrines and practices essential to being Christian and thus extending to all groups which fulfill these basic criteria a co equal status with perhaps ones own group still retaining a first among equal standing This process involved a redefinition of the idea of the Church from traditional theology This ecclesiology known as denominationalism contends that each group is a sub group of a greater Christian Church itself a purely abstract concept with no direct representation ie no group or denomination claims to be the Church Obviously this ecclesiology it at variance with other groups that indeed consider themselves to be the Church But moreover because the essential criteria generally consist of belief in the Trinity it has resulted in strife between these Protestant ecumenical movements and non Trinitarian groups such as Latter day Saints and Jehovahs Witnesses which are not often not regarded as Christian by these ecumenical groups

Western culture and Christian churches use the Gregorian calendar The Gregorian calendar has been in use since 1582 when it replaced the Julian Calendar The Julian calendar did not calculate the length of the year accurately The Gregorian Calendar added leap years to make this more correct The Gregorian calendar began in Europe in the reign of Pope Gregory XIII The Gregorian calendar is now used almost everywhere in the world 

The Gregorian calendar dates years from before or after the birth of Jesus Years that are before the birth of Jesus have the initials BC and years that are after have the initials AD Nowadays these are often written BCE and CE

The year one is the first year in anno Domini There is no year zero When the Gregorian calendar was calculated the mathematicians tried to work out exactly when the birth of Jesus happened The exact date is not certain but most agree that it was between 6 BC and 4 BC

The term Mass is used for different concepts in different fields of study

  

In the plural form the masses can mean 

An adjective describing a large amount of something as in 

In music the word mass means a piece of music to be sung by a choir which uses the words of the church service known as the Eucharist The words are in Latin as they are taken from the Roman Catholic service

The words of the mass that are not from the Ordinary are called the Proper These are words that may change in the service from day to day The Proper consists of the Introit Gradual Alleluia Tract Offertory and Communion There are also some words which are special for particular feast days

During the last two centuries many composers have written masses which were not meant to be sung in a church service they are written as concert pieces Some of them are quite long and fill a whole concert programme Some of the most famous masses are those by Bach Mozart Beethoven Schubert Berlioz Dvok Verdi Bruckner Faur and Vaughan Williams

Camille Saint Saens was a French composer pianist and organist He was one of the greatest composers of his day He composed lots of music of different kinds Among his best works are his Symphony no 3 Piano Concerto no 2 Violin Concerto no 3 Cello Concerto no 1 the opera Samson and Delilah and the Danse Macabre His most popular work however is the Carnival of the Animals Saint Saens hated being thought of as the composer of the Carnival of the Animals He said he had only written it for a bit of fun and he did not want anyone to perform it Today it still remains one of the most popular pieces for children 

Three months after Camille was born his father died Camille was often ill with tuberculosis when he was very small He was brought up by his mother and his aunt His aunt taught him the piano from when he was two When he was ten he played piano concertos by Beethoven and Mozart at a public concert playing everything from memory He was very good at school and was interested in lots of subjects including science and philosophy In 1858 he published some duets for harmonium and piano and he used the money to buy a telescope

He studied music at the Paris Conservatoire and was a brilliant student although he did not win the Prix de Rome He soon became known as a composer pianist and organist and he made many friends among them Gounod Berlioz and Rossini Liszt thought he was the greatest organist in the world Like Liszt Saint Sans was often very kind to other composers and helped them to become known by playing and conducting their music He was the first person to conduct Liszts symphonic poems in France He himself wrote symphonic poems such as Le Rouet dOmphale and Danse Macabre The idea of music which describes a story was quite a new idea at that time He also helped people to like Bach whose music had been forgotten for a long time

In the 1860s his fame spread and he also did some teaching at the Ecole Niedermeyer which educated young musicians for church music His pupils included Faure Messager and Gigout who all became life long friends He also founded the Societe Nationale de Musique which helped new music to be performed Faure Cesar Franck and Lalo were all members The society gave first performances of works by Saint Saens Chabrier Debussy Dukas and Ravel and others

Saint Saens married a 19 year old girl The marriage was not a success They had two sons who died within six weeks of one another the baby from an illness and the two year old from falling out of a fourth floor window Saint Saens blamed his wife and they eventually divorced

For many years Saint Saens travelled all over the world as a famous musician Eventually he became less popular in France but in England and America he was still very much admired He played for Queen Victoria and spent some time studying original manuscripts of Handel in the library of Buckingham Palace He was awarded the title of Doctor by the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge and was made a Commander of the Victorian Order because he had composed a march for the coronation of King Edward VII in 1902 He died in Algiers in 1921 His funeral was in the cathedral there and his body was then taken back to Paris where he was given a state funeral at the church of Madeleine

Saint Saens was more famous in the concert hall than he was in the theatre He wrote 13 operas but only one of them is still regularly performed Samson et Dalila One of the arias from this opera Ma cur souvre ta voix is especially famous

Saint Saens wrote many concertos symphonies sonatas and chamber music He often uses the style of dance music and creates a happy atmosphere by repeating certain patterns His music is late Romantic but based on the classical traditions rather than following the style of Wagner like many other French composers were doing at the time

Their second album The Promise was released in 2001 The album hit 2 on the charts but it quickly slipped from the charts In the same year they had their first concert with singer Kim Jo Han

The duo released two albums during this time Their third album Sea of Love was released while Joo was at New Jersey going to Rutgers University so Fany performed the songs by himself The album featured Condition of My Heart which was written by American singer Brian McKnight

Their fourth album Missing You was came out around the time when his manager died in a car crash Fany was especially shocked by his death because he was in the same car with his manager just hours before the incident

Gravity was their fifth and last album came out by SM Entertainment Their contract to the company ended soon after the release

Fly to the Sky signed on with PFull Entertainment after their first contract ended in 2004 They wanted a smaller label that cared less about money Fly to the Sky recorded their sixth studio album Transition in January 2006

The duo started their first tour in Korea called Fly To The Sky 2006 The Twice Tour Starting from Jamsil Arena in Seoul in May 2006 they had concerts in major Korean cities like Busan Daegu Junju and Kwangju

Abraham Bram Stoker was an Irish writer best remembered as the author of the influential horror novel Dracula

He was born on November 8 1847 at 15 Marino Crescentthen as now called The Crescentin Clontarf a coastal suburb of Dublin Ireland His parents were Abraham Stoker and the feminist Charlotte Mathilda Blake Thornley Stoker was the third of seven children Abraham and Charlotte were members of the Church of Ireland and attended the Clontarf parish church with their children where both were baptised Until he started school at the age of sevenwhen he made a complete astounding recoveryStoker was an invalid Of this time Stoker wrote I was naturally thoughtful and the leisure of long illness gave opportunity for many thoughts which were fruitful according to their kind in later years

After his recovery he became a normal young man even excelling as an athlete at Trinity College Dublin from which he was graduated with honors in mathematics He was auditor of the College Historical Society and president of the University Philosophical Society where his first paper was on Sensationalism in Fiction and Society In 1876 while employed as a civil servant in Dublin he wrote theater reviews for The Dublin Mail a newspaper partly owned by fellow horror writer J Sheridan Le Fanu His interest in theatre led to a lifelong friendship with the English actor Henry Irving In 1878 Stoker married Florence Balcombe a celebrated beauty whose former suitor was Oscar Wilde The couple moved to London where Stoker became business manager of Irvings Lyceum Theatre a post he held for 27 years The collaboration with Irving was very important for Stoker Through him he became involved in Londons high society where he met among other notables James McNeil Whistler and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle In the course of Irvings tours he got the chance to travel around the world

They had one son Irving Noel Stoker who was born 31 December 1879

He supplemented his income by writing a large number of sensational novels his most famous being the vampire tale Dracula which he published in 1897 Before writing Dracula Stoker spent eight years researching European folklore and stories of vampires Dracula is an epistolary novel written as collection of diary entries telegrams and letters from the characters as well as fictional clippings from the Whitby and London newspapers Stokers inspiration for the story was a visit to Slains Castle near Aberdeen The bleak spot provided an excellent backdrop for his creation 

Dracula has been the basis for countless movies and plays The first was Nosferatu directed by Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau and starring Max Schreck as Count Orlock Nosferatu was produced while Florence Stoker Bram Stokers widow and literary executrix was still alive Represented by the attorneys of the British Incorporated Society of Authors she eventually sued the filmmakers Her chief legal complaint was that she had been neither asked for permission for the adaptation nor paid any royalty The case dragged on for some years with Mrs Stoker demanding the destruction of the negative and all prints of the movie The suit was finally resolved in the widows favour in July 1925 Some copies of the movie survived however and Nosferatu is now widely regarded as an innovative classic The most famous movie version of Dracula is the 1931 production starring Bela Lugosi and which spawned several sequels that had little to do with Stokers novel

Stoker wrote several other novels dealing with horror and supernatural themes but none of them achieved the lasting fame or success of Dracula His other novels include The Snakes Pass The Jewel of Seven Stars and The Lair of the White Worm

Criss Angel was the guest host of the March 8 2010 version of WWE Monday Night Raw

Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet was an American teacher and the founder of the American School for the Deaf He founded the school in 1817

Gallaudet was born in Philadelphia Pennsylvania He went to Yale University He got his bachelors degree in 1805 and masters degree in 1808 He wanted to do many things for example study law or study religion In 1814 Gallaudet became a preacher 

Gallaudet chose not to become a preacher when he met Alice Cogswell the nine year old deaf daughter of a neighbor Dr Mason Cogswell He taught her many words by writing them in the dirt Cogswell asked Gallaudet to go to Europe to learn ways for teaching deaf people 

While in Great Britain he met Abb Sicard head of a school for deaf people in Paris and two of its deaf teachers Laurent Clerc and Jean Massieu Sicard asked Gallaudet to go to Paris to study the schools ways of teaching the deaf Gallaudet studied with Sicard He learned sign language from Massieu and Clerc who were both graduates of the school

Gallaudet asked Clerc to go back to America with him The two men toured New England and got money to create a school for deaf students in Hartford Connecticut which later became known as the American School for the Deaf Young Alice was one of the first seven students in the United States

Annelids are a phylum of Invertebrates Sometimes they are called by their Latin name Annelida They include the segmented worms with about 150000 known species Well known species are earthworms and leeches Annelids can be found in most wet environments Some of these species are parasitic or mutualistic This means they live together with another organism A mutualistic relationship is beneficial to both organisms Their size varies from under a millimetre to about 3 metres The largest known species is the seep tube worm which is related to the giant tube worm

Annelids are made of one or more body segments Each segment has one or more rings These rings are called annuli Annelids reproduce sexually by hermaphroditic cross fertilization Annelid Worms have nerve tissue a ganglia that makes up a primitive brain a heart and segmented body parts They can regenerate cut off pieces of their body Unlike sponges which can come back together if ripped apart They have a hydrostatic skeleton a 1 way digestion system and bilateral symmetry

Polychaetes or bristle worms are a class of annelid worms 

They are generally found in a marine environment There are more than 10000 known species in this class 

Each of their body segments has some fleshy protrusions that stand out These parapodia have many bristles which are made of chitin This is different from the Oligochaeta which are similar in form but only have a few bristles 

Common animals of the group are the lugworm and the clam worm Nereis

Polychaetes are segmented worms generally less than convert10cmin in length although ranging at the extremes from convert1mmin to convert3mft They are often brightly coloured and may be iridescent or even luminescent 

Each segment bears a pair of paddle like parapodia which are used for movement In many species the parapodia well supplied with blood vessels act as the worms primary respiratory surfaces Bundles of bristles called setae project from the parapodia

Some bristle worms have poison bristles The bristles will break off in the skin of a predator that tries to pick up the animal and sting the predator painfully

The head or prostomium is relatively well developed compared with other annelids It projects forward over the mouth which therefore lies on the animals underside The head normally includes two to four pair of eyes although there are some blind species These are fairly simple structures capable of distinguishing between light and dark Some species have large eyes with lenses that may be capable of more sophisticated vision

The head also includes a pair of antennae tentacle like palps and a pair of pits lined with cilia known as nuchal organs These latter appear to be chemoreceptors which help the worm seek out food

Polychaetes are extremely variable in both form and lifestyle Most burrow or build tubes in the sediment some swim among the plankton and some live as commensals A few are parasitic 

The mobile forms tend to have well developed sense organs and jaws while the stationary forms lack them but may have specialized gills or tentacles used for respiration and deposit or filter feeding eg fanworms

A few groups have evolved to live in terrestrial environments but are restricted to humid areas Some have even evolved tubes that open inwards from the skin which work like simple lungs absorbing oxygen from the air and allowing release of waste gases

Most bristle worms are scavengers but some are good predators eating fishes and coral Others like to eat algae They are usually found hiding in reefs and rocky places They crawl along the sea floor or the bottom of a tide pool looking for something to eat

The lugworm or sandworm is a large worm of the phylum Annelida Lugworms make the coiled tubes of sand that are a familiar sight on a beach at low tide but the lugworm itself is not seen except by people who dig them up from curiosity or to use as fishing bait

The lugworm can grow to a size of about 9 inches Its body is segmented like that of an earthworm It has bristles in the middle of its body It is a polychaete It also has well developed blood vessels and gills to breathe in the water 

 ImageWattwurm altjpgA lug worm ImageWattwurm jungjpgA young lugworm in its burrow 

The Common clam worm is a widely distributed polychaete worm It is often referred to as a ragworm or sandworm or simply as the clam worm but these terms can all refer to any one of a number of other species of the genus Nereis The name common clam worm is less ambiguous but is also sometimes used for other Nereis species such as N virens and N limbata It is similar to a millipede

The common clam worm can reach up to 15 centimeters in length but most specimens are smaller than this It is brown coloured at the rear and reddish brown on the rest of its body It has an identifiable head with four eyes two sensory feelers or palps and eight tentacles 

It is a freeswimming polychaete scavenging on the bottom of shallow marine waters It feeds on other worms and algae To feed it uses a proboscis which has two hooks at the end to grasp prey and draw it into its mouth Clamworms are an important food source for bottom feeding fish and crustaceans though they can protect themselves by secreting a mucus substance that hardens to form a sheath around them

During lunar phases in the spring and early summer the clam worm undergoes heterogenesis Their parapodia enlarge so they can swim The clamworms are then capable of releasing eggs and sperm After they have released their egg or sperm they die

Planktonic larvae develop grow into annelids and eventually sink to the bottom of the water

Protozoa from Greek first life are small organisms They are single celled heterotrophic eukaryotes which eat bacteria and other protists 

They are Protista and are classified in a number of different phyla Both Protozoa and Protista are not monophyletic but rather convenient hold alls 

Protozoa are of many different kinds Some protozoa are parasites

The name Sandworm can refer to different species

It can also stand for huge worms in the book Dune by Frank Herbert see Sandworm

Hematophagy is the habit of certain animals to feed on blood Blood is rich in proteins Examples of animals that feed on blood are mosquitoes vampire bats and leeches

The Crinoids are a class of Echinoderms They have two forms the sea lilies stalked forms attached to the sea floor and the feather stars which are free living

All crinoids are marine and live both in shallow water and in depths as great as 6000 meters The basic echinoderm pattern of fivefold symmetry can be recognized but most crinoids have many more than five arms Crinoids have a mouth on the top surface that is surrounded by feeding arms

The crinoids have a long history They were the first echinoderms to appear in the fossil record and have kept their early structure throughout their long career They were extremely common in the Palaeozoic and some rocks from the Carboniferous consist almost entirely of fossil crinoids 

Crinoids mouths faces up towards the surface of the ocean and the stalked forms feed on the detritus which comes down to the bottom The mouth is surrounded by many feathery tentacles They have a U shaped gut and their anus is located next to the mouth

 History  The crinoids were almost wiped out by the extinction event at the end of the Palaeozoic era Four whole classes became extinct and the few that survived became the only living class the Articulata The stalked members of the class sufered from heavy predation in the Mesozoic and now all the remaining sea lilies are in deep water where the competition is less fierce The feather stars have been much more successful

In 2005 a stalked crinoid was recorded pulling itself along the sea floor off the Grand Bahama Island The recording showed a crinoid moving at much faster speeds than was thought possible

The free living feather stars first appear in the Upper Triassic As juveniles they are attached to the sea bottom by a stalk as their ancestors were In the adult stage they break away from the stalk and can move about Some can swim by undulating movements of the arms Usually feather stars creep about by using projections at the bottom of the crown called cirri They are the only crinoids in shallow water and are all in the Order Comatulidae Their flexible arms and ability to choose their feeding grounds was undoubtedly important in their success and survivalp293

Feather stars arrange themselves so the fan faces the flow of the current The posture serves to present the maximum area of food collecting surfaces to the incoming water flow so that more particles will settle on them They are found mostly in shallow water

The Yorkshire Dales is the name given to an upland area mostly in Yorkshire in Northern England Most of the area falls within the Yorkshire Dales District National Park created in 1954 The Dales is one of the twelve National parks of England and Wales The area is so called because it is a collection of river valleys and the hills in between them The area is mainly in the historic county of Yorkshire but today is partly in three modern counties North Yorkshire West Yorkshire and Cumbria

Biogas means a gas produced by the anaerobic digestion or fermentation of organic matter in an environment without oxygen The organic matter can be manure sewage sludge municipal solid waste biodegradable waste or any other biodegradable feedstock Biogas is mainly methane and carbon dioxide

Depending on where it is produced biogas is also called

Biogas can be used as a vehicle fuel or for generating electricity It can also be burned directly for cooking heating lighting process heat and absorption refrigeration

Biogas production by anaerobic digestion is popular for treating biodegradable waste because valuable fuel can be produced while destroying disease causing pathogens and reducing the volume of disposed waste products The methane in biogas burns more cleanly than coal and produces more energy with less emissions of carbon dioxide The harvesting of biogas is an important role of waste management because methane is a greenhouse gas with a greater global warming potential than carbon dioxide The carbon in biogas was generally recently extracted from the atmosphere by photosynthetic plants so releasing it back into the atmosphere adds less total atmospheric carbon than the burning of fossil fuels

The composition of biogas varies depending upon the origin of the anaerobic digestion process Landfill gas typically has methane concentrations around 50 Advanced waste treatment technologies can produce biogas with 55 75CH4

A liturgy is a ceremony according to the traditions of a particular group or event In religion it may mean an elaborate formal ritual or a daily activity such as the Muslim Salats Anglican Orthodox Lutheran or other groups when using the words the Liturgy normally mean a standardized order of events observed during a religious service often including the Eucharist The open or waiting worship of Quakers is an example of a non liturgical service because there is no minister or structured order of events 

In the Christian church liturgical churches are those that use a well defined liturgy dating to the second century and earlier in which many of the words and music used follow basic patterns each time the service is conducted Most Orthodox Catholic Anglican and Lutheran churches are liturgical most other churches to a far lesser extent So called non liturgical churches usually follow a common worship sequence from one service to the next with several elements common to many such services These elements often include readings from the Bible hymns a sermon offerings of money and at certain times Holy Communion 

This article is about mass as a ceremony for other uses see Mass

Mass is the term used to describe celebration of the Eucharist in the Western liturgical rites of the Roman Catholic Church Old Catholic Churches in the Anglo Catholic tradition of Anglicanism and in some largely High Church Lutheran regions in Scandinavian and Baltic countries the Lutheran Eucharistic service is also known as the Mass 

The term comes from the late Latin word missa a word used in the concluding formula of Mass in Latin Ite missa est

The woodpeckers and its near relatives the piculets wrynecks and sapsuckers are the family Picidae They are near passerine birds Members of the Picidae are found worldwide except for the parts of old Gondwana which they did not get to Australia New Zealand Madagascar and Antarctica Most species live in forests or woodland habitats

The Picidae are just one of the eight living families in the order Piciformes DNA sequence analyses have shown they are a clade

There are about 200 species and about 30 genera in this family Many species are threatened or endangered due to loss of habitat or habitat fragmentation

All the special features of the woodpeckers are adaptations to their mode of life

Members of the family Picidae have strong bills for drilling and drumming on trees and long sticky tongues for extracting food The bills of piculets and wrynecks are shorter and less strong and sharp than those of woodpeckers but their morphology is very similar 

The woodpecker bills chisel like tip is kept sharp by the pecking action on wood With their smaller bill size many piculets and wrynecks will forage in decaying wood more often than woodpeckers The long sticky tongues which have bristles help the birds grab and extracting insects from deep in a hole of a tree Detailed studies published in 2004 showed that the tongue wraps around the prey before being pulled out

Many of the foraging breeding and signalling behaviours of woodpeckers involve drumming and hammering using the bill To prevent brain damage from the rapid and repeated decelerations woodpeckers have evolved a number of adaptations which protect the brain These include small brain size the orientation of the brain within the skull and the short duration of contact 

The unequal length of the upper and lower parts of their beaks serves to steer the impact force downwards away from the brain Also the woodpeckers brain is held in a skull with uneven spongy plates that absorb shock Third woodpeckers have a special hyoid bone which reaches from their beak loops over top of the skull to completely surround their brains This acts to keep the brain in place It is the movement of the brain inside the skull during impact more than the blow itself that causes concussions If the brain is held in place injury risks are greatly reduced

The millisecond before contact with wood a thickened nictitating membrane closes protecting the eye from flying debris The nostrils are also protected they are often slit like and have special feathers to cover them

Woodpeckers piculets and wrynecks all have zygodactyl feet These feet have four toes the first and the fourth face backward and the second and third face forward This foot arrangement is good for grasping the limbs and trunks of trees Members of this family can walk vertically up a tree trunk In addition to the strong claws and feet woodpeckers have short strong legs This is typical of birds that regularly forage on trunks The tails of all woodpeckers except the piculets and wrynecks are stiffened and when the bird perches on vertical surfaces the tail and feet work together to support it

Piri Reis was an Ottoman Turkish admiral and cartographer born between 1465 and 1470 in Gallipoli on the Aegean coast of Turkey Today people remember him because of the maps he made He made the first Ottoman map to show parts of the Americas the Piri Reis map in 1513 He drew a second map in 1528 Only a fragment of that map survives today That fragment however shows parts of North America including Greenland It goes from the coast of Labrador and Newfoundland in the north to FloridaCuba and parts of Central America in the south Therefore some people believe he drew a map of the Arctic about 200 years before it was discovered

After Nute Gunray the viceroy of the Trade Federation loses Queen Amidala Darth Sidious sends Darth Maul to track her down Darth Maul follows her to Tatooine where he sends out probe droids to find her As Anikan the Queen and the Qui Gon Jin get ready to leave the planet Darth Maul attacks on his speeder and Maul and Qui Gon battle After losing the Queen Darth Sidious sends Darth Maul to Naboo to watch over the planet When the Queen launches an attack Darth Maul shows himself again This time Qui Gon Jinn and Obi Wan Kenobi start to battle with him Darth Maul kills Qui Gon and almost pushes Obi Wan down a pit In the end Obi Wan uses Qui Gons lightsaber to cut Darth Maul in half

Probe droids are robots in the Star Wars movies They are used for spying and finding people Darth Maul used probe droids to find Queen Amidala and the Jedi in The Phantom Menace In The Empire Strikes Back the Imperials use the probe droids to find the Rebel base

Count Dooku of Serenno is a character from the Star Wars universe Dooku is one of the major characters in Episode II Attack of the Clones 

The Clone Wars was a period in the Star Wars movies They had the Jedi and the clone troopers vs the Sith and the Battle Droids

Prokaryotes are the simplest living things bacteria and archaea They generally do not have a cell nucleus nor cell organelles however a small number of exceptions have been found

The word describes a type of cell The name comes from Greek pro and karion meaning nut or kernel Prokaryotes are cells that do not have a cell nucleus and lack other things eukaryotes have Prokaryotes do not have membranes inside the cell This means that there are no vacuoles Golgi apparatus endoplasmic reticula or other organelles inside the cell 

Prokaryotes are unicellular They are either bacteria or archaea The Archaea include simple organisms that were first discovered in extreme environments Most of them can survive at very high or very low temperatures Some of them can also survive in highly salty acidic or alkaline water Some have been found in geysers black smokers or oil wells 

Cells with a nucleus are called Eukaryotes Eukaryote cells include organelles which were once free living prokaryotes These are like cells but they do not have any organelles they actually infect in the cells a virus infects a cell by attaching to it and injecting viral nucleic acid Eventually the nucleic acid directs the cell to make more viral nucleic acid and protein coats

Cuttlebone is a hard brittle structure found inside cuttlefish It is made mainly of calcium carbonate The cuttlefish use it to control floating Cuttlebones have been used to make polishing powder This was then added to toothpaste Today cuttlebone is mainly used for caged birds and turtles so they get their calcium

Saint James son of Zebedee was one of the disciples of Jesus He was the son of Zebedee and Salome and brother of John the Evangelist He is called Saint James the Greater to distinguish him from the other apostle named James James is described as one of the first disciples who joined Jesus The Synoptic Gospels tell that James and John were with their father by the seashore when Jesus called them to begin traveling According to Mark James and John were called Boanerges or the Sons of Thunder Acts of the Apostles 1212 records that King Herod had James executed by sword He was likely the first of the apostles martyred for his faith

According to ancient local tradition on 2 January of the year AD 40 the Virgin Mary appeared to James on the bank of the Ebro River at Caesaraugusta while he was preaching the Gospel in Spain She supposedly appeared upon a pillar Nuestra Seora del Pilar and that pillar is conserved and venerated within the present Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar in Zaragoza Spain Following that apparition St James returned to Judea where he was beheaded by King Herod Agrippa I in the year 44 

The translation of his relics from Judea to Galicia in the northwest of Iberia was effected in legend by a series of miraculous happenings decapitated in Jerusalem with a sword by Herod Agrippa himself his body was taken up by angels and sailed in a rudderless unattended boat to Iria Flavia in Spain where a massive rock closed around his relics which were later removed to Compostela The 12th century Historia Compostellana gives a summary of the legend of St James as it was believed at Compostela Two ideas are central to it first that St James preached the gospel in Spain as well as in the Holy Land second that after his martyrdom at the hands of Herod Agrippa I his disciples carried his body by sea to Spain where they landed at Padrn on the coast of Galicia and took it inland for burial at Santiago de Compostela 

The authenticity of the sacred relics of Compostela was asserted in the Bull of Pope Leo XIII Omnipotens Deus of 1 November 1884 

The tradition at Compostela placed the discovery of the relics of the saint in the time of king Alfonso II and of bishop Theodemir of Iria These traditions were the basis for the pilgrimage route that began to be established in the 9th century and the shrine dedicated to James at Santiago de Compostela in Galicia in Spain became the most famous pilgrimage site in the Christian world St Jamess Way is a tree of routes that cross Western Europe and arrive at Santiago through Northern Spain Eventually James became the patron saint of Spain

The name James in English comes from Iacobus in Latin In eastern Spain Jacobus became Jacome or Jaime in Catalunya it became Jaume in western Spain it became Iago and Portugal and Galicia it was Tiago Saint James became Sant Iago which was abbreviated to Santiago Jamess emblem was the scallop shell and pilgrims to his shrine often wore that symbol on their hats or clothes

Saint James could mean any of the following

The Vampire squid is a small deep sea cephalopod It can be found throughout the temperate and tropical oceans of the world 

It has special filaments it can retract because of this it has been placed in its own order Vampyromorphida It is similar to both squid and octopus It is the only surviving member of its order It was first described and mistakenly identified as an octopus in 1903

The vampire squid can grow to about 30 cm in total length It is no threat to humans Its 15 cm gelatinous body varies in color between velvety jet black and pale reddish depending on location and lighting conditions A webbing of skin connects its eight arms each lined with rows of fleshy spines or cirri The inside of this cloak is black Only the distal half of the arms have suckers Its limpid globular eyeswhich appear red or blue also depending on lightingare proportionately the largest in the animal kingdom at 25 cm in diameter

Mature adults have a pair of ear like fins These fins stand out from the lateral sides of the mantle They serve as the adults primary means of propulsion Vampire Squid are said to fly through the water by way of flapping their fins Their powerful beak like jaws are as white as ivory Within the webbing are two pouches These pouches hide the tactile velar filaments The filaments are analogous to a true squids tentacles extending well past the arms however they are a different arm pair than the squids tentacles Instead the filaments are the same pair that were lost by the ancestral octopuses

The Vampire Squid is covered entirely in light producing organs called photophores The animal has great control over the organs It is capable of producing disorienting flashes of light for fractions of a second to several minutes in duration The intensity and size of the photophores can also be varied Appearing as small white discs the photophores are larger and more complex at the tips of the arms and at the base of the two fins They are absent from the underside of the caped arms Two larger white areas on top of the head were initially believed to be photophores too but have turned out to be photoreceptors

The chromatophores common to most cephalopods are poorly developed in Vampire Squid While this means the animal is not capable of changing its skin colour in the dramatic fashion of shallow dwelling cephalopods such trickery is not needed at the pitch black depths in which it lives

The Vampire Squid is an extreme example of a deep sea cephalopod People think it lives at aphotic depths from 600 900 metres or more Within this region of the worlds oceans is a discrete habitat known as the oxygen minimum zone Within the OMZ oxygen saturation is too low to support aerobic metabolism in most higher organisms Nonetheless the Vampire Squid is able to live normally in the OMZ at oxygen saturations as low as 3 something no other cephalopodand few other animalscan do

In order to cope with life in this habitat vampire squid have developed several radical adaptations Of all deep sea cephalopods their metabolic rate is the lowest Their blue blood hemocyanin binds and transports oxygen most efficiently aided by gills with especially large surface area The animals have weak musculature but maintain agility and buoyancy with little effort thanks to sophisticated statocysts and ammonium rich gelatinous tissues closely matching the density of the surrounding seawater

At the shallower end of the Vampire Squids vertical range the view from below is like the sky at twilight The highly sensitive eyes of deepwater dwellers are able to distinguish the silhouettes of other animals moving overhead To combat this the vampire squid generates its own bluish light in a strategy called counterillumination The light diffuses the animals silhouette effectively cloaking its presence from the watchful eyes below Its own large eyes detect even the faintest of gleams A pair of photoreceptors are located on top of its head perhaps alerting the animal to movements above

Like other deep sea cephalopods Vampire Squid have no ink sacs If threatened instead of ink a sticky cloud of bioluminescent mucus containing innumerable orbs of blue light is ejected from the arm tips This luminous barrage which may last nearly 10 minutes is presumably meant to daze would be predators and allow the Vampire Squid to disappear into the blackness without the need to swim far The display is made only if the animal is very agitated

Their development goes through three forms the very young animals have a single pair of fins an intermediate form has two pairs and the mature form again has one As the animals grow and their surface area to volume ratio drops the fins are resized and repositioned in order to maximize gait efficiency Whereas the young propel themselves primarily by jet propulsion mature adults find flapping their fins to be the most efficient means This unique ontogeny caused confusion in the past with the varying forms identified as several species in distinct families

The Vampire Squid likely reproduces slowly by way of a small number of large eggs Growth is slow as food is not abundant at depths where the animals live The vastness of their habitat and its sparse population make procreative encounters a fortuitous event The female may store a males hydraulically implanted spermatophore for long periods before she is ready to fertilize her eggs Once she does she may need to brood over them for up to 400 days before they hatch The female will not eat towards this culmination and dies shortly thereafter

Hatchlings are about 8 mm in length and are well developed miniatures of the adults with some differences Their arms lack webbing their eyes are smaller and their velar filaments are not fully formed The hatchlings are transparent and survive on a generous internal yolk for an unknown period before they begin to actively feed The smaller animals frequent much deeper waters perhaps feeding on marine snow

What behavioral data known has been gleaned from ephemeral encounters with ROVs animals are often damaged during capture and survive for no more than about two months in aquaria An artificial environment makes reliable observation of non defensive behavior difficult

With their long velar filaments deployed Vampire Squid have been observed drifting along in the deep black ocean currents If the filaments contact an entity or if vibrations impinge upon them the animals investigate with rapid acrobatic movements They are capable of swimming at speeds equivalent to two body lengths per second with an acceleration time of five seconds However their weak muscles limit stamina considerably

Unlike their relatives living in more hospitable depths deep sea cephalopods cannot afford to spend energy in protracted flight Given their low metabolic rate and the low density of prey at such depths Vampire Squid must use innovative predator avoidance tactics in order to save energy Their aforementioned bioluminescent fireworks are combined with the writhing of glowing arms erratic movements and escape trajectories These features make it difficult for a predator to home in 

In a threat response called pumpkin or pineapple posture the Vampire Squid inverts its caped arms back over the body presenting an ostensibly larger form covered in fearsome looking though harmless spines The underside of the cape is heavily pigmented masking most of the bodys photophores The glowing arm tips are clustered together far above the animals head diverting attack away from critical areas If a predator were to bite off an arm tip the Vampire Squid can regenerate it

Copepods prawns and cnidarians have all been reported as prey of Vampire Squid Little else is known regarding their feeding habits Considering their environmentthey are unlikely to be picky about food Vampire Squid have been found among the stomach contents of large deepwater fish deep diving whales and pinnipeds such as sea lions

The Vampyromorphida are characterized by the possession of photophores a peculiar type of uncalcified endoskeleton called gladius 8 webbed arms and the 2 velar filaments Until fairly recently known only from the modern species and some fossil remains tentatively allocated to this group a batch of Middle Jurassic c165 164 million years ago specimens found at La Voulte sur Rhne demonstrated that clearly vampyromorphid cephalopods were in existence for far longer than has been hitherto believed These were described as Vampyronassa rhodanica 

The supposed vampyromorphids from Solnhofen limestone Plesioteuthis prisca Leptoteuthis gigas and Trachyteutis hastiformis are large species and show features not found in vampyromorphids They are similar to the true squids Teuthida

Gwinnett County is a county in the American state of Georgia The county seat of Gwinnett County is Lawrenceville The county was created on December 15 1818 In 2006 the Census bureau says there were 754104 people living in Gwinnett County

Dill is a short lived annual herb that is often used as a spice to make food taste better 

Fresh and dried dill leaves are used as herbs

Like caraway its fernlike leaves are aromatic and are used to flavor many foods such as gravlax borscht and other soups cream cheese and pickles Dill is said to be best when used fresh as it lose its flavor rapidly if dried however freeze dried dill leaves preserve their flavor relatively well for a few months

Dill seed is used as a spice with a flavor similar to caraway

Dill oil can be extracted from the leaves stems and seeds of the plant 

Mummification is a process Through it the skin and flesh of a corpse can be preserved The process can occur either naturally or it can be intentional If it occurs naturally it is the result of cold acid or dryness 

Intentional mummification was common in ancient Egypt especially for burying Egyptian pharaohs It takes about 70 days to completely mummify a dead body The first step is to push a sharp rod up the nose and into the brain From there the brain is broken up into tiny pieces and removed through the nose Next they make a hole in the body to remove all the organs except for the heart Jars which had the heads of gods on top were used to store the organs The hole was then filled with linen and spices and the body was left under a salt to become dry Later after 40 days the body was wrapped in linen bandages Priests surrounded the body while it was being wrapped and said spells After the mummifying process was complete a mask was placed over the head so it can be known in the afterlife

The Confederacy of Independent Systems was an organization that appeared in the Star Wars movies The CIS was led by the fallen Jedi Count Dooku The armies of the Separatists had thousands of battle droids The CIS launched attacks against the Galactic Republic The Separatists stayed a strong power until the rise of the Empire

The Confederacy of Independent Systems was first shown in Attack of the Clones Count Dooku a former Jedi left the Jedi order and began a Separatist movement This movement gained support and soon had support from thousands of solar systems The Galactic Republic feared that a war would begin Count Dooku and the Separatist leaders were getting ready for a war Nute Gunray leader of the Trade Federation gave thousands of battle droids to the Separatist army Other leaders such as Poggle the Lesser and San Hill gave money and droids to the Separatist cause On the planet Geonosis Count Dooku met with the leaders of powerful companies Count Dooku gave his offer and the Confederacy of Independent Systems was formed The Jedi Obi Wan Kenobi overheard the meeting and sent a warning to the Republic The Republic sent a newly created clone army to fight the battle droids This battle on Geonosis began the Clone Wars The Geonosian Archduke Poggle the Lesser gives the plans of a new weapon to Count Dooku Count Dooku leaves the planet and goes to Coruscant He gives the plans to Darth Sidious as well as telling him that the war has begun

During the Clone Wars fighting between the Republic and the Separatists continued Jedi were sent to help the clone armies overcome their enemies The droid armies fought to hold more planets in its grip For three years the fighting took place across the Galaxy The Separatists gained several new allies during the Clone Wars After the death of Jango Fett on Geonosis a new bounty hunter named Durge took his place Count Dooku found a woman named Asajj Ventress who was powerful in the Force Asajj Ventress proved to be a powerful commander in the Separatist army A new leader of the Separatists rose at this time General Grievous was half droid and half alien He was trained in lightsaber combat by Count Dooku and became feared by Jedi throughout the Galaxy One of the final and most daring attacks on the Republic came when General Grievous led a large fleet of starships to Coruscant to capture Supreme Chancellor Palpatine

Supreme Chancellor Palpatine is taken from Coruscant and put on the starship The Invisible Hand The Battle of Coruscant is fought both on the ground and in space Obi Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker get on The Invisible Hand and rescue Palpatine During this rescue Anakin kills Count Dooku General Grievous escapes and the Separatist forces are defeated General Grievous now the leader of the CIS goes to Utapau to talk to the leaders of the businesses Grievous is told by Darth Sidious to move the leaders to Mustafar Droid armies attack on Kashyyyk and Utapau Obi Wan Kenobi kills General Grievous on Utapau Nute Gunray becomes the leader after both the deaths of Count Dooku and General Grievous The new Sith apprentice Darth Vader was sent to Mustafar to kill the leaders After he finished this job all droid forces were stopped This marked the end of the Confederacy of Independent Systems and the beginning of the Galactic Empire

Hedone in Greek mythology was the daughter of Amor and Psyche She was seen as the personification of lust 

The Ancient Greeks believed that the Psyche was responsible for behaviour In modern times a distinction is made between soul self and mind The study of the mind is called Psychology and a person who studies the mind and helps people with their mind problems is called a psychologist

Lamellibrachia is a genus of cold seep tube worms These are related to giant tube worms 

They live on the floor of the oceans near cold seeps There crude oil and methane leak out of the ocean floor The worm forms a symbiosis with certain bacteria These can oxidise sulfides 

The worm provides the bacteria with hydrogen sulfide and oxygen It does this by taking them up from the environment and binding them to a haemoglobin molecule 

In return the bacteria feed the worm The worms can grow to a length of about 3 metres

They form a biogenic habitat by creating groups of hundreds or thousands of individuals Living in these aggregations are over a hundred different species of organism many of which are found only at these seeps

Cold seeps and hydrothermal vents are the only known communities that do not rely on photosynthesis for food and energy production 

Unlike hydrothermal vents which are short lived environments cold seeps leak oil and gas slowly Likely owing to the cooler temperatures and stability many cold seep organisms are much longer lived than those inhabiting hydrothermal vents

These worm grow very slowly but can reach lengths of over 10 feet This means individuals may live over 250 years 

Giant tube worms are annelids They live on the floor of the oceans usually near Black Smokers or hydrothermal vents They can tolerate extremely high temperatures and levels of sulfur They live in symbiosis with certain bacteria The bacteria enter the mouth of a young tube worm but when the worm gets older its mouth and gut seal up trapping the bacteria forever These bacteria are fed with sulfur compounds and oxygen The bacteria then turn these compounds into organic molecules on which the host worms feed 

The Trans Siberian Railway or Trans Siberian Railroad is a set of railways that goes from Moscow and European Russia to the Russian Far East provinces Mongolia China and the Sea of Japan

Because Russia is such a big country travel from one end and the other is an important problem In the 1890s the Russians began building the longest railway in the world to connect Moscow to the Pacific Ocean Before the railway was built the trip took about a year along very rough roads One reason for building the Trans Sib was military to transport troops to the East in order to protect the country against Japan and China Another reason was to transport food from the farming areas of south western Siberia to the people in the European part of Russia Many cities and industries are built up along the route of the Trans Siberian Railway

A nuclear reaction is a process from physics In it two or more particles collide The result are new particles which are different from the first ones In the case of radioactivity this reaction is broken wikt linkspontaneousspontaneous It can also be done on purpose to make energy This energy can then be used for different things for example to make electricity It can also be used as fuel for a bomb

In the example figure 6Li reacts with deuterium This makes Beryllium which then decays into two alpha particles 

Nuclear reactions occur in the sun in nuclear reactors in particle accelerators and in outer space Other than radioactive decay there are very few nuclear reactions that occur outside of these special places on earth Nuclear reactors use nuclear reactions to make heat and electricity Accelerators sometimes cause nuclear reactions to make radioactive materials Particles from outer space cause nuclear reactions in earths atmosphere that make air slightly radioactive

St Pauls Cathedral is an Anglican church in Central London England It was started in 604 The man who built it was called Mellitas Bishop of the East Saxons In 962 and 1087 the cathedral burnt down and was built again Before todays version of the cathedral there were four others but they also burnt down Todays cathedral is made of limestone and it was built in 1666 after the Great Fire Of London Its architect was Sir Christopher Wren who designed 53 churches most after the Great Fire It has 3 floors The Wishpering Hall and 2 outside St Pauls is a popular tourist attraction and is still used as a church today

A greenhouse is a building where plants such as flowers and vegetables are grown It usually has a glass or clear plastic roof Many greenhouses also have glass or plastic walls Greenhouses get hot during the day The suns heat warms the plants and soil inside the greenhouse and they stay warm through the night because the heat cannot escape 

Greenhouses come in many different sizes Some people have small greenhouses in their backyard outside their home Plant companies have large greenhouses Their structures range in size from small sheds to very large buildings Small greenhouses are often called mini greenhouses or tomato houses They are used by people with smaller gardens those on a budget as well as those that want to start off their seeds and seedlings in a protected environment as we as those growing things that need warmer conditions  say tomatoes or even beans

Many vegetables and flowers are grown in greenhouses in late winter and early spring when it is still too cold to grow plants outside Then these plants are moved to the soil outside as the weather warms up Greenhouses are used to grow crops in cold countries such as Canada The largest group of greenhouses in the world is in Leamington Ontario where about 200 acres of tomatoes are grown in glass greenhousesso the greenhouse is very helpful

Gardening and growing plants in greenhouses is different from growing plants outside No rain can get inside a greenhouse so gardeners have to put water on the plants As well greenhouses can get very hot from the suns heat so gardeners have to make sure that it does not get too hot for the plants Greenhouses usually have vents that can be opened to let excess heat out Some greenhouses have electric exhaust fans that automatically turn on if it gets too hot in the greenhouse

In ancient Rome Roman gardeners grew cucumbers in frames covered with oiled cloth or with sheets of mica In the 1500s Italian gardeners built structures for the tropical plants that explorers brought back to Italy Jules Charles built the first modern greenhouse in Holland In the 1800s large greenhouses were built in England They are also very warm

Apprenticeship is a system of training people who are learning how to do a job which needs special skill Someone who is learning in this way is called an apprentice An apprentice will learn by working with someone who is already skilled at a job They are like a teacher and pupil

The system of apprenticeship has been used for many hundreds of years In the late Middle Ages the craft guilds and town governments used to watch and control the system A master craftsman had the right to employ young people to work for them and pay them a small salary In return the apprentice would be learning the trade Most apprentices were males but female apprentices are more common nowadays especially in crafts such as embroidery silk weaving etc

In the Star Wars fictional universe battle droids are robots that are made for fighting They are seen in the prequel trilogy of the Star Wars movies Battle droids are used by the Confederacy of Independent Systems to fight the Galactic RepublicClones of the Republic could easily overcome these droidsThe battle droids are controlled by a central droid control ship If the control ship is destroyed the droids shut off 

The Western Long beaked Echidna is one of the four living echidnas and one of three species of Zaglossus that live in New Guinea Fossils of this species have also been found in Australia As Tachyglossus bruijni this is the type species of Zaglossus

The Western Long beaked Echidna lives above 1300m and up to 4000m above sea level It lives in alpine meadow and humid forests in the mountains Unlike the Short beaked Echidna which eats ants and termites the Long beaked species eats earthworms The Long beaked Echidna is also larger that the Short beaked species It reached up to 165 kilograms the snout is longer and turns downward It is difficult to see the spines in the long fur It can be told apart from the other Zaglossus species by the number of claws on the front and back feet It has three claws

The IUCN has listed it as an endangered species Its population has been decreased by reduced habitat because of human activities and hunting The Long beaked Echidna is a delicacy Although hunting the species has been banned by the Indonesian and Papua New Guinean governments traditional hunting is permitted 

In February of 2006 an expedition led by Conservation International found a population of the mammals as part of what they described as a Lost world of wildlife in the Foja Mountains of Papua Province Indonesia

Platypuses and echidnas are the only known mammal species to lay eggs

The Short beaked Echidna is 1 of 4 living types of echidna It is also known as the Spiny Anteater because it eats ants and termites It is the only member of the genus Tachyglossus The Short beaked Echidna is covered in fur and spines It has a special nose and a special tongue that lets the echidna catch its prey at a great speed Like the other monotremes the Short beaked Echidna lays eggs The monotremes are the only mammals that lay eggs

The echidna lives throughout Australia and in coastal and highland regions of southwestern New Guinea In Australia it is the most widespread native mammal In New Guinea it is known as the Mungwe in the Daribi and Chimbu languages It is not threatened with extinction but human activities such as hunting habitat destruction and the introduction of foreign predatory animals and parasites have reduced the places where the Short beaked Echidna lives in Australia 

The Short beaked Echidna was first described by George Shaw in 1792 He named the species Myrmecophaga aculeata He thought it might be related to the South American anteater Since Shaw first described the echidna its name has changed four times 

The name Tachyglossus means quick tongue This is about the speed with which the echidna uses its tongue to catch ants and termites The word aculeatus means spiny or equipped with spines

The Short beaked Echidna is the only member of its genus sharing the family Tachyglossidae with the surviving three species of the genus Zaglossus that live in New Guinea The Zaglossus species includes the

These are all much bigger than T aculeatus They eat mostly worms and grubs not ants and termites Species of the Tachyglossidae are egg laying mammals together with the related family Ornithorhynchidae the Platypuses they are the only living monotremes in the world

There are five subspecies of the Short beaked Echidna each live in different areas The subspecies are also different from each other as to hairiness spine length and width and the size of the claws on their back feet

Short beaked Echidnas are usually 30 to 45 centimetres in length They have a 75 millimetre beak and weigh between two and five kilograms The Tasmanian subspecies T a setosus is larger than the Australian mainland species Because the neck can not be seen the head and body appear to join together The earholes are on either side of the head with no external pinnae The eyes are small and at the base of the wedge shaped beak The nostrils and the mouth are at the far end of the beak The mouth of the Short beaked Echidna cannot open wider than 5 mm The body of the Short beaked Echidna is except for the underside face and legs covered with cream coloured spines The spines which may be up to 50 mm long are modified hairs mostly made of keratin They have fur between the spines which ranges in colour from honey to a dark reddish brown and even black The underside and short tail are also covered in fur Fur colour changes with geographic location The Echidnas fur may be infested with what is said to be the worlds largest flea Bradiopsylla echidnae which is about 4 mm long

The legs of the Short beaked Echidna are designed for rapid digging Their legs are short and have strong claws The claws on the back feet are longer and curve backwards to help cleaning and grooming between the spines Like the platypus it has a low body temperature between 30 and 32 C Unlike the platypus which shows no evidence of torpor or hibernation the body temperature of the echidna may fall as low as 5 C The Echidna does not pant or sweat and normally seeks shelter in hot conditions In autumn and winter the Echidna shows periods of torpor or deep hibernation Because of the low body temperature of the Short beaked Echidna it becomes sluggish in very hot and very cold weather Like all monotremes it has only one orifice for the passage of faeces urine and reproductive products which is known as the cloaca The male has internal testes no external scrotum and a highly unusual penis with four knobs on the tip The gestating female has a pouch on its underside where it raises its young 

The muscles of the Short beaked Echidna have a number of unusual features There is an enormous muscle that is just beneath the skin and covers the entire body By contraction of various parts of this muscle the Short beaked Echidna can change shape The most common shape change is achieved by rolling itself into a ball when threatened protecting its belly and presenting a defensive array of sharp spines It has one of the shortest spinal cords of any mammal extending only as far as the thorax

The tongue of the Short beaked Echidna is the animals only way of catching prey It can stick out up to 180 mm outside the snout The tongue is sticky because of the presence of glycoprotein rich mucous This mucus both lubricates movement in and out of the snout and helps to catch ants and termites which stick to it Sticking out the tongue is achieved by contracting the circular muscles that change the shape of the tongue and force it forward and contraction of two muscles attached to the caudal end of the tongue and to the mandible The protruded tongue is stiffened by the rapid flow of blood allowing it to penetrate wood and soil Retraction requires the contraction of two internal muscles When the tongue is retracted the prey is caught on backward facing keratinous teeth along the roof of the buccal cavity This allows the animal to both capture and grind food The tongue moves with great speed and has been measured to move in and out of the snout 100 times a minute

Many physiological adaptations help the lifestyle of the Short beaked Echidna Because the animal burrows it can tolerate very high levels of carbon dioxide in inspired air and will voluntarily remain in situations where carbon dioxide concentrations are high Its ear is sensitive to low frequency sound which may be ideal for detecting sounds emitted by termites and ants underground The leathery snout is covered in mechano and thermoreceptors These receptors provide information about the surrounding environment The Short beaked Echidna has a well developed olfactory system which may be used to detect mates and prey It has a highly sensitive optic nerve It has been shown to have visual discrimination and spatial memory comparable to those of a rat The brain and central nervous system of the Short beaked Echidna have been extensively studied for evolutionary comparison with placental mammals The Short beaked Echidna has the largest prefrontal cortex with respect to body size of any mammal It shows rapid eye movement during sleep and its brain has been shown to contain a claustrum that is similar to placental mammals linking this structure to their common ancestor

The solitary Short beaked Echidna looks for a mate between May and September the precise timing of the mating season varies with geographic location Both males and females give off a strong odour during the mating season During courtship observed for the first time in 1989 males locate and pursue females Trains of up to ten males may follow a single female in a courtship ritual that may last for up to four weeks the duration of the courtship period varies with location In cooler parts of their range such as Tasmania females may mate within a few hours of arousal from hibernation 

Before mating the male smells the female paying particular attention to the cloaca The male is often observed to roll the female onto her side and then assumes a similar position so that the two animals are abdomen to abdomen Each mating results in the production of a single egg and females are known to mate only once during the breeding season each mating is successful

Fertilisation occurs in the oviduct Gestation takes between 21 and 28 days during which time the female constructs a nursery burrow Following the gestation period a single rubbery skinned egg between 13 and 17 millimetres in diameter is laid directly into a small backward facing pouch that has developed on her abdomen Ten days after it is laid the egg hatches within the pouch The embryo develops an egg tooth during incubation which it uses to tear open the egg the tooth disappears soon after hatching 

Hatchlings are about 15 cm long and weigh between 03 and 04 grams After hatching young Echidnas are known as puggles Hatchlings attach themselves to their mothers milk areolae a specialised patch on the skin that secretes milk The way in which puggles drink the milk is not yet known but they have been observed drinking large amounts during each feeding period since mothers may leave them unattended in the burrow for between five and ten days The principal components of the milk are fucosyllactose and saialyllactose The milk has a high iron content which gives it a pink colour Juveniles are eventually ejected from the pouch at around two to three months of age because of the continuing growth in the length of their spines Suckling gradually decreases until juveniles are weaned at about six months of age The duration of lactation is about 200 days and the young leave the burrow between 180 and 240 days

The age of sexual maturity is uncertain but may be four to five years A twelve year field study published in 2003 found that the Short beaked Echidna reached sexual maturity between five and 12 years of age and that the frequency of reproduction varies from once every two years to once every six years The Short beaked Echidna can live as long as 45 years in the wild

No systematic study of the ecology of the Short beak Echidna has been published There have been studies of several aspects of their ecological behaviour Short beaked Echidnas live alone and apart from the burrow created for rearing young they have no fixed shelter or nest site They do not have a home territory but range over a wide area Short beaked Echidnas are usually active in the daytime however they have problems in hot weather because they have no sweat glands and do not pant Therefore in warm weather they change their pattern of activity becoming crepuscular or nocturnal They can tolerate cold temperatures and hibernate during the winter in very cold regions

Short beaked Echidnas can live anywhere where there is a good supply of food Short beaked Echidnas find food by smell using sensors in the tip of their beak and regularly feast on ants and termites They are powerful diggers using their clawed front paws to dig out prey and dig burrows for shelter They may rapidly dig themselves into the ground if they cannot find cover when in danger

In Australia they are most common in forested areas where there are many termite filled fallen logs In agricultural areas they are most likely to be in uncleared scrub they may be in grassland arid areas and in the outer suburbs of the capital cities Little is known about their distribution in New Guinea they have been found in southern New Guinea between Merauke in the west to the Kelp Welsh River east of Port Moresby in the east where they may be in open woodland

The Short beaked Echidna is common in most of temperate Australia and lowland New Guinea and is not listed as endangered In Australia the number of Short beaked Echidnas has been less affected by land clearing than have some other species since Short beaked Echidnas do not require a specialised habitat beyond a good supply of ants and termites Despite their spines they are eaten by birds the Tasmanian Devil cats foxes and dogs They were also eaten by indigenous Australians and the early European settlers of Australia The most common threats to the animal in Australia are cars and habitat destruction These have led to localised extinction Infection with the introduced parasite Spirometra erinaceieuropaei is fatal for the Echidna The Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland runs an Australia wide survey called Echidna Watch to monitor the species in Australia

Captive breeding is difficult partly because of the relatively infrequent breeding cycle Only five zoos have managed to breed a captive Short beaked Echidna but no captive bred young have survived to be adults This has conservation implications for the endangered species of echidna from the genus Zaglossus and to a lesser extent for the Short beaked Echidna

Short beaked Echidnas feature in the animistic culture of Indigenous Australians including their visual arts and stories The species was a totem for some groups including the Noongar people from Western Australia who called the animal the Nyingarn Many groups have myths about the animal one myth explains that it was created when a group of hungry young men went hunting at night and stumbled across a wombat They threw spears at the wombat but lost sight of it in the darkness The wombat adapted the spears as its own defense and turned into an Echidna Another story tells of a greedy man that kept food from his tribe warriors speared him and he crawled away into the bushes where he was turned into an Echidna the spears becoming his spines

The Eastern Long beaked Echidna also known as Bartons Long beaked Echidna is one of three species from the genus Zaglossus All of them occur in New Guinea It is found mainly in Papua New Guinea between 2000 and 3000 meters above sea level 

It can be distinguished from other members of the genus by the number of claws on the fore and hind feet It has five claws on its fore feet and four on its hind feet The adult animal weights between 5 kg and 10 kg Its body length ranges from 60100 cm It has no tail It has dense black fur The species is the largest monotreme and is slow moving It rolls into a spiny ball for defense

There are four recognised subspecies

The population of each subspecies is geographically isolated and they can be distinguished primarily by differences in body size

Zaglossus bartoni 

Zaglossus bruijni

Zaglossus hacketti

The long beaked echidnas make up one of the two genera of echidna Echidna is a spiny monotreme that lives in New Guinea There are three living species and two extinct ones

Echidnas are one of the two types of mammals that lay eggs 

Remarks Species described from one sample only May be endangered or locally extinct See Sir Davids Long beaked Echidna

Remarks see Eastern Long beaked Echidna

Remarks see Western Long beaked Echidna

Remarks This species is known only from a few bones At a metre long it was huge for an echidna and for monotremes in general

Remarks This species is known from a fossil skull about 65 cm long

Sir Davids Long beaked Echidna also known as the Cyclops Long beaked Echidna is one of three species from the genus Zaglossus All of them are found in New Guinea It is named after Sir David Attenborough It lives in the Cyclops mountains in Papua province of Indonesia near the cities of Sentani Jayapura 

The species was described from a single damaged animal which was collected in the Dutch colonial era It has not been collected since that time The Cyclops mountain forest habitat has been disturbed recently This has raised concern that Z attenboroughi populations may already be endangered or even locally extinct However many parts of the mountains are covered in thick jungle and have not been searched since 1961 It is possible that the animal still exists there or in nearby mountain ranges In 2007 scientists found holes which they believe were made by the echidna poking its nose into the dirt while looking for earthworms 

It is the smallest member of the genus It is closer in size to the Short beaked Echidna than other members of the genus It has five claws on its fore and hind feet It has dense short fur

Bioluminescence is the capacity of living things to produce light Often this is done by symbiosis In this the larger organism contains often in a special organ microorganisms which make the light Eukaryote protists have special organelles and some bacteria also produce light Bioluminescence is the result of chemical processes where the energy produced is released as visible light Bioluminescence has appeared many times during evolution

ATP the biological energy source reacts with luciferin with the aid of the enzyme luciferase to yield an intermediate complex This complex combines with oxygen to produce a highly chemiluminescent compound

The role of Gamma Proteobacteria in producing light is discussed in detail in reference works The capacity to produce light is an extension of normal metabolism all chemical reactions produce a few photons Visible light is produced when the photon production increases In the case of bacteria the original function of the reaction was probably to detoxify excessive oxygen

Bioluminescence is mainly a marine phenomenon 

Bioluminescence is found in the sea at all levels planktonic pelagic and benthic organisms Some planktonic groups such as dinoflagellates and ctenophores use it in most species Most deep sea marine life use bioluminescence in one form or another Usually marine light emission belongs in the blue and green light spectrum the wavelengths that can transmit through seawater most easily

For a list see Biolum web page

In some squid species bacterial bioluminescence is used for counterillumination so the animal matches the overhead environmental light seen from below In these animals light organs control the contrast of this illumination to create optiminal matching Usually these light organs are separate from the tissue containing the bioluminescent bacteria 

Bioluminescence is used as a lure to attract prey by several deep sea fish such as the anglerfish A dangling lure on the head of the fish attracts small animals to within striking distance Some fish however use a non bioluminescent lure

The cookiecutter shark uses bioluminescence for camouflage but a small patch on its underbelly remains dark and appears as a small fish to large predatory fish like tuna and mackerel swimming beneath it When these fish try to consume the small fish they are bitten by the shark which gouges out small circular cookie cutter shaped chunks of flesh from its hosts

Dinoflagellates have an interesting twist on this mechanism When a predator of plankton is sensed through motion in the water the dinoflagellate luminesces This in turn attracts even larger predators which will consume the would be predator of the dinoflagellate

Attracting mates is an important function of bioluminescence This is seen in fireflies which use periodic flashing in their abdomens to attract mates in the mating season In the marine environment this has only been well documented in certain small ostracod crustaceans but may be quite common

Certain squid and small crustaceans use bioluminescence as many squid use ink A cloud of luminescence is expelled confusing or repelling a potential predator while the squid or crustacean escapes to safety Every species of firefly has larvae that glow to repel predators

Bioluminescent organisms are a target for many areas of research Luciferase systems are widely used in the field of genetic engineering They have also been used in biomedical research to give some cells visible labels

The structure of photophores the light producing organs in bioluminescent organisms are being investigated by industrial designers

The Mongol Empire an area ruled by the great Mongol khans in the 13th and 14th centuries was one of the largest land empires in history The original homeland of the Mongols was bounded by the Khingan Mountains on the east the Altai and Tian mountains on the west the Shilka River and the mountain ranges by Lake Baikal on the north and the Great Wall of China on the south 

It was founded by Genghis Khan in 1206 AD when he brought together the Mongol tribes When he died in 1227 AD he had conquering Central Asia North China and parts of eastern Persia Later his grandson Kublai Khan would go on to expand the empire and found the Mongol ruled Yuan Dynasty ruling whole China The Mongol Empire was the largest land empire in history stretching from Eastern Europe to Western Asia and including Central Asia and the Middle East Its power did not last long though By 1360s it had broken into several empires all of which were later destroyed

Parthia is an ancient country of Asia now Iran and regions of Armenia Iraq Georgia eastern Turkey eastern SyriaAzerbaijan Turkmenistan Afghanistan Tajikistan Pakistan Kuwait the Persian Gulf coast of Saudi Arabia Bahrain Qatar and UAE 

Parthians were excellent horsemen and archers In battle mounted Parthians often discharged their arrows back towards the enemy while pretending to flee

In 250 BC the Parthians succeeded in founding an independent kingdom that in the 1st century BC it grew into an empire extending from the Euphrates to the Indus and from the Amu Darya to the Indian Ocean

Hydrolysis is a chemical reaction or process in which a chemical compound reacts with water This is the type of reaction that is used to break down polymers into many smaller units In this reaction water is always added to the chemical compound

This implies that hydrogen chloride is lost in the evaporation of AlCl3 solutions and the residue is a basic salt in place of AlCl3 This type of reaction is also seen with other metal chlorides such as ZnCl2 SnCl2 FeCl3 and lanthanide halides such as DyCl3 With some compounds such as TiCl4 the hydrolysis may go to completion and form the pure hydroxide or oxide in this case TiO2

In mammals the lymphatic system is a network of thin vessels that branch like blood vessels into tissues throughout the body It is part of the immune system

Lymphatic vessels carry lymph a colorless watery fluid This comes from interstitial fluid in the tissues which is squeezed out of the blood vessels The lymphatic system transports infection fighting cells called lymphocytes is involved in the removal of foreign matter and cell debris by phagocytes One part of it also transports fats from the small intestine to the blood 

Lymphatic fluid gathers from the tissues and enters the valved lymphatic ducts It is the valves which make sure the lyph flows the right way This lymph fluid then passes back to the heart On its way it passes through special nodular glands or lymph nodes in certain zones such as the back of the neck the armpits and the groin When a lymph node detects a possible threat passing into it in the lymph it swells up This is why lymph nodes swell in the region of an infected body part The function of the lymph glands is to prevent or reduce the number of infective agents getting into the general circulation and reaching other parts of the body

Lymph ends up back in the blood system In mammals under normal conditions most of the lymph is returned to the blood stream through lymph vein communications at the base of the neck

Chastity is the sexual behavior of a man or woman which is right and proper according to the moral rules of a culture or religion It has recently begun to mean sexual abstinence especially before marriage However it can also be used for all kinds of people with more meaning than simply not having sex The word chastity came from the Latin word castitatem meaning purity

 Metallic bond is the reaction between molecules within metals called alkali reactive force It involves the sharing of free electrons among a lattice of metal atoms Metallic bonds may be compared to molten salts

The electrons and the positive ions in the metal have a strong attractive force between them Therefore metals often have high melting or boiling points The principle is similar to that of ionic bonds

The metallic bond accounts for many physical characteristics of metals such as strength malleability ductility lusterluster conduction of heat and electricity

Because the electrons move independently of the positive ions in a sea of negative charge the metal gains some electrical conductivity It allows the energy to pass quickly through the electrons generating a current Heat conduction works on the same principle  the free electrons can transfer the energy at a faster rate than other substances such as those which are covalently bonded as these have their electrons fixed into position There also are few non metals which conduct electricity graphite and molten and aqueous ionic compounds which have free moving ions  

Metal bonds have at least one valence electron which they do not share with neighboring atoms and they do not lose electrons to form ions Instead the outer energy levels of the metal atoms overlap They are similar to covalent bonds Not all metals exhibit metallic bonding For example the mercurous ion forms covalent metal metal bonds

Heat conduction or Thermal conduction is the transfer of energy between particles in a solidHeat can also be transferred by Thermal radiation andor convection and it is normal that more than one of these processes happen at the same time

In the atomic theory solids liquids and gases are made of tiny particles called atoms The temperature of the material measures how fast the atoms are moving and the heat measures the total amount of energy due to the vibration of the atoms

You might imagine conduction to take place when one part of a material is heated The atoms in this part vibrate faster and are more likely to hit their neighboursWhen collisions take place the energy is passed on to the neighbouring atoms allowing the energy to travel through the solid

The atomic picture also helps explain why conduction is more important in solids in solids the atoms are close together and unable to move around In liquids and gases the particles can move past each other so the collisions are less common

A vassal during the feudalism of medieval Europe was someone who had shared duties with a lord Usually the vassal provided soldiers to the lord The lord used his army of soldiers from all of his vassals to protect those vassals The lord also gave him the piece of land that he held as a fief By analogy the term vassal is used also for similar systems in other feudal societies

The development of the vassal in a society that was increasingly organised around the concept of lordship in French the seigneur is one sign that Antiquity ended and the Early Middle Ages began Lordship is the basic social institution as Tacitus described them in his book Germania The Roman West experienced them for the first time in the Migration Period 

As the system developed in the seventh century the vassals were gangs of freemen who subjected themselves in some degree of formality to the authority of a leader from whom they could expect to be fed clothed and armed The quality of a vassal was only in his fighting ability and the strength of his loyalty The etymology of vassal is from a Celtic word gwas boy that meant a young male slave with a Latinised form vassus that appeared in Salic Law like the way knight came from the from Old English word cniht and similar words in Frisian and Dutch all meaning lad 

The Migration Period also called Barbarian Invasions or Vlkerwanderung is a name given by historians to a human migration which happened in the period of roughly AD 300700 in Europe That was the period at the end of Ancient history and the beginning of the Middle Ages

The migration included the Goths Vandals and Franks among other Germanic Bulgar and Slavic tribes The migration may have been influenced by attacs of the Huns in the east and connected to the Turkic migration in Central Asia population pressures or climate changes 

Migrations would continue well beyond 1000 AD successive waves of Slavs Alans Avars Bulgars Hungarians Pechenegs Cumans and Tatars changed the ethnic makeup of Eastern Europe Western European historians however tend to stress the migrations most relevant to Western Europe

The San Francisco Bay Area also known as the Bay Area is a metropolitan region that goes around the San Francisco Bay in Northern California It includes the cities of San Francisco San Jos and Oakland and their many suburbs 

It also includes the smaller urban and rural areas of the North Bay Almost seven million people live there The Bay Area includes cities towns military bases airports and related regional state and national parks

San Jos is the largest city in the Bay Area since 1990 and the tenth largest city in America But for most of its history San Francisco was the city with the most people San Francisco is still the city people pay the most attention to and it is the major cultural center in the region 

The region north of the Golden Gate Bridge is known locally as the North Bay This area includes Marin County and continues north into Sonoma and Napa counties and east to Solano County With some exceptions this region is quite rich Marin County is listed as the wealthiest in the nation

The City and County of San Francisco is generally placed in a category by itself in terms of geography and culture It is separated by water from the north west and east and by a county line from its neighbor cities to the South San Francisco has been the cultural financial and urban center of the region for a long time For most of the Bay Areas history it has also been the main population center But because the size of the county is limited the growth of the city was limited as well As a result other cities and counties have had more population growth

The area between the South Bay and the City and County of San Francisco is the San Francisco Peninsula known locally as The Peninsula This area includes many small cities and suburban communities in San Mateo County and the northwestern part of Santa Clara County as well as several towns along the Pacific coast such as Pacifica and Half Moon Bay 

The eastern side of the bay consisting of Alameda and Contra Costa counties is known locally as the East Bay The East Bay is split into two regions the inner East Bay which is on the coast of the Bay and the outer East Bay including the inland valleys separated from the inner East Bay by hills and mountains

The communities along the southern edge of the Bay are known as the South Bay Santa Clara Valley and Silicon Valley This region is home to a large number of major technology companies Some notable tech companies in the South Bay are Intel AMD Cisco Systems Hewlett Packard Apple Google and Yahoo 

The San Francisco Bay Area is one of the wealthiest regions in the United States

San Francisco Bay is a shallow productive estuary through which water draining about forty percent of California flowing in the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers from the Sierra Nevada mountains and Central Valley enters the Pacific Ocean Technically both rivers flow into Suisun Bay which help flows through the Carquinez Strait to meet with the Napa River at the entrance to San Pablo Bay which connects at its south end to San Francisco Bay although the entire group of interconnected bays are often referred to as the San Francisco Bay

San Francisco Bay lies in the US state of California and is surrounded by a region known as the San Francisco Bay Area that is near the big cities of San Francisco Oakland and San Jose

The Bay covers somewhere between 400 and 1600 square miles depending on which sub bays estuaries wetlands and so on are included in the measurement

Ahmed Yassin was a spiritual leader of the militant Palestinian group Hamas Yassins birth date is in dispute He claimed he was born 111938 however his passport indicated 111929 To some he was a hero to some he was a notorious member of a terrorist organization He was also a symbolic figure for Palestinians to fight against Israel 

Yassin helped create Hamas and became its spiritual leader in 1987 To other members of Hamas he was a hero but he was blamed by the Israeli government for planning suicide bombings and other attacks against Israel He claimed that was the only way of fighting occupation He was confined to a wheelchair because he was paralyzed since childhood he was also nearly blind and could barely hear He was very powerful and influential He was assassinated in an airstrike by the Israeli Army after he left a mosque in Gaza in the early morning hours

In physics the field strength of a field is the magnitude of its value This means that the force exerted by the field on a given object is proportional to the field strength

In theoretical physics the field strength is just another name for the curvature form For the electromagnetic field the curvature form is just an antisymmetric matrix whose elements are the electric field and magnetic field the electromagnetic tensor

In physics a field means that a physical quantity is assigned to every point in space A field is seen as extending throughout a large region of space so that it influences everything The strength of a field usually varies over a region 

For some fields there is a number for each point in space They are called scalar fields For more complicated fields there are more than one number for each point in space They are called vector fields or tensor fields For example one can model a gravitational field by a vector field where a vector indicates the acceleration a mass would experience at each point in space Other examples are temperature fields or air pressure fields which are often illustrated on weather reports by isotherms and isobars by joining up the points of equal temperature or pressure respectively

In vector calculus the gradient of a scalar field is a vector field which points in the direction of the greatest rate of increase of the scalar field and whose magnitude is the greatest rate of change

The gradient can also be used to measure how a scalar field changes in other directions rather than just the direction of greatest change by taking a dot product Consider again the example with the hill and suppose that the steepest slope on the hill is 40 If a road goes directly up the hill then the steepest slope on the road will also be 40 If instead the road goes around the hill at an angle with the uphill direction then it will have a shallower slope For example if the angle between the road and the uphill direction projected onto the horizontal plane is 60 then the steepest slope along the road will be 20 which is 40 times the cosine of 60 

In mathematics the trigonometric functions are a set of functions which relate angles to the sides of a right triangle There are many trigonometric functions the 3 most common being sine cosine tangent followed by cotangent secant and cosecant The last three are called reciprocal trigonometric functions because they act as the reciprocals of other functions Secant and cosecant are rarely used

The trigonometric functions sometimes are also called circular functions They are functions of an angle they are important when studying triangles among many other applications Trigonometric functions are commonly defined as ratios of two sides of a right triangle containing the angle and can equivalently be defined as the lengths of various line segments from a unit circle 

In order to define the trigonometric functions for the angle A start with a right triangle that contains the angle A

An archer is someone who practices archery 

Archer can also mean

Archery is the practice of using a bow to shoot arrows Archery has historically been used in hunting and combat and has become a precision sport A person practicing archery is called an archer and one who enjoys or is an expert at archery is sometimes called a toxophilite

The earliest evidence of archery dates back more than 5000 years The bow probably was used in hunting first and was then adopted as a tool of warfare It was one of the earliest forms of artillery 

Classical civilizations notably the Persians Macedonians Nubians Greeks Parthians Indians Japanese Chinese and Koreans had large numbers of archers in their armies Arrows were very destructive against massed formations and the use of archers helped win battles

John Felix Anthony Cena Jr is an American professional wrestler hip hop musician and actor He works for World Wrestling Entertainment and wrestles on the Raw brand where he is one of the two disputed WWE Champions with CM Punk Cena has won the WWE Championship ten times the World Heavyweight Championship twice the WWE United States Championship three times and the World Tag Team Championship twice Also Cena won the Royal Rumble in 2008 As for his musical career Cena has released an album called You Cant See Me Cena has also been featured in the movies The Marine 12 Rounds and Legendary In Baseball he is a Red Sox fan turned Rays fan

Cena was signed by then Person in charge of Talent Relations Jim Ross on behalf on WWF According to Ross when he returned to Connecticut after signing Cena he walked into Vince McMahons office and told him I just signed your main event for WrestleMania in 5 years Cena would eventually make his WrestleMania debut 3 years later at WrestleMania XX winning the WWE United States Championship from The Big Show and his Main event WrestleMania debut 4 years later winning the WWE Championship from John Bradshaw Layfield

During the match between Barrett and Orton Orton won so Cena was forced to retire He was rehired by Wade Barrett and defeated him at TLC Tables Ladders and Chairs Pay Per View

He was drafted to SmackDown as the first pick in the 2011 WWE Draft but before the end of the night he was drafted back to Raw

His current feud with Kane is bringing down his popularityThere is a high chance that Cena could change heel before his Wrestlemania match with The Rock 

A signal transduction in biology is a cellular mechanism It converts a stimulus into a specific cellular response Signal transduction starts with a chemical or physical signal to a receptor and ends with a change in cell function

Receptors are in the cell membrane with part of the receptor outside and part inside the cell The chemical signal binds to the outer portion of the receptor changing its shape This causes another signal inside the cell Some chemical messengers such as testosterone can pass through the cell membrane and bind directly to receptors in the cytoplasm or nucleus

Sometimes there is a cascade of signals within the cell With each step of the cascade the signal can be amplified so a small signal can result in a large response Eventually the signal creates a change in the cell either in the expression of the DNA in the nucleus or in the activity of enzymes in the cytoplasm 

Most often ordered sequences of biochemical reactions inside the cell are involved These are carried out by enzymes and linked through second messengers So a second messenger pathway is produced These things usually happen quickly sometimes very quickly They may last from milliseconds to days for gene expression 

The number of proteins and other molecules that take part increases during the process So a signal cascade develops and a relatively small stimulus may cause a large response

In bacteria and other single cell organisms the transduction processes a cell has limits the number of ways it can respond to its environment In multicellular organisms lots of different signal transduction processes are used to coordinate the behavior of individual cells By this means the function of the organism as a whole is organized The more complex the organism the more complex the repertoire of signal transduction processes the organism must possess 

Thus sensing of both the external and internal environment at the cellular level relies on signal transduction Many disease processes such as diabetes heart disease autoimmunity and cancer arise from defects in signal transduction pathways This highlights the critical importance of signal transduction to biology and medicine

Flux is a term in physics and mathematics

In the study of transport phenomena flux is defined as flow per unit area where flow is the movement of some quantity per time Flux in this definition is a vector

There are many fluxes used in the study of transport phenomena Each type of flux has its own distinct unit of measurement along with distinct physical constants Six of the most common forms of flux from the transport literature are defined as

In the field of electromagnetism flux is usually the integral of a vector quantity over a finite surface The result of this integration is a scalar quantity The magnetic flux is thus the integral of the magnetic vector field over a surface and the electric flux is defined similarly Using this definition the flux of the Poynting vector over a specified surface is the rate at which electromagnetic energy flows through that surface Confusingly the Poynting vector is sometimes called the power flux which is an example of the first usage of flux above It has units of watts per square metre

Flux comes from Latin and means flow it may mean

Neuroscience is the scientific study of brain and mind and the whole nervous system It helps to understand how we perceive and interact with the outside world and in particular how human experience and human biology influence each other

Its studies may include genetics biochemistry physiology pharmacology and pathology of the nervous system Traditionally it is seen as a branch of biological sciences However recently there has been an effort to draw together many related areas including psychology computer science statistics physics and medicine

Current neuroscience research activities can be very roughly divided into the following major branches based on what they study and at what scale they study as well as what experimental approaches they use  Individual neuroscientists however often work on questions that span several different subfields

Neuroscience research from different areas can also be seen as focusing on a set of specific themes and questions

Conversation analysis is the study of talk in interaction CA tries to describe the structure and patterns of interaction whether this is institutional or casual conversation

Mark Anthony Turnage is an English composer He is one of the most original composers in his country today 

Turnage studied at the Royal College of Music and won all the major prizes He became famous when he wrote an opera called Greek It is typical of his musical style quite lyrical but also very dramatic and aggressive His music is often inspired by jazz Other works include Kai Rockaby Blood on the Floor Dispelling the Fears Drowned Out and Three Screaming Popes He has written music for the English National Opera City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra 

A hydrothermal vent is a fissure in the surface of the Earth There are gases that rise through it which heat the water around it There are many such vents on Earth If they are on land they are usually hot springs geysers or fumaroles Many archaea and bacteria live near hydrothermal vents which are underwater They support giant tube worms clams and shrimp and many other eukaryotes

Deep sea organisms have no access to sunlight so they must depend on nutrients in the chemical deposits and hydrothermal fluids in which they live Compared to the surrounding sea floor however hydrothermal vent zones have a density of organisms 10000 to 100000 times greater

Hydrothermal vent communities are able to sustain such vast amounts of life because vent organisms depend on chemosynthetic bacteria for food These bacteria use sulfur compounds particularly hydrogen sulfide a chemical highly toxic to most known organisms to produce organic material through the process of chemosynthesis

The chemosynthetic bacteria grow into a thick mat which attracts other organisms such as amphipods and copepods which graze upon the bacteria directly Larger organisms such as snails shrimp crabs giant tube worms fish and octopus form a food chain of predator and prey relationships above the primary consumers 

The main groups of organisms around seafloor vents are worms gastropods and crustaceans with large bivalves and eyeless shrimp making up the bulk of non microbial organisms

Tube worms form an important part of the community around a hydrothermal vent They absorb nutrients directly into their tissues There are approximately 285 billion bacteria per ounce of tubeworm tissue

Tubeworms have red plumes which contain haemoglobin Haemoglobin combines hydrogen sulfide and transfers it to the bacteria living inside the worm In return the bacteria nourish the worm with carbon compounds 

Other examples of the unique fauna who inhabit this ecosystem are the gastropod Crysomallon squamiferum a species of snail with a foot reinforced by scales made of iron and organic materials and the Pompeii Worm Alvinella pompejana which is capable of withstanding temperatures up to 80C

Over 300 new species have been discovered at hydrothermal vents many of them sister species to others in geographically separated vent areas It has been proposed that before the North American plate overrode the mid ocean ridge there was a single biogeographic vent region found in the eastern Pacific The subsequent barrier to travel began the evolutionary divergence of species in different locations The examples of convergent evolution seen between distinct hydrothermal vents is seen as major support for the theory of natural selection and evolution as a whole

A species of phototrophic bacterium has been found living near a black smoker off the coast of Mexico at a depth of convert2500mftabbronlkoff No sunlight penetrates that far into the waters Instead the bacteria part of the Chlorobiaceae family use the faint glow from the black smoker for photosynthesis This is the first organism discovered in nature to exclusively use a light other than sunlight for photosynthesis

Guavas are plants in the genus Psidium of the myrtle family There are about 100 species of tropical shrubs and small trees in the genus

They are native to Mexico the Caribbean Central America and the northern part of South America Now they are found in all the tropical and in some subtropical regions because their edible fruits

The most common guava is Apple Guava it is so common that the word guava usually refers to this species

The resting potential of a cell is the membrane potential that would be maintained if there were no action potentials synaptic potentials or other active changes in the membrane potential In most cells the resting potential has a negative value which by convention means that there is excess negative charge inside compared to outside The resting potential is mostly determined by the concentrations of the ions in the fluids on both sides of the cell membrane and the ion transport proteins that are in the cell membrane How the concentrations of ions and the membrane transport proteins influence the value of the resting potential is outlined below

Thrust is a force or a push When a system pushes or accelerates mass in one direction there is a thrust just as large in the opposite direction In math and physics this is described by Isaac Newtons second and third laws Thrust is used to describe how well a type of engine runs It can be used for many kinds of engines like rocket engines plane engines and jet engines 

Thrust is measured in pounds of thrust in the US and in Newtons in the metric system 445 Newtons of thrust equals 1 pound of thrust A pound of thrust is how much thrust it would take to keep a one pound object unmoving against the force of gravity on earth 

A very common question is how to compare the thrust number of an airplane engine with the power number of a piston engine It is hard to compare these two This is because they are not measuring the same exact thing A piston engine does not move the plane It just delivers power to the propeller which turns and moves the plane Because of this piston engines are rated by how much power they give to the propeller 

Where T is thrust and v is speed This is the power being delivered by the engine at a certain thrust or velocity The propulsive power of a jet engine increases with its speed If the speed is zero then the propulsive power is zero

When the thrust of a rocket or an engine is compared to the weight of the engine it is called the Thrust to weight ratio The number that comes from this comparison does not have any units because it is a ratio A ratio in this case means that the thrust of the engine is divided by the weight of the engine The purpose of this comparison is to show how well the engine or vehicle performs It is a number that can be used to compare various types of motors like airplane motors jet engines rocket engines or car engines 

This comparison number can change while the engine is running This is because the weight of the engine gets lighter as fuel is used The thrust to weight ratio is and used to actually compare engines is the number found when the engine is first running 

An airplane makes forward thrust when air is pushed in the direction opposite to flight The thrust is made by the spinning blades of a propeller Thrust can also be made by a rotating fan pushing air out from the back of a jet engine Another way is by ejecting hot gases from a rocket engine 

Reverse thrust is the opposite of forward thrust In this way air is pushed in the same way as the motion of the body Reverse thrust can be used to help braking after landing This can be done by changing the direction that a propeller turns 

Birds normally achieve thrust during flight by flapping their wings

A boat with a motor makes thrust or reverse thrust when the propellers are turned to push water backwards The thrust that this makes pushes the boat in the opposite direction than the water is being pushed 

A rocket is pushed forward by a thrust force as large as the force the exhaust gas makes when going out of the rocket nozzle The force the exhaust gas makes is called the exhaust velocity The velocity is measured compared to the rocket For vertical launch of a rocket to work the starting thrust must be more force than the weight of the rocket
