The Isles of Scilly form an archipelago off the southwestern tip of the Cornish peninsula of Great Britain 

The islands have had a unitary authority council since 1890 and are separate from the Cornwall unitary authority Some services are combined with Cornwall and the islands are still part of the ceremonial county of Cornwall

The islands are designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty They have been dangerous for ships and there are 530 known shipwrecks around the archipelago

Scilly has been inhabited since the Neolithic Its history has been one of subsistence living until the early 20th century Farming and fishing continue today but the main industry now is tourism

It is likely that until relatively recent times the Isles were much larger with many of them joined into one island named Ennor Rising sea levels flooded the central plain around 400500 AD forming the current islands

Evidence for the older large island includes

Offshore midway between Lands End and the Isles of Scilly is the supposed location of the mythical lost land of Lyonesse referred to in Arthurian literature

Scilly has been identified as the place of exile of two heretical 4th century bishops Instantius and Tiberianus who were followers of Priscillian

The Isles of Scilly form an archipelago of five populated islands and many other small rocky islets lying 45 km off Lands End They are all composed of granite of early Permian age

The position of the islands causes great contrasts The warming effect of the sea means they rarely have frost or snow This allows local farmers to grow flowers earlier than would grow on mainland Britain The chief agricultural product is cut flowers mostly daffodils 

Exposure to Atlantic winds means that spectacular winter gales lash the islands from time to time This is reflected in the landscape On Tresco the lush sub tropical Tresco Abbey Gardens shelter on the southern end of the island but the low heather and bare rock get the wind on the exposed northern end

Calluna vulgaris is the sole species in the genus Calluna in the family Ericaceae

Heather is the dominant plant on most heaths and moorland in Europe and in some bog vegetation and acidic pine and oak woodland It is tolerant of grazing and regenerates following occasional burning It is often managed in nature reserves and grouse moors by sheep or cattle grazing and also by light burning

The flowers emerge in late summer in wild plants these are normally mauve but white flowered plants also occur occasionally

Heather is an important food source for various sheep and deer which can graze the tips of the plants when snow covers low growing vegetation Willow Grouse and Red Grouse feed on the young shoots and seeds of this plant Both adults and larvae of the Heather Beetle Lochmaea suturalis feed on it and can cause damage The larvae of a number of Lepidoptera species also feed on the plant

Heather honey is a highly valued product in moorland and heathland areas with many beehives being moved there in late summer It has a strong taste and an unusual texture It is thixotropic being a jelly until stirred when it becomes a syrup but then sets again to a jelly This makes the extraction of the honey from the comb difficult and it is therefore often sold as comb honey

Heather is seen as iconic of Scotland where the plant grows widely When poems like Bonnie Auld Scotland speak of fragrant hills of purple heather when the hero of Kidnapped flees through the heather when heather and Scotland are linked in the same sentence the heather talked about is Calluna vulgaris

The Highland Boundary Fault is a geological fault that traverses Scotland from Arran and Helensburgh on the west coast to Stonehaven in the east It separates two distinctly different regions the Highlands from the Lowlands

The geological history of Scotland can be understood as the result of two great tectonic events The first was the formation of the global super continent Pangaea the second was the break up of Pangaea to form the continents we know today

The fault is the middle of three great faults which run south east to north west across Scotland In the north there is the Great Glen Fault and in the south the Southern Uplands Fault Further south just over the border with England is the Iapetus Suture where the palaeo Iapetus Ocean closed These four major geological signs mark the ancient history of Scotland

The Highland Boundary Fault was active during the Caledonian Orogeny This was a plate tectonic collision which took place from Mid Ordovician to Mid Devonian periods during the closure of the Iapetus Ocean 

The fault allowed the Midland Valley to descend as a major rift by up to 4000 metres and there was subsequently vertical movement This movement was later replaced by a horizontal shear A complementary fault the Southern Uplands Fault forms the southern boundary for the Central Lowlands

The 2011 Egyptian revolution also known as The Day of Anger and The Day of Revolt is a series of demonstrations and riots in Egypt that started on 25 January 2011 

The demonstrations and riots began in the weeks after the successful uprising in Tunisia The people who organised the Egyptian protest are hoping that the events in Tunisia would inspire the crowds to mobilise The protests are taking place in Cairo Alexandria Suez and Ismailiya In the first day of the protests the Egyptian government censored most of the media outlets inside Egypt and had taken measures to block most social media websites which helped the protesters spread news about the events On the eve of January 28 a nationwide internet and mobile phone blackout began though before dawn of the following morning it was reported that the blackout for cell phones had ended

So far there have been over 1000 arrests at least 1030 protestors were injured and at least 53 deaths have been reported

The capitol city of Cairo has been described as a war zone and the port city of Suez has been the scene of frequent violent clashes The Egyptian government has attempted to break up and contain protests using different methods Anti riot police groups have been responding to areas with shields rubber bullets batons water cannons tear gas and in some cases live ammunition For the most part the protest response has been non lethal but there have been fatalities The government successfully turned off internet access and imposed a curfew claiming that minimizing disruption from the protests is necessary to maintain order and to prevent an uprising of fundamentalist Islamic groups

The protests have captured worldwide attention due to the increasing integration of Twitter Facebook YouTube and other social media platforms that have allowed activists and onlookers to communicate coordinate and document the events as they occur As the level of publicity has increased the Egyptian government has made increasing efforts to limit internet access especially to social media On the evening of major planned protests on Friday 28 January a nationwide internet and mobile phone blackout began though before dawn the following morning it was reported that the blackout for cell phones had ended

On February 11 Mubarak resigned from office due to a result of determined protests and pressure

The Scottish Highlands is an historic region of Scotland It is the area to the north of the Highland Boundary Fault The fault separates the hard igneous and metamorphic rocks to the north from the softer sedimentary rocks of the Scottish Lowlands in the south 

The Highlands are divided in two parts The Great Glen divides the Grampian Mountains to the southeast from the Northwest Highlands 

The area is generally sparsely populated with many mountain ranges and includes the highest mountain in the British Isles Ben Nevis 

Before the 19th century the Highlands was home to a much larger population but for several reasons the area is now one of the most sparsely populated in Europe The average population density in the Highlands and Islands is lower than that of Sweden Norway Papua New Guinea and Argentina

The reasons for the low population include the harsh nature of the land Also the outlawing of the traditional Highland way of life after the Jacobite Rising of 1745 the infamous Highland Clearances and mass migration to urban areas during the Industrial Revolution all had their effects

Like the Scottish islands the Highlands are a stronghold of Protestant churches There is the Kirk but the Wee Frees are the typical religion of the Highlands and Islands Old style observance of the Sabbath is typical of these areas

The Central Lowlands or Midland Valley is a geologically defined area of relatively low lying land in southern Scotland It consists of a rift valley between the Highland Boundary Fault to the north and the Southern Uplands Fault to the south The Central Lowlands are one of the three main geographical sub divisions of Scotland the other two being the Highlands and Islands which lie to the north and west and the Southern Uplands which lie south of the second fault line

The Midland Valley has fertile low lying agricultural land and significant deposits of valuable coal and iron have led to the Central Lowlands being much more densely populated than the rest of Scotland 

The major cities of Glasgow Edinburgh Stirling and Dundee all lie in the Central Lowlands and over half of Scotlands population lives in this region

The Southern Uplands is the southernmost and least populous of mainland Scotlands three major geographic areas They lie south of the Southern Uplands Fault line that runs from Ballantrae on the Ayrshire coast northeastwards to Dunbar in East Lothian on the North Sea coast a distance of some convert220kmabbron The term is used both to describe the geographical region and to collectively denote the various ranges of hills within this region

The Southern Uplands Fault in Scotland is a fault that runs from Girvan to Dunbar on the East coast It marks the southern boundary of the Scottish Midland Valley

The Grampian Mountains or Grampians are one of the three major mountain ranges in Scotland occupying a considerable portion of the Scottish Highlands in northeast Scotland They occupy almost half the land area of Scotland

The Grampians extend southwest to northeast between the Highland Boundary Fault and Gleann Mr This includes the Cairngorms and the Lochaber hills The range includes Ben Nevis and Ben Macdui

The mountains are composed of granite gneiss marble schists and quartzite The other major mountain ranges in Scotland are the Northwest Highlands and the Southern Uplands

A number of rivers and streams rise in the Grampians the Tay Spey Cowie Water Burn of Muchalls Burn of Pheppie Burn of Elsick Cairnie Burn Don Dee and Esk The area is generally sparsely populated

The Northwest Highlands are the northern third of Scotland that is separated from the Grampian Mountains by the Great Glen The Caledonian Canal which extends from Loch Linnhe in the west via Loch Ness to the Moray Firth in the north splits this area from the rest of the country

The Highlands are formed on Lewisian gneiss the oldest layers of rock in Scotland There are impressive rock islands of dark red or gray Torridonian sandstone which project out of the gneiss Some of the peaks such as Beinn Eighe and Canisp are topped with light gray or white Cambrian quartzite

The city of Inverness known as the Capital of the Highlands is by far the largest settlement in the region It is the administrative centre for the Highland Council area

This areas climate varies with altitude It has wet warm summers average under 17C The winters are mild at low altitude but become snowier and colder with higher elevation 

Mountains may have up to 6 months of snow Naturally the area would be a vast birch pine and montane shrub forest such as those surviving in Glen Affric Snow may lie from more than a month to 105 days but not at coastal or very low altitudes

The region has steep glacier carved mountains valleys and interspersed plains Many islands lie off the coast 

Elevations of around 800 metres or over are common as are mountains exceeding 1000 metres 

The Northwest Highlands are typically not quite as cold as the Cairngorms Considering its terrain and its latitude of about 57 to 58 degrees North the area is surprisingly warm this is due to the mild influence of the Gulf Stream The aurora borealis is sometimes visible on winter nights weather permitting especially at the climax of the 11 year cycle

Bordering the region to the north east is the lowland area of Caithness

The region has a very low population density Significant settlements are Kyle of Lochalsh Mallaig Dingwall Dornoch and Ullapool

Geologically the Northwest Highlands exteds to the Hebrides especially Lewis and Harris

The main outcrops of the Lewisian complex are on the islands of the Outer Hebrides including Lewis from which the complex takes its name It is also exposed on several islands of the Inner Hebrides small islands north of the Scottish mainland and forms a coastal strip on the mainland 

The Lewisian complex or Lewisian Gneiss is a suite of Precambrian metamorphic rocks that outcrop in the northwestern part of Scotland forming part of the Hebridean Terrane These rocks are of Archaean and Paleoproterozoic age ranging from 3017 billion years ago 

They form the basement on which later sediments were deposited The Lewisian consists mainly of granitic gneisses Rocks of the Lewisian complex were caught up in the Caledonian orogeny appearing in the hanging walls of many of the thrust faults formed during the late stages of this tectonic event

Its presence at the seabed and beneath Paleozoic and Mesozoic strata west of Shetland has been confirmed by shallow boreholes and hydrocarbon exploration wells 

Basement rocks of similar type are found at the base of the Moine Supergroup sometimes with well preserved unconformable contacts These form part of the Lewisian so the Lewisian complex extends at least as far southeast as the Great Glen Fault

Expos is a pop rock group which got started in 1984 The group consist of Ann Curless Jeanette Jurado and Gioia Bruno They achieved success in the late 1980s and early 1990s Expos are the first music group to carry four top 10 hit songs on the Billboard Hot 100 The group have had over 25 million records worldwide

The caper is a perennial winter deciduous species that bears rounded fleshy leaves and big white to pinkish white flowers A caper is also the pickled bud of this plant Caper bush is present in almost all the countries and is included in the floristic composition of most of them but whether it is indigenous to this region is uncertain Although the flora of the Mediterranean region has considerable endemism the caper bush could have originated in the tropics and later been naturalized to the Mediterranean basin

The Titan stick insect is one of the largest stick insects in Australia It has a brown body with spikes on its neck The Titan stick insect can reach up to 27cm in length and takes the form of a stick as a disguise to predators

The Titan stick insect can be found in two states of Australia Queensland and New South Wales

The Titan Stick insect reproduces through sexual reproduction and lay eggs that hatch

The city was founded on May 1 2001 and was designated on April 1 2003 as a government ordinance For the histories of Urawa miya and Yono before the merger see Urawa ku and Saitama miya ku and Saitama and Yono and Saitama respectively

On April 1 2005 it merged with the city of Iwatsuki to its east which became a new ward Iwatsuki ku

The city is 20 to 30 km north of central Tokyo This is the center of the Kant Plain The city is mostly below 20 m above sea level There are no mountains or hills in the city

Saitama has ten wards which were assigned official colours as of April 2005

Manufacturing includes automotive food optical precision and pharmaceutical products Iwatsuki is famous for manufacturing of hinamatsuri dolls and ornate kabuto

Saitama is a regional transportation hub for both passengers and freight

miya Station is the biggest railway hub in the prefecture

The closest major airports are Haneda Airport and Narita International Airport both about two hours away

Omiya Law School

Saitama has two J League football teams the Urawa Red Diamonds and Omiya Ardija

The name Saitama originally comes from the Sakitama district of what is now the city of Gyda in the northern part of what is now known as Saitama Prefecture Sakitama has an ancient history and is mentioned in the famous 8th century poetry anthology Manysh The pronunciation has changed from Sakitama to Saitama over the years

With the merger of Urawa miya and Yono it was decided that a new name one fitting for this newly created prefectural capital was needed The prefectural name Saitama was changed from kanji into hiragana thus Saitama City was born It is the only prefectural capital in Japan whose name is always written in hiragana and belongs to the list of hiragana cities

However Saitama written in hiragana actually finished in second place in public polling to Saitama written in kanji Despite this government officials decided to name the new city Saitama in hiragana not kanji In third place in the poll was miya In fourth was Saitama written with an alternative kanji for sai which means colorful The sai used in the prefectural name is a rare form of a common character that means cape or promontory

Saitama has six sister cities

Lost Horizon is a 1933 novel by English writer James Hilton In this book Hilton imagined a special place high in the mountains of Tibet It was a utopian lamasery where people could live to be hundreds of years old This perfect place was called Shangri La

Hugh Conway is a member of the British diplomatic service He finds inner peace love and a sense of purpose in Shangri La People there live a very long time One theme of the book is the possibility of another world war and war preparations This was actually happening at the time The story is similar travel stories in the Tibetan borderlands by Joseph Rock in the National Geographic magazine The remote communities he visited such as Muli are similar to Hiltons fictional Shangri La The Muli town of Zhongdian has its name to Shangri La

The book describes how war on the ground would move into the air Life and all special things could be lost even history Maybe Shangri la would protect these important things for later when the world was tired of war That was the real purpose of the lamasery

Conway survived the trench warfare of WWI This strongly affected his emotions He was exhausted and felt older than he really was He is strongly attracted to life at Shangri La because the monks understand him

The origin of the eleven numbered chapters of the novel is explained in two opening and closing sections The narrator is a neurologist

This neurologist friend named Rutherford were eating dinner at Tempelhof Berlin with their old school friend Wyland The topic of Hugh Conway comes up in conversation He was a British consul in Afghanistan who disappeared mysteriously Rutherford tells the narrator later that evening that he met Conway in a French mission hospital in Chung Kiang China Conway had amnesia but recovered his memory He told Rutherford his story then disappeared again

Rutherford wrote down Conways story and gave it to the neurologist That story became the main part of the novel

In May 1931 during the British Raj in India 80 white residents were evacuated to Peshawar because of a revolution Conway the British consul age 37 Mallinson his young vice consul an American Barnard and a British missionary Miss Brinklow are in an airplane The plane is hijacked and flown over the mountains to Tibet After a crash landing the pilot dies But he told the four to get help at the nearby lamasery of Shangri La They do not know where they are but Conway thinks they passed the Himalayas and are near the Kuen Lun

Chang lives at Shangri La and speaks English He takes the four to the lamasery It has modern conveniences like central heating bathtubs from Akron Ohio a large library a grand piano a harpsichord and food from the valley below Above is Karakal a mountain more than convert28000ftm high Karakal mean Blue Moon

Mallinson wants to hire help and leave but Chang stops him politely The others eventually decide they are happy to stay Miss Brinklow will teach the people a sense of sin Barnard wants to hide form the police and look for gold Conway likes the quiet life of study

Lo Tsen is a Manchu woman at the lamasery She seems very young She does not speak English but plays the harpsichord Mallinson falls in love with her Conway does too

Conway meets the High Lama He learns that the lamasery was built by a Catholic monk named Perrault from Luxembourg in the early eighteenth century The lamasery has since then been joined by others who have found their way into the valley Once they enter the valley they age slowly If they leave the valley they age quickly and die Conway guesses that the High Lama is Perrault now 300 years old He is correct

Later the High Lama says that he is finally dying He wants Conway to lead the lamasery Meanwhile Mallinson has arranged to leave the valley with Lo Tsen and workers to carry their food and belongings They are waiting for him convert5mikm outside the valley but Mallinson cannot cross the dangerous route by himself He convinces Conway to go along This ends Rutherfords story 

The last time Rutherford saw Conway it seemed he was preparing to return to Shangri La Rutherford tells the neurologist that he tried to follow Conway and check his stories of Shangri La He found the Chung Kiang doctor who had treated Conway The doctor said Conway had been brought in by a Chinese woman who was ill She soon died The doctor told Rutherford the woman was very old Rutherford thought the old woman was Lo Tsen She had aged quickly after leaving Shangri La

The book was published in 1933 It only became popular after Hiltons next book Goodbye Mr Chips was published in 1934 Lost Horizon then became a huge success In 1939 it was published in paperback as Pocket Book 1 Because of its number one position in what became a very long list of pocket editions Lost Horizon is often called the first American paperback book This is not correct The first pocket sized paperback book sold in many stores in America was Pearl Bucks The Good Earth by Pocket Books in 1938 as an experiment

US President Franklin D Roosevelt named the Presidential hideaway in Maryland after Shangri La Now it is called Camp David Roosevelt also lied to the public and said that the Doolittle Raid came from Shangri La This became the an idea to name an aircraft carrier USS Shangri La

The book has been made into two movies

The book was also made into the unsuccessful 1956 Broadway musical Shangri La

Hiltons novel was adapted for BBC Radio 4 in three hour long episodes under its Classic Serial banner It was broadcast 20 September to 4 October 1981 Barry Campbell directed Derek Jacobi played Hugh Conway

The novel is important in the book Deadeye Dick by Kurt Vonnegut

CP Violation is refers to the violation of C symmetry and P symmetry This describes physical processes that violate the combination of charge congregation symmetry and parity symmetry both of which are fundamental symmetries of nature

In physics parity is a transformation in which the mirror image of a system is considered If the system behaves in the mirror image as it normally would it is said to respect parity symmetry usually shortened to P symmetry  Most types of physics respects P symmetry One type of interaction that often does not respect this symmetry is the weak interaction

Charge conjugation describes a type of symmetry of nature To preform a charge conjugation one would exchange all particles with their corresponding antiparticles This action would create a physical system where everything would be the same except the electromagnetic charge would be reversed For example one could make an antihydrogen atom with an antiproton and an antielectron This would result in an atom with a negatively charged nucleus orbited by a positively charged positron The masses of the nucleus and the lepton orbiting the nucleus would remain unchanged If the behavior of the system remains unchanged after charge conjugation the system is said to be symmetric with respect to charge conjugation This symmetry is also known as C symmetry

The Great Glen is a series of glens in Scotland It runs 100 kilometres from Inverness on the Moray Firth to Fort William at the head of Loch Linnhe

The Great Glen follows a large geological fault known as the Great Glen Fault It bisects the Scottish Highlands into the Grampian Mountains to the southeast and the Northwest Highlands to the northwest

The Glen is a natural travelling route in the Highlands of Scotland which is used by both the Caledonian Canal and A82 road which link the city of Inverness on the east coast with Fort William on the West 

It was important in controlling the Highland Scottish clans particularly in the Jacobite uprisings of the 18th century This is recognised by the towns of Fort William in the south Fort Augustus in the middle of the Glen and Fort George just to the north of Inverness These settlements were built by the British Army to control the Highlands in the 17th18th centuries 

Fort William is now a significant town Despite the difficult terrain Fort William has rail connection with Glasgow in the south and Mallaig on the north west coast It is a tourism centre The Caledonian Canal connects it with Inverness

Much of the Glen is taken up with a series of lochs with rivers connecting them The Caledonian Canal also uses the lochs as part of the route but the rivers are not navigable 

From northeast to southwest the natural water features along the Great Glen are 

The watershed or water divide lies between Loch Oich and Loch Lochy Loch Linnhe to the south of Fort William is a sea loch into which both the River Lochy and Caledonian Canal emerge At the north end the River Ness empties into the Moray Firth

The Great Glen Fault is a long strike slip fault that runs through its namesake the Great Glen in Scotland However the fault is actually much longer and over 400 million years old It extends in both directions beyond mainland Scotland

Aligned northeast to southwest the Great Glen Fault extends further southwest in a straight line into northwestern Ireland directly through Lough Foyle Donegal Bay and Clew Bay 

To the northeast the fault continues before becoming obscured by the effects of Mesozoic rifting to the north of Shetland

The fault continues on the North American side of the North Atlantic Ocean but is no longer part of a continuous fault The complete fault was broken when the Mid Atlantic Ridge formed 200 million years ago 

The North American side of the fault runs the length of northwestern Newfoundland Canada and on into the Gulf of St Lawrence It is at least 300 miles long

The Great Glen Fault has a long history of movements It formed towards the end of the Caledonian orogeny associated with the collision of tectonic plates at the end of the Silurian period and continued into the early Devonian The likely age range of the fault is 430390 million years ago 

The second main phase of movement was during the Carboniferous The exact timing is uncertain but associated folds within the Devonian are cut by members of the Upper Carboniferous to Lower Permian dyke swarm The Great Glen Fault had its final phase of movement during the Upper Cretaceous to early Tertiary The displacement is estimated to be 64 miles

Weathering along the fault zone during Quaternary glaciation formed the famous Loch Ness 

The fault is mostly inactive today but occasional moderate tremors have been recorded over the past 150 years

A Baroque Suite is a collection of dance pieces written in the style of Baroque music It is an important instrumental form of the period

Many composers have written Baroque Suites including George Frideric Handel

There is an accepted standard order in which the dances are performed The four primary dances are the Allemande Courante Sarabande and Gigue Many times a composer would add a Prelude before all the dances Sometimes a composer would add another piece in between the Sarabande and the Gigue

There are many exceptions to the standard order but the order of Prelude Allemande Courante Sarabande Other and Gigue is most common This can be easily remembered by the acronym PACSOG

The Iapetus Ocean was an ocean that existed in the Neoproterozoic and Paleozoic eras The Iapetus Ocean was situated in the southern hemisphere between three paleocontinents 

The ocean disappeared when these three continents joined to form one big landmass That large continent has been given various names such as Laurussia or the Old Red Sandstone continent Probably the best name is Euramerica because basically it was American and Europe stuck together

The Iapetus Ocean was positioned between continental masses that would at a much later time roughly form the opposite shores of the Atlantic Ocean It was a kind of precursor of the Atlantic

At the start of the 19th century American paleontologist Charles Doolittle Walcott noticed differences in early Paleozoic benthic trilobites either side of the line which later was called the Iapetus Suture

The so called Pacific fauna of Laurentia as found in Scotland and western Newfoundland was quite different from those of Baltica often called the Atlantic fauna The latter is found in the southern parts of the British Isles and eastern Newfoundland Geologists of the early 20th century thought a large trough a so called geosyncline had existed between Scotland and England in the early Paleozoic keeping both sides separated

With the development of plate tectonics in the 1960s geologists concluded the Atlantic Ocean must have had a precursor before the time of Pangaea That ocean had closed as three continents joined producing the Iapetus Suture

The Order of MerittagrefFor use in Canada which uses French and English as official languages at federal levelgroupnnameLingo is an order of knighthood for distinguished service in the armed forces science art literature or for the promotion of culture The order was set up in 1902 by Edward VII Membership of the order is a personal gift of its Sovereign The sovereign of the order is the reigning monarch of the Commonwealth realms and is limited to 24 living recipients at one time from these countries plus a limited number of honorary members 

While all members receive the ability to use the post nominal letters OM and a medallion for life the Order of Merits precedence amongst other honours differs between Commonwealth realms

The first mention of a possible Order of Merit was made following the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 in letters between the First Lord of the Admiralty Lord Barham and Prime Minister William Pitt though nothing came from the idea Later Queen Victoria her courtiers and politicians all thought that a new order based on the Prussian order Pour le Mrite would make up for the insufficient recognition offered by the established honours system to achievement outside of public service in realms such as art music literature industry and science Victorias husband Albert Prince Consort took an interest in the matter he wrote in his diary that he met on 16 January 1844 with Robert Peel to discuss the idea of institution of a civil Order of Merit and three days later he talked with the Queen on the subject The concept did not wither and on 5 January 1888 British prime minister the Marquess of Salisbury submitted to the Queen a draft constitution for an Order of Merit in Science and Art consisting of one grade split into two branches of knighthood the Order of Scientific Merit  for Knights of Merit in Science with the post nominal letters KMS and the Order of Artistic Merit  for Knights of Merit in Art with the post nominal letters KMA However Sir Frederic Leighton President of the Royal Academy advised against the new order primarily because of its selection process

It was Victorias son Edward VII who eventually founded the Order of Merit on 26 June 1902 the date for which his coronation had been originally planned as a means to acknowledge exceptionally meritorious service in Our Navy and Our Army or who may have rendered exceptionally meritorious service towards the advancement of Art Literature and Science all modern aspects of the order were established under his direction including the division for military figures From the outset prime ministers attempted to propose candidates or lobbied to influence the monarchs decision on appointments but the Royal Household adamantly guarded information about potential names After 1931 when the Commonwealth of Nations came into being and the former Dominions of the British Empire became independent states equal in status to the UK the Order of Merit remained an honour open to all the Kings realms thus as with the monarch who conferred it the order ceased to be purely British

From the start the order has been open to women Florence Nightingale being the first woman to receive the honour in 1907 Several individuals have refused admission into the Order of Merit such as Rudyard Kipling A E Housman and George Bernard Shaw To date Prince Philip Duke of Edinburgh remains the youngest person ever inducted into the Order of Merit having been admitted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1968 when he was 47 years of age

All citizens of the Commonwealth realms are eligible for appointment to the Order of Merit There can only be 24 living people in the order at any given time not including honorary appointees and new members are personally selected by the reigning monarch of the 16 realms presently Queen Elizabeth II with the assistance of her private secretaries the order has thus been described as quite possibly the most prestigious honour one can receive on planet Earth Within the limited membership is a designated military division with its own unique insignia though it has not been abolished it is currently unused the Earl Mountbatten of Burma having been the last person so honoured Honorary members form another group to which there is no limit though such appointments are rare individuals from countries in the Commonwealth of Nations that are not headed by Elizabeth II are considered foreigners and thus are granted only honorary admissions such as Nelson Mandela and Mother Teresa

On admission into the Order of Merit members can use the post nominal letters OM and have the badge of the order consisting of a golden crown from which is suspended a red enamelled cross itself centred by a disk of blue enamel surrounded by a gold laurel wreath and bearing in gold lettering the words FOR MERIT the insignia for the military grouping has a pair of crossed swords behind the central disk The ribbon of the Order of Merit is divided into two stripes of red and blue men wear their badges on a neck ribbon while women carry theirs on a ribbon bow pinned to the left shoulder and aides de camp may wear the insignia on their aiguillettes Since 1991 the insignia be returned upon the recipients death flagiconSouth Africa Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela statesman and Nobel laureate appointed 21 March 1995

As the Order of Merit is open to the citizens of sixteen different countries each with their own system of orders decorations and medals the orders place of precedence varies from country to country While in the United Kingdom members rank below Knights and Dames Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath it has been claimed by Stanley Martin in his book The Order of Merit 1902 2002 One Hundred Years of Matchless Honour that the Order of Merit is actually the pinnacle of the British honours system Similarly though it was not listed in the Canadian order of precedence for honours decorations and medals until December 2010 except relating to those who were appointed to the order prior to 1 June 1972 both Christopher McCreery an expert on Canadian honours and secretary to the Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia and Rafal Heydel Mankoo an editor of Burkes Peerage stated that the Order of Merit was the highest civilian award for merit a Canadian could receive

Some orders of precedence are as follows

The Ellsworth Street Bridge is a highway bridge that crosses the Willamette River in Albany Oregon United States Built in 1925 the two lane structure carries US Route 20 eastbound traffic with the adjacent Lyon Street Bridge carrying westbound traffic The convert1090ftmsingon long steel truss bridge was designed by Conde McCullough and opened in 1926

In 1887 a bridge was built across the Willamette River at Albany for the Corvallis and Eastern railway followed by the Steel Bridge built in 1893 just down river The state of Oregon began building a new bridge across the river at the city in 1925 to carry vehicular traffic Designed by state highway department bridge designer Conde McCullough it was constructed by the Union Bridge Company based in Portland Oregon The steel truss structure was completed in 1926

When the bridge opened the Albany Corvallis Highway was completed At the time the structure was named the Albany Bridge In 1973 the neighboring Lyon Street Bridge was completed to the east to expand capacity to a total of four lanes between the two bridges Ellsworth Street Bridge was refurbished in 1971 and 2002 As of 2004 the bridge handled an average of 9850 cars per day

The East Caribbean dollar is the currency of eight of the nine members of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States

It has existed since 1965 when it replaced the British West Indies dollar and it is normally abbreviated with the dollar sign or alternatively EC to distinguish it from other dollar denominated currencies 

The EC is subdivided into 100 cents It has been pegged to the United States dollar since 1976 and the exchange rate is currently at US1 EC270

Six of the eight countries which use the EC are independent The other two are British overseas territories Anguilla and Montserrat

All of the countries except Dominica are Commonwealth realms

Hurdle race is a type of track and field race

There are sprint hurdle races and long hurdle races The standard sprint hurdle race is 110 meters for men and 100 meters for women The standard long hurdle race is 400 meters for both men and women Each of these races is run over ten hurdles and they are all Olympic events

Other distances are sometimes run particularly indoors The sprint hurdle race indoors is usually 60 meters for both men and women although races 55 meters or 50 meters long are sometimes run

Hammer throw is an athletic throwing event The goal of it is to throw a heavy metal ball attached to a wire and handle The name hammer throw is derived from the older Scottish sport competitions

Like in other throwing events competitors gain maximum distance by swinging the hammer above their head to set up the circular motion Then they apply force and pick up speed by completing one to four turns in the circle In competition most throwers turn three or four times to gradually increase the velocity with each turn The thrower releases the ball from the front of the circle The most important factors for a long throw are the angle of release and the speed of the ball

Ocean thermal energy conversion is a way of getting useful energy from the worlds oceans The sun shines on the oceans of the world and in the hot parts near the equator the water at the seas surface can be quite warm sometimes 20 C or more

Many oceans are very deep and the water at the bottom of the ocean can be quite cold around 5 C or so

If a pipe is put down into the ocean we can bring the cold water to the surface where we also have warm water available

The difference in temperature between the warm surface water and the cold deep water may only be around 15 C But we can build a machine called a heat engine which can use this difference to generate power that can be used by people that live in that place A machine which can do this is called an OTEC machine which stands for ocean thermal energy conversion

Because the difference in temperature is small we will need to get large quantities of warm and cold water to go through the machine to get a useful amount of work but large quantities are available in the ocean

It has been estimated that OTEC could give amounts of energy that are 10 to 100 times greater than the other ocean energy source wave power

The first OTEC machine was built in Cuba in 1930 and made 22 kW of electricity The largest machine built so far generated 250 kW in 1999 and was made by the US Plans to build even bigger machines of around 10 MW have been made

OTEC can also supply quantities of cold water as a by product This can be used for air conditioning and refrigeration and can help crops and fish grow OTEC can also produce large amounts of salt free water which can be useful on mid ocean islands as drinking water

Middle distance race event is longer than sprints up to 3000 metres The standard middle distances are the 800 metres 1500 metres and the mile run while the 3000 metres may also be classified as a middle distance event The 880 yard run or half mile was the forebear to the 800 m distance and it has its roots in competitions in the United Kingdom in the 1830s The 1500 m came about as a result of running three laps of a 500 m track which was commonplace in continental Europe in the 20th century

Counter Strike is a first person shooter video game for the computer It was made by Valve Corporation in 1999 In which you play as special united states solders disguised as terrorists and doing secret missions One team plays as the terrorists and the other plays as the counter terrorists You play online against each other each having different objectives or goals This game was at first a fan made mod of the classic game Half Life but was later bought by Valve and actually turned into a real game marketed and sold in retail stores It is commonly refereed to today as one of the best video game mods ever made

Walking race or race walking is a long distance athletic event It is different from running in that one foot must appear to be in contact with the ground at all times Stride length is reduced so to achieve competitive speeds race walkers must attain pace rates comparable to those achieved by Olympic 400 meter runnersand they must do so for hours at a time since the Olympic events are the 20 km race walk and 50 km race walk

In St Kitts or when representing St Kitts in another country she is known as the Queen of St Kitts and Nevis Her full official title being Elizabeth the Second by the Grace of God Queen of Saint Christopher and Nevis and of Her other Realms and Territories Head of the Commonwealth

When acting as Queen of St Kitts Elizabeth II only takes advice from the Government of St Kitts and Nevis This is because the Statute of Westminster of 1931 said that all Commonwealth countries were independent of each other and that the British government no longer had the right to interfere or give orders to the other countries

Usually the Queens constitutional roles are carried out by the Governor General of Saint Kitts and Nevis 

Royal succession is governed by the English Act of Settlement of 1701 which is part of constitutional law

The giant impact hypothesis is that the Moon was created out of the debris from a collision between the young Earth and a Mars sized protoplanet This is the favoured scientific hypothesis for the formation of the Moon 

Evidence for this hypothesis comes from Moon samples which show that

The colliding body is sometimes called Theia for the mythical Greek Titan who was the mother of Selene the goddess of the moon 

There are several unanswered issues with this hypothesis Lunar oxygen isotopic ratios are essentially identical to Earth with no evidence of a contribution from another solar body Also lunar samples do not have expected ratios of volatile elements iron oxide or siderophilic elements and there is no evidence that the Earth ever had the magma ocean implied by the hypothesis

The Earths relatively large natural satellite the Moon is unique During the Apollo program rocks from the Moons surface were brought to Earth Radiometric dating of these rocks has shown the Moon to be 4527 10 million years old about 30 to 55 million years younger than other bodies in the solar system New evidence suggests the Moon formed even later 448002Ga or 70110Ma after the start of the Solar System Another notable feature is the relatively low density of the Moon which must mean it does not have a large metallic core which other terrestrial bodies in the solar system have The Moon has a bulk composition closely resembling the Earths mantle and crust together without the Earths core This has led to the giant impact hypothesis the idea that the Moon was formed during a giant impact of the proto Earth with another protoplanet

The impactor sometimes called Theia is thought to have been a little smaller than the planet Mars Theia collided with Earth about 4533 Ga Models reveal that when an impactor this size struck the proto Earth at a low angle and relatively low speed much material from the mantles of the proto Earth and the impactor was ejected into space where much of it stayed in orbit around the Earth This material would eventually form the Moon 

However the metallic cores of the impactor would have sunk through the Earths mantle to fuse with the Earths core depleting the Moon of metallic material The giant impact hypothesis thus explains the Moons abnormal composition The ejecta in orbit around the Earth could have condensed into a single body within weeks Under the influence of its own gravity the ejected material became a more spherical body the Moon

The radiometric ages show the Earth existed already for at least 10 million years before the impact enough time to allow for differentiation of the Earths primitive mantle and core Then when the impact occurred only material from the mantle was ejected leaving the Earths core of heavy elements untouched

The impact had some important consequences for the young Earth It released a enormous amount of energy causing both the Earth and Moon to be completely molten Immediately after the impact the Earths mantle was vigorously convecting the surface was a large magma ocean The planets first atmosphere must have been completely blown away by the enormous amount of energy released The impact is also thought to have changed Earths axis to produce the large 235 axial tilt that is responsible for Earths seasons It may also have sped up Earths rotation

COBOL is a programming language that was developed in 1959 It was one of the first programming languages The name COBOL stands for COmmon Buisness Oriented Language COBOL was created because people wanted a language they could use to describe the problems in a way that is independent of the hardware used Like SQL COBOL uses a syntax that is close to that of natural languages As an example ADD YEARS TO AGE is a valid expression There are several different versions of COBOL The newest is from 2002 In general versions of the language before 1985 are not compatible with the newer versions from 1985 and later 

In his letter to an editor in 1975 titled How do we tell truths that might hurt computer scientist and Turing Award recipient Edsger Dijkstra remarked that The use of COBOL cripples the mind its teaching should therefore be regarded as a criminal offense In this letter Dijkstra also criticised several other languages which were used at the time

The computer scientist Howard E Tompkins disagreed and defended structured COBOL COBOL programs with convoluted control flow indeed tend to cripple the mind but this was because there are too many such business application programs written by programmers that have never had the benefit of structured COBOL taught well

In recent years COBOL has been extended to allow object oriented programming user defined functions and user defined data types 

Edsger Wybe Dijkstra was a Dutch computer scientist He received the 1972 Turing Award for fundamental contributions to developing programming languages and was the Schlumberger Centennial Chair of Computer Sciences at The University of Texas at Austin from 1984 until 2000

Shortly before his death in 2002 he received the ACM PODC Influential Paper Award in distributed computing for his work on self stabilization of program computation This annual award was renamed the Dijkstra Prize the following year in his honor

Lotus is owned by Proton Proton took over Lotus after the bankruptcy of former owner Bugatti in 1994

The company was started as Lotus Engineering Ltd by engineer Colin Chapman in 1952 The first factory was in old stables in Hornsey North London Team Lotus was started in 1954 It was split off from the Lotus Engineering company Team Lotus was active and competitive in Formula One racing from 1958 to 1994 

The Lotus Group of Companies was formed in 1959 One company was Lotus Cars Limited which made road cars The other company was Lotus Components Limited which worked on customer race cars Lotus Components Limited became Lotus Racing Limited in 1971 but stopped building cars in the same year

In 1959 the company moved to Cheshunt into a factory built to make cars Since 1966 the company has been in a modern factory and road test facility at Hethel near Wymondham This site is the former RAF Hethel base The test track uses parts of the old runway

Chapman died of a heart attack in 1982 at the age of 54 The car maker built tens of thousands of successful racing and road cars They won the Formula One World Championship seven times At the time of his death he was linked with the DeLorean scandal over the use of government subsidies for the production of DeLorean DMC 12 for which Lotus had designed the chassis

In 1986 the company was bought by General Motors On 27 August 1993 GM sold the company to Bugatti Automobili SpA In 1996 a majority share in Lotus was sold to Proton a Malaysian car company

The company is organized as Group Lotus Group Lotus is divided into Lotus Cars and Lotus Engineering Lotus Engineering builds suspension for other car builders They also worked with General Motors to develop the 4 cylinder Ecotec engine

The four letters in the middle of the logo stand for the initials of Anthony Colin Bruce Chapman

The Lotus Cars helped its customers to race its cars They entered Formula One through its sister company Team Lotus in 1958 In 1960 Lotus got its first win in F1 A Lotus 18 driven by Stirling Moss won at Monaco The car was entered by privateer Rob Walker 

They had big success in 1963 with the Lotus 25 With Jim Clark driving Lotus its first F1 World Constructors Championship Clark had a bad crash in a Formula Two Lotus 48 in April 1968 He was killed in the crash It was a severe blow to the team and to Formula One Clark was the dominant driver with the best car at the time He is an important part of Lotus early years The 1963 championship was won by Clarks teammate Graham Hill

Lotus made the mid engined layout popular for IndyCars They developed the first monocoque Formula One chassis They also made the engine and transaxle a part of the chassis A transaxle is a combination of the transmission and rear axle Lotus was also among the first in Formula One to add wings and shape the bottom of the car This created aerodynamic downforce They were the first to move radiators to the sides of the car This improved the aerodynamic performance of the car Lotus also developed active suspension

After Chapmans death until the late 1980s Lotus was still to be a major player in Formula One Ayrton Senna drove for the team from 1985 to 1987 Senna won twice in each year and earned 17 pole positions By the companys last Formula One race in 1994 the cars were not competitive Lotus won a total of 79 Grand Prix races Lotus was the first team to achieve 50 Grand Prix victories

Formula One Constructors Championships

In 1992 Team Lotus started Classic Team Lotus for the Works historic motorsport activity Classic Team Lotus keeps Lotus F1 cars fixed and in running condition They race them in the FIA Historic Formula One Championship It keeps the Team Lotus archive and the Works Collection of cars It is managed by Clive Chapman the son of Colin Chapman At the end of the 1994 season Lotus left Formula One racing

The Lotus name returned to Formula One for the 2010 season A new team in Malaysia was started called Lotus Racing They used the Lotus name with licensor from Group Lotus The new team was unrelated to the old Team Lotus The new team was funded by a Malaysian Consortium including Proton Proton is the owner of Lotus Cars

After the 2010 season Proton ended the license for Lotus Racing to use the Lotus name Proton believed the team broke the license rules Lotus Racing then bought Team Lotus Ventures Ltd This company owned the rights to use the name Team Lotus The Lotus Racing team announced they would be known as Team Lotus starting in 2011 

In December 2010 Group Lotus purchased part of the Renault F1 team They announced the team would be now be known as Lotus Renault GP Lotus Renault GP will compete in Formula One starting in 2011

At the 2010 Paris Motorshow Lotus announced five new models These will be introduced over the next five years

Lotus Engineering has established a group dedicated to hybrid and electric vehicles

Lotus plans to enter the electric vehicle race CEO Michael Kimberley told the Financial Times Dont be surprised to see an electric Lotus shortly he said adding that a concept version could debut as early as March 2009 at Geneva Motor Show Lotus is now front and center in the electric car arena

Lotus did not reveal details about the car or the engine but discloses that it will go for 300 to convert400mikm and it will really live up to the expectations of being one of the best electric cars in the world

Lotus joined Jaguar Cars MIRA Ltd and Caparo on a luxury hybrid executive sedan project called Limo Green funded by the UK Government Technology Strategy Board The vehicle will be a series plug in hybrid

Tesla Motors a likely rival for Lotus if its plans go through has also turned to contractors for parts of the all electric Roadster Of note however is the fact that Tesla currently obtains the chassis for their Roadster from Lotus as do Dodge for their EV because of the heavy weight of the batteries in an EV and Lotuss widely known low weight and sharp handling characteristics While only 10 of the parts of the Tesla Roadster are shared with the Lotus Elise Lotus is responsible for approximately 40 of the overall content of the car

Lotus Cars were awarded the Queens Award for Enterprise for contribution to International Trade one of 85 companies receiving the recognition in that category in 2002 Lotus cars wore the badge of the award for a number of years

Genetic counselling or counseling is the process by which clients are advised about genetic disorders Genetic disorders by definition can be passed on in heredity Example many descendents of Queen Victoria carried one or both alleles for haemophilia It was a hereditary disease in European royal families

Clients with a disorder may be interested in the probability of developing or transmitting a genetic disorder to their children They may ask what the options are to prevent avoid or ameliorate it

Facilities and rules vary in different countries In the United States the National Society of Genetic Counselors defines genetic counselling as 

A genetic counsellor is an expert with a Master of Science degree in genetic counseling In the United States they are certified by the American Board of Genetic Counseling Most enter the field from biology genetics nursing psychology public health and social work Genetic counsellors need to be expert educators skilled in translating ideas into terms that are easy to understand

Families may choose to attend counselling or undergo prenatal testing for a number of reasons

Within about ten years the cost of complete genome analysis will have come down so far that individual people will be able to have their own genome analysed In fact there are claims that the day has already arrived

Pacific Biosciences stated they may not release their second generation machine capable of a US1000 genome until 2013 Complete Genomics however stated that they will be able to provide a US5000 full genome sequencing service by the summer of 2009 Complete Genomics demonstrated in a peer reviewed paper that was published online in Science in Nov 2009 that it could sequence a human genome for a consumables cost of approximately US1700 The accuracy and completeness of these systems is a critical issue

It is obvious that the demand for genetic counselling will increase hugely once accurate and complete genome analyses are widely available The problem then will be to interpret what the analysis shows At present there are many genes whose functions are not yet known and many alleles whose effect is not known

Already it is possible to identify the sex of a foetus in the womb and to identify some of the most common disorders This may depending on legal and religious constraints influence abortion of the foetus in some cases In some cases the effects of a defect can be anticipated and prevented or cured These issues do not affect most people today but as genomic analysis advances genetic counselling will become of much greater significance

ImageJackCrawfordMemorialjpgthumbrightCrawfords headstone at Holy Trinity graveyard in the East EndJack Crawford was a sailor of the Royal Navy He was most famous for his actions at the Battle of Camperdown in 1797 and so is known as the Hero of Camperdown

Crawford was born in the east end of Sunderland He trained as a keelman until 1786 when he joined the crew of the Peggy at South Shields as an apprentice He was still only 11 or 12 years old In 1796 he was press ganged into the Royal Navy and served on HMS Venerable under Admiral Duncan the Royal Navy Commander in Chief of the North Seas

At the Battle of Camperdown Venerable was Admiral Duncans flagship During the battle part of the Venerables mast was felled including the admirals flag Lowering the Admirals personal flag was a sign of surrender Crawford climbed the mast and nailed the colours to the top

After the victory procession in London he was formally presented to King George III of the United Kingdom and was given a government pension of 30 a year and later a silver medal from the people of Sunderland However Crawford fell on hard times and drunkenness and had to sell his medal He became the second victim of the cholera epidemic of 1831 and was buried in an unmarked paupers grave 

Towards the end of the nineteenth century interest in the Hero of Camperdown was renewed A headstone was put up in Holy Trinity Sunderland churchyard in 1888 Two years later a monument was erected in Mowbray Park opposite what is now the Civic Centre 

A pub in Monkwearmouth was named the Jack Crawford and sported a carved figure of him on the side of the building After the pub was destroyed during World War II the figure was removed In 1987 it was loaned to Sunderland Museum and put on display in the local history gallery but has been returned to the owner The Museum holds Jack Crawford in high regard There was an exhibition about him on the bicentenary of the Battle of Camperdown and there was a display about him in SeaBritain Year One of the Learning Rooms is named after him and there are several pieces of nineteenth century Jack Crawford commemorative pottery on display in the Pottery Gallery and the silver medal that was presented to him by the Town following the battle in 1797 and given to the Museum by the Earl of Camperdown in 1880 is proudly on display in the Sunderland Heroes section of the Museum Street near the entrance of this award winning Museum

Outside Sunderland doubt has been raised about Crawfords heroics Nevertheless possible evidence that Crawford was not a volunteer that he was forced to climb the mast or that he was drunk is ignored by the people of his hometown One book written by the American Sheri Holman attracted criticism from the Citys Mayor However local historian William Corder had already made the criticism in the 1890s Corder thought little of Crawford He claimed that it was reported by reliable witnesses that Crawford was drunk acted without orders and should have been court martialled Furthermore Corder dismissed as a deplorable monument what others called the fine headstone of 1888

Ski jumping is mostly a winter sport performed on snow where skiers go down a take off ramp jump forward and land as far as possible down the hill below Judges give points both for length of the jump and for the jump style The skis used for ski jumping are wide and long Ski jumping is a part of the Winter Olympic Games 

True ski jumping originates in Norway in 1809 when a Norwegian lieutenant launched himself 95 metres in the air in front of his soldiers The first widely known ski jumping competition was held in Oslo in 1879 with Olaf Haugann of Norway setting the first world record for the longest ski jump at 20 metres

Ski jump techniques is divided into four sections 1 In run 2 Take off 3 Flight and 4 Landing In each part the athlete is required to pay attention to and practice a particular technique in order to maximize his or her length and style marks

commonscatFreestyle skiing is an acrobatic form of skiing which is divided into a number of different disciplines Freestyle skiing first began to be taken seriously in the 1960s and early 1970s However some people thought that this style of skiing was too dangerous and did not want it to be an Olympic sport The free form sport had few rules and was not without danger knee injuries became a common case for professional freestylers

The International Ski Federation recognized freestyle as a sport in 1979 and brought in new regulations regarding certification of athletes and jump techniques in an effort to curb the dangerous elements of the competitions The first World Cup series was staged in 1980 and the first FIS Freestyle World Ski Championship took place in 1986 in Tignes France 

The City of London Livery Companies began as trade associations or trade guilds which controlled who could carry out certain jobs in the City of London

Today the companies act mainly as social and charitable groups because over the centuries the livery companies have lost most rights to control trade often as statute law applied the same standards across the whole country  Some support schools which were set up in the 1500s Others sponsor apprentices in colleges and unversities Some still have a statutory role  For example the Goldsmiths Company continue to run the London Assay Office where several million articles of gold silver and platinum are hallmarked each year

The order of precedence was first set down in 1515 by the Aldermen of the City of London Forty eight livery companies then existed The list was based on the companies economic or political power 

The first twelve livery companies are known as the Great Twelve City Livery Companies There are now 108 livery companies some very new so the Order of Precedence is sometimes reviewed

The Merchant Taylors and the Skinners have always disputed their precedence so once a year they exchange sixth and seventh place This is one of the theories for the origin of the phrase at sixes and sevens as the master of the Merchant Taylors has said a number of times although the first use of the phrase may have been before the Taylors and the Skinners decided to alternate their position Both companies had been founded before the birth of Chaucer who was one of the first people to use the phrase so it may have dated from before him

Two old companies do not intend applying for a grant of the right to wear the special costume or uniform known as a livery 

Three groups intend applying for livery One has already been recognised as a Company without Livery the other two have not yet existed long enough or become well enough known

A farrier is a person who works with iron or other materials to make horseshoes and take care of horses hooves They check for signs of disease and make sure the feet are well cared for 

At one time a farrier and blacksmith had almost the same job which can be seen by the etymology of the word farrier comes from Middle French ferrier from the Latin word ferrum Today farriers usually specialize in horseshoeing and on the care of the horses hoof For this reason farriers and blacksmiths are now known to be different jobs

By law in Great Britain it is illegal for anyone except a registered farrier to call themselves a farrier or to carry out any farriery work under the Farriers Act 1975 The main aim of this act is to prevent and avoid suffering by and cruelty to horses arising from the shoeing of horses by unskilled persons

The Worshipful Company of Farriers a London Livery Company was set up in 1356 It still offers diplomas which are recognised qualifications to be a modern farrier

Ichthyornis was a tern like extinct bird that lived alongside dinosaurs like T rex and Triceratops It lived in flocks nested on shorelines and hunted for fish in Cretaceous seas Ichthyornis lived 135 70 million years ago during the Cretaceous period

Ichthyornis was about 8 inches long It had a large head toothed jaws and a long beak This powerful flyer is the oldest known bird that had a keeled breastbone similar to that of modern birds

Ichthyornis was originally found in 1872 in Kansas by a member of paleontologist Othniel C Marsh in Yale University expedition Ichthyornis was named by Marsh in 1872 Fossils have been found in Kansas and Texas and in Alberta

Designer baby is a colloquial term that refers to a baby whose genetic makeup has been artificially selected by genetic engineering combined with in vitro fertilization to make sure that there is a presence or absence of certain genes or characteristics The term is derived by comparing artificially selected babies with designer clothing Reasons parents design their babies are varied

Herons are wading birds in the Ardeidae family There are 64 recognised species in this family Some are called egrets or bitterns instead of herons

Within the family all members of the genera Botaurus and Ixobrychus are referred to as bitterns and are a monophyletic group within the Ardeidae 

On the other hand egrets are not a biologically distinct group and are called egrets because they are mainly white andor have decorative plumes Although egrets have the same build as the larger herons they tend to be smaller

The classification of the individual heronegret species is fraught with difficulty and there is still no clear consensus about the correct placement of many species into either of the two major genera Ardea and Egretta 

Although herons resemble birds in some other families such as the storks ibises and spoonbills they differ from these in flying with their necks retracted not outstretched They are also one of the bird groups that have powder down 

Some members of this group nest colonially in trees others notably the bitterns use reedbeds

Serotonin is a neurotransmitter From its chemical structure it is called 5 Hydroxytryptamine or 5 HT It is derived from Tryptophan Serotonin can mainly be found in the gastroinstestinal tract platelets and central nervous system of certain animals including humans Its name is derived from its effect on blood pressure Serotonin is a part of the serum which regulates the tonus of blood vessels Serotonin also contributes to the feeling of well being For this reason it is often labeled happiness hormone even though it is not a hormone Serotonin is a monoamine

Serotonin is also found in fungi and plants Its presence in insect venoms and plant spines serves to cause pain which is a side effect of serotonin injection Serotonin is produced by pathogenic amoebas and its effect on the gut causes diarrhea It can be found in many seeds and fruits This may serve to stimulate the digestive tract to expel the seeds 

The ibises are a group of long legged wading birds in the family Threskiornithidae

They all have long down curved bills and usually feed as a group probing mud for food items usually crustaceans Most species nest in trees often with spoonbills or herons

TrES 4b is an exoplanet It orbits around the star GSC 02620 00648 The planet is 45 million miles from its sun Being this close to its sun the year on TrES 4b about three days long This makes the temperature on the planet very hot In fact the temperature on TrES 4b is about 2300 degrees Fahrenheit 

TrES 4b is a gas giant that is 70 percent bigger than Jupiter However the planet is only as dense as cork At the time of its discovery TrES 4b was the largest known planet in the universe

The planet was found by Georgi Mandushev at the Lowell Observatory in Arizona Mandushev discovered the planet as a part of the Trans Atlantic Exoplanet Survey project

TrES 4b was discovered using the transit method When an exoplanet passes between its sun and the Earth astronomers can see a change in light from the star

The oxpeckers are the two species of bird which make up the family Buphagidae 

Oxpeckers are endemic to the savanna of Sub Saharan Africa Their names come from their habit of perching on large mammals such as cattle or rhinoceroses and eating ticks botfly larvae and other parasites

According to the more recent studies of phylogeny the oxpeckers are an ancient line related to the Mimidae and starlings but not particularly close to either

Considering the known biogeography of these groups the most plausible explanation seems that the oxpecker lineage originated in Eastern or Southeastern Asia like the other two This would make the two species of Buphagus something like living fossils and elegantly demonstrates that such remnants of past evolution can possess striking and unique adaptations

Oxpeckers feed exclusively on the backs of large mammals Certain species seem preferred whereas others like the Lichtensteins hartebeest or Topi are generally avoided The smallest regularly used species is the Impala probably because of the heavy tick load and social nature of that species In many parts of their range they now feed on cattle but avoid camels They feed on ectoparasites particularly ticks as well as insects infecting wounds and the flesh and blood of some wounds as well 

Oxpeckermammal interactions are the subject of some debate and ongoing research They were originally thought to be an example of mutualism but recent evidence suggests that oxpeckers may be parasites instead Oxpeckers do eat ticks but often the ticks that have already fed on the ungulate host and there has been no proven statistically significant link between oxpecker presence and reduced ectoparasite load However one study of impalas found that impalas which were used by oxpeckers spent less time grooming themselves suggesting a reduction in parasite load Oxpeckers have been observed to open new wounds and enhance existing ones in order to drink the blood of their perches Oxpeckers also feed on the earwax and dandruffs of mammals although less is known about the benefits of this to the mammal it is suspected that this is also a parasitic behaviour Some oxpecker hosts are intolerant of their presence Elephants and some antelope will actively dislodge the oxpeckers when they land Other species tolerate oxpeckers while they search for ticks on the face what one author described as appears to be an uncomfortable and invasive process

Immigration to Canada is a way that people from other countries can move to Canada Some laws about this include the Immigration Act 1976 and the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act 2002

Canada lets many people move to Canada Because of this there are some high percentages of non Canadians in ethnicity results

Even after Canadian colonization by the United Kingdom and France there have been many other people coming to Canada in large groups

In the 1700s the French were settling in Quebec and Acadia followed by some American and European movement

After the American Revolution ended many Americans loyal to Britain went to Canada as it was the last main territory in North America still loyal to the Crown

The War of 1812 promoted British and Irish immigration to Canada Some British officers went to Canada fearing that the Americans would invade Canada While Irish immigration was still high eventually some went to the United States

Others went to Canada from America especially during the Klondike Gold Rush

This time many people went to Canada from Europe A large spike in the third group was pre World War I

This group saw a increase in Asian immigrants

Lessepsian migration is the name given for the migration of marine species through the Suez Canal between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean 

It is named after Ferdinand de Lesseps who built the Suez Canal The Suez Canal joined two biospheres that were separate before Many species migrated from the Red Sea to the Eastern Mediterranean Only a few species migrated in the other direction from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea The migration can be seen most clearly when looking at fish species even though other animals also migrated

When the Suez Canal was opened in 1869 it created the first salt water passage between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean The Bitter Lakes are two very salty lakes about mid way in the canal At first this blocked the migration of species from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean Over the last decades the salinity of the lakes changed which made it easier for species to migrate 

The Red Sea is higher than the Mediterranean at high tide water flows from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean The Red Sea is also poor in nutrients so species who migrate will find more nutrients The waters of the Red Sea are saltier than that of the Mediterranean For these reasons most species migrate from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean and only very few migrate in the other direction

When the Aswan High Dam was built in the 1960s this blocked the flow of freshwater from the Nile into the Mediterranean As a result the salinity levels in the Eastern Mediterranean increase and make it much more like the Red Sea this means that migration will become even easier as conditions are very similar 

Invasive species coming from the Red Sea and introduced into the Mediterranean by the construction of the canal have become a major component of the Mediterranean ecosystem They have serious impacts on the Mediterranean ecology endangering many local and endemic Mediterranean species To this day about 300 species native to the Red Sea have been identified in the Mediterranean Sea and there are probably others still unidentified 

The Egyptian government announced it plans to deepen and widen the canal This announcement has raised concerns from marine biologists who fear that this will worsen the invasion of Red Sea species into the Mediterranean and make the crossing of the canal easier for additional species

Today the term Lessepsian migration is used more broadly for any migration of animals over man made structures

One of the most pressing tasks for the new government was to draft a new constitution When martial law was finally lifted the Assembly was summoned in April 1972 on the basis of the 1970 election results in the former West Pakistan region A committee was set up from a cross section of politicians from different parties There were disagreements within the committee as to whether the new constitution should bring in parliamentary rule or a presidential system of government There were also differing views over the question of provincial autonomy It took the constitutional committee eight months before it submitted its report on 10th April 1973 The draft constitution was passed by the federal Assembly by 135 votes in favour with three abstentions It was brought into force on 14th August 1973 and Bhutto was elected prime minister by the National Assembly on 12th August The Constitutions main features were

I Pakistan shall be a federal Republic with a Parliamentary system of government The prime minister shall be the head of government elected from the majority party

II The special position of Islam as the state religion shall be emphasized and both the prime minister and president are required to be Muslims

III Pakistan shall be declared an Islamic Republic by default

IV A bill to amend the constitution shall need a two thirds majority in the lower house and a majority in the upper house

V All fundamental human rights shall be guaranteed but the stipulation was added that it was subject to resonable restrictions imposed by law

VI The supreme Court and High Courts shall be given the power to enforce fundamental rights

VII The president shall act in accordance with the binding advice of the prime minister and all orders of president shall be counter signed by the prime minister

VIII The senate or upper house shall be elected mostly from the provincial governments and so for the first time the interests of the provinces shall be safeguarded at the centre The Senate shall not be dissolved even in emergencies

IX In case of emergencies the federal government can pass legislation on anything and can even suspend fundamental freedoms

X Urdu shall be the official language of the country with Pakistani English to be retained for the next 15 years

XI Pakistan shall be a federal Islamic state so residuary powers shall rest with provinces not the central government

The 1973 Constitution therefore marked a return to a parliamentary form of democracy after the presidential experiment introduced under the 1962 constitution There were also concessions made to the provinces to alleviate fears that the central government would overule them on every issue This was important as the one unit scheme had only recently been abolished and because 2 of the 4 provincial governments in the new State of Pakistan were non PPP The 1973 Constitution however had another advantage over its two predecessors it had been agreed and voted on by a democratically elected Assembly This gave it greater authority and even though it was suspended under the next martial law regime it was restored in 1985 and remains in place to date

According to Harriet Smith editor of the book some of the manuscripts of Twains autobiography are handwritten by him but most are transcripts of what he said typed by helpers such as his secretaries and his youngest daughter There are three drafts of much of the autobiography an original a copy used for the 25 installments of the book in North American Review and a copy used for Paines 1924 edition of the book Clemens proofread them Into his dictations he often inserted earlier manuscripts he wrote and also letters newspaper clippings and other documents In Smiths 2010 edition Clemens instructions are not always followed For example she did not insert his article about the survivors of the sunken ship in his February 20 1906 dictation Also she did not include in the January 12 1906 dictation the illustrated magazine about his 70th birthday dinner Discovered factual errors are pointed out in the books explanatory notes rather than corrected She has made some corrections such as spelling and adding missing prepositions She does not correct grammar when the text would lose the spoken style For example she believes  the worlds sympathy and compassion are with her where it belongs is bad grammar but does not correct it

Larry Rohter in his July 9 2010 review in The New York Times describes Twain as a Colonel Sanders without the chicken who told stories whose books Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer he had to read in high school In writing his autobiography Twain spoke his recollections and opinions to his secretary for a more natural frank colloquial tone than if he had written them down Twain died on April 21 1910 He was 74 years old The content of his 500000 word autobiography is being published in the random order he wrote it and that is the way he wanted it to be Previous editions of the work have put things in chronological order They have also censored it for interest and propriety This edition published over 100 years after his death has the material in the order he wrote it and uncensored The University of California Press is publishing it in three volumes Five percent of the first volume was never published before and about fifty percent of all three volumes was never published before Twain claims some shocking things such as the elder Rockefeller paying taxes on only 25 million of his fortune and a US Army overkill against six hundred Philippine savages resisting US imperialism In Twains boyhood in Missouri he was not aware there was anything wrong about slavery When Cleveland was US President Twain met him in the White House and got the First Ladys autograph Twain resented his publisher and an inventor for fleecing him and also a rude landlord from when he lived in Italy in 1904

Julie Bosmans review on November 19 2010 in The New York Times said the book is a four pound 500000 word 3500 doorstopper more political than Twains previous works The content is nonlinear although very readable It seems like a reader could flip the book open at random to any part of it and not worry about plot The book includes 200 pages of end notes At first the publisher planned to print 7500 copies However because it was being published a century after Twains death as he wanted it to be the book got in the news Before the books November 15th publication date magazines including Newsweek Playboy and Harpers ran excerpts from the book The book was quickly sold out and back ordered The publisher was University of California Press A girl with them said We feel like wow  people are interested in a 736 page scholarly tome about Mark Twain They rushed to send copies to bookstores in time for the holidays The publisher hired a small printer in Michigan to print the books They worked overtime producing 30000 copies a week and got bigger trucks to bring the books to the warehouses Instead of 7500 copies the book got on best seller lists with over 275000 copies in November 2010 The book was the biggest success the University of California Press had in sixty years

The endgame in chess is the part of the game when there are few pieces left on the board Alternatively endgames begin when the middlegame is over and kings are relatively safe 

There are three main strategic differences between earlier parts of the game and endgame the 

All endgame positions can be put into two camps On the one hand are positions which may be won by force On the other hand are positions which are drawn or which should be drawn The ones that are drawn for certain may be legally drawn or drawn by chess experience All endgames in master chess revolve around the borderline between winning and drawing Generally once a textbook drawn position is reached the players will agree a draw otherwise they play on

Endgames can be studied according to the type of pieces that remain on board For example king and pawn endgames have only kings and pawns on one or both sides and the task of the stronger side is to promote one of the pawns Other endings are studied according to the pieces on board other than kings eg rook and pawn versus rook endgame

Basic checkmates are positions in which one side has only a king and the other side has one or two pieces enough to checkmate the opponents king They are usually learned at the beginner stage Examples are mate with KQ v K KR v K K2B v K KBN v K

Positions for which the result is certain given best play are technical positions The best example is the analysis by computer chess engine of all possible positions with six pieces or fewer This is called proof by exhaustion or exhaustive proof It is logically the same as proving a mathematical theorem by proving the complete set of individual cases covered by the theorem

After the chess engine has analysed the positions the results are put into an endgame tablebase for easy retrieval by users Working with a database to discover previously unknown facts is called data mining

A number of interesting and surprising facts have indeed emerged For example For all three to five piece endgames and pawnless six piece endgames a complete list of mutual zugzwangs has been tabulated and published

Another case is the longest sequence of moves to reach a definite result called Depth to conversion In May 2006 Bourzutschky and Konoval discovered a KQN vs KRBN position with an astonishing DTC of 517 moves

Display is a form of animal behaviour linked to survival of the species in various ways 

One function of display is in courtship In most species the male has a striking feature that is distinguished by colour shape or size used to attract a female In many species the male has another more cryptic form out of the mating season

A related function is armament exhibited and used by tournament species In these species males fight to gain the right to breed The display part of the process is a mechanism for younger males to avoid being damaged by prime males Instinctive behaviour prompts lesser males to leave the field Peafowl deer antelope and elephant seals are good examples

The other main function is in species which have territorial display behaviour This may preserve a foraging or hunting territory for its family or group

Antelope is a term for many even toed ungulate species This is not a strict taxonomic term they are not a clade Antelope is a wastebasket taxon within the family Bovidae It includes the old world species which are not cattle sheep buffalo bison or goats 

Antelope are found mostly in Africa below the Sahara and parts of Asia No antelope are native to North America the Pronghorn is a member of the family Antilocapridae another family True antelope have horns which are unbranched and never shed while Pronghorns have branching horns and shed annually 

There are 91 species of antelope most of which are native to Africa in about 30 genera A group of antelope is called a herd

Species of forest woodland or bush tend to be sedentary but many of the plains species undertake huge migrations These migrations enable grass eating species to follow the rains and therefore their food supply The gnus and gazelles of East Africa perform some of the most impressive mass migratory circuits of all mammals 

All bovids have even toed hooves horizontal pupils ruminating guts and bony horns Many antelope are sexually dimorphic In most species both sexes have horns but those of males tend to be larger There is a tendency for males to be larger than the females

Horns are not shed and are not made of bone which distinguishes them from antlers Gazelles and Springbok are known for their speed and leaping abilities Even larger antelope such as Elands and Kudus are capable of jumping 8 feet or greater although their running speed is restricted by their greater mass

He made his NHL debut in Ottawa in 199596 scoring 14 points in 75 games The Senators traded McCleary along with a draft pick to the Boston Bruins for Shawn McEachern following the season He appeared in 59 games with the Bruins but was unable to come to an agreement on a new contract for the 199798 season As a result he signed to play in the International Hockey League splitting the season between the Las Vegas Thunder and Detroit Vipers

His rights ultimately released by the Bruins McCleary signed with the Montreal Canadiens as a free agent in 1998 appearing in 46 NHL games in 199899 Early the following season he again suffered a severe injury to his right eye suffering a severed tear duct when he was hit in the face by an errant skate He recovered splitting the early part of the season between the Canadiens and the Quebec Citadelles in the AHL

During a game between the Canadiens and the Philadelphia Flyers on January 29 2000 McCleary dropped to the ice in an attempt to block a Chris Therien slapshot He was critically injured when hit in the throat by the shot which fractured his larynx and resulted in a collapsed lung Unable to breathe McCleary rushed to the bench collapsing upon his arrival Medical staff worked to partially open his airway in the hallways of Molson Centre actions which McCleary credits with saving his life He was then rushed to a waiting ambulance and transported to hospital where surgeons performed an emergency tracheotomy He remained in full equipment during the procedure hospital staff did not even have time to remove his skates

Unable to speak immediately following his surgery McCleary sent a written note to his teammates explaining he was all right while his surgeon revealed that he came as close as you could come to dying in the moments after he was struck He met with the media two weeks following his injury responding to questions via note pad stating that he hoped to return to his career upon recovery He regained the ability to talk after six weeks and several surgeries

McCleary attempted a comeback at the start of the 200001 season Despite doubts he would be capable of returning the Canadiens signed him to a one year US300000 contract He appeared in exhibition games with the Canadians but found he was unable to play a full shift without running short of breath He was examined by his doctor who noted that because his air passage was left 15 narrower than before his injury it was too dangerous for him to continue playing As a result on September 20 2000 McCleary announced his retirement calling it the toughest day in his seven year career The Canadiens kept him in the organization naming him a WHL scout

When walking tendon or joints in the elands foreleg produce a sharp clicking sound the cause of which is not known The sound carries some distance and is a good indication of an approaching herd Scientists take it as a form of communication in elands

Maria Beatrice dEste was heiress of the two Duchies of Modena and Reggio She was married to Archduke Ferdinand of Austria son of Empress Maria Theresa of Austria in an attempt to give the Austrians more influence in the Italian states Maria Beatrice was the Duchess of Massa and Carrara in her own right as well as an Archduchess of Austria by marriage from 1790 until 1797 and from 1816 until her death in 1829

As heiress to four duchies Modena and Reggio from her father and Massa and Carrara from her mother she was a very attractive candidate for marriage From 1753 it was arranaged that she would marry Archduke Leopold of Austria younger son of Empress Maria Theresa The situation changed when Leopolds childlessness made Leopold the heir to the Holy Roman Empire As a result she was instead engaged to Leopolds brother Archduke Ferdinand of Austria Plans began in 1754 and it was concluded by their actual marriage in Milan on 15 October 1771 Some of the festivities for the marriage were played by Mozart 

When her mother died in 1790 Maria Beatrice succeeded to Massa and the Principality of Carrara which she held in her own right After the French conquest of her domains in Italy she spent her life in Austria and left the rule to administrators Just after the marriage the couple had settled in Modena then travelled to Milan where Maria Beatrice gave birth to most of her 10 children by Ferdinand As Modena did not allow female succession Maria Beatrices rights to the throne passed to her son when her father died in 1803 By her marriage the House of Austria Este was created a cadet branch of the House of Habsburg Lorraine which ruled Modena between 1814 and 1859 At her death in her palace in Vienna in 1829 Massa and Carrara were added to the Duchy of Modena which were subsequently given to her son

When tea is more than a drink and the tea ceremony is understood and practiced to foster harmony in humanity promote harmony with nature discipline the mind quiet the heart and attain the purity of enlightenment the art of tea becomes teaism And it can be used to describe tea ceremony as the interests in tea culture and studies and pursued over time with self cultivation Teaism is mostly a simplistic mode of aesthetics but there are subtle insights into ethics and even metaphysics Teaism is related to teamind A sense of focus and concentration while under the influence of great tasting tea Teaist is a person who performs or enjoys the art of tea and teaism In Chinese Japanese and Korean cultures they all have well developed teaism

It is a synthesis of Taoism Zennism and tea It is likely that it alludes more to the Taoist influences on Zen and subsequently the Chado or the Japanese Tea Ceremony as he makes the statement A subtle philosophy lay behind it all Teaism was Taoism in disguise Teaism is brought out for its Taoist origins but in the second half it is shown through its manifestations in the Chado and in Japanese culture in general

In this sense tea is more than a drink and more than an art it is integrated in the culture and the mind The term Chinesechadao or Japanesechado in English is a difficult translation task In most common use and easy to express translation is tea ceremony A direct translation is the way of tea or the way of tea The term teaism is by some only signifies this with Japanese tea ceremony Similar terms are tea arts and tea culture While the word lore is usually not used in this context another term used is tea lore

Tea Lore includes art culture history and ceremony Tea Lore can be compared to and has some of the same qualities as music art or literature Tea is also an intricate part of Calligraphy Floral Arts Incense Arts and Scroll Arrangement These are five Classical Chinese Arts In another sense it is the facts and traditions of tea and tea ceremony and the accumulation over time through experience Lore all the facts and traditions about a particular subject that have been accumulated over time through education or experience Tea Lore can also be described as to include not only the acquired knowledge or traditional beliefs but the myths that also revolve around the subject of tea

Nikolaas Niko Tinbergen was a Dutch and later English ethologist and ornithologist who shared the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Karl von Frisch and Konrad Lorenz for their discoveries concerning organization and elicitation of individual and social behaviour patterns in animals

In the 1960s he collaborated on a series of wildlife films including The Riddle of the Rook and Signals for Survival which won the Italia prize in that year and the American blue ribbon in 1971

Niko who had two eminent brothers was a prisoner of war during World War II His experience as a prisoner of the Nazis led to some friction with longtime intellectual collaborator Konrad Lorenz and it was several years before the two reconciled 

After the war Tinbergen moved to England where he taught at the University of Oxford He remained in England for the rest of his life Several of his Oxford graduate students went on to become prominent biologists these include Richard Dawkins Marian Dawkins Desmond Morris and Iain Douglas Hamilton He married Elisabeth Rutten and they had five children 

The body of Tinbergens research focused on what he termed supernormal stimuli This was the concept that an artificial object could be a stronger trigger for an instinct than the natural object for which the instinct originally evolved 

He constructed plaster eggs to see which a bird preferred to sit on finding that they would select those that were larger had more defined markings or more saturated colourand a dayglo bright one with black polkadots would be selected over the birds own pale dappled eggs

Tinbergen found that territorial male stickleback fish would attack a wooden fish model more vigorously than a real male if its underside was redder He constructed cardboard dummy butterflies with more defined markings that male butterflies would try to mate with in preference to real females The superstimulus by its exaggerations clearly showed what features were triggering the response

He is well known for originating the four questions he believed should be asked of any animal behaviour which were

Proximate mechanisms

Ultimate mechanisms

Niko gave his Nobel Lecture on autism in children which he and his wife had been researching for some time

Karl Ritter von Frisch was an Austrian ethologist who received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1973 jointly with Niko Tinbergen and Konrad Lorenz 

His work was on the communication and senses of the European honey bee He was the first to translate the meaning of the waggle dance By doing the dance when they come back to the hive honey bees indicated where they have found nectar and other details

His theory was disputed by other scientists and greeted with skepticism at the time Only recently was it definitively proved to be an accurate theoretical analysis

Sense of smell Frisch discovered that bees can distinguish various blossoming plants by their scent and that each bee is flower constant4551

Polarization pattern Light scattered in a blue sky forms a pattern of partially polarized ultraviolet light This depends on the position of the sun and is invisible to human eyes Each lens unit of a compound eye has a UV receptor and a UV filter oriented differently in each of these units so a bee is able to detect this polarization pattern A small piece of blue sky is enough for a bee to recognize the pattern changes occurring over the course of a day This provides not only directional but also information on the time of day

Variations in the daytime position of the sun Karl von Frisch proved that variations in the position of the sun gave bees with a tool for navigation They use this capability to get information on the progress of the day deep inside a dark beehive This makes it possible for the bees to convey up to date directional information during their waggle dance without having to make a comparison with the sun during long dance phases 

Internal clock Bees have an internal clock with three different synchronization or timekeeping mechanisms If a bee knows the direction to a feeding place found during a morning excursion it can also find the same location as well as the precise time at which this source provides food in the afternoon based on the position of the sun137147

A simple dance called round dance is used for nearby flowers It means there is a feeding place near the beehive at 50 to 100 meters Blossom scent would also be picked up 

The waggle dance proper is used to give the directions to a source further away Other bees follow her as she dances keeping in touch with their antennae The dance takes a figure of eight with variations such as angle and vigour of wiggles The communication is apparently quite effective

Gustav Stresemann was a German liberal politician who was Chancellor and Foreign Minister of Germany during the Weimar Republic He shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 1926 

Stresemanns politics are hard to define Today he is generally considered one of the most important leaders of Germany and a staunch supporter of democracy in the fragile Weimar Republic He is noted as one of the first to see European economic integration Arguably his most notable achievement was reconciliation between Germany and France for which he and Aristide Briand received the Peace Prize

Stresemann was born on 10 May 1878 in the Kpenicker Strae area of southeast Berlin the youngest of seven children His father worked as a beer bottler and distributor and also ran a small bar out of the family home as well as renting rooms for extra money The family was lower middle class but relatively well off for the neighbourhood and had enough money to give Gustav with a high quality education

Stresemann was an excellent student especially in German literature and poetry In an essay written when he left school hewrote that he would have enjoyed becoming a teacher but he would only have been qualified to teach languages or the natural sciences which were not his primary areas of interest He entered the University of Berlin in 1897 to study political economy During his studies Stresemann was exposed to the principal political arguments of his day particularly the German debate about socialism

During his university years Stresemann also became active in Burschenschaften movement of student fraternities and in April 1898 became editor of the Allgemeine Deutsche Universitts Zeitung a newspaper run by Konrad Kuster a leader in the liberal part of the Burschenschaften His editorials for the paper were often political and dismissed most political parties as wrong in one way or another In these early writings he combined liberalism with nationalism In 1898 Stresemann left the University of Berlin and went to the University of Leipzig so that he could study for a doctorate He completed his studies in January 1901 submitting a thesis on the bottled beer industry in Berlin which received a relatively high grade 

In 1902 he founded the Saxon Manufacturers Association In 1903 he married Kte Kleefeld daughter of a wealthy Jewish Berlin businessman At that time he was also a member of Friedrich Naumanns National Social Association In 1906 he was elected to the Dresden town council Though he had initially worked in trade associations Stresemann soon became a leader of the National Liberal Party in Saxony In 1907 he was elected to the Reichstag where he soon became a close associate of party chairman Ernst Bassermann However his support of more social welfare programmess was not popular with some of the partys more conservative members and he lost his post in the partys executive committee in 1912 Later that year he lost both his Reichstag and town council seats He returned to business and founded the German American Economic Association In 1914 he returned to the Reichstag He was exempted from war service due to poor health With Bassermann kept away from the Reichstag by either illness or military service Stresemann soon became the National Liberals de facto leader After Bassermanns death in 1917 Stresemann succeeded him as party leader

His political ideas grew and changed At first in the German Empire Stresemann was on the left wing of the National Liberals During World War I he gradually moved to the right He supported the monarchy and Germanys expansionist goals He also spoke in support of unrestricted submarine warfare However he still favoured an expansion of the social welfare programme and also supported allowing more ordinary Prussians to vote

When the Allies peace terms became known Constantin Fehrenbach denounced them and claimed the will to break the chains of slavery would be implanted into a generation of Germans Stresemann said of this speech He was inspired in that hour by God to say what was felt by the German people His words spoken under Fichtes portrait the final words of which merged into Deutschland Deutschland ber alles made it an unforgettably solemn hour There was in that sense a kind of uplifting grandeur The impression left on all was tremendous

Stresemann briefly joined the German Democratic Party after the war but was expelled for his association with the right wing He then gathered most of the right wing of the old National Liberal Party into the German Peoples Party with himself as chairman Most of its support came from middle class and upper class Protestants The DVP platform promoted Christian family values non religious education lower tariffs opposition to welfare spending and agrarian subsides and hostility to Marxism

The DVP was at first seen along with the German National Peoples Party as part of the national opposition to the Weimar Republic particularly for its grudging acceptance of democracy and its attitude towards the Freikorps and the Kapp Putsch in 1920 Although they did not support the Freikorps the party did not publicly condemn them either By late 1920 Stresemann gradually moved to cooperation with the parties of the left and centre possibly in reaction to political murders like that of Walther Rathenau However he remained a monarchist at heart

On 13 August 1923 in the midst of the Ruhr Crisis he was appointed Chancellor and Foreign Minister of a grand coalition government As Chancellor Stresemann went a long way towards resolving the crisis In the so called year of crises he showed strength by calling off the popular peaceful resistance at the Ruhr Since Germany was no longer able to pay the striking workers more and more money was printed which finally led to hyperinflation Hans Luther who was the current finance minister ended this disastrous process by introducing a new currency the Rentenmark which reassured the people that the democratic system was willing and able to solve urgent problems 

Stresemanns decision to end passive resistance was motivated by his view that making a good faith effort to fulfill the terms of Versailles was the only way to win relief from the treatys harsher provisions He like virtually every German felt Versailles was an onerous Diktat that sullied the nations honour However he felt that trying to fulfill the treatys terms was the only way Germany could demonstrate that the reparations bill was truly beyond its capacity He also wished to recover the Rhineland  he wrote to the Crown Prince on 23 July 1923 The most important objective of German politics is the liberation of German territory from foreign occupation First we must remove the strangler from our throat

However some of his moves  like his refusal to deal firmly with culprits of the Beer Hall Putsch  alienated the Social Democrats They left the coalition and caused its collapse on 23 November 1923 Stresemann remained as Foreign Minister in the government of his successor Centrist Wilhelm Marx He remained foreign minister for the rest of his life in eight successive governments ranging from the centre right to the centre left 

As Foreign Minister Stresemann had numerous achievements His first notable achievement was the Dawes Plan of 1924 which reduced Germanys overall reparations commitment and reorganized the Reichsbank 

After Sir Austen Chamberlain became British Foreign Secretary he wanted a British guarantee to France and Belgium as the Anglo American guarantee had fallen due to the United States refusal to ratify the Treaty of Versailles Stresemann later wrote Chamberlain had never been our friend His first act was to attempt to restore the old Entente through a three power alliance of England France and Belgium directed against Germany German diplomacy faced a catastrophic situation Stresemann conceived the idea that Germany would guarantee her western borders and pledged never to invade Belgium and France again along with a guarantee from Britain that they would come to Germanys aid if attacked by France Germany was in no position at the time to attack as Stresemann wrote to the Crown Prince The renunciation of a military conflict with France has only a theoretical significance in so far as there is no possibility of a war with France Stresemann negotiated the Locarno Treaties with Britain France Italy and Belgium On the third day of negotiations Stresemann explained Germanys demands to the French Foreign Secretary Aristide Briand As Stresemann recorded Briand almost fell off his sofa when he heard my explanations Stresemann said that Germany alone should not make sacrifices for peace European countries should cede colonies to Germany the disarmament control commission should leave Germany the Anglo French occupation of the Rhineland should be ended and Britain and France should disarm as Germany had done The Treaties were signed in October 1925 at Locarno Germany officially recognized the post World War I western border for the first time and was guaranteed peace with France and promised admission to the League of Nations and evacuation of the last Allied occupation troops from the Rhineland Germanys eastern borders were guaranteed to Poland only by France not by a general agreement

Stresemann was not willing to conclude a similar treaty with Poland There will be no Locarno of the east he said Moreover he never excluded the use of force to regain the eastern territories of Germany which had come under Polish control as a consequence of the Treaty of Versailles The reason were atrocities against the German minority in the former German territories committed by or tolerated by the Polish government see and Hermann Rauschning In the session of the League of Nations on 15 December 1928 in Lugano Stresemann formulated a furious charge against Poland because of these crimes which were well known to the League of Nations The chairman Aristide Briand French foreign minister concluded the session after this speech with the words The League of Nations must never break the sacred support of the minority rights

After this reconciliation with the Versailles powers Stresemann moved to allay the growing suspicion of the Soviet Union He said to Nikolay Krestinsky in June 1925 as recorded in his diary I had said I would not come to conclude a treaty with Russia so long as our political situation in the other direction was not cleared up as I wanted to answer the question whether we had a treaty with Russia in the negative The Treaty of Berlin signed in April 1926 reaffirmed and strengthened the Rapallo Treaty of 1922 In September 1926 Germany was admitted to the League of Nations as permanent member of the Security Council This was a sign that Germany was quickly becoming a normal state and assured the Soviet Union of Germanys sincerity in the Treaty of Berlin Stresemann wrote to the Crown Prince All the questions which to day preoccupy the German people can be transformed into as many vexations for the Entente by a skilful orator before the League of Nations As Germany now had a veto on League resolutions she could gain concessions from other countries on modifications on the Polish border or Anschluss with Austria as other countries needed her vote Germany could now act as the spokesman of the whole German cultural community and thereby provoke the German minorities in Czechoslovakia and Poland

Stresemann was co winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1926 for these achievements

Germany signed the Kellogg Briand Pact in August 1928 It renounced the use of violence to resolve international conflicts Although Stresemann did not propose the pact Germanys adherence convinced many people that Weimar Germany was a Germany that could be reasoned with This new insight was instrumental in the Young Plan of February 1929 which led to more reductions in German reparations payment

Gustav Stresemanns success owed much to his friendly personal character and his willingness to change He was close personal friends with many influential foreigners The most noted was Briand with whom he shared the Peace Prize

Stresemann was not however in any sense pro French His main preoccupation was how to free Germany from the burden of reparations payments to Britain and France imposed by the Treaty of Versailles His strategy for this was to forge an economic alliance with the United States The US was Germanys main source of food and raw materials and one of Germanys largest export markets for manufactured goods Germanys economic recovery was thus in the interests of the US and gave the US an incentive to help Germany escape from the reparations burden The Dawes and Young plans were the result of this strategy Stresemann had a close relationship with Herbert Hoover who was Secretary of Commerce in 1921 28 and President from 1929 This strategy worked remarkably well until it was derailed by the Great Depression after Stresemanns death

During his period in the foreign ministry Stresemann came more and more to accept the Republic which he had at first rejected By the mid 1920s having contributed much to a consolidation of the feeble democratic order Stresemann was regarded as a Vernunftrepublikaner  someone who accepted the Republic as the least of all evils but was in their heart still loyal to the monarchy The conservative opposition criticized him for his supporting the republic and fulfilling too willingly the demands of the Western powers Along with Matthias Erzberger and others he was attacked as an Erfllungspolitiker

In 1925 when he first proposed an agreement with France he made it clear that in doing so he intended to gain a free hand to secure a peaceful change of the borders in the East and concentrate on a later incorporation of German territories in the East In the same year while Poland was in a state of political and economic crisis Stresemann began a trade war against the country Stresemann hoped for an escalation of the Polish crisis which would enable Germany to regain territories ceded to Poland after World War I and he wanted Germany to gain a larger market for its products there So Stresemann refused to engage in any international cooperation that would have prematurely restabilized the Polish economy In response to a British proposal Stresemann wrote to the German ambassador in London A final and lasting recapitalization of Poland must be delayed until the country is ripe for a settlement of the border according to our wishes and until our own position is sufficiently strong According to Stresemanns letter there should be no settlement until Polands economic and financial distress has reached an extreme stage and reduced the entire Polish body politic to a state of powerlessness

Gustav Stresemann died of a stroke in October 1929 at the age of 51 His massive gravesite is situated in Berlins Luisenstadt Cemetery at Sdstern in Kreuzberg and includes work by the German sculptor Hugo Lederer Stresemanns sudden and premature death as well as the death of his pragmatic moderate French counterpart Aristide Briand in 1932 and the assassination of Briands successor Louis Barthou in 1934 left a vacuum in European statesmanship that further tilted the slippery slope towards World War II

Gustav and Kthe had two sons Wolfgang and Joachim Stresemann

Icing in ice hockey is a rule the happens when a player shoots the puck across at least two red lines the other teams goal line being the last and the puck remains untouched but it is not icing if the player shoots the puck from behind the halfway line of the ice into the goal If the goal went into the net it would be counted as a goal There is also automatic or no touch icing which is used mostly in lower level professional hockey leagues like the ECHL and Central Hockey League It was enforced in 1990 after Ludk ajka a Czech player rushed to get to the puck in an icing situation he crashed into the boards suffered severe spinal injuries and died a few weeks later Sometimes the goaltender will raise his hand for icing also

If icing is waved off by a referee it is either because

The Copenhagen interpretation is an interpretation of quantum mechanics in physics It was developed by Werner Heisenberg Niels Bohr and Albert Einstein in Copenhagen in the 1927 It is based on an idea called Borns law of the wave function by the Nobel Prize laureate Max Born It is one of the first usable models of quantum mechanics

The Copenhagen Interpretation is strongly based on Positivism the idea that science and machinery is the only way to gain knowledge about the meaning of life and so forth 

The principle idea is that a particle exists in many states at once and when it is observed it is essentially forced to choose a state to permanently be in For example

The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics was theoretically proven by what has become a famous thought experiment involving a cat and a box Its called Schrdingers cat and it was first introduced by the Viennese physicist Erwin Schrdinger in 1935

In his theoretical experiment Schrdinger put his cat in a box along with a bit of radioactive material and a Geiger counter  a device for detecting radiation The Geiger counter was designed so that when it sensed the decay of the radioactive material it triggered a hammer which was poised to break a flask containing hydrocyanic acid which when released would kill the cat

To eliminate any certainty regarding the cats fate the experiment was to take place within an hour long enough so that some of the radioactive material could possibly decay but short enough so that it was also possible none would

In Schrdingers experiment the cat was sealed in the box During its stay there the cat came to exist in an unknowable state Since it could not be observed it could not be said whether the cat was alive or dead It existed instead in the state of both life and death Its sort of like quantum physics answer to the old Zen question If a tree falls in the woods and no one is around to hear it does it make a sound

This is a small breed of sheep They were developed by breeding the Shetland Sheep with Barbadian Black Belly Sheep The Shetland has a very fine coat of wool that is highly desired by home spinners and weavers The wool comes in varied shades of black grey white and a brown shade   The rams have a magnificent curled horn reminiscent of Rocky Mountain Sheep The rams generally weigh up to about a hundred pounds The ewes will range in about the ninety pound range The ewes are very good mothers and have been known to drop lambs in very severe weather with just a lean to for shelter with a good survival rate Big strong lambs that weigh out up to ninety pounds by six months and can be sexually mature at six months Ewe lambs have been known to deliver in their first year They tend to mature into nice square meat sheep with little fat and because of their shetland and wooless background the meat does not have that high wild taste Very sweet flavour The sheep tend to be very easy to keep and have the hardiness to stand Canadian harsh winters The colours are what gives them that unusual quality of wool I will try later to put up pictures of this unique breed of sheep 1541 11 February 2011legacyfilly

Peat or turf is an accumulation of partially decayed vegetation Peat forms in wetland bogs moors mires and swamps 

Peat forms when plant material usually in marshy areas is inhibited from decaying fully by acidic and anaerobic conditions It is composed mainly of marshland vegetation trees grasses fungi as well as other types of organic remains such as insects and animal remains Under certain conditions the decomposition of the latter is inhibited

Peat formed in very wet conditions accumulates faster and is less decomposed than that in drier places This allows climatologists to use peat as an indicator of climatic change The composition of peat can also be used to reconstruct ancient ecologies by examining the types and quantities of its organic constituents

Under the proper conditions peat is the earliest stage in the formation of coal The coal measures of the Pennsylvanian period were laid down in a gigantic tropical river basin and later squeezed and heated to form the metamorphic rock we call coal

Most modern peat bogs formed in high latitudes after the retreat of the glaciers at the end of the last ice age some 9000 years ago They usually grow slowly at the rate of about a millimetre per year

The peat in the worlds peatlands has been forming for 360 million years and contains 550 Gigatonnes of carbon

Peat is harvested as an important source of fuel in certain parts of the world By volume there are about 4 trillion m of peat in the world covering a total of around 2 of global land area containing about 8 billion terajoules of energy

Peat is soft and easily compressed Under pressure water in the peat is forced out Upon drying peat can be used as a fuel It has industrial importance as a fuel in some countries such as Ireland and Finland where it is harvested on an industrial scale In many countries including Ireland and Scotland where trees are often scarce peat is traditionally used for cooking and domestic heating Stacks of drying peat dug from the bogs can still be seen in some rural areas

Peats insulating properties make it of use to industry

Peat fires are used to dry malted barley for use in Scotch whisky distillation This gives Scotch whisky its distinctive smoky flavour often called peatiness

Although peat has many uses for humans it also presents problems When dry it can be a major fire hazard as peat fires can burn almost indefinitely Peat fires can even burn underground reigniting after the winter provided there is a source of oxygen Peat deposits also pose major difficulties to builders of structures roads and railways as they are highly compressible under even small loads When the West Highland Line was built across Rannoch Moor in western Scotland its builders had to float the tracks on a mattress of tree roots brushwood and thousands of tons of earth and ashes

ESCP is a printer control language developed by Epson The language was popular with dot matrix printers It uses escape codes a command starts with the escape character As an example ESC E will switch on bold and ESC F will switch it off There are different versions of the protocol which was also used by other printer manufacturers Today ESCP is rarely used any more modern printers use page description languages like Postscript PCL or PDF

Shirred eggs also known as baked eggs or in are eggs cooked in a manner which results in a firm white but soft or runny yolk The name comes from the dish in which the eggs are cooked

The eggs are placed in small dishes called ramekins with a knob of butter on top and baked at 180C until the white is set but the yolk remains soft which takes around 15 minutes

The Printer Command Language is a page description language developed by Hwelett Packard As of 2011 most modern printers understand PCL Its complexity is between pure ASCII text such as in ESC P and for example Postscript There are different versions of the language Common versions

Except where stated PCL versions are downwards compatible A printer that supports PCL6 can also be programmed using PCL3 for example 

PCL is a very efficient way of coding For this reason certain manufacturers build high volume printers that support different versions of PCL Such printers can do more than 1000 pages per minute 

The Graphics Device Interface is an API of Microsoft Windows used for representing graphical objects and transmitting them to output devices such as printers and monitors

GDI is responsible for tasks such as drawing lines and curves rendering fonts and handling palettes It is not directly responsible for drawing windows menus etc that task is reserved for another subsystem built on top of GDI Other systems have components that are similar to GDI for example Macintoshs QuickDraw and GnomeGTKs GDKXlib

Perhaps the most significant capability of GDI over more direct methods of accessing the hardware is its scaling capabilities and abstraction of target devices Using GDI it is very easy to draw on multiple devices such as a screen and a printer and expect proper reproduction in each case This capability is at the center of all What You See Is What You Get applications for Microsoft Windows

Simple games that do not require fast graphics rendering use GDI However GDI cannot animate properly as it has no notion of synchronizing with the framebuffer and lacks rasterization for 3D Modern games usually use DirectX or OpenGL instead which give programmers the capabilities to use features of modern hardware

Conodonts are an extinct class of the phylum Chordata They are now regarded as vertebrates though the issue is still a live one

For many years they were known only from their feeding apparatus which fossilise well 

It was not until early 1980s that the conodont teeth were found with trace fossils of the host organism in a lagersttte 

This is because most of the conodont animal was soft bodied so everything but the teeth were not fossilised in normal circumstances

The teeth called conodont elements are very common in the fossil record and have been used in biostratigraphy

They are also used as palaeothermometers This is because under higher temperatures the phosphate undergoes colour changes which are measured with the conodont alteration index This has made them useful for petroleum exploration in rocks dating from the Cambrian to the Upper Triassic

Eleven fossil imprints of conodont animals are known They depict an eel like creature with 15 or more rarely 19 elements forming a bilaterally symmetrical array in the head This array was a feeding apparatus different from the jaws of modern animals 

There are three forms of teeth coniform cones ramiform bars and pectiniform platforms which may have performed different roles

The organisms range from a centimeter or so to the giant Promissum 40 cm in length It is now widely agreed that conodonts had large eyes fins with fin rays chevron shaped muscles and a notochord

The entire class of Conodonts or at least what was left of them at the time were wiped out by the TriassicJurassic extinction event which occurred roughly 200 million years ago

Mayflies are insects which belong to the Order Ephemeroptera 

They are in an ancient group of insects the Palaeoptera with dragonflies and damselflies

Mayfly are insects whose aquatic larvae live months up to a year in freshwater The adults are extremely short lived from 30 minutes to one day depending on the species The function of the adult imago is reproduction and dispersal they do not eat

The naiads go through 20 or 30 moults as they develop The development is incomplete metamorphosis 

Mayflies are unique in that they moult one more time after getting functional wings This second to last winged stage is usually very short a matter of hours The stage is a favourite food of many fish and many fishing flies are modelled on them

It often happens that all the mayflies in a population mature at once and for a day or two in the Spring or Autumn mayflies will be everywhere dancing around each other in large groups or resting on every available surface

The adults have various special features Their rear wings are small or almost vestigial the males have two long front legs for holding females the rest have no function Mating is usually in mid air 

The mayfly are quite a successful group About 2500 species are known worldwide including about 630 species in North America

Hollandaise sauce is an emulsion of egg yolk and butter  Lemon juice salt and a little white pepper or cayenne pepper are often added as seasoning Hollandaise light yellow and opaque smooth and creamy it tastes rich and buttery with a mild tang added by the seasonings but not so strong as to overpower mildly flavoured foods Hollandaise sauce is well known as a key ingredient of Eggs Benedict and is often paired with vegetables such as steamed asparagus

Hollandaise is one of the five mother sauces in French haute cuisine 

Hollandaise sauce got its name because it was thought to be like a Dutch sauce and at the time the King of the Netherlands was due to make a state visit to France Mrs Isabella Beetons Household Management had recipes in the first edition for Dutch sauce for fish As early as 1651 Franois Pierre La Varenne describes a sauce similar to hollandaise sauce in his groundbreaking cookbook Le Cuisinier Franois avec du bon beurre frais un peu de vinaigre sel et muscade et un jaune duf pour lier la sauce Alan Davidson notes a sauce la hollandoise from Franois Marins Les Dons de Comus but since that sauce included flour bouillon and herbs and omitted egg yolks it may not be related to the modern hollandaise However Larousse Gastronomique states that in former times fish la hollandaise was served with melted butter Davidson also quotes from Harold McGee who explains that eggs are not needed at all and proper emulsification can simply be done with butter He also states that if one does wish to use eggs they are not needed in as great a quantity as normally called for in traditional recipes  The sauce using egg yolks and butter appeared in the 19th century Though various sources say it was first known as sauce Isigny Mrs Isabella Beetons Household Management had recipes in the first edition for Dutch sauce for fish and its variant on the following page Green sauce or Hollandaise verte Her directions for hollandaise seem somewhat fearless

Being a mother sauce hollandaise sauce is the foundation for many others made by adding or changing ingredients The following is not a complete list of such minor sauces

Sauces in French cuisine date back to the Middle Ages There were hundreds of sauces in the culinary repertoire and were a major defining characteristic of French cooking of the 19th and 20th centuries until nouvelle cuisine 

In the 19th century the chef Antonin Carme classified sauces into four families each of which was based on a mother sauce Carmes four mother sauces were

In the early 20th century the chef Auguste Escoffier updated this classification to five mother sauces They are

A sauce which is based on one of the mother sauces is sometimes called a small sauce minor sauce or secondary sauce Most sauces commonly used in classical cuisine are small sauces or derivatives of one of the above mentioned mother sauces 

Mother sauces are not commonly served as they are instead they are augmented with additional ingredients to make small sauces For example Bechamel can be made into Mornay by the addition of Gruyre or any cheese one may like and Espagnole becomes Bordelaise with the addition and reduction of red wine shallots and poached beef marrow

Jean Anthelme Brillat Savarin was a French lawyer and politician and gained fame as an epicure and gastronome Grimod and Brillat Savarin Between them two writers effectively founded the whole genre of the gastronomic essay

Brillat Savarin was born in the town of Belley Ain where the River Rhone separated France from Savoy He studied law chemistry and medicine in Dijon and practiced law in his hometown He was born Jean Anthelme Brillat but adopted his second surname because an aunt named Savarin left him her entire fortune on the condition that he adopt her name In 1789 at the start of the French Revolution he was sent as a deputy to the Estates General that soon became the National Constituent Assembly he became well lknown for some of his speeches particularly one supporting capital punishment  He returned to Belley and was for a year the elected mayor At a later stage of the Revolution there was a bounty on his head and he sought political asylum at first in Switzerland He later moved to Holland and then to the new born United States where he stayed for three years in Boston New York Philadelphia and Hartford living on the proceeds of giving French language and violin lessons For a time he was first violin in the Park Theater in New York City

He returned to France under the Directory in 1797 and acquired the magistrate post he would then hold for the rest of his life as a judge of the Court of Cassation He published several works on law and political economy He remained a bachelor but he counted love as the sixth sense his inscription of the Physiognomie to his beautiful cousin Juliette Rcamier reads Madam receive kindly and read indulgently the work of an old man It is a tribute of a friendship which dates from your childhood and perhaps the homage of a more tender feelingHow can I tell At my age a man no longer dares interrogate his heart 

His famous work Physiologie du got was published in December 1825 two months before his death The full title is Physiologie du Got ou Mditations de Gastronomie Transcendante ouvrage thorique historique et lordre du jour ddi aux Gastronomes parisiens par un Professeur membre de plusieurs socits littraires et savantes The book has not been out of print since it first appeared shortly before Brillat Savarins death Its most notable English translation was done by food writer and critic M F K Fisher who remarked I hold myself blessed among translators Her translation was first published in 1949 The philosophy of Epicurus lies at the back of every page the simplest meal satisfied Brillat Savarin as long as it was executed with artistry

Brillat Savarin cheese the Savarin mould a ring mould with a rounded contour and Gteau Savarin are named in his honour

His reputation was spread to a wide television audience by Chairman Kaga of the TV series Iron Chef which introduced to millions the quote Tell me what you eat and I will tell you what you are

Brillat Savarin is often considered as the father of low carbohydrate diet He considered sugar and white flour to be the cause of obesity and he suggested instead protein rich ingredients Sure enough carnivorous animals never grow fat Herbivorous animals do not grow fat easily at least until age has reduced them to a state of inactivity but they fatten very quickly as soon as they begin to be fed on potatoes grain or any kind of flour The second of the chief causes of obesity is the floury and starchy substances which man makes the prime ingredients of his daily nourishment As we have said already all animals that live on farinaceous food grow fat willy nilly and man is no exception to the universal law 

Eneas Sweetland Dallas wrote Kettners Book of the Table a Manual of Cookery 1877 a treatise on gastronomy based on the work of Brillat Savarin Dallas published his book under the pseudonym of A Kettner

Brillat Savarin is a soft white crusted cows milk cheese with at least 75 fat in dry matter named after the 18th century French gourmet Jean Anthelme Brillat Savarin The cheese was created in the 1930s by cheese maker Henri Androut

Brillat Savarin is produced all year round mainly in Normandy It comes in 12 13 cm wheels and approximately 4 cm thick and is aged for one to two weeks It is also available as a fresh cheese that resembles rich cream cheese

It is a triple cream Brie that is creamy and faintly sour It goes well with medjool dates and also champagne Because of its creaminess combined with its Brie aroma and slight sharpness it has been described as Dairylea for grownups or what Dairylea tastes like in heaven

Pairing with red wines is difficult as any mushroominess or mouldy taste will bring out the tannins of the wine Brillat Savarin is also quite salty when ripe which may disturb the taste of red wine It does pair well with Pale Ale and Champagne The carbonation wipes the fattiness from the palate and the malts enhance the creaminess of the cheese

The French cheese making company Rouzaire also produces an older Brillat Savarin under the name Pierre Robert The extra aging time concentrates the proteins and salt in the cheese resulting in deeper earthy flavours and more intense salty taste Wheels of Pierre Robert are physically shorter yet creamier than the regular aged Brillat Savarin

Description and history of Brillat Savarin cheese

Poularde Albufera is a chicken dish named in honour of the Duke of Albufera It sometimes credited to French chef Adolphe Duglr who invented several other dishes However as Duglr was only ten years old when Albufera fell out of favour with the king and had his French title of nobility taken away it is more likely that Poularde Albufera was created by Antonin Carme who trained Duglr 

It consists of poached chicken with a garnish of vol au vents filled with quenelles cocks kidneys mushrooms and truffles in Albufera sauce

The guppy also known as the millionfish is one of the most popular freshwater aquarium fish species in the world It is a small member of the Poeciliidae family and like all other members of the family is live bearing Guppies are popular aquarium kept fish because of their inexpensive needs and beautiful color ranges

Escoffier gives a recipe in Le Guide culinaire which consists of a base of Suprme Sauce to which is added meat glaze in order to lend the latter an ivory white tint which characterizes it It is served chiefly with poultry and sweetbreads

Bacterial conjugation is the transfer of genetic material between bacterial cells by direct cell to cell contact or by a bridge like connection between two cells 

Conjugation is a mechanism of horizontal gene transfer as are transformation and transduction though these two other mechanisms do not involve cell to cell contact

Bacterial conjugation was discovered by Nobel Prize winners Joshua Lederberg and Edward Tatum They showed that the bacterium Escherichia coli entered a sexual phase during which it could share genetic information 

Bacterial conjugation is often incorrectly regarded as the equivalent of sexual reproduction since it involves the exchange of genetic material During conjugation the donor cell provides a conjugative or mobilizable genetic element that is most often a plasmid or transposon Most conjugative plasmids have systems ensuring that the recipient cell does not already contain a similar element

The genetic information transferred is often beneficial to the recipient Benefits may include antibiotic resistance xenobiotic tolerance or the ability to use new metabolites Such beneficial plasmids may be considered bacterial endosymbionts Other elements however may be viewed as bacterial parasites and conjugation as a mechanism evolved by them to allow for their spread

imageConjugationsvgrightthumb300pxSchematic drawing of bacterial conjugation 

Conjugation diagram 1 Donor cell produces pilus 2 Pilus attaches to recipient cell and brings the two cells together 3 The mobile plasmid is nicked and a single strand of DNA is then transferred to the recipient cell 4 Both cells synthesize a complementary strand to produce a double stranded circular plasmid and also reproduce pili both cells are now viable donors

The basic conjugative plasmid is the F plasmid or F factor The F plasmid is an episome with a length of about 100000 base pairs 

There can only be one copy of the F plasmid in a given bacterium either free or integrated and bacteria that possess a copy are called F positive or F plus Cells that lack F plasmids are called F negative or F minus and can function as recipient cells

The nitrogen fixing Rhizobia are an interesting case of inter kingdom conjugation 

For example the tumor inducing plasmid of Agrobacterium and the root tumor inducing plasmid of A rhizogenes contain genes that are capable of transferring to plant cells These genes turn plant cells into factories producing chemicals used by the bacteria for nitrogen and energy Infected cells form crown galls or root tumours respectively The Ti and Ri plasmids are thus endosymbionts of the bacteria which are in turn endosymbionts of the infected plant

Conjugation is a convenient means for transferring genetic material to a variety of targets In laboratories successful transfers have been reported from bacteria to yeast plants mammalian cells and isolated mammalian mitochondria 

Conjugation has advantages over other forms of genetic transfer In plant engineering Agrobacterium like conjugation complements other standard vehicles such as tobacco mosaic virus While TMV is capable of infecting many plant families these are primarily herbaceous dicots Agrobacterium like conjugation is also primarily used for dicots but monocot recipients are not uncommon

A plasmid is a DNA molecule that is separate from the chromosomal DNA and that can replicate independently 

Plasmids are double stranded and in many cases circular Plasmids usually occur naturally in bacteria but are sometimes found in eukaryotic organisms

Plasmid size varies from 1 to over 1000 kilobase pairs The number of identical plasmids within a single cell can range from one to thousands Plasmids are often associated with conjugation a mechanism of horizontal gene transfer

The term plasmid was first introduced by the American molecular biologist Joshua Lederberg in 1952

Plasmids are considered transferable genetic elements or replicons capable of autonomous replication within a suitable host Plasmids can be found in all three major domains Archaea Bacteria and Eukarya Similar to viruses plasmids are not considered a form of life as it is currently defined Unlike viruses plasmids are naked DNA and do not encode genes necessary to encase the genetic material for transfer to a new host

Plasmid host to host transfer requires direct mechanical transfer by conjugation or changes in host gene expression allowing the intentional uptake of the genetic element by transformation 

Microbial transformation with plasmid DNA is neither parasitic nor symbiotic in nature since each implies the presence of an independent species living in a commensal or detrimental state with the host organism Rather plasmids provide a mechanism for horizontal gene transfer within a population of microbes and may provide a selective advantage under a given environmental state

Plasmids may carry genes that provide resistance to naturally occurring antibiotics in a competitive environmental niche or alternatively the proteins produced may act as toxins under similar circumstances Plasmids also can provide bacteria with an ability to fix elemental nitrogen or to degrade difficult organic compounds This may provide an advantage under conditions of nutrient deprivation

Horizontal gene transfer is any process in which an organism gets genetic material from another organism without being the offspring of that organism 

By contrast vertical transfer occurs when an organism gets genetic material from its ancestor eg its parent or a species from which it has evolved

Most thinking in genetics has focused on vertical transfer but there is a growing awareness that horizontal gene transfer is a significant phenomenon Amongst single celled organisms it may be the dominant form of genetic transfer Artificial horizontal gene transfer is a form of genetic engineering

There are several mechanisms for horizontal gene transfer

A 2010 report found that genes for antibiotic resistance could be transferred by engineering GTAs in the laboratory

Horizontal gene transfer was first described in Japan in a 1959 publication that demonstrated the transfer of antibiotic resistance between different species of bacteria In the mid 1980s Syvanen predicted that lateral gene transfer existed had biological significance and was involved in shaping evolutionary history from the beginning of life on Earth 

As Jain Rivera and Lake put it Increasingly studies of genes and genomes are indicating that considerable horizontal transfer has occurred between prokaryotes The phenomenon appears to have had some significance for unicellular eukaryotes as well As Bapteste et al observe additional evidence suggests that gene transfer might also be an important evolutionary mechanism in protist evolution

There is some evidence that even higher plants and animals have been affected and this has raised concerns for safety However Richardson and Palmer state Horizontal gene transfer has played a major role in bacterial evolution and is fairly common in certain unicellular eukaryotes However the prevalence and importance of HGT in the evolution of multicellular eukaryotes remain unclear

Transduction is the process by which DNA is transferred from one bacterium to another by a virus 

Joshua Lederberg and his graduate student Norton Zinder showed in 1952 that bacteriophages could transfer genetic information between bacteria in Salmonella This process explained how bacteria of different species could gain resistance to the same antibiotic very quickly 

Transduction also refers to the process whereby foreign DNA is introduced into another cell via a viral vector This is a common tool used by molecular biologists to introduce a foreign gene into a host cells genome

When bacteriophages infect a bacterial cell their normal mode of reproduction is to harness the replicational transcriptional and translation machinery of the host bacterial cell to make numerous complete viral particles including the viral DNA or RNA and the protein coat Errors in this process can result in the virus carrying over DNA from one bacterium to another

Ferdinand Marie Vicomte de Lesseps GCSI was the French developer of the Suez Canal which joined the Mediterranean and Red Seas in 1869 He also tried to build a Panama Canal during the 1880s but malaria and yellow fever was so bad that he gave up and the Panama Canal Company went bankrupt A different canal was later built by the United States and completed in 1914

Ferdinand de Lesseps was born at Versailles Yvelines in 1805 His first years were spent in Italy where his father was a diplomat

In 1828 de Lesseps was sent as an assistant vice consul to Tunis where his father was consul general He aided the escape of Youssouff pursued by the soldiers of the Bey of whom he was one of the officers for violation of the seraglio law 

In 1832 de Lesseps was appointed vice consul at Alexandria and in 1833 he became consul in Cairo and soon afterwards given the management of the consulate general at Alexandria until 1837 Near the end of 1837 he returned to France and on 21 December married Mlle Agathe Delamalle daughter of the prosecuting attorney at the court of Angers They had five sons

In 1839 he was appointed consul at Rotterdam and in the following year transferred to Mlaga the ancestral home of his mothers family In 1842 he was sent to Barcelona and soon afterwards promoted to the grade of consul general From 1848 to 1849 he was minister of France at Madrid

In 1849 the government of the French Republic sent him to Rome to negotiate the return of Pope Pius IX to the Vatican He tried to negotiate an agreement whereby Pope Pius could return peacefully to the Vatican but also ensuring the continued independence of Rome But during negotiations the elections in France caused a change in the foreign policy of the government 

He was created on 30 August 1851 the 334th Commander and then the 200th Grand Cross of the Order of the Tower and Sword

De Lesseps then retired from the diplomatic service and never again occupied any public office In 1853 he lost his wife and his son Ferdinand Victor at a few days interval In 1854 the accession to the viceroyalty of Egypt of Said Pasha gave de Lesseps a new impulse to act upon the creation of a Suez Canal

Said Pasha invited de Lesseps to pay him a visit and on 7 November 1854 he landed at Alexandria on the 30th of the same month Said Pasha signed the concession authorizing him to build the Suez Canal

De Lesseps died at Chteau de La Chesnaye in Guilly Vatan Indre on 7 December 1894 He was buried in the Pre Lachaise cemetery in Paris

His name was used in a speech by Egyptian President Gamal Nasser as the codeword to order the raiding of the Suez Canal Companys offices on 26 July 1956 the first step to its nationalization In the course of the raid and seizure of the canal by Nasser the statue of de Lesseps at the entrance of the Suez Canal was removed from its pedestal to symbolize the end of European ownership of the waterway The statue now stands in a small garden of the Port Fouad shipyard

In molecular biology transformation is the genetic alteration of a cell by the direct uptake and expression of DNA from its surroundings 

Transformation occurs most commonly in bacteria and in some species occurs naturally Transformation can also be effected by artificial means Bacteria that are capable of being transformed whether naturally or artificially are called competent 

Transformation is one of three processes by which outside genetic material may be got into bacterial cells The other two are conjugation and transduction 

Transformation may also used to describe the insertion of new genetic material into nonbacterial cells including animal and plant cells Introduction of foreign DNA into eukaryote cells is usually called transfection

Transformation was first demonstrated in 1928 by British bacteriologist Frederick Griffith Griffith discovered that a harmless strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae could be made virulent after being exposed to heat killed virulent strains

Griffith thoought some transforming principle from the heat killed strain was responsible for making the harmless strain virulent In 1944 this transforming principle was identified as being genetic by Oswald Avery Colin MacLeod and Maclyn McCarty They isolated DNA from a virulent strain of S pneumoniae and using just this DNA were able to make a harmless strain virulent They called this uptake and incorporation of DNA by bacteria transformation See AveryMacLeodMcCarty experiment

The results of these experiments were at first sceptically received by the scientific community Not until the discovery of other methods of genetic transfer by Joshua Lederberg were Averys experiments accepted Transformation did not become routine procedure in laboratories until 1972 when Cohen successfully transformed Escherichia coli by treating the bacteria with calcium chloride This created an efficient and convenient procedure for transforming bacteria and opened the way for biotechnology and research 

Transformation of animal and plant cells was also investigated with the first transgenic mouse being created by injecting a gene for a rat growth hormone into a mouse embryo in 1982 

In 1907 a bacterium that caused plant tumors Agrobacterium tumefaciens was discovered and in the early 1970s the tumor inducing agent was found to be a DNA plasmid called the Ti plasmid By removing the genes in the plasmid which caused the tumour and adding in new genes researchers were able to infect plants with A tumefaciens and let the bacteria insert their chosen DNA into the genomes of the plants 

Not all plant cells are susceptible to infection by A tumefaciens so other methods were developed including electroporation and micro injection Particle bombardment was made possible with the invention of the Biolistic Particle Delivery System by John Sanford in 1990

Charles Ranhofer was the chef at the famous Delmonicos Restaurant in New York from 1862 to 1876 and 1879 to 1896 Ranhofer wrote The Epicurean a cookbook of over 1000 pages similar in scope to Escoffiers Le Guide Culinaire 

Ranhofer was sent to Paris at the age of 12 to begin his training by studying pastry making and at 16 became the private chef for the prince dHnin comte dAlsace In 1856 he moved to New York to become the chef for the Russian consul and later worked in Washington DC and New Orleans 

He returned to France in 1860 for a short time where he arranged balls for the court of Napoleon III at the Tuileries Palace but then came back to New York to work at what was then a fashionable location Maison Dore In 1862 Lorenzo Delmonico hired him for Delmonicos Restaurant and it was there that Ranhofer made his real fame though others say that he made the fame of the restaurant as well At that time Delmonicos was considered the finest restaurant in the United States He was the chef at Delmonicos until his retirement in 1896 except for a short break from 1876 and 1879 when he owned the Hotel American at Enghien les Bains

Ranhofer invented or made famous a number of dishes that Delmonicos was known for such as Lobster Newberg and had a talent for naming dishes after famous or prominent people particularly those who dined at Delmonicos as well as his friends and events of the day Examples include

Many others may be found under List of foods named after people

Ranhofer did not invent baked Alaska but he popularized it in 1876 when he named it in honor of the newly acquired Alaskan territory

Ranhofer and his wife Rose had five children three sons and two daughters He died at home of Brights Disease in 1899 and was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery

Malibu is a city in the southwestern part of California not far from Los Angeles It is famous for Hollywood stars and others who are associated with the entertainment industry Malibu was incorporated as a city around 1991

Joshua Lederberg was an American geneticist known for his work on bacterial transduction artificial intelligence and space exploration He was just 33 years old when he won the 1958 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discovering that bacteria can mate and exchange genes He shared the prize with Edward Tatum and George Beadle who won for their work on the genetics of the fungus Neurospora

In addition to his contributions to biology Lederberg did extensive research in artificial intelligence This included work in the NASA experimental programs seeking life on Mars and the chemistry expert system Dendral

In 1946 and 1947 Lederberg took a leave of absence to study under Edward Tatum at Yale University Lederberg and Tatum showed that the bacterium Escherichia coli entered a sexual phase during which it could share genetic information through bacterial conjugation With this discovery and some mapping of the E coli chromosome Lederberg got his PhD from Yale University in 1947 

Lederberg and his graduate student Norton Zinder went on to show in 1952 that bacteriophages could transfer genetic information between bacteria in Salmonella This process called transduction explained how bacteria of different species could gain resistance to the same antibiotic quickly This was followed in 1952 by papers written by Zinder and Lederberg dealing with bacteriophage lambda 

In 1957 Lederberg founded the Department of Medical Genetics at the University of WisconsinMadison

In 1958 Joshua Lederberg received the Nobel Prize and moved to Stanford University where he was the founder and chairman of the Department of Genetics He collaborated with Frank Macfarlane Burnet to study viral antibodies 

With the launching of Sputnik in 1957 Lederberg became concerned about the biological impact of space exploration In a letter to the National Academies of Sciences he outlined his concerns that extraterrestrial microbes might gain entry to Earth onboard spacecraft causing catastrophic diseases He also argued that conversely microbial contamination of manmade satellites and probes may obscure the search for extraterrestrial life He advised quarantine for returning astronauts and equipment and sterilization of equipment before launching 

Teaming up with Carl Sagan his public advocacy for what he termed exobiology helped expand the role of biology in NASA In the 1960s he collaborated with Edward Feigenbaum in Stanfords computer science department to develop DENDRAL

In 1978 he became the president of Rockefeller University until he stepped down in 1990 and became professor emeritus of molecular genetics and informatics at Rockefeller University

Throughout his career Lederberg was active as a scientific advisor to the US government Starting in 1950 he has been a member of various panels of the Presidential Science Advisory Committee In 1979 he became a member of the US Defense Science Board and the chairman of President Jimmy Carters Presidents Cancer Panel In 1989 he received National Medal of Science for his contributions to the scientific world In 1994 he headed the Department of Defenses Task Force on Persian Gulf War Health Effects which investigated Gulf War Syndrome

In 2006 Lederberg was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom

Spirochaetes belong to a phylum of distinctive Gram negative bacteria which have long helically coiled cells Spirochetes are chemoheterotrophic in nature with lengths between 5 and 250 m and diameters around 01 06 m

Spirochaetes are distinguished from other bacterial phyla by the location of their flagella sometimes called axial filaments which run lengthwise between the cell wall and outer membrane These cause a twisting motion which allows the spirochaete to move about When reproducing a spirochaete will undergo asexual transverse binary fission

The AveryMacLeodMcCarty experiment was an experimental demonstration reported in 1944 by Oswald Avery Colin MacLeod and Maclyn McCarty that DNA is the substance that causes bacterial transformation 

This was the culmination of research in the 1930s and early 1940s at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research to purify and characterize the transforming principle responsible for the phenomenon first described in Griffiths experiment of 1928 In this early experiment dead Streptococcus pneumoniae of the virulent strain type III S when injected along with living but non virulent type II R pneumococci resulted in a deadly infection of type III S pneumococci 

In their paper of 1944 Avery and his colleagues suggest that DNA rather than protein was the hereditary material of bacteria and could be analogous to genes andor viruses in higher organisms

Marie Franois Sadi Carnot was a French statesman the fourth president of the Third French Republic He served as the President of France from 1887 until he was murdered by Sante Geronimo Caserio in 1894

Carnot had a reputation for honesty this made him a popular candidate to succeed Jules Grvy who had resigned following a scandal He was elected by 616 votes out of 827 He assumed office at a critical period when the republic was all but openly attacked by 

Carnots popularity helped to force General Boulanger into exile Boulanger Boulanger was a conservative and a supporter of the monarchy and it was feared he would try to overthrow the Republic

Carnot was near his most popular when on 24 June 1894 he attended a public banquet in Lyon Afterwards he was stabbed by an Italian anarchist named Sante Geronimo Caserio and died shortly after midnight on 25 June The stabbing aroused widespread horror and grief and the president was honoured with an elaborate funeral ceremony in the Panthon

The family Phylliidae contains the extant true leaf insects or walking leaves which include some of the most remarkable leaf mimics in the entire animal kingdom They occur from South Asia through Southeast Asia to Australia There are different views about their taxonomy

Leaf insects use camouflage to take on the appearance of a leaf They do this so accurately that predators often arent able to distinguish them from real leaves In some species the edge of the leaf insects body even has the appearance of bite marks To further confuse predators when the leaf insect walks it rocks back and forth to mimic a real leaf being blown by the wind

They and stick insects go together in the Order Phasmatodea

The scholar Antonio Pigafetta may have been the first to document the creature Sailing with Ferdinand Magellans circumnavigational expedition he studied and chronicled the fauna on the island of Cimbonbon as the fleet hauled ashore for repairs

The Phasmatodea are an order of insects which include the stick insects and leaf insects They are all mimics The name comes from Ancient Greek phasma meaning an apparition or phantom

Their natural camouflage can make them extremely difficult to spot Phasmatodea can be found all over the world in warmer zones especially the tropics and subtropics The greatest diversity is found in Southeast Asia and South America followed by Australia Phasmids also have a considerable presence in the continental United States mainly in the Southeast

Isoptera 

Mantodea 

Dictyoptera includes three orders of insects cockroaches termites and mantids

While all modern Dictyoptera have short ovipositors the oldest fossils of Dictyoptera have long ovipositors much like members of the Orthoptera

The term Dictyoptera is usually considered a superorder with Isoptera Blattaria and Mantodea being its three orders In some classifications however Dictyoptera is shifted to order status 

Regardless in all classifications the three constituent groups are the same just treated at different rank Termites and cockroaches are very closely related with ecological and molecular data pointing to a relationship with the cockroach genus Cryptocercus

Grylloblattidae is a family of extremophile and wingless insects that live in the cold on top of mountains 

They are commonly called grylloblattids but are also sometimes called ice crawlers or icebugs 

Most are nocturnal and appear to feed on detritus They have long antennae and long cerci but no wings 

Their closest living relatives are the recently discovered Mantophasmatidae

The family is placed in its own suborder Grylloblattodea and sometimes in its own order Grylloblattaria It contains 5 genera and 25 species

Paraneoptera is a monophyletic superorder of insects 

It includes four orders the bark lice true lice thrips and hemipterans the true bugs 

The mouthparts of the Paraneoptera reflect diverse feeding habits Basal groups are microbial surface feeders whereas more advanced groups feed on plant or animal fluids

Hemiptera is an order of insects most often known as the true bugs comprising around 5000080000 species of cicadas aphids planthoppers leafhoppers shield bugs and others They range in size from convert1mmin to around convert15cmin and share a common arrangement of sucking mouthparts

Psocoptera the bark lice include 4400 described species arranged in 3 suborders There are 50 families of bark lice with over 200 genera This is the first insect order to show the beginnings of a transition to sucking mouthparts It is sister group to the Phthiraptera Bark lice are found on foliage under bark or in leaf litter

Phthiraptera the lice includes 5000 described species divided into 4 suborders 

The body of a louse is dorsoventrally flattened and the eyes are absent or nearly so The legs are strong for holding onto fur or feathers of the host All species of lice are parasitic Lice parasitise all orders of birds and most orders of mammals 

Order Thysanoptera includes 5500 species classified into two suborders These insects are called thrips

The mouth is in the form of an asymmetrical mouth cone consisting of piercing stylets Thrips are commonly found on and in flowers Most species are phytophagous feeding on flowers

For orders previously in the Exopterygota see Dictyoptera and Parapneuroptera 

The Exopterygota are a superorder of insects They are in the subclass Pterygota in the infraclass Neoptera 

In Exopterygotes the young resemble adults but have externally developing wings They undergo a modest change between immature and adult without going through a pupal stage The nymphs develop gradually into adults through a process of moulting

The Exopterygota are a diverse insect superorder divided into eight orders They include locusts thrips and lice among other types of insects

They are distinguished from the Endopterygota by the way in which their wings develop Endopterygota develop wings inside the body and undergo an elaborate metamorphosis involving a pupal stage Exopterygota develop wings on the outside of their bodies without going through a true pupal stage though a few have something resembling a pupa

Xiphosura is an order of marine chelicerates It includes a large number of extinct lines and only four recent species in the family Limulidae which include the horseshoe crabs 

The group has hardly changed in millions of years The modern horseshoe crabs look almost identical to prehistoric genera such as the Jurassic Mesolimulus and are considered to be living fossils

Xiphosura are traditionally placed in the class Merostomata This term was originally made for the eurypterids now with the Xiphosura added it is known to be paraphyletic 

Although the name Merostomata is still seen in textbooks without reference to the Eurypterida some have urged that this usage should be discouraged The shared features of the two groups traditionally grouped in the Merostomata are now thought to be retentions of primitive conditions

The Xiphosura is basal to a clade comprising Eurypterida and Arachnida It is estimated that the Xiphosura diverged from the Arachnida 480 million years ago

The eurypterids related to arachnids were the largest known arthropods 

They are members of the extinct order Eurypterida It is a most diverse Chelicerate order

The largest such as Jaekelopterus reached 2 metres in length but most species were less than 20 cm 

They were formidable predators that thrived in the warm shallow seas and lakes of the Ordovician to the Permian periods around 460 to 248 million years ago 

The move from the sea to fresh water probably occurred by the Pennsylvanian period

They went extinct during the PermianTriassic extinction event 251 million years ago and their fossils have a near global distribution

The typical eurypterid had a large flat semicircular carapace followed by a jointed section and finally a tapering flexible tail most ending with a long spine at the end Behind the head of the eurypterids were twelve body segments These segments are formed by a dorsal plate called a tergite and a ventral plate called a sternite The tail known as the telson is spiked in most eurypterids

Amblypygi is an order of Arachnids also known as whip spiders or tailless whip scorpions The name amblypygid means blunt rump a reference to a lack of the telson They are harmless to humans

The Amblypygs are in the subphylum Chelicerata of the phylum Arthropoda The order has 5 families 17 genera and about 155 species They are found in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide Some species are subterranean many are nocturnal During the day they may hide under logs bark stones or leaves They prefer a humid environment

Dejima Dutch Trading Post is now a Japanese national historic site

In 1543 Portuguese traders were the first to set foot in Japan on the island of Tanegashima Six years later Jesuit missionary Francis Xavier came to the island Kagoshima At first Portuguese traders were based in Hirado Then they started a search for better port In 1570 a powerful landowner or daimyo called mura Sumitada became a Catholic He made a deal with the Portuguese to make Nagasaki better for trading Soon the port was open In 1580 Sumitada gave the jurisdiction of Nagasaki to the Jesuits The Portuguese became the only ones trading silk with China through Macau 

Shogun Iemitsu ordered the creation of the artificial island in 1634 He did this at first to keep the Portuguese merchants living in Nagasaki in one area After a rebellion of the mostly Christian population in the Shimabara Amakusa region the Tokugawa government banned all Western nationals except the Dutch employees of the Dutch East India Company Without the yearly Portuguese ships from Macau the economy of Nagasaki suffered heavily

Since 1609 the Dutch had a trading post on the island of Hirado Government officials made the Dutch move from Hirado to Dejima From 1641 on only Chinese and Dutch ships were allowed to come to Japan

Every ship that came to Dejima was inspected The sails were taken off until that ship was ready to leave Religious books and weapons were taken away Religious services were not allowed on the island

The island of Dejima was part of the city of Nagasaki Dejima was small 120 by 75 meters 25 local Japanese families owned the land They got a yearly rent rent from the Dutch The island was linked to the mainland by a small bridge with guards There were houses for about twenty Dutchmen and warehouses for goods 

The Dutch were watched by a number of Japanese officials gatekeepers and night watchmen There was also a head supervisor who had about fifty people working for him There were a number of traders to sell the people on Dejima food and drink and other items they needed There were also about 150 tsji They all had to be paid by the VOC Like the city of Nagasaki Dejima was under direct supervision of Edo by a governor

It was very expensive for the Dutch to pay for their trading post But their trade with Japan was very profitable for the VOC At first they made profits of 50 or more Trade became less in the 18th century This was because only two ships per year were allowed to dock at Dejima The VOC had no more money in 1795 and went bankrupt After that the Dutch government took over the trade with Japan Life on Dejima became especially difficult when the Netherlands was under French Napoleonic rule All contact with the homeland was broken off For a time Dejima was the only place in the world where the Dutch flag was flown because they were not ruled by France

The most important Dutch official in Dejima was called the Opperhoofd by the Dutch The Japanese also called him Kapitan

The innate immune system is the cells and mechanisms which defend the host from infections in a non specific way 

This means the cells of the innate system recognize and respond to pathogens in a general way but unlike the adaptive immune system it does not confer long lasting or protective immunity to the host Innate immune systems provide immediate defence against infection and are found in all plant and animal life 

The innate system is the evolutionarily older defense strategy It is the main immune system found in plants fungi insects and in primitive multicellular organisms

The vertebrate innate immune system

The epithelial surfaces form a physical barrier that keeps out most infectious agents It is the first line of defence against invading organisms 

Old skin cells drop off and this helps remove bacteria that have stuck to the skin In the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract movement due to peristalsis or cilia helps remove infectious agents Also mucus traps infectious agents The gut flora can prevent pathogenic bacteria by secreting toxic substances or by competing with pathogenic bacteria for nutrients or attachment to cell surfaces The flushing action of tears and saliva helps prevent infection of the eyes and mouth

Inflammation is one of the first responses of the immune system to infection or irritation 

Inflammation is stimulated by chemical factors released by injured cells It serves to establish a physical barrier against the spread of infection and to promote healing of any damaged tissue after the clearance of pathogens 

Chemical factors produced during inflammation attract phagocytes especially neutrophils Neutrophils then trigger other parts of the immune system

The complement system is a biochemical cascade of the immune system that helps antibodies clear pathogens or mark them for destruction by other cells 

The cascade is composed of many plasma proteins synthesized in the liver The proteins work together to  

Elements of the complement cascade can be found in many non mammalian species including plants birds fish and some species of invertebrates

Adolphe Marie Hardy was a Belgian writer first published in 1888 He rose to be a major figure in French literature

Hardy was educated at Herve before starting at the University of Louvain in 1886 studying law After getting his doctorate he returned to Dison where he carried on his literary work as well as working as a lawyer

Hardy was editor or assistant editor of several literary journals from 1900 onwards including Rappel de Charleroi Dpche de Lige and the Journal de Bruxelles

In 1931 Hardy received the Grand Prix de Langue franaise from the French Academy He was the first Belgian to win the prize and he won it for his poem Le Cortge des mois In 1935 he married Madeleine Verhelst In 1940 they escaped to Issigeac France After his wifes death in 1941 he married Germaine Van Den Boeck 

In May 1954 he was made a Freeman of the City of Dison and died at Laeken on June 19 of that year 

Charles Ranhofer chef at Delmonicos honoured Hardy early in his publishing career by naming a goose liver pate after him and Ranhofers book The Epicurean also lists a chicken dish Cotelettes De Poulet A La Adolphe Hardy

Oxygen difluoride was first prepared in 1929 It was made by the electrolysis of molten potassium fluoride and hydrofluoric acid The chemicals had small amount of moisture  Nowadays it is prepared by the reaction of fluorine with a dilute aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide Sodium fluoride is left as a side product

It is a very powerful oxidizing agent This is proved by the oxidation number of 2 for the oxygen atom This oxidising number is quite unusual Above 200 C OF2 decomposes to oxygen and fluorine

OF2 reacts with many metals It produces oxides and fluorides Nonmetals also react with it Phosphorus reacts with OF2 to form PF5 and POF3 Sulfur produces SO2 and SF4 with it A noble gas xenon also reacts with it It produces XeF4 and xenon oxyfluorides

Oxygen difluoride reacts very slowly with water to form hydrofluoric acid

Oxygen difluoride oxidizes sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide

However in the presence of UV radiation the products are sulfuryl fluoride chemSO2F2 and pyrosulfuryl fluoride chemS2O5F2

OF2 is a dangerous chemical This is because it is highly oxidising

The adaptive immune system is made of specialized cells and processes which kill pathogens or prevent their attack 

The adaptive immune system is switched on by the evolutionarily older innate immune system This older system is non specific whereas the adaptive system is tailored to specific targets 

Whereas the innate immune system is found in all metazoa the adaptive system is only found in vertebrates It is thought to have arisen in the first jawed vertebrates 

The adaptive immune response gives the vertebrate immune system the ability to recognize and remember specific pathogens The system mounts stronger attacks each time a particular pathogen is encountered It is adaptive immunity because the bodys immune system prepares itself for future challenges

The immune system protects organisms from infection with layered defences In simple terms physical barriers prevent pathogens such as bacteria and viruses from entering the organism 

If a pathogen breaches these barriers the innate immune system provides an immediate but non specific response Innate immune systems are found in all plants and animals 

If pathogens successfully evade the innate response vertebrates possess a third layer of protection the adaptive immune system which is activated by the innate response Here the immune system adapts its response during an infection to improve its recognition of the pathogen 

After the pathogen has been killed the offspring of B and T cells continue They are ready for a faster response next time This is a kind of immunological memory These cells allow the adaptive immune system to mount faster and stronger attacks each time this pathogen is encountered 

Both innate and adaptive immunity depend on the ability of the immune system to distinguish between self and non self molecules In immunology self molecules are those components of an organisms body that can be distinguished from foreign substances by the immune system Conversely non self molecules are those recognized as foreign molecules One class of non self molecules are called antigens and are defined as substances that bind to specific immune receptors and elicit an immune response

Adaptive immunity is triggered in vertebrates when a pathogen evades the innate immune system and generates a threshold level of antigen

The major functions of the adaptive immune system include

The Earths core is the part of Earth in the middle of our planet It has a solid inner core and a liquid outer core

The outer core of the Earth is a liquid layer about 2266 kilometers thick It is made of iron and nickel This is above the Earths solid inner core and below its mantle Its outer boundary is convert2890kmmiabbron beneath the Earths surface The transition between the inner core and outer core is approximately 5150 km beneath the Earths surface

The temperature of the outer core ranges from 4400 C in the outer regions to 6100 C near the inner core Eddy currents in the nickel iron fluid of the outer core are believed to influence the Earths magnetic field 

The average magnetic field strength in the Earths outer core was measured to be 25 Gauss 50 times stronger than the magnetic field at the surface 

The outer core is not under enough pressure to be solid so it is liquid even though it has a composition similar to that of the inner core Sulfur and oxygen could also be in the outer core

Without the outer core life on Earth would be very different Convection of liquid metals in the outer core creates the Earths magnetic field This magnetic field extends outward from the Earth for several thousand kilometers and creates a protective bubble around the Earth that deflects the Suns solar wind Without this field the solar wind would directly strike the Earths atmosphere This might have removed the Earths atmosphere making the planet nearly lifeless It may have happened to Mars

The inner core of the Earth as detected by seismology is a solid sphere about convert1216km 1abbron in radius or about 70 that of the Moon 

It is believed to be an ironnickel alloy and may have a temperature similar to the Suns surface approximately 5778 K

The Shapiro time delay is a physics experiment It is one of the four classic solar system observations or experiments which test general relativity 

Radar signals passing near a massive object take slightly longer to travel to a target and longer to return than it would if the mass of the object were not present

The time delay effect was first noticed in 1964 by Irwin I Shapiro Shapiro proposed an observational test of his prediction bounce radar beams off the surface of Venus and Mercury and measure the round trip travel time When the Earth Sun and Venus are most favorably aligned Shapiro showed that the expected time delay due to the presence of the Sun of a radar signal traveling from the Earth to Venus and back would be about 200 microseconds well within the limitations of 1960s era technology

The first tests performed in 1966 and 1967 using the MIT Haystack radar antenna were successful matching the predicted amount of time delay The experiments have been repeated many times since then with increasing accuracy

The Miller and Urey experiment was an experiment to make organic compounds out of inorganic ones by applying a form of energy

The idea was to simulate hypothetical conditions thought to be present on the early Earth It was a test of the chemical origins of life Specifically the experiment tested Alexander Oparins and JBS Haldanes hypothesis that conditions on the primitive Earth favored chemical reactions that synthesized organic compounds from inorganic precursors Considered to be the classic experiment on the origin of life it was conducted in 1952 and published in 1953 by Stanley Miller and Harold Urey at the University of Chicago

After Millers death in 2007 scientists examined sealed vials preserved from the original experiments They were able to show that there were well over 20 different amino acids produced in Millers original experiments That is considerably more than those Miller originally reported and more than the 20 that naturally occur in life

Moreover some evidence suggests that Earths original atmosphere might have had a different composition than the gas used in the MillerUrey experiment There is abundant evidence of major volcanic eruptions 4 billion years ago which would have released carbon dioxide nitrogen hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere Experiments using these gases in addition to the ones in the original MillerUrey experiment have produced more diverse molecules

Note that organic compounds including amino acids are present in the meteorite dust which rains down on Earth Therefore interest in abiogenesis and the origin of life has shifted to the question of how cells and large macromolecules formed

Agns Sorel was a favourite mistress of King Charles VII of France Charles VII was the father of her three daughters

She was the subject of several contemporary paintings and works of art including Jean Fouquets Virgin and Child Surrounded by Angels

Sorel was twenty years old when she was first introduced to King Charles She was a very beautiful young woman and was also of above average intelligence The French king immediately fell in love and she soon became his mistress The King gave her the Chteau de Loches as her private residence

Sorels presence was alleged to have brought the king out of a protracted depressionFactdateApril 2010 She had a very strong influence on the king and that in addition to her extravagant tastes earned her a number of powerful enemies at court

Agns gave birth to three daughters fathered by the King Marie de France Charlotte de France and Jeanne de France While pregnant with their fourth child she journeyed from Chinon in deep midwinter to join Charles on the campaign of 1450 in Jumiges wanting to be with him as moral support There she suddenly became ill and died at the age of 28 While the cause of death was originally thought to be dysentery In 2005 French forensic scientist Philippe Charlier examined her remains and found that the cause of death was mercury poisoning This did not mean Sorel was murdered because mercury was sometimes used in cosmetic preparations and also to treat worms this could therefore have been the reason for her death

A death mask is a wax or plaster cast made of a persons face after their death Death masks may be mementos of the dead or be used for creation of portraits It is sometimes possible to tell if paintings have been copied from death masks because shape of the face is changed by the weight of the plaster during the making of the mold In some cultures a death mask may be a clay or other item placed on the face of the dead person before burial rites The best known of these are the masks used by ancient Egyptians as part of the mummification process such as Tutankhamons burial mask

In the 17th century in some European countries it was common for death masks to be used as part of the effigy of the deceased displayed at state funerals During the 18th and 19th centuries they were also used to keep a record the faces of unknown bodies This is now done with photographs

Phrenologists and ethnographers also used both death masks and life masks for scientific and pseudoscientific purposes

Masks of dead people are a tradition in many countries The most important process of the funeral ceremony in ancient Egypt was the mummification of the body After prayers and consecration the body was put into a sarcophagus decorated with gold and gems A special part of the rite was a sculpted mask put on the face of the dead person This mask strengthened the spirit of the mummy and guarded the soul from evil spirits on its way to the afterworld The best known mask is that of Tutankhamun Made of gold and gems the mask shows the highly stylized features of the ancient ruler Such masks were not however made from casts of the features The mummification process itself kept the features of the dead person

In 1876 the archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann discovered in Mycenae six graves which he believed were those of kings and ancient Greek heroesAgamemnon Cassandra Evrimdon and others To his surprise the skulls were covered with gold masks It is now thought by some unlikely that the masks actually belonged to Agamemnon and other heroes of the Homeric epics

The lifelike character of Roman portrait sculptures has been linked to the earlier Roman use of wax to keep the features of dead family members The wax masks were then remade in stone

In the late Middle Ages a shift took place from sculpted masks to true death masks made of wax or plaster These masks were not buried with the dead Instead they were used in funeral ceremonies and were later kept in libraries museums and universities Death masks were taken not only of dead royalty and nobility but also of important peoplepoets philosophers and dramaturges such as Dante Filippo Brunelleschi Torquato Tasso Blaise Pascal and Voltaire Like in ancient Rome death masks were often then used in making marble sculpture portraits busts or engravings of the deceased

Oliver Cromwells death mask is kept at Warwick Castle Another famous death mask is that of Napoleon Bonaparte taken on the island of Saint Helena and displayed at Londons British Museum

In Russia the death mask tradition dates back to the times of Peter the Great whose death mask was made by Carlo Bartolomeo Rastrelli Also well known are death masks of Alexander I Nicholas I and Alexander II 

One of the first real Ukrainian death masks was that of the poet Taras Shevchenko made by Peter Clodt von Jrgensburg in St Petersburg Russia

Death masks were used by scientists from the late 18th century onwards to record differences in human physiognomy The life mask was also increasingly common at this time taken from living persons Anthropologists used such masks to study physiognomic features in famous persons and notorious criminals Masks were also used to collect data on racial differences

Before the invention of photography the faces of unknown bodies were sometimes kept by making death masks so that relatives of the dead could recognize them if they were looking for a missing person 

One such mask known as LInconnue de la Seine recorded the face of a young woman who had drowned in the Seine River at Paris around the late 1880s A worker at the Paris morgue was so taken by her beauty that he made a plaster cast of her face She was considered so beautiful that in the following years copies of the mask became a fashionable item in Parisian Bohemian society The face of Resusci Anne the worlds first CPR training mannequin introduced in 1960 was modeled after LInconnue de la Seine

Smith was the first Catholic to run for President and attracted many thousands of ethnic voters However he was especially unpopular among Southern Baptists and German Lutherans who feared the pope would dictate his policies It was a time of national prosperity and Smith lost in a landslide to Republican Herbert Hoover Smith tried for the 1932 nomination but was defeated by his former ally Franklin D Roosevelt Smith entered business in New York City and became an increasingly vocal opponent of Roosevelts New Deal

In 1939 he was appointed a Papal Chamberlain of the Sword and Cape one of the highest honors the Papacy bestowed on a layman which today is styled a Gentlemen of His Holiness

In the autumn of 1825 the Emperor sailed to the south of Russia due to the increasing illness of his wife During his trip he caught a cold which developed into typhus from which he died in the southern city of Taganrog on 19 November 1 December 1825 His wife died a few months later as the emperors body was transported to Saint Petersburg for the funeral He was interred at the Sts Peter and Paul Cathedral of the Peter and Paul Fortress in Saint Petersburg on 13 March 1826

The unexpected death of the Emperor of Russia far from the capital caused rumours that his death and funeral were staged so he could spend the rest of his life in solitude Some say the former emperor became a monk in either Pochaev Lavra or Kievo Pecherskaya Lavra or elsewhere Many people including some historians have theorized that a mysterious hermit Feodor Kuzmich who emerged in Siberia in 1836 died in the vicinity of Tomsk in 1864 and was eventually glorified as a saint of the Orthodox Church was Alexander I under an assumed identity While there are testimonies that Feodor Kozmich in his earlier life might have belonged to a higher level of society claims that he was Alexander I were never established beyond reasonable doubt

Temperatures in Interior Alaska change a lot between the seasons Winter temperatures in Fairbanks are usually around 12 F and summer temperatures are around 62 F Temperatures there can get as low as 65 F in mid winter and as high as 99 F in summer Both the highest and lowest temperature records for the state were set in the Interior with 100 F in Fort Yukon and 80 F in Prospect Creek Temperatures within a given winter can ghange a lot also Long cold snaps can be followed by sudden warmth with temperatures above freezing this is because of changes in the wind

Summers can be warm and dry for a long time This can make it easy for wildfires to start Weak thunderstorms can produce lightning that starts a fire These fires are often left to burn if they are far away from where people live The 2004 season had the most fires Over convert6600000acrekm2 were burned

The average annual precipitation in Fairbanks is 113 inches Most of this is snow during the winter Most storms in the interior of Alaska originate in the Gulf of Alaska Most of these storms are blocked or weakened by passing over the mountains 

The months from May to July in the summer have no darkness at night They only have a twilight during the night hours The months of November to January are the other way around They have little daylight It is light for about 21 hours every day between May 10 and August 2 It is light less than four hours each day between November 18 and January 24 On clear winter nights the aurora borealis or Northern lights can often be seen dancing in the sky A lot of the ground in the Interior has permafrost meaning that there is a layer of soil that is always frozen

Polymorphism in biology is when two or more clearly different phenotypes exist in the same population of a species The words forms or morphs are sometimes used 

Polymorphism is common in nature The most common example is sexual dimorphism which occurs in many organisms Another example is sickle cell anaemia

In order to be classified as such morphs must occupy the same habitat at the same time and belong to a population with random mating

The mechanism which decides which of several morphs an individual displays is called the switch This switch may be genetic or it may be environmental Taking sex determination as the example in man the determination is genetic by the XY sex determination system In Hymenoptera sex determination is by haplo diploidy the females are all diploid the males are haploid 

However in some animals an environmental trigger determines the sex alligators are a famous case in point In ants the distinction between workers and guards is environmental by the feeding of the grubs Polymorphism with an environmental trigger is called polyphenism

The polyphenic system does have a degree of environmental flexibility not present in the genetic polymorphism However such environmental triggers are the less common of the two methods

Since all polymorphism has a genetic basis genetic polymorphism has a particular meaning

The definition has three parts a sympatry one interbreeding population b discrete forms and c not maintained just by mutation

Genetic polymorphism is actively and steadily maintained in populations by natural selection This contrasts with transient polymorphisms where a form is progressively replaced by anotherrp6 7 

By definition genetic polymorphism relates to a balance or equilibrium between morphs The mechanisms that conserve it are types of balancing selection

Such a balance is seen more simply in sickle cell anaemia which is found mostly in tropical populations in Africa and India 

An individual homozygous for the recessive sickle haemoglobin HgbS has a short expectancy of life The life expectancy of the standard haemoglobin homozygote and also the heterozygote is normal 

The sickle cell variant survives in the population because the heterozygote is resistant to malaria and the malarial parasite kills a huge number of people each year 

This is heterozygote advantage a kind of balance between fierce selection against homozygous sickle cell sufferers and selection against the standard HgbA homozygotes by malaria The heterozygote has a permanent advantage so long as malaria exists and it has existed as a human parasite for a long time Because the heterozygote survives so does the HgbS allele survive at a rate much higher than the mutation rate 

Mammals normally produce lactase only as long as the mother has milk Then the enzyme lactase is cut off Modern humans are different 

The human ability to drink milk during adult life is supported by a lactase mutation Human populations have a high proportion of this mutation wherever milk is important to the diet The spread of milk tolerance is promoted by natural selection it helps people survive where milk is available 

Genetic studies suggest that the oldest mutations associated with lactase persistence only reached appreciable levels in human populations in the last ten thousand years Therefore lactase persistence is often cited as an example of recent human evolution As lactase persistence is genetic but animal husbandry a cultural trait this is geneculture coevolution

Ants exhibit a range of polymorphisms First there is their characteristic haplodiploid sex determination system whereby all males are haploid and all females are diploid 

Second there is differentiation based mostly on feeding of larvae This determines for example whether the adult is capable of reproduction 

Lastly there is differentiation of size and duties which are usually controlled by feeding andor age but which may sometimes be genetically controlled Thus the order exhibits both genetic polymorphism and extensive polyphenism

An example of a botanical genetic polymorphism is heterostyly in which flowers occur in different forms with different arrangements of the pistils and the stamens 

Pin and thrum heterostyly occurs in dimorphic species of Primula such as P vulgaris There are two types of flower The pin flower has a long style bearing the stigma at the mouth and the stamens half way down and the thrum flower has a short style so the stigma is half way up the tube and the stamens are at the mouth 

So when an insect in search of nectar inserts its proboscis into a long style flower the pollen from the stamens stick to the proboscis in exactly the part that will later touch the stigma of the short styled flower and vice versa

Another most important property of the heterostyly system is physiological If thrum pollen is placed on a thrum stigma or pin pollen on a pin stigma the reproductive cells are incompatible and relatively little seed is set Effectively this ensures outcrossing as described by Darwin Quite a lot is now known about the underlying genetics the system is controlled by a set of closely linked genes these act as a single unit a so called super generpch10rp86 

All sections of the genus Primula have heterostyle species altogether 354 species out of 419 Since heterostyly is characteristic of nearly all races or species the system is at least as old as the genus

Between 1861 and 1863 Darwin found the same kind of structure in other groups such as flax and in Purple Loosestrife and other species of Lythrum

Heterostyly is known in at least 51 genera of 18 families of Angiosperms

Studies over many years have shown that natural populations of Drosophila are polymorphic for chromosome inversions The inversions are so common that they must be kept in the population by natural selection

Petrified wood is the name given to a special type of fossilized remains of terrestrial vegetation It is the result of a tree having turned completely into stone by the process of permineralization All the organic materials have been replaced with minerals while retaining the original structure of the wood Unlike other types of fossils which are typically impressions or compressions petrified wood is a three dimensional representation of the original organic material

The petrifaction process occurs underground when wood becomes buried under sediment and is initially preserved due to a lack of oxygen which inhibits aerobic decomposition

Dolores Claiborne is a 1995 film in which Kathy Bates plays the title character Also starring in the film is Jennifer Jason Leigh This film is based on the Stephen King novel of the same name

Four principal stars  and Crv make a group of stars called as the Spicas Spanker or the Sail 

31 Crateris is a 52 magnitude star which was once mistaken for a moon of Mercury

Corvus has no Messier objects

The Antennae peculiar galaxy is made up of two galaxies that are colliding NGC 4038 and NGC 4039 It has a heart shape as seen from Earth The name name comes from the huge tidal tails that come off the ends of the two galaxies

There is a planetary nebula NGC 4361 at the center of Corvus The nebula looks like a small elliptical galaxy but it is not The center star is only magnitude 13 so it cannot be a large galaxy

The story of Corvus is related to two other constellation Crater and Hydra

Once the crow had beautiful silver or snowy white feathers and could speak to humans The crow was a very special bird for the god Apollo When Apollos lover Coronis was pregnant Apollo told the raven to watch over her Coronis slowly lost interest in Apollo and was attracted to a human The crow had been spying on her secretly He told Apollo that Coronis had a new lover Apollo was so angry that he turned the loyal ravens feathers black and took away the birds ability to speak Coronis was killed by Apollos twin sister Artemis The child of Coronis and Apollo lived He then became Asclepius the god of medicine and healing

In another story Apollo sent his raven to get some water in the gods cup called the Crater The raven waited for some figs to become ripe and ate them He came back very late with a water snake called a Hydra and the water in the cup The foolish raven said he was late because of the water snake Apollo was not tricked He put the raven in the sky along with the water snake and the cup The snake stops the thirsty raven from getting to the water in the cup The raven can see the water just out of reach

Corvus is similar to the Babylonian raven The Babylonians also put the raven sitting on the tail of a snake The Babylonian constellation was special to the god Adad Adad was the god of rain and storms In the time of the Babylonians the constellation would have risen just before the start of the autum rainy season

Flowering plant sexuality describes some of the technical terms for common arrangements of flowers

Terms for the sexuality of individual flowers

Examples of plants with perfect or bisexual flowers include the lily rose and most plants with large showy flowers though a perfect flower does not have to have petals or sepals Other terms widely used are hermaphrodite monoclinous and synoecious A complete flower is a perfect flower with petals and sepals 

Many plants have complete flowers with both male and female parts others only have male or female parts and still other plants have flowers on the same plant that are a mix of male and female flowers 

Some plants even have mixes that include all three types of flowers where some flowers are only male some are only female and some are both male and female 

A distinction needs to be made between arrangements in single plants versus the larger plant population 

Some plants also undergo what is called Sex switching like Arisaema triphyllum which express sexual differences at different stages of growth In some arums smaller plants produce all or mostly male flowers and as plants grow larger over the years the male flowers are replaced by more female flowers on the same plant Arisaema triphyllum thus covers a multitude of sexual conditions in its life time from nonsexual juvenile plants to young plants that are all male as plants grow larger they have a mix of both male and female flowers to large plants that have mostly female flowers 

Other plant populations have plants that produce more male flowers early in the year and as plants bloom later in the growing season they produce more female flowers In plants like Thalictrum dioicum all the plants in the species are either male or female 

Specific terms are used to describe the sexual expression of individual plants within a population

Individuals bearing separate flowers of both sexes at the same time are called simultaneously or synchronously monoecious Individuals that bear flowers of one sex at one time are called consecutively monoecious plants may first have single sexed flowers and then later have flowers of the other sex Protoandrous describes individuals that function first as males and then change to females protogynous describes individuals that function first as females and then change to males

In states that are Commonwealth Realms a Royal Commission is a major government public inquiry into an important issue They have been held in the United Kingdom Canada Australia New Zealand Kenya and Saudi Arabia In Hong Kong Ireland and South Africa they are called a Commission of Enquiry or Commission of Inquiry

A Royal Commissioner has a lot of power more than those of a judge but these are limited to the Terms of Reference of the Commission The Commission is created by the Head of State on the advice of the Government In practiceunlike other forms of inquiryonce a Commission has started the government cannot stop it Because of this governments are usually very careful about framing the Terms of Reference and generally include in them a date by which the commission must finish

Royal Commissions are called to look into very important matters and usually controversy For example these can be about government structure the treatment of minorities or the events that had received concern from the public or economic questions

Many Royal Commissions last many years and often a different government is left to respond to the findings In Australiaand particularly New South WalesRoyal Commissions have been investigations into police and government corruption and organised crime They have used the powers of the Royal Commissioner to force powerful but corrupt public officials to tell the truth

Royal Commissions are usually run by one or more notable figures Because of their legal powers the Commissioners are often retired senior judges

Royal Commissions usually research issues consult with experts both within and outside of government and the public as well They can call witnesses under oath offer indemnities seize documents and other evidence holding hearings in camera and can force all government officials to help the Commission 

The results of Royal Commissions are published in often massive reports of findings containing policy recommendations They often have long and complex names for example the Royal commission into whether there has been corrupt or criminal conduct by any Western Australian Police Officer Because of this they are commonly known by the name of the main Commissioner These reports are often quite important with the government making some or all recommendations into law The work of some Commissions have been almost completely ignored by the government In other cases where the Commissioner has not kept to the terms of reference the commission has been stopped by a superior court

Delmonicos is the name of series of restaurants in New York City The original and most famous was operated by the Delmonico family during the 19th and early 20th centuries but the last family owned restaurant closed due to a Prohibition era slowdown in 1923 Since that time restaurants using the Delmonicos name have reopened elsewhere in Manhattan under different owners 

The original Delmonicos began in a rented pastry shop at 23 William Street in 1827 appearing listed as a restaurant in 1830 They moved several times before settling at 2 South William Street for eighty years it is credited with being the first restaurant in America to allow patrons to order from a menu la carte as opposed to table dhte It is also claimed to be the first to employ a separate wine list

At the peak of Delmonicos fame the family operated four restaurants under the name at the same time and a total of ten during their ownership

Six years after they closed the doors of their last restaurateur Oscar Tucci opened a Delmonicos at 2 South William Street which stayed in business until 1977 Other Delmonicos have operated in the space from 19811992 and from 1998 to present

The restaurant was opened by the brothers John and Peter Delmonico from Ticino Switzerland In 1831 they were joined by their nephew Lorenzo Delmonico who eventually became responsible for the restaurants wine list and menu When the William Street building was opened on a grand scale in August 1837 after the Great Fire of New York New Yorkers were told that the columns by the entrance had been imported from the ruins of Pompeii

Beginning in the 1850s the restaurant hosted the annual gathering of the New England Society of New York which featured many important speakers of the day  In 1860 Delmonicos provided the supper at the Grand Ball welcoming the Prince of Wales at the Academy of Music on East 14th Street Supper was set out in a specially constructed room the menu was French and the pices montes represented Queen Victoria and Prince Albert the Great Eastern and Floras Vase The New York Times reported We may frankly say that we have never seen a public supper served in a more inapproachable fashion with greater discretion or upon a more luxurious scale In 1862 the restaurant hired Charles Ranhofer considered one of the greatest chefs of his day

In 1919 Edward LC Robins purchased Delmonicos Its grand location at Fifth Avenue and 44th Street closed in 1923 as a result of changing dining habits due to Prohibition That was the Delmonicos linked with the original family business

Almost immediately after the closing of the last Delmonicos a number of imitators opened Delmonicos restaurants The Delmonico family attempted to retain exclusive rights to the name but a court ruled that with the closing of the last restaurant the name had passed into the public domain

In 1929 Oscar Tucci opened a Delmonicos popularly called Oscars Delmonicos at the old restaurant at 2 South William Street in New York Tucci used the original menus and recipes and became distinguished in its own right continuing to attract prominent politicians and celebrities It was open continuously until it closed in 1977

In 1981 a new Delmonicos was opened at the location by Ed Huber which operated until 1992

The building was vacant until 1998 when the Bice Group acquired the property and again opened a Delmonicos with Gian Pietro Branchi as executive chef In 1999 the restaurant was sold to the Ocinomled partnership which continues to operate Delmonicos at the South William Street location

Lobster Newberg and Delmonico Potatoes were invented at Delmonicos restaurant and possibly Chicken la King but it was most famous for Delmonico steak Eggs Benedict were also said to have originated at Delmonicos although others claim that dish as well Baked Alaskas name was coined at Delmonicos as wellfactdateDecember 2010

Among the many well known people who patronized Delmonicos are Jenny Lind who it was said ate there after every show Theodore Roosevelt Mark Twain Diamond Jim Brady Lillian Russell usually in the company of Diamond Jim Charles Dickens Oscar Wilde JP Morgan James Gordon Bennett Jr Walter Scott Nikola Tesla Edward VII then the Prince of Wales and Napoleon III of France Journalist Jacob A Riis claimed to be a patron of a different sort in his book The Making of an American he mentioned that when he was down on his luck a kindly French speaking cook at Delmonicos would pass him rolls through the basement window

The New Orleans Louisiana Delmonicos which opened in 1895 was purchased by Emeril Lagasse in 1997 Lagasse refurbished the restaurant and reopened it as Emerils Delmonico

A warming center is a place where people can go to stay warm and dry when it is rainy or wet outside They are like homeless shelters except that they are only open when the weather is bad 

The main reason for them is to make sure that nobody is left out in the cold Many people die from being wet and cold every year

Sometimes when it is windy trees fall on them Sometimes people get frostbite if it is very cold But the main thing that people worry about is called hypothermia  thats when the body temperature gets too low It can be fatal When it is cold and windy the wind chill factor makes it worse

If people are old drinking or homeless things can get very bad very fast if the weather goes bad These things are all called risk factors The level of risk goes way up making it more likely that they will become sick or maybe even die out in the cold Scientists study these risk factors and put them all together with numbers That kind of study is discussed below it is called a vulnerability index

Warming Centers are mostly for people who are homeless who do not stay in homeless shelters Sometimes they are also set up when blizzards occur or the power goes out Sometimes they are set up when the roads are out due to landslides avalanches and blizzards 

In some cases when cold snaps threaten wildlife they are created and operated to protect endangered wild animals Cold blooded animals such as turtles are particularly vulnerable as are their hatchlings Emergency shelters vary in policy on pet companion or domesticated animals During large scale disasters there are frequently separate locations including a safe place for horses Citation neededdateFebruary 2011

Sometimes warming centers are set up in existing homeless shelters However the law says that only a certain number of people are allowed at any one time This is because of things like the fire code Sometimes an agreement with the neighbors prevents too many people because of parking and overcrowding of the neighborhood 

Therefore they need to find different locations 

These include churches and community organizations but also may involve special real estate such as National Guard armories

Warming centers are generally opened for only a few days at a time based on the conditions of the area although some are open for specific portion of the year when weather conditions are bad 

The City of Chicago opens its shelters from December 1 to March 1 each year as well as any other times the temperature drops below freezing

The City of Portland Oregon uses a more complicated formula to determine when to open centers wet or dry conditions the nights predicted low the three day trendwind and whether snowfall

Opening a center depends on the weather conditions and theformula at that center Each one is different because weather is different in each place Lane County Oregon utilizes an elaborate system of tiered readiness levels in collaboration with the American Red Cross The Red Cross is involved with some warming centers They use a system to tell the staff people to get ready They refer to these levels as their alert status It goes all the way from normal good weather OUTLOOK status all the way up through different levels Finally they reach ACTIVATE which means it is time to get to work

Once a center has been set up it is always a problem to make sure people know about it A lot of people do not want to deal with the authorities Other people may be connected with the helping system In the USA some people came up with an idea to help fix that problem The government agency in charge of these issues is called Housing and Urban Development That agency requires a homeless count every two years Organizations such as wCommon Ground are trying to reach out to more people with the homeless counts and use these counts to get a list of homeless people who need some help Hopefully one of the good things to come from all of that work is there will be better ways to make sure people know about the warming centers 

Centers often coordinate with outside programs such as 211 Newspapers are generally published weekly or less frequently which makes them useful only for general information such as contact numbers and locations 

For transportation to centers some offer free transportation In some cases for persons being released from jail can get rides if the weather is bad In blizzard conditions snowmobilers have been mobilized

Once opened and populated they typically offer only the most bare bones of service a cot and perhaps a bowl of hot soup They are generally operated with one or more experienced professional staff person This is due to the difficulties which untrained volunteers might encounter in dealing with the clientele Often users of warming centers are persons who are not participating in routine homeless shelter services due This may be due to disciplinary problems and issues with behavior such as drinking and fighting Sometimes it takes a professional to figure out who might be disruptive or even dangers as opposed to who is just a little bit eccentric or odd That is why it is important to have experienced staff

Some people who use warming centers do not have major issues maybe they are just on the road and the weather takes a turn for the worse Or they do not stay in shelters because they do not like the rules or have personality problems with a staff person 

Sometime warming centers are started because someone dies from the cold or many people are at riskThey seem to go back as far as 1945 at the end of World War II In Berlin clothing and blankets were allowed for under the air lift plan Also an extensive plan was developed for public warming centers

Nowadays US warming centers are springing up all over the place They are seen as a means to help the homeless who usually stay outdoors The main time is during temperature and rainfall spikes There may not be room in the sheleters According to Detroit writer Naomi Spencer they serve also as a last resort for homeless people to find respite relief from the cold especially those with drug addictions mental illness or criminal backgrounds who may not meet requirements imposed by some homeless shelters or religious charity operations Others including straight edge DIY or anarchist identified persons may choose to live off the gridoutside the regular system of housing They are not there because of sobriety issues

Others simply find shelters too regimented too much like jail Newspaperman Mike Hendricks quotes a former resident of an unauthorized homeless encampment named Crow who said that some guys would sooner do what they want and not be told what to do

Tom Browns Field Guide to City and Suburban Survival contains chapters on shelters and heating  He also outlines means of creating a personal warming center by using ATM access cards His recommendations have been circulated by Chicagos urban community activist Chrisdian Wittenburg including instructions on building a makeshift stove and a plethora of collaborative cultural projectsCitation neededdateFebruary 2011

Perception of the importance and priority of warming centers varies At one extreme their under utilization or minimal level of service is said to be unfriendly During the blizzard of February 2011 the City of Ottawa Illinois did not have established warming centers A temporary facility was set up People had to bring their own food and blankets There was criticism of that According to a man calling himself Poppy the have notscan all freeze to deathhere in the friendly city In Detroit there was Federal money for a warming center but the money was not given to the proper officials in time or at all This failure to distribute Community Development Block Grants resulted in a situation where people slept in plastic chairs or in cold hallways

At the other end critics have asked if churches the right place for handling the kind of people who are likely to come in the door  Many people say that the warming centers tend to keep things the way they are to maintain the status quo That is because they do not get to the root of the problems 

Sue Murphy is the administrative director of Interfaith Action of Evanston Illinois which has a daytime center It is used for a time slot when the overnight shelters are closed She states that warmth and snacks is not nearly enoughwhat we need is a place where they can go the whole winter

Her concerns are seconded by Sue Loellebach of Connections for the Homeless who laments the lack of warm refuge during daylight hours

Sinodelphys is an extinct mammal from the Lower Cretaceous It is a member of the infraclass Metatheria the group which contains modern marsupials

To date it is the oldest metatherian fossil known estimated to be 125 million years old This makes it almost contemporary to the earliest placental fossils which have been found in the same area

It was discovered and described in 2003 in rocks of the Yixian Formation in Liaoning Province China by a team of scientists 

Sinodelphys szalayi grew only 15 cm long and possibly weighed about 30 g 

Its fossilized skeleton is surrounded by impressions of fur and soft tissue thanks to the exceptional sediment that preserves such details 

From its foot structure it is thought that Sinodelphys was a tree dweller like its non marsupial contemporary Eomaia and modern opossums such as Didelphis Sinodelphys probably hunted worms and insects 

Most Mesozoic metatherians have been found in North America and Asia Most lived during the Upper Cretaceous between 90 65 million years ago

Sweetbreads or ris are culinary names for the thymus or the pancreas glands especially of the calf and lamb

Various other glands used as food have also been called sweetbreads including the parotid gland the sublingual glands and testicles The heart sweetbreads are more spherical in shape and surrounded symmetrically by the throat sweetbreads which are more cylindrical in shape

One common preparation of sweetbreads involves soaking in salt water then poaching in milk after which the outer membrane is removed Once dried and chilled they are often breaded and fried They are also used for stuffing or in pts They are grilled in many Latin American cuisines such as in the Argentine asado and served in bread in Turkish cuisine

The word sweetbread is first known in the 16th century but the logic behind the name is unclear Sweet is perhaps used since the thymus is sweet and rich tasting as opposed to savoury tasting muscle flesh Bread may come from brede roasted meat

Culinary name is the name of an ingredient when used in the kitchen for preparing food Sometimes the kitchen name is used because it sounds more attractive than the real name or because a cheaper ingredient can be linked with a more expensive one The culinary name may also refer to a way of cooking or to a region or using a particular ingredient

Lojze Grozde was a Slovenian student who was killed by partisans during World War II His death is recognised as martyrdom by the Catholic Church He was beatified on June 13 2010

Grozde was born on May 27 1923 in the village of Gorenje Vodale Trie near Mokronog in Lower Carniola Slovenia He was an illegitimate child When he was four years old his mother married His stepfather chased him away each time he wanted to see his mother Later because Lojze was a good pupil the stepfather became friendlier towards him and so he remained at the house and his aunt took care of him She saw to his schooling and sent him to a school in Ljubljana where she was working as a servant Some benefactors helped her support her nephew He stayed at the Marijanie boarding school and attended Classical Secondary School in Ljubljana There he was an outstanding student but found time for literary creativity too and so became poet and writer He was a member of Catholic Action and a member of the Marian Congregation Towards the end of his high schooling World War II was approaching Circumstances were becoming increasingly strained This was also the time when Lojze had to make a decision about his vocation He sought his path in life through meditation and learning in deep prayer and in apostolic work for others

During his summer vacation of 1942 he did not go home because there was a lot of violence and it was not easy to travel It was only for New Year 1943 that he decided to visit his relatives He asked for a permit to travel home First he visited a friend of his at the village of Struge On 1 January 1943 the first Friday he attended mass at the monastery at Stina where he received communion for the last time in his young life then travelled by train from Ivanna Gorica to Trebnje where he found he could not travel further because the rails had been destroyed He decided to continue to Mirna on foot and on the way he rode in a cart By the first house at Mirna he had to get out of the cart because a partisan guard seized and interrogated him On him they found a devotional book The Imitation of Christ by Thomas a Kempis and a booklet on Our Lady of Fatima He was taken to a nearby inn and interrogated tortured and killed Three hours earlier the seminarian Janez Hoevar who wanted to visit his relatives in nearby entrupert had been also shot Lojze Grozde was suspected of being an informant the communists saw in him the mentality that they deprecated and persecuted

Soon rumors spread about cruel way the Tone Tomi Partisan Brigade which had conquered Mirna celebrated the New Year Some others maintain that Grozde was not tortured Other sources state that he was tortured

On 23 February 1943 the fate of Lojze Grozde was partly revealed indicating that he had been tortured Schoolchildren picking snowdrops found his corpse Although there were traces of torture on his body the corpse itself was uncorrupted His body was taken to nearby entrupert where a committee made a report The body of Lojze Grozde was buried at the cemetery in entrupert because it was impossible to take it to his home parish of Trie under the difficult circumstances of those days The news of the violent torture and death of this innocent student struck fear among people and shocked the students in Ljubljana

On the 50th anniversary of the death of Lojze Grozde the Archdiocese of Ljubljana started a process to recognize his martyrdom and also his beatification and canonization When Pope John Paul II visited Slovenia for the first time in 1996 he mentioned Lojze Grozde twice He said The servant of God Lojze Grozde is just one of innumerable innocent victims of Communism that raise the palm of martyrdom as an indelible memory and admonition He was a disciple of Christ Pope Benedict XVI said that saints are not the past but they represent the present and the future of the Church and society They fully realized love in truth which is the highest value in Christian life their figures are like prisms that in various casts reflect the unique light of Christ

On March 27 2010 the news came from Rome that Pope Benedict XVI had affirmed the martyrdom of Lojze Grozde Thus a solemn beatification is allowed that took place at the Slovenian eucharistic congress in Celje on June 13 2010 In his introduction to the biography of Lojze Grozde by Anton Strle who is also a candidate for sainthood Taras Kermauner wrote Grozde combines the ardour and apostolate of Friderik Baraga the asceticism and suffering of Janez Franiek Gnidovec a gift for organization and the Slovenian national consciousness of Blessed Anton Martin Slomek He symbolizes the entire martyrdom suffered by Christians and Catholic Slovenians during World War II and afterwards for their affiliation to their faith His personality should be returned to the common Slovenian consciousness of heroes that have been praised and elevated to the first plane as the only models Today a man like Grozde is needed as our model a martyr a saint Not a man of aggressive military action thinking he will put forward God with arms and the blood of other or foreign people I do not fear to write that Grozde belongs among the greatest young Slovenians that his attitude is fitting and most precious

The vulnerability index is a tool for finding out who among the street homeless population needs health care and housing the most It is being used in more and more cities in the USA Volunteeers conduct a survey of people living in homeless shelters warming centers and people who do not have any housing at all 

The vulnerability index is from the work of Dr Jim OConnell of Bostons Healthcare for the Homeless He was concerned about the causes of death of unsheltered homeless individuals living on the street A national drive is underway by Common Ground to work with the HUD homeless count Since communities are doing the count he believes that is a good time to do the vulnerability index too Its people say that using it will help getting needy individuals off the street 

The vulnerability index has been tried out in a lot of other places not just the East Coast These include Charlotte North Carolina AlbuquerqueNew Mexico and Santa Monica California

Common Ground is a nonprofit social services organization It provides housing for the homeless and others Their philosophy holds that housing costs less than homeless shelters It also costs many times less than jail cells or hospital rooms They also believe that people with psychiatric and other problems can better manage them once they have a place to live It was started in 1990 by Rosanne Haggerty Since then the organization has created more than 2000 units of housing for the homeless This is about creating a small town rather than just a building according to Haggerty Its about a real mixed society working with many different people

Haggertys work was recognized in 2001 She was selected as a prize winner and received and award called a MacArthur Fellowship award The MacArthur Foundation praised her work in saving historic buildings and fixing them up She used creative financing which means new ways to deal with banks and other organizations that provide money for housing 

Among Common Grounds activities is documentation of the homeless population In other words to study them and write down what is going on so that people can figure out a plan of action Sometimes this is done while counting the homeless These counts are sometimes called enumeration because they put a number on how many homeless there are 

In these counts there is a way of writing down who is most vulnerable who is most in danger from being homeless This is called a vulnerability index Workers complete the vulnerability index by asking about medical problems Then they try to persuade those who spend the most time on the streets to seek permanent housing They do this even if the people still have drug alcohol or medical problems Some of those involved in the issue of homelessness consider Common Ground a pioneer  someone who thinks up new ways to deal with old problems 

However the count is not an end to itself but a first step According to Becky Kanis the Director of Common Grounds Innovations Department

The important part is what we do with this information We want to move from crisis management to lasting solutions Other cities have done that successfully We plan to do the same At the real end of the day the only thing thats going to matter is the people who have been unwilling to accept the offers of shelter Can we reach them and make a positive difference in their lives 

Some people have asked if what works in New York will work in other places 

Kanis states We dont know exactly whats going to work here in New York but we know whats worked in other cities Therefore were going to spend our efforts doing those things and as we find smarter and better ways to do things we will adopt them

The 2011 Christchurch earthquake was a 63 magnitude earthquake which struck the South Island of New Zealand at 1251 pm on 22 February 2011 NZT It was about 5km underground It struck the Canterbury region of the island and caused a lot of damage and many deaths in Christchurch New Zealands second largest city

It was the largest aftershock of the 4 September 2010 Canterbury earthquake although it is being regarded as a separate earthquake It was smaller than the September earthquake but it was more damaging because it was closer to Christchurch and nearer to the surface of the earth It also happened at lunchtime on a Tuesday compared to before dawn on a Saturday which meant that more people were outside and in danger of being injured by falling buildings Buildings were also already weakened from the previous quakes The intensity felt in Christchurch was MM VIII

Prime Minister John Key said that 22 February may well be New Zealands darkest day At least 166 people have been confirmed dead with the final death toll expected to be over 200

At the end of the first day 65 people were known to have died and the number is expected to rise Over 100 people may be trapped in one building alone The New Zealand Fire Service says many people were injured and trapped in buildings At 5pm local time Radio New Zealand reported that 80 of the city was without electricity Water and wastewater services are not working in many parts of the city People are being asked to use as little water as possible and to collect rainwater It is expected that the State of Emergency Level 3 the highest possible in a regional disaster will last at least five days Medical staff from the army are being used

The Sydney Morning Herald reported that two buses and a number of cars were crushed by falling buildings

Buildings have collapsed around Cathedral Square in downtown Christchurch The spire of ChristChurch Cathedral has completely collapsed Christchurch Hospital was evacuated due to damage in some areas but soon reopened to treat the injured It has treated over 220 serious injuries so far even though sometimes they were working by torchlight The New Zealand defence forces have been called in to help move people out of the central business district Fires were reported at the Canterbury Television building

The Pyne Gould Corporation building on Cambridge Terrace has suffered a lot of damage and some of the buildings 200 workers are believed to be trapped within Screams have been heard from inside

The historic Canterbury Provincial Chambers building has also suffered major damage from the earthquake

The Statistics New Zealand buildings in Christchurch were also damaged They were due to process much of the March 2011 census of New Zealand The census has been cancelled because people living in Christchurch have had their lives seriously disrupted This is the third time the census has been cancelled the previous two times being during the Great Depression and World War II

ChristChurch Cathedral has lost the top of its main spire and its roof has fallen in Initial reports said 22 people were in the spire at the time of the collapse However after the building was made safe to enter over a week after the quake and searched throughly no bodies were located 

The Catholic cathedral of Christchurch the Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament has half collapsed

Buildings in Lyttelton have been damaged a fire officer said that 60 of the buildings in the main street have collapsed The towns historic Timeball Station was also badly damaged The New Zealand Historic Places Trust who own the building have decided that it is unsafe to try to repair it It will be dismantled if possible and perhaps re constructed

Around 30 million tonnes of ice fell off Tasman Glacier into Tasman Lake about convert200kmmi from the epicentre hitting tour boats with waves 35 high

The quake was felt as far north as Tauranga and as far south as Invercargill where the 111 emergency network was damaged and stopped working

New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said All Civil Defence procedures have now been activated the Civil Defence bunker at Parliament is in operation here in Wellington Civil Defence has alerted all Urban Search and Rescue teams in Christchurch The New Zealand Red Cross is also involved

Australia has offered help and immediately sent a search and rescue team of 70 from New South Wales on a RAAF C 130 Hercules Foreign Affairs Minister Kevin Rudd also said a second team from South Australia will also be sent with more equipment Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard has offered John Key any other help he may need The United States and Japan have also offered help

Christchurch International Airport was only open for emergency air traffic but has now been opened to all local and domestic flights The earthquake has affected all air traffic in New Zealand Air traffic control services by Airways New Zealand the national Air Traffic Control organisation have been disrupted

Adolphe Duglr was a French chef and a pupil of Carme

Duglr was a chef de cuisine to the Rothschild family until 1848 and was manager at the restaurant Les Frres Provenaux at the Palais Royal from 1848 to 1866 which was owned by three men from Provence named Barthlmy Maneille and Simonas

In 1866 he became the head chef of the  which was the most famous Paris restaurant of the 19th century and where he is believed to have created the dish Pommes Anna

It was at the Caf Anglais in 1867 that Duglr served a famous meal that became known as the Dner des trois empereurs for Tsar Alexander II of Russia his son the tsarevitch and King William I of Prussia as well as Prince Otto von Bismarck who were in Paris for LExposition Universelle The table service used for this meal is on display to this day at the oldest existing restaurant in Paris La Tour dArgent which is owned by the descendants of Claudius Burdel the last owner of Caf Anglais which was demolished in 1913

The evening of 7 June 1867 is reputed to have been the most magnificent ever to have occurred in any restaurant in the world The three emperors and Prince Bismarck had requested of Duglr a meal that would live in their memories and the matre de cave Claudius Burdel was instructed to accompany the dishes with the greatest wines in the world

The most famous dish attributed to Duglr is almost certainly Pommes Anna Other dishes created by Duglr include Potage Germiny a sorrel soup created for the Count of Germany governor of the Bank of France Poularde Albufera dedicated to Marchal Suchet Duke of Albufera Souffl langlaise Sole Duglr and Culotte de buf Salomon and Barbue la Duglr

He is also credited with inventing Tournedos Rossini but this dish has also been credited to both Escoffier as well as Carme It was composer Gioachino Rossini who dubbed Duglr Le Mozart de la cuisine It was a title he used on the menu for the Dinner of the Three Emperors

The International Labour Organization is an international organization created in Geneva in 1919 for better for working conditions and standard of living In 1946 this organization has become a special organization of the United Nations and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1969

The constitution of the International Labour Organization affirms that universal and lasting peace can be established only if it is based upon social justice An additional declaration adopted in Philadelphia at the 26th section affirms that Labour is not a commodity Freedom of expression and association are essential to sustained progress Poverty anywhere constitutes a danger to prosperity everywhere and that All human beings irrespective of race creed or sex have the right to pursue both their material well being and their spiritual development in conditions of freedom and dignity of economic security and equal opportunity

For this purpose ILO has made 189 Conventions called Inrenational Labour Convention but many countries do not ratify the Conventions despite its improtance

Consomm Brillat Savarin is a consomm or soup named after Jean Anthelme Brillat Savarin

It is made by taking a basic chicken consomm and adding chicken breast and savoury pancakes along with lettuce and sorrel chiffonade and chervil leaves

James Graham Brown was an American businessman and philantropist He was a hotel owner in Louisville Kentucky It was his hotel the Brown Hotel which first served the hot sandwich 

The name Hot Brown meaning a type of hot sandwich comes either from Brown himself or his hotel

Social justice est a idea of justice that affirms social equality against any kind of discrimination or abuse out of social class social status or any other reasons

This idea is discussed by modern philosopher such as John Rawls and is a fundamental idea for International Labour Organization for universal and lasting peace And Vienna Declaration also affirm social justice as a subject and a purpose of education for human rights

Speciation is about how species form It is a major part of evolutionary biology

Darwin thought most species arose directly from pre existing species This is called anagenesis species by changing or phyletic evolution Now we think most species arise by previous species splitting cladogenesis

The general view is that most species splitting is caused or helped on its way by isolating mechanisms

Isolating Mechanisms are features of behavior morphology or genetics which serve to prevent breeding between species Reproductive isolation of populations is established It is particularly important to the biological species concept as species are defined by reproductive isolation  Isolating mechanisms can be divided into two groups before and after fertilisation

Factors which prevent individuals from mating 

Genomic incompatibility hybrid inviability or sterility

This is thought to be the most comon cause of speciation The first person to think of it was Moritz Wagner a German explorer and natural historian

Wagners early career was as a geographer and he published a number of geographical books about North Africa the Middle East and Tropical America He was also a keen naturalist and collector and it is for this work he is best known among biologists Ernst Mayr the evolutionist and historian of biology has given an account of Wagners significancep562565 

During his three years in Algeria Wagner studied the flightless beetles Pimelia and Melasoma Each genus is split into a number of species each of which is confined to a stretch of the north coast between rivers which descend from the Atlas Mountains to the Mediterranean As soon as one crosses a river a different but closely related species appears

This was an early description of a process of one kind of geographic speciation In 1942 it was reintroduced by Mayr and the importance of geographic speciation became one of the core ideas of the evolutionary synthesis  

Another term for geographic speciation is allopatric speciation Allopatry means different land 

Volcanic islands are formed with no life and all life has to arrive carried by wind or water We know from the Hawaiian islands and from the Galapagos Islands that all forms of life change when they reach the islands from the mainland

In about convert6500sqmikm2abbron the Hawaiian Islands have the most diverse collection of drosophilid flies in the world living from rainforests to mountain meadows About 800 Hawaiian drosophilid species are known

Studies show a clear flow of species from older to newer islands There are also cases of colonization back to older islands and skipping of islands but these are much less frequent 

By potassiumargon radioactive dating the present islands date from 04 million years ago to 10mya The oldest member of the Hawaiian archipelago still above the sea is Kure Atoll which can be dated to 30 mya 

The archipelago itself produced by the Pacific plate moving over a hot spot has existed for far longer at least into the Cretaceous Previous islands now beneath the sea form the Hawaiian Emperor seamount chain

All of the native drosophilid species in Hawaiokinai have apparently descended from a single ancestral species that colonized the islands about 20 million years ago The subsequent adaptive radiation was spurred by a lack of competition and a wide variety of vacant niches Although it would be possible for a single pregnant female to colonise an island it is more likely to have been a group from the same species

There are other animals and plants on the Hawaiian archipelago which have undergone similar if less spectacular adaptive radiations

In biology a ring species is a connected series of neighboring populations each of which can interbreed with next door populations The two ends of the chain overlap

The two end populations in the series are too distantly related to interbreed Such non breeding though genetically connected end populations may co exist in the same region thus closing a ring

Ring species provide important evidence of evolution they illustrate what happens over time as populations genetically diverge Richard Dawkins observed that ring species are only showing us in the spatial dimension something that must always happen in the time dimension

A classic example of ring species is the Larus gulls circumpolar species ring The range of these gulls forms a ring around the North Pole which is not normally flown over by individual gulls

Broadly speaking the gulls can interbreed to some extent with their neighbours except at the two ends of the ring

The Lesser Black backed Gulls and Herring Gulls are sufficiently different that they do not normally hybridize thus the group of gulls forms a continuum except where the two lineages meet in Europe

Although the reality is much more complicated it shows the general idea well

Sympatric speciation refers to the formation of two or more descendant species from a single ancestral species all occupying the same geographic location

In sympatric speciation species diverge while inhabiting the same place Often cited examples of sympatric speciation are found in insects that become dependent on different host plants in the same area 

However the existence of sympatric speciation as a mechanism of speciation is still hotly contested People have argued that the evidences of sympatric speciation are in fact examples of micro geographic speciation The most widely accepted example of sympatric speciation is that of the cichlids of Lake Nabugabo in East Africa which is thought to be due to sexual selection

Polyploidy has caused many rapid speciation events because offspring of for example tetraploid x diploid matings often result in triploid sterile progeny 

However not all polyploids are reproductively isolated from their parental plants and gene flow may still occur for example through triploid hybrid x diploid matings that produce tetraploids

Many of the existing plant and most animal species have apparently undergone polyploidization in their evolutionary history Reproduction of successful polyploid species is sometimes asexual by parthenogenesis For unknown reasons many asexual organisms are polyploid 

One example of evolution at work is the case of the hawthorn fly Rhagoletis pomonella which appears to be undergoing sympatric speciation 

Different populations of hawthorn fly feed on different fruits A distinct population emerged in North America in the 19th century some time after apples a non native species were introduced This apple feeding population normally feeds only on apples and not on the historically preferred fruit of hawthorns The current hawthorn feeding population does not normally feed on apples 

Some evidence suggests that sympatric speciation is occurring Hawthorn flies mature later in the season and take longer to mature than apple flies and there is little evidence of interbreeding 

The emergence of the new hawthorn fly is an example of evolution in progress

Rarely a new species forms when individual members of different species mate Usually the products of such hybrid matings are infertile or relatively so and so get eliminated by natural selection 

One example of a new and successful hybrid species has been found The new species is a hybrid of the Italian and Spanish sparrows and the basic facts have been checked by sequence analysis from the DNA in their blood The bird lives in Italy in a region where both parent species live It does not reproduce with the Spanish sparrow even though it lives with them side by side

New species have been created by domesticated animal husbandry but the initial dates and methods are not clear For example domestic sheep were created by hybridisation and no longer produce viable offspring with Ovis orientalis one species from which they are descended 

Domestic cattle on the other hand can be considered the same species as several varieties of wild ox gaur yak etc as they readily produce fertile offspring with them

The best documented creations of new species in the laboratory were performed in the late 1980s William Rice and GW Salt bred fruit flies Drosophila melanogaster using a maze with three different choices of habitat such as lightdark and wetdry 

Each generation was placed into the maze and the groups of flies that came out of two of the eight exits were set apart to breed with each other in their respective groups After thirty five generations the two groups and their offspring were isolated reproductively because of their strong habitat preferences they mated only within the areas they preferred and so did not mate with flies that preferred the other areas The history of such attempts is described in Rice and Hostert

Diane Dodd was also able to show how reproductive isolation can develop from mating preferences in Drosophila pseudoobscura after only eight generations using different food types starch and maltose

Dodds experiment has been easy for many others to replicate including with other kinds of fruit flies and foods

Reinforcement is the process by which natural selection increases reproductive isolation 

It may occur after two populations of the same species are separated and then come back into contact If their reproductive isolation was complete then they will have already developed into two separate incompatible species 

If their reproductive isolation is incomplete then further mating between the populations will produce hybrids which may or may not be fertile If the hybrids are infertile or fertile but less fit than their ancestors then there will be no further reproductive isolation and speciation has essentially occurred 

The reasoning behind this is that if the parents of the hybrid offspring each have naturally selected traits for their own different environments the hybrid offspring will bear traits from both and would not fit either niche as well as either parent The low fitness of the hybrids would cause selection to favour assortative mating which would reduce hybridization 

This is sometimes called the Wallace effect after the evolutionary biologist Alfred Russel Wallace who suggested in the late 19th century that it might be an important factor in speciation 

If the hybrid offspring are more fit than their ancestors then the populations will merge back into the same species within the area they are in contact

Reinforcement is required for separation when there is a hybrid zone between two forms of a species Hybrid zones are regions where diverged populations meet and interbreed Hybrid offspring are very common in these regions which are usually created by diverged species coming into secondary contact 

Without reinforcement the two populations or species would have uncontrollable interbreeding Reinforcement may be induced in artificial selection experiments as described above

Elasmobranchii is a subclass of Chondrichthyes or cartilaginous fish that includes the sharks and the rays and skates

Fossilised shark teeth are known from the early Devonian around 400 million years ago During the following Carboniferous period the sharks underwent a period of diversification with many new forms evolving Many of these became extinct during the Permian but the remaining sharks underwent a second burst of adaptive radiation during the Jurassic around which time the skates and rays first appeared

Edward B Lewis was an American geneticist He shared the 1995 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine

Lewis was born in Wilkes Barre Pennsylvania He received a BA in Biostatistics from the University of Minnesota in 1939 

In 1942 Lewis received a PhD from California Institute of Technology working on Drosophila melanogaster under the guidance of Alfred Sturtevant 

After serving as a meteorologist in the US Air Force in World War II Lewis joined the Caltech faculty in 1946 as an instructor In 1956 he was appointed Professor of Biology and in 1966 the Thomas Hunt Morgan Professor of Biology 

His Nobel Prize winning studies with Drosophila founded the field of developmental genetics and laid the groundwork for our current understanding of the universal evolutionarily conserved strategies controlling animal development 

His key publications in the fields of genetics developmental biology radiation and cancer are available in a book

During the 1950s Dr Lewis studied the effects of radiation from X rays nuclear fallout and other sources as possible causes of cancer He reviewed medical records from survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as well as radiologists and patients exposed to X rays Lewis concluded that health risks from radiation had been underestimated Dr Lewis published articles in Science and other journals and made a presentation to a Congressional committee on atomic energy in 1957

At the scientific level of the debate the crucial question was whether the threshold theory was valid or whether as Lewis insisted the effects of radioactivity were linear with no threshold where every exposure to radiation had a long term cumulative effect

In a series of experiments with the fruit fly Drosophila Lewis was able to identify a complex of genes whose proteins bind to the regulatory regions of target genes The latter then activate or repress cell processes which direct the final development of the organism 

Furthermore the sequence of these control genes show co linearity the order of the loci in the chromosome parallels the order in which the loci are expressed along the anterior posterior axis of the body Not only that but this cluster of master control genes programs the development of all higher organisms 

Each of the genes contains a homeobox a remarkably conserved DNA sequence This suggests the complex itself arose by gene duplication 

In his Nobel lecture Lewis said Ultimately comparisons of the control complexes throughout the animal kingdom should provide a picture of how the organisms as well as the control genes have evolved

Angela Georgina Burdett Coutts 1st Baroness Burdett Coutts born Angela Georgina Burdett was a noted nineteenth century philanthropist She was the daughter of Sir Francis Burdett 5th Baronet and Sophia Coutts daughter of Thomas Coutts the banker In 1837 she became the wealthiest woman in England when she inherited her grandfathers fortune of nearly three million pounds sterling At the same time she got a Royal Licence to join her fathers and grandfathers surnames and become Angela Burdett Coutts 

Lady Burdett Coutts did not mary until she was 67 She married her 29 year old secretary the American born William Lehman Ashmead Bartlett who later became MP for Westminster on 12 February 1881 Her new husband changed his surname to Burdett Coutts Lady Burdett Coutts had no children

She gave away most of her wealth setting up on scholarships endowments and giving to a wide range of charitable causes One of her earliest was to establish with the novelist Charles Dickens Urania Cottage a home that helped young women who had turned to a life of immoralityincluding theft and prostitution

Among many gifts to churches she also personally endowed the bishoprics of Cape Town and Adelaide and the founding bishopric of British Columbia The money from these endowments was invested to help pay for the Bishops expenses

The granite fountain in Edinburgh with a statue of Greyfriars Bobby was erected by Baroness Burdett Coutts She also established the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children in 1883 the Westminster Technical Institute in 1893 and was closely involved with the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals 

Other roles and charitable projects included

In 1871 in recognition of her charity work Queen Victoria made her a peer on her under the title Baroness Burdett Coutts of Highgate and Brookfield in the County of Middlesex although as a woman she was not a member of the House of Lords On 18 July 1872 she became the first woman to be presented with the Freedom of the City of London at the Guildhall and in 1874 was Edinburghs first woman Burgess also being presented with the Freedom of that city

Lady Burdett Coutts died of acute bronchitis at her house in Stratton Street Piccadilly By the time of her death she had given more than 3 million to good causes She was buried on 5 January 1907 near the West Door in the nave of Westminster Abbey The barony became extinct on her death

Charles Dickens dedicated his novel Martin Chuzzlewit to her and she had many royal and eminent friends The book Flashmans Lady by George MacDonald Fraser makes reference to Angela Burdett Coutts love interest for James Brooke and his rejection of her due to his physical affliction

Prince Maurice of Teck full name Alice Mary Victoria Augusta Pauline titles HRH Princess Alice Countess of Athlone HRH Princess Alice Lady Cambridge HRH Princess Alexander of Teck HRH Princess Alice of Albany house House of Windsor

Princess Alice Countess of Athlone GCVO GBE GStJ was a member of the British Royal Family She was the longest lived Princess of the Blood Royal of the British Royal Family and the last surviving grandchild of Queen Victoria She also a Princess of Saxe Coburg and Gotha and a Duchess in Saxony from birth as well as a Princess of Teck by marriage until 1917 when she was ordered to give up all German titles by the Letters Patent of George V She was godmother to Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands who was the granddaughter of her first cousin Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands Princess Alice was the last grandchild of Queen Victoria to die in January 1981 almost 115 years after the death of Prince Sigismund of Prussia the first grandchild of Queen Victoria to die

Princess Alice was born 25 February 1883 at Windsor Castle Her father was Prince Leopold Duke of Albany the youngest son of Queen Victoria and Albert Prince Consort Her mother was Princess Helena of Waldeck and Pyrmont She had one brother Prince Charles Edward Duke of Albany who was reigning Duke of Saxe Coburg and Gotha As the granddaughter of the Sovereign through the male line she was a Princess of the United Kingdom and a Royal Highness As the daughter of the Duke of Albany she was therefore styled Her Royal Highness Princess Alice of Albany 

Prince and Princess Alexander of Teck had three children

Princess Alice was one of the carriers of the gene for haemophilia which arose with Queen Victoria Princess Alice inherited the gene from her father who himself was a sufferer Her eldest son Rupert inherited the disease from her this led to his early death following an automobile accident citation neededdateFebruary 2010

When the British Royal Family abandoned all German titles by Letters Patent issued by King George V in June 1917  Prince Alexander of Teck gave up the title Prince of Teck in the Kingdom of Wrttemberg and the style Serene Highness and took the surname Cambridge For a short time he was known as Sir Alexander Cambridge then the Earl of Athlone Their two surviving children also lost their Wrttemberg princely titles 

Princess Alice gave up her titles of Princess of Saxe Coburg and Gotha and Duchess of Saxony but her brother Charles Edward Duke of Saxe Coburg and Gotha who held a commission in the German Army did not and was stripped of his British titles instead Alice stayed a Princess of Great Britain and Ireland and a Royal Highness in her own right as granddaughter of Queen Victoria in the male line From June 1917 until her death she was styled Her Royal Highness Princess Alice Countess of Athlone

The Earl was appointed Governor General of the Union of South Africa and served from 1924 31 Princess Alice accompanied him and was the Vicereine during that period Lord and Lady Athlone had a coastal beach house constructed at Muizenberg which still stands today and is one of South Africas national monuments The Cape Town Suburb of Athlone was named in honour of the Governor General and it and the beach house are the only physical reminder of the Athlones residence at the Cape

On the sudden death of the very popular John Buchan in 1940 Canada was without a Governor General in time of war For a long time Canadian governments had intended appointing only Canadians as governors general Australia had long since done so with the appointment of Sir Isaac Isaacs as its governor general But wartime did not seem the right time for such a move As the Royal Family had got a lot of public support during the Royal Tour of 1939 Lord Athlone seemed a very good candidate He was Queen Marys brother and a former governor general of another of His Majestys Dominions and Mackenzie King advised the King to appoint him 

Princess Alice accompanied her husband to Canada where he served as Governor General from 19401946 

It does not appear that the Athlones left any lasting mark in Canada or indeed conducted any public works delivered any speeches or performed any works of lasting value though photos of the Earl with Roosevelt Churchill and Mackenzie King on the ramparts of the Citadel during the Quebec Conference were amply published at the time

At the end of World War II the American Military Government in Bavaria under the command of General George S Patton arrested and imprisoned Alices brother Charles Edward Duke of Saxe Coburg and Gotha because of his Nazi sympathies Alice came to Germany with her husband to plead with for his release They would not yield and in 1946 he was sentenced by a de nazification court heavily fined and almost bankrupted

In her lifetime Princess Alice carried out many Royal duties Apart from her normal duties as Vicereine of South Africa and then Canada she attended the Coronations of four monarchs Edward VII George V George VI and Elizabeth II She was also the Colonel in Chief of two British Army units and one Rhodesian Army unit During the Second World War she was Honorary Air Commandant of the Royal Canadian Air Force Womens Division In 1950 she became the first Chancellor of the University of the West Indies From the 1930s 60s she was Chair of the Council of Royal Holloway College University of London

The Earl of Athlone died in 1957 at Kensington Palace in London Princess Alice lived on there until 1981 when she died at age 97 years and 313 days At her death she was the longest lived British Princess of the Blood Royal and the last surviving grandchild of Queen Victoria

Her funeral took place in St Georges Chapel at Windsor Castle attended by all members of the Royal Family She is buried alongside her husband and son in the private British Royal Burial Grounds at Frogmore directly behind the mausoleum of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in Windsor Great Park Her daughter and son in law are also buried close by

She lived through six reigns Victoria Edward VII George V Edward VIII George VI and Elizabeth II

As a granddaughter of Queen Victoria in the male line Princess Alice was entitled to use the Royal Arms with a 5 point label as a difference the central point bearing a cross gules the others hearts gules

Until George Vs warrant of 1917 her arms like all those of Prince Alberts British royal descendants bore an inescutcheon for Saxony

These activities can be as simple as sitting up in bed walking to the bathroom and cleaning Sometimes they are dangerous examples include cooking driving extremely violent gesture or grabbing at hallucinated objects or even homicide

Generally sleepwalking cases consist of simple repeated behaviours occasionally there are reports of people performing complex behaviours while asleep but the legitimacy of these claims is often disputed In 2004 sleep medicine experts in Australia claimed to have successfully treated a woman who claimed to have sex with strangers in her sleep In December 2008 reports were published of a woman who sent semi coherent emails while sleepwalking including one inviting a friend around for dinner and drinks Sleepwalkers often have little or no memory of the what they do because they are not truly conscious Their eyes are open but their expression is dim and glazed over Sleepwalking may last as little as 30 seconds or as long as 30 minutes

There is no data about how common sleepwalking is Estimates say that that one to two percent of adults are sleepwalkers Sleepwalking seems to be more common in children between ten and thirty percent of children are affected in most cases they stop sleepwalking during puberty Most cases of sleepwalking are temporary they occur once or only a few times It looks like some sleepwalking may be inherited very often people who are sleepwalkers have other sleepwalkers in the family

There are certain drugs that can treat sleepwalking

The format of the Cricket World Cup has changed greatly over the course of its history The first four tournaments were played by eight teams divided into two groups of four The competition was held in two stages A group stage and a knock out stage The four teams in each group played each other once in the group stage The top two teams in each group went through to the semi finals The winners of the semi finals played against each other in the final With the return of South Africa in 1992 after the ending of the apartheid boycott nine teams played each other once in the group phase and the top four teams progressed to the semi finals The tournament was made bigger in 1996 with two groups of six teams The top four teams from each group progressed to quarter finals and semi finals

A new format was used for the 1999 and 2003 World Cups The teams were split into two pools The top three teams in each pool went into the Super 6 The Super 6 teams played the three other teams that had made it through from the other group The teams carried their points forward from the matches played against the other two who were in their group The top four teams from the Super 6 stage progressed to the semi finals with winners playing in the final

The last format used in the 2007 World Cup features 16 teams allocated into four groups of four Each team played each other once within the group Teams earn points for wins and half points for ties The top two teams from each group move forward to the Super 8 round The Super 8 teams play the other six teams that progressed from the different groups Teams earned points in the same way as the group stage Teams also carry their points forward from the match against the other team who qualified from the same group The top four teams from the Super 8 round advance to the semi finals The winners of the semi finals play in the final

The current format features 14 teams The 14 teams are split into two groups of seven Within each group each team will play each other once The top four teams from each group will proceed to the knock out stage playing quarter finals Winners of the quarter finals will play semi finals and the winning semi finalists will play in the final

The ICC Cricket World Cup Trophy is presented to the winners of the World Cup finals The current trophy was created for the 1999 championships and was the first permanent prize in the tournaments history prior to this different trophies were made for each World Cup The trophy was designed and produced in London by a team of craftsmen from Garrard Co over a period of two months

The current trophy is made from silver and gild and features a golden globe held up by three silver columns The columns shaped as stumps and bails represent the three fundamental aspects of cricket batting bowling and fielding while the globe characterises a cricket ball The trophy is designed with platonic dimensions so that it can be easily recognised from any angle It stands 60 cm high and weighs approximately 11 kilograms The names of the previous winners are engraved on the base of the trophy with space for a total of twenty inscriptions

The original trophy is kept by the ICC A replica which differs only in the inscriptions is permanently awarded to the winning team

The tournament is the worlds third largest being televised in over 200 countries to over 22 billion television viewers Television rights mainly for the 2011 and 2015 World Cup were sold for over US11 billion and sponsorship rights were sold for a further US500 million The 2003 Cricket World Cup matches were attended by 626845 people while the 2007 Cricket World Cup sold more than 672000 tickets and recorded the highest ticketing revenue for a Cricket World Cup

Successive World Cup tournaments have generated increasing media attention as One Day International cricket has become more established The 2003 World Cup in South Africa was the first to sport a mascot Dazzler the zebra An orange raccoon like creature known as Mello was the mascot for the 2007 Cricket World Cup

The International Cricket Councils executive committee votes for the hosts of the tournament after examining the bids made by the nations keen to hold a Cricket World Cup

England hosted the first three competitions The ICC decided that England should host the first tournament because it was ready to devote the resources required to organising the inaugural event India volunteered to host the third Cricket World Cup but most ICC members believed England to be a more suitable venue because the longer period of daylight in England in June meant that a match could be completed in one day The 1987 Cricket World Cup was the first hosted outside England held in Pakistan and India

Since 1992 one player has been declared as Man of the Tournament at the end of the World Cup finals

Previously there was no tournament award although Man of the Match awards have always been given for individual matches Winning the Man of the Match in the final is logically noteworthy as this indicates the player deemed to have played the biggest part in the World Cup final To date the award has always gone to a member of the winning side The Man of the Match award in the final of the competition has been awarded to

Desiccation is the state of extreme dryness or the process of extreme drying 

A desiccant is a hygroscopic substance that causes dessication in a moderately sealed container

Desiccation tolerance refers to the ability of an organism to withstand or endure extreme dryness or drought like conditions 

Plants and animals living in arid or periodically arid environments such as temporary streams or ponds may face desiccation therefore physiological or behavioural adaptations are necessary to ensure survival In particular insects occupy a wide range of ecologically diverse niches and so have a variety of strategies to avoid desiccation 

Desiccation resistance in insects is generally measured by the change in mass during dry conditions The overall mass difference between measurements before and after aridity exposure is attributed to body water loss

Cryptobiosis refers to the state of an organism that has no detectable metabolic activity resulting from extreme and unfavorable environmental conditions Anhydrobiosis refers to the state of surviving the loss of all body water

 Tardigrades  Tardigrades are able to live in environments that would kill most animals In 2007 scientists discovered that some tardigrades were able to survive 10 days in outer space Tardigrades can survive more than ten years without water

Rotifers are specialists at living in habitats where water dries up regularly 

The Monogononta which have males produce fertilised resting eggs which can resist desiccation for long periods 

The Bdelloids who have no males contract into an inert form and lose almost all body water a process known as cryptobiosis Bdelloids can also survive the dry state for long periods the longest well documented dormancy is nine years After they have dried they may be revived by adding water

Fettuccine alfredo is a pasta dish made from fettuccine pasta tossed with Parmesan cheese and butter

This is an old and simple recipe in Italy it is simply called Fettuccine al burro The Italian restaurateur Alfredo di Lelio doubled the amount of butter used This made it easier for his pregnant wife to eat He then started selling his variation at his restaurant Alfredo alla Scrofa in Rome 

Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks ate at Alfredo alla Scrofa on their honeymoon and this helped make the restaurant and Fettuccine alfredo popular with tourists

In US cuisine it may be mixed with other ingredients such as broccoli parsley cream garlic shrimp or chicken

A knockout mouse is a genetically engineered mouse in which one or more genes have been turned off by a gene knockout 

Knockout mice are important animal models for studying the role of genes which have been sequenced but whose functions are not yet known By causing a specific gene to be inactive in the mouse and observing any differences from normal behaviour or condition researchers can infer its probable function

Mice are currently the most closely related laboratory animal species to humans for which the knockout technique can easily be applied They are widely used in knockout experiments especially those genetic questions which relate to human physiology 

Gene knockout in rats is much harder and has only been possible since 2003

The first knockout mouse was created by Mario R Capecchi Martin Evans and Oliver Smithies in 1989 for which they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for 2007 

A detailed explanation of how knockout mice are produced is at the website of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2007

Aspects of the technology for generating knockout mice and the mice themselves have been patented in many countries by private companies

The Chinese water chestnut is a plant The corms of the plant are the water chestnuts and is a crispy white flesh and can be eaten raw slightly boiled grilled pickled or tinned This plant comes from China They are grown in flooded paddy fields

A gene knockout is a genetic technique in which one of an organisms genes is switched off or replaced by one which does not work 

The organisms such as knockout mice are used to learn about a gene that has been sequenced but whose function is unknown or incompletely known Researchers draw inferences from the difference between the knockout organism and normal individuals 

The technique is essentially the opposite of a gene knock in Knockout is often abbreviated as KO 

Knockout is accomplished through a combination of techniques It starts in the test tube with a plasmid or other DNA construct and proceeding to cell culture 

Individual cells are genetically transformed with the DNA construct Often the goal is to create an animal that has the altered gene 

If so embryonic stem cells are genetically transformed and inserted into early embryos Resulting animals with the genetic change in their germline cells can then often pass the gene knockout to future generations

Temple Square is a National Historic Landmark and religious center located in Salt Lake City Utah and is owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints Temple Square contains the Salt Lake Temple Salt Lake Tabernacle Salt Lake Assembly Hall the Seagull Monument and two visitors centers With 3 million to 5 million visitors a year Temple Square is the most popular tourist attraction in Utah

A DNA construct is an artificially constructed segment of nucleic acid which is going to be transplanted into a target tissue or cell 

It often contains a DNA insert which contains the gene sequence encoding a protein of interest The DNA insert has been subcloned into a molecular biology vector 

A DNA construct may express wildtype protein or prevent the expression of certain genes by expressing competitors or inhibitors It may express mutant proteins such as deletion mutations or missense mutations A DNA construct is often used in molecular biology to analyze macromolecules such as proteins or RNA in more detail

A molecular biology vector is a DNA molecule used as a vehicle to transfer foreign genetic material into another cell 

The main types of vectors are plasmids bacteriophages and other viruses and artificial chromosomes Common to all engineered vectors are an origin of replication a multicloning site and a selectable marker 

The vector itself is generally a DNA sequence that consists of an insert and a larger sequence that serves as the backbone of the vector The backbone will include bacterial resistance genes for growth in bacteria and promoters for expression in the organism 

The purpose of a vector which transfers genetic information to another cell is typically to isolate multiply or express the insert in the target cell 

Insertion of a vector into the target cell is usually called transformation for bacterial cells or transfection for eukaryotic cells Insertion of a viral vector is often called transduction

The 2011 Libyan protests is a series of demonstrations and riots in Libya that started on 13 February 2011 

The demonstrations began to protest against the Government of Libya and its de facto leader Muammar al Gaddafi According to NBC News Chief Foreign Correspondent Richard Engel who entered Libya and had reached the city of Tobruk on 22 February 2011 was quoted as saying the protest movement is no longer a protest movement its a war Its open revolt and on 22 February The Economist described the protests as an uprising that is trying to reclaim Libya from the worlds longest ruling autocrat On 21 February Libyan Air Force aircraft attacked civilian protesters in Tripoli which caused international condemnation Over 300 to 2000 are dead and over 5000 have been injured

The protests are to have been inspired because of the successful uprising in Tunisia and the 2011 Egyptian protests

Gene targeting is a genetic technique for replacing an existing gene with a mutated one It can be done in lab mice or some other model organism

The method can be used to delete a gene remove control sections add a gene and introduce point mutations 

Gene targeting can be permanent or conditional Conditions can be a specific time during development in the life of the organism or limited to a specific tissue for example

To date this method has been applied to a number of species including Drosophila melanogaster tobacco corn human cells mice and rats

Mario R Capecchi Martin J Evans and Oliver Smithies were declared laureates of the 2007 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work on principles for introducing specific gene modifications in mice by the use of embryonic stem cells or gene targeting 

First a DNA construct is made usually in bacteria The construct has the mutated gene or part of it and a reporter gene which may be a selectable marker

Mutated DNA is got into a stem cell genome derived from an embryo

Now the stem cells undergo a process called homologous recombination 

The now mutant stem cells are injected into some early mouse embryo cells The mice are from a black line and the injected cells carry a white marker The mice which result are chimeras part white and part black 

Large numbers of mice are mated which produces a few white mice Cross breeding the white mice produces 50 of offspring which are homozygous for the marker and so pure bred for the experimental gene being inserted Tests on the mice with the gene insertion can now take place

The pipits are a cosmopolitan genus Anthus of small passerine birds with medium to long tails Along with the wagtails and longclaws the pipits make up the family Motacillidae The genus is widespread occurring across most of the world except the driest deserts rainforests and the mainland of Antarctica

They are slender often drab ground feeding insectivores of open country Like their relatives in the family the pipits are monogamous and territorial Pipits are ground nesters laying up to six speckled eggs

A model organism is a non human species that is studied over many years building up a lot of knowledge about it

The purpose is to understand fundamental biological phenomena The hope is that discoveries made in the model will give insight into how other organisms work 

In particular model organisms are widely used to explore potential causes and treatments for human disease when experimenting on humans would be impossible or less ethical 

This strategy is made possible by the common descent of all living organisms and the conservation of metabolic and developmental pathways and genes over the course of evolution

Drosophila melanogaster was one of the first animals used for genetics Today it is one of the most widely used and genetically best known of all eukaryotic organisms 

All organisms use common genetic systems understanding transcription and replication in fruit flies helps to understand these processes in other eukaryotes including humans

Studies of X linked traits confirmed that genes are found on chromosomes Studies of linked traits led to the first maps of genetic loci on chromosomes The first maps of Drosophila chromosomes were done by Alfred Sturtevant

Drosophila melanogaster is one of the most studied organisms in biological research particularly in genetics and developmental biology Its complete genome was sequenced and first published in 2000

Because great deal is known about its development from egg to larva to adult it is a key model for developmental genetics or evo devo The hox genes or homeobox which control development in metazoa were worked out first of all in Drosophila

In 1946 Joshua Lederberg and Edward Tatum first described the phenomenon known as bacterial conjugation using Escherichia coli as a model bacterium 

E coli was an integral part of the first experiments to understand phage genetics and early researchers such as Seymour Benzer used E coli and phage T4 to understand the topography of gene structure Before Benzers research it was not known whether the gene was a linear structure or if it had a branching pattern

E coli was one of the first organisms to have its genome sequenced the complete genome of E coli K12 was published by Science in 1997

The long term evolution experiments using E coli begun by Richard Lenski in 1988 have allowed direct observation of major evolutionary shifts in the laboratory

The inaugural Cricket World Cup was hosted in 1975 by England the only nation able to put forward the resources to stage an event of such magnitude at that time The 1975 tournament started on June 7 The first three events were held in England and officially known as the Prudential Cup after the sponsors Prudential plc The matches consisted of 60 six ball overs per team played during the daytime in traditional form with the players wearing cricket whites and using red cricket balls

Eight teams participated in the first tournament Australia England India New Zealand Pakistan and the West Indies together with Sri Lanka and a composite team from East Africa One notable omission was South Africa who were banned from international cricket due to apartheid The tournament was won by the West Indies who defeated Australia by 17 runs in the final at Lords

The 1979 World Cup saw the introduction of the ICC Trophy competition to select non Test playing teams for the World Cup with Sri Lanka and Canada qualifying West Indies won a second consecutive World Cup tournament defeating the hosts England by 92 runs in the final At a meeting which followed the World Cup the International Cricket Conference agreed to make the competition a quadrennial event

The 1983 event was hosted by England for a third consecutive time By this time Sri Lanka had become a Test playing nation and Zimbabwe qualified through the ICC Trophy A fielding circle was introduced convert30ydm away from the stumps Four fieldsmen needed to be inside it at all times India an outsider quoted at 66 1 to win by bookmakers before the competition began were crowned champions after upsetting the West Indies by 43 runs in the final

The 1987 tournament named the Reliance World Cup after their Indian sponsors was held in India and Pakistan the first time that the competition was held outside England The games were reduced from 60 to 50 overs per innings the current standard because of the shorter daylight hours in the Indian subcontinent compared with Englands summer Australia won the championship by defeating England by 7 runs in the final the closest margin in World Cup final history

The 1992 World Cup held in Australia and New Zealand introduced many changes to the game such as coloured clothing white balls daynight matches and an alteration to the fielding restrictions The South African cricket team participated in the event for the first time following the fall of the apartheid regime and the end of the international sports boycott Pakistan overcame a dismal start to emerge as winners defeating England by 22 runs in the final

The 1996 championship was held in the Indian subcontinent for a second time with the inclusion of Sri Lanka as host for some of its group stage matches In the semi final Sri Lanka heading towards a crushing victory over India at Eden Gardens after their hosts lost eight wickets while scoring 120 runs in pursuit of 254 were awarded victory by default after riots broke out in protest against the Indian performance Sri Lanka went on to win their maiden championship by defeating Australia by seven wickets in the final which was held in Lahore

In 1999 the event was hosted by England with some matches also being held in Scotland Ireland Wales and the Netherlands Australia qualified for the semi finals after reaching their target in their Super 6 match against South Africa off the final over of the match They then proceeded to the final with a tied match in the semi final where a mix up between South African batsmen Lance Klusener and Allan Donald saw Donald drop his bat and stranded mid pitch to be run out In the final Australia dismissed Pakistan for 132 and then reached the target in less than 20 overs with eight wickets in hand

South Africa Zimbabwe and Kenya hosted the 2003 World Cup The number of teams participating in the event increased from twelve to fourteen Kenyas victories over Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe among others and a forfeit by the New Zealand team which refused to play in Kenya because of security concerns enabled Kenya to reach the semi finals the best result by an associate In the final Australia made 359 runs for the loss of two wickets the largest ever total in a final defeating India by 125 runs

In 2007 the tournament was hosted by the West Indies The Cricket World Cup became the world tournament to be hosted on all six populated continents Bangladesh progressed to the second round for the first time after defeating India and they later went on to defeat South Africa in the second round Ireland making their World Cup debut tied with Zimbabwe and defeated Pakistan to progress to the second round where they went on to defeat Bangladesh Following their defeat to Ireland the Pakistani coach Bob Woolmer was found dead in his hotel room The cause of death was heart failure Australia defeated Sri Lanka in the final by 53 runs extending their undefeated run in the World Cup to 29 matches and winning three straight World Cups

ImageRunzelmarkenjpgthumb230pxThis wrinkled elephant skin texture is a trace fossil of a non stromatolite microbial mat The image shows the location in the Burgsvik beds of Sweden where the texture was first identified as evidence of a microbial mat

A microbial mat is a multi layered sheet of microorganisms mainly bacteria and archaea They were first described by Paracelsusp1 but their full significance was not realised until the last quarter of the 20th century  

Microbial mats grow mostly on submerged or moist surfaces but a few survive in deserts They colonize environments ranging in temperature from 40C to 120C A few are endosymbionts of animals

Although usually only a few centimetres thick microbial mats create a wide range of internal chemical environments They consist of layers of microorganisms that can feed on or tolerate the chemicals at their level In moist conditions mats are usually held together by slimy substances secreted by the micro organisms118 1671 7 Some of the micro organisms form tangled webs of filaments which make the mat tougher The best known physical forms are flat mats and stubby pillars called stromatolites but there are also spherical forms

Microbial mats are the earliest form of life on Earth for which there is good fossil evidence from 3500 million years ago and were for a long period the most important members of the planets ecosystems 

Originally they may have depended on hydrothermal vents for energy and chemical food The development of photosynthesis gradually liberated them from the hydrothermal ghetto by proving a more widely available energy source sunlight although initially the photosynthesizing mats still depended on the diffusion of chemicals emitted by hydrothermal vents The final and most significant stage of this liberation was the development of oxygen producing photosynthesis since the main chemical inputs for this are carbon dioxide and water

As a result microbial mats began to produce the atmosphere we know today in which free oxygen is a vital component At around the same time they may also have been the birthplace of the more complex eukaryote type of cell of which all multicellular organisms are composed Microbial mats were abundant on the shallow seabed until the Cambrian substrate revolution when animals living in shallow seas increased their burrowing capabilities and thus broke up the surfaces of mats and let oxygenated water into the deeper layers poisoning the oxygen intolerant micro organisms that lived there Although this revolution drove mats off soft floors of shallow seas they still flourish in many environments where burrowing is limited or impossible including rocky seabeds and shores hyper saline and brackish lagoons and are found on the floors of the deep oceans 

Because of microbial mats ability to use almost anything as nutrients there is considerable interest in industrial uses of mats especially for water treatment and for cleaning up pollution

Fiji Hindi is an Indo Aryan language which is the mother tongue of 313000 people of Indian origin in Fiji

This language is very different from the standard Hindi spoken in India and the relationship between the two languages are similar to those between Dutch and Afrikaans The language is composed of the Eastern Hindi dialects with numerous English and Fijian words It is spoken with a Pacific twang 

In recent times due to the political upheaval in Fiji large numbers of Fiji Indians have migrated to Australia New Zealand United States and Canada taking the Fiji Hindi language with them

The Iroquois also known as the Haudenosaunee or the People of the Longhouse are a group of tribes of indigenous people of North America After the people who spoke Iroquoian came together as different tribes which were mostly in what is now central and upstate New York in the 16th century or earlier they came together in an group known today as the Iroquois League or the League of Peace and Power The first Iroquois League was often known as the Five Nations as it was made up of the Mohawk Oneida Onondaga Cayuga and Seneca After the Tuscarora nation joined the League in 1722 the Iroquois became known as the Six Nations To this day fifty sachems who represent different clans of the Iroquois meet at the Grand Council near Syracuse New York

When Europeans first arrived in North America the Iroquois lived in what is now the northeastern United States mostly in what is today upstate New York west of the Hudson River and through the Finger Lakes region Today the Iroquois live mostly in New York and Canada

The Iroquois League has also been called the Iroquois Confederacy Some modern scholars now think the League and the Confederacy are different According to this belief the term Iroquois League stands for the ceremonies and culture found in the Grand Council while the term Iroquois Confederacy stands for what was the spread out political and diplomatic group that was made after Europeans began colonizing America The League still exists The Confederacy broke up after the defeat of the British and allied Iroquois nations in the American Revolutionary War

The Iroquois call themselves the Haudenosaunee which means People of the Longhouse or more accurately They Are Building a Long House They believe that the Great Peacemaker came up with the name when the League was formed It means that the nations of the League should live together as families in the same longhouse Symbolically the Mohawk guarded the eastern door as they lived in the east closest to the Hudson River The Seneca guarded the western door of the tribal longhouse the land they controlled in New York The Onondaga who lived in the center of Haudenosaunee territory were keepers of the Leagues central flame The French colonists called the Haudenosaunee by the name of Iroquois There are several different places this name might have come from 

Members of the League speak Iroquoian languages that are very different from those of other Iroquoian speakers This suggests that while the different Iroquoian tribes had the same historical and cultural origin they came apart over a long enough time that their languages became different Evidence from archaeology shows that Iroquois ancestors lived in the Finger Lakes region from at least 1000 AD ImageTheiroquoislonghousepngthumb250pxA traditional Iroquois longhouse After coming together in the League the Iroquois invaded the Ohio River Valley in present day Kentucky to find more hunting grounds  The Iroquois League was made before they first met European people Most archaeologists and anthropologists think that the League was made sometime between about 1450 and 1600 although some people think it was even earlier

According to tradition the League was formed through the efforts of two men Deganawida sometimes known as the Great Peacemaker and Hiawatha They brought a message called the Great Law of Peace to the fighting Iroquoian nations The nations who joined the League were the Seneca Onondaga Oneida Cayuga and Mohawk Once they stopped most of their fighting the Iroquois fast became one of the strongest forces in 17th and 18th century northeastern North America

According to legend an evil Onondaga chieftain named Tadodaho was the last to be converted to the ways of peace by The Great Peacemaker and Hiawatha He became the spiritual leader of the Haudenosaunee This is said to have occurred at Onondaga Lake near Syracuse New York The title Tadodaho is still used for the leagues spiritual leader the fiftieth chief who sits with the Onondaga in council He is the only one of the fifty to have been chosen by the entire Haudenosaunee people The current Tadodaho is Sid Hill of the Onondaga Nation

In the 1600s the Iroquois fought with other tribes for hunting land This is called the Beaver Wars

During the French and Indian War the Iroquois took the side of the British against the French and their Algonquian allies both of whom had been enemies of the Iroquois in the past The Iroquois hoped that helping the British would also bring favors after the war In actuality few Iroquois joined the campaign and in the Battle of Lake George a group of Mohawk and French ambushed a Mohawk led British column The British government made the Royal Proclamation of 1763 after the war which said that white people could not live past the Appalachian Mountains but this proclamation was largely ignored by the settlers and the Iroquois agreed to move this line again at the Treaty of Fort Stanwix in 1768 where they sold the British all their remaining claim to the lands between the Ohio and Tennessee Rivers

During the American Revolution many Tuscarora and the Oneida took the side of the colonists while the Mohawk Seneca Onondaga and Cayuga remained loyal to Great Britain This was the first major split among the Six Nations Joseph Louis Cook offered his services to the United States and received a Congressional commission as a Lieutenant Colonel the highest rank held by any Native American during the war However after a series of successful operations against frontier settlements led by the Mohawk war chief Joseph Brant other war chiefs and British allies the future United States wanted revenge In 1779 George Washington ordered the Sullivan Campaign led by Col Daniel Brodhead and General John Sullivan against the Iroquois nations to not merely overrun but destroy the British Indian alliance

After the war the ancient central fireplace of the League was made again at Buffalo Creek Captain Joseph Brant and a group of Iroquois left New York to settle in Canada As a reward for their loyalty to the British Crown they were given a large land grant on the Grand River in Ontario 

Traditionally the Iroquois were a mix of farmers fishers gatherers and hunters although most of their food came from farming The main crops they farmed were corn beans and squash which were called the three sisters and were considered special gifts from the Creator These crops are grown strategically The food was stored during the winter and it lasted for two to three years When the soil eventually became less fertile the Iroquois moved

Gathering was the job of the women and children Wild roots greens berries and nuts were gathered in the summer During spring maple syrup was tapped from the trees and herbs were gathered for medicine

The Iroquois hunted mostly deer but also other game such as wild turkey and migratory birds Muskrat and beaver were hunted during the winter Fishing was also a big source of food because the Iroquois lived near a large river They fished salmon trout bass perch and whitefish In the spring the Iroquois netted and in the winter fishing holes were made in the ice

When Americans and Canadians of European descent began to study Iroquois customs in the 18th and 19th centuries they found that women assumed a position in Iroquois society that was about equal in power to that of the men Women could own property including homes horses and farmed land and when they married they could keep their property without it being given to their husbands A woman could keep the money she earned for herself A husband lived in the longhouse of his wifes family A woman choosing to divorce a husband who was not being a good husband was able to ask him to leave the dwelling taking any of his possessions with him Women had responsibility for the children of the marriage and children were educated by members of the mothers family The clans were matrilineal which means that clan ties were traced through the mothers line If a couple broke up the woman kept the children

The chief of a clan could be removed at any time by a council of the mothers of that clan The chiefs sister was responsible for nominating the next chief

Important festivals were at the same time as the major events of the agricultural calendar including a harvest festival of thanksgiving The Great Peacemaker was their prophet After the the Europeans arrived many Iroquois became Christians among them Kateri Tekakwitha a young woman of Mohawk Algonkin parents Traditional Iroquois religious beliefs became somewhat more popular again in the second half of the 18th century by the teachings of the Iroquois prophet Handsome Lake

The first five nations listed below formed the original Five Nations the Tuscarora became the sixth nation in 1720 

Within each of the six nations people are divided into a number of matrilineal clans The number of clans varies by nation currently from three to eight with a total of nine different clan names

Population history It is difficult to figure out exactly how many Iroquois there are today About 45000 Iroquois lived in Canada in 1995 In the 2000 census 80822 people in the United States said they were Iroquois with 45217 of them claiming only an Iroquois background There were about 30000 tribal registrations among the Six Nations in the United States in 1995

The Grand Council of the Iroquois League is an assembly of 50 Hoyenah or Sachems a number that has never changed Today the seats on the Council are distributed among the Six Nations as follows

When anthropologist Lewis Henry Morgan studied the Grand Council in the 19th century he thought it was a central government This interpretation became influential but some scholars have since argued that while the Grand Council served an important ceremonial role it was not a government in the way that Morgan thought According to this view Iroquois political and diplomatic decisions are made on the local level and are based on what the local communities think A central government that makes policy and puts it into practice for the people at large is not how the Iroquois handle government

In 1855 Minnie Myrtle saw that no Iroquois treaty came into effect unless it was approved by 75 of the male voters and 75 of the mothers of the nation The women held real power particularly the power to veto treaties or declarations of war 

Councils of the mothers of each tribe were held separately from the mens councils The women used men as runners to send word of their decisions or a woman could appear at the mens council to speak presenting the view of the women Women often were the ones who suggested new laws

Mathematics has shown that any object can be reassembled into any other object For example a sphere can be split up into multiple parts which can then be put back together again to make two identical copies of the original sphere

The reason this seems to be a paradox is because no stretching or bending of the parts takes place and no new material is added yet by the end the volume can be doubled This goes against our geometric intuition However it is mathematically possible and it just turns out that our intuition about nonmeasurable sets is not correct

Reproductive isolation refers to the situation where different species may live in the same area but properties of individuals prevent them from interbreeding 

The things which stop species or groups of organisms reproducing sexually are called isolating mechanisms

Members of one species do not in general mate with members of another species though there are many exceptions and variations to this And if such mating does take place the offspring may not develop or may not be fertile 

If species arise by the splitting of ancestral species it might be asked what stops the new species continuing to reproduce together If they did they would again become one species

The answer given by Dobzhansky and Ernst Mayr was that species split mainly because they lived in different areas and over time they developed featues which made crossing not work properly 

The idea of the biological species concept was that a species was defined as a group of interbreeding individuals They would be a natural population which is reproductively isolated from other such groups284 

A list was drawn up of isolating mechanisms 

Factors which cause individuals to mate with their own species 

Incompatibility of the two genomes stops normal development in the hybrid

There is still much debate as to whether the DobzhanskyMayr account is satisfactory Modern researchers tends to avoid the general term isolating mechanisms in favour of the more specific terms mate choice hybrid incompatibility and other forms of reproductive isolation

Heterozygote advantage is the situation where at a gene locus the heterozygote has greater fitness than either homozygotep205 It is a type of balancing selection

Hb gene for normal haemoglobin molecules Hbs mutant gene Three genotypes are possible in a population HbHb producing a normal phenotype HbHbs the heterozygote and HbsHbs homozygous for sickle cell anaemia

The fitness of these three genotypes varies according to the environment In the temperate zone the normal homozygotes and the heterozygotes will leave most offspring This is because the homozygote for sickle cell has less chance of suriving to leave children and if they do survive they will have many health problems

In a tropical climate such as equatorial Africa malaria is a big killer There the heterozygote has the advantage in fitness They do not get malaria so badly and they do not suffer the earlier deaths of the homozygote sickle cell sufferers

Not surprisingly the Hbs gene is present in about a quarter of Africans from the countries near the equator In Europeans it is a rare gene 

Heterozygote advantage is probably the main cause of polymorphism in biological species Polymorphism alternate genetic types in a population is extremely common The fitness of the heterozygotes keeps a wide range of alternate gene alleles in a population This in turn gives the population a wide range of genetic resources and this gives a better chance of survival

Circuito de Jerez is a Spanish race track near Jerez de la Frontiera It opened on December 8 1985 and started holding motorcycling events and the Spanish Grand Prix in Formula One The race was held in Jerez until 1990 since the circuit was in a remote area and the Spanish Grand Prix was moved to Circuit de Catalunya in 1991

The economy of the USA grew quickly in the 1920s for five main reasons This growth in the 1920s greatly affected the USA throughout the 20th century and today as the world superpower

The USA had very many natural resources for example oil in Texas coal in the Appalachian Mountains and ranching in the Midwest and Great Plains and so there was no need to buy natural resources from other countries The population of the USA was growing very fast and this made a very big market for natural resources inside the USA which grew quickly

Below is a table in which the population growth in millions is shown in the 40 years before the 1920s

Below is a table which shows the urban growth in the six largest cities by population in 1870 and 1910

During the First World War the USA was selling lots of food to Britain and France and also weapons The USA made a lot of money from this Also the USA took over Europes international trade and became the word leader in chemical manufacturing explosives manufacturing and plastics manufacturing along with others This was very good for the US economy

The Republican Party at the time had policies which were very useful for a large economic growth

1 The Republicans had a laissez faire way of thinking which meant that the government would not stand in the way of peoples lives and businesses The Republican Party believed that this would create much profit and it did

2 The Republicans made tariffs which meant that it was cost a lot of money to buy products from other countries This protected American businessmen from foreign competition This also made the American people buy American made products

3 The Republicans lowered taxes which was good for normal people and even better rich people The Republican Party believed that low taxes would make people keep their money and spend it on American made products and put money into American industries

4 The Republicans allowed trusts Trusts were very large corporations or businesses which controlled almost all of a certain industry Many people did not like these trusts as they did not want one corporation to control an entire industry but the Republican Party said that a corporation would do business better than a politician These trusts were very important in causing this economic growth

There were also problems with the policies During the 1920s much of the wealth in the United States was controlled by only a few people Also farmers and other people who worked in the business of farming found it very difficult to make money and were therefore very poor

The fact that there were new industries created new ways of managing industries For example new products such as telephones radios vacuum cleaners washing machines and others were being made on a large scale but at a cheaper price Very good advertising was also created for many products and could be seen very often The largest new industry in the 1920s was the motorcar industry which had been made entirely different by Henry Ford By the year 1929 48 million cars had been made

At the time most Americans believed that they deserved success For example a nice house a good job plenty to eat and many consumer goods The act of consuming was seen as very American and this belief that spending and consuming was American greatly power the economic growth

Raymond Arthur Dart was an Australian anatomist and anthropologist who worked for much of his life in South Africa

In 1924 he discovered the first fossil of an Australopithecine at Taung in Northwestern South Africa It was Australopithecus africanus an extinct hominid closely related to humans This was a great event in the study of human evolution

Dart was born in Brisbane Queensland Australia the son of a farmer and tradesman He studied at the University of Queensland the University of Sydney and University College London before taking a position as head of the newly established department of anatomy at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg South Africa in 1922

In 1924 Dart discovered the first fossil ever found of Australopithecus africanus an extinct hominid closely related to humans at Taung in Northwestern South Africa 

However because he was an Australian and not a part of the scientific establishment and because he found the fossil in Africa and not Europe or Asia where the establishment looked to for mans origins his findings were initially dismissed

Darts closest ally was Robert Broom whose discoveries of further Australopithecines eventually vindicated Dart So much so that in 1947 Sir Arthur Keith said Dart was right and I was wrong

From 1903 to 1910 he was Professor of Zoology and Geology at Victoria College Stellenbosch South Africa and subsequently he became keeper of vertebrate paleontology at the South African Museum Cape Town

Broom was first known for his study of mammal like reptiles After Raymond Darts discovery of the Taung Child an infant australopithecine Brooms interest in paleoanthropology was heightened Brooms career seemed over and he was sinking into poverty when Dart wrote to Jan Smuts about the situation Smuts exerting pressure on the South African government managed to obtain a position for Broom in 1934 with the staff of the Transvaal Museum in Pretoria as an Assistant in Palaeontology

In the following years he and John T Robinson made a series of spectacular finds including fragments from six hominids in Sterkfontein which they named Plesianthropus transvaalensis but which was later classified as an adult Australopithecus africanus as well as more discoveries at sites in Kromdraai and Swartkrans 

In 1937 Broom made his most famous discovery of Paranthropus robustus These discoveries helped support Darts claims for the Taung species 

The remainder of Brooms career was devoted to the exploration of these sites and the interpretation of the many early hominid remains discovered there For his volume The South Africa fossil ape men the Australopithecinae in which he proposed the Australopithecinae subfamily Broom was awarded the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the National Academy of Sciences in 1946 He continued to write to the very last Shortly before his death he finished a monograph on the Australopithecines and remarked to his nephew

Elliot tries to lead Boog out of the forest but it becomes evident that he has no clue where they are going because Boog realizes they meet the same animals again and again After winding up at Reillys dam Boog and Elliot are confronted by Shaw Boog tries to run over the dam but its not a load bearing structure It breaks under his weight and the rush of water washes everyone in the forest including Shaw to the clearing below the falls

At first everyone blames Boog but Boog accuses Elliot of lying to him about leading him home Elliot confesses saying he wanted Boog as a friend and thought if they just spent time together it would work out Angry Boog leaves attempting to find Timberline on his own He unwittingly find Shaws log cabin Shaw discovers him and pursues him Boog flees to the city road where Boog finds a group of trucks with hunters in them zooming past him and he soon finds the glowing lights of Timberline  Instead of deserting his companions Boog decides to take Elliot with him but the other animals want to live in the garage too but they realize there is no way out because the hunters have already gathered around the forest Boog decides that they should defend themselves and they collect supplies from Bob and Bobbys RV while their pet dachshund Mr Weenie joins the animals

The following day Boog witnesses the hunters coming and sends a signal to the animals by flinging one of the mule deers of the herd in the air Elliot receives the signal and sends out the ducks who are carrying skunks into the air causing stinky green air to flow around the forest Meanwhile Elliot and the squirrels ride on the mule deers and charge On the other side Boog and the other animals charge too causing a big rampage The ducks drop a tank of gas onto one of the hunters trucks but it goes out so McSquizzy flings some dynamite into the air and all the trucks blow up and the hunters all run away All the animals start celebrating Suddenly Shaw appears and attempts to kill Boog with his gun but Elliot shoots things that they had stolen from the RV One of the objects hits the gun and the gun falls out of reach Shaw then proceeds to attack Boog with his hunting knife Boog beats him with a golf club Elliot had shot Shaw within reaching distance of his gun grabs it and attempts to shoot Boog Elliot takes the bullet meant for Boog enraging Boog who tackles Shaw roars loudly in his face then ties him up with his own gun Boog finds that Elliot survived the wound only losing his second antler in the fight Beth returns to take Boog back home where he will be safe but he instead stays with his friends They both realize that the bear is at home in the forest

The idea for the film came from cartoonist Steve Moore known for his comic strip In the Bleachers Moore and producer John Carls submitted the story to Sony in June 2002 and the movie immediately went into development On February 29 2004 Sony Pictures Animation announced the beginning of the production on its first CGI animated feature Open Season

The film location was inspired by the towns of Sun Valley Idaho and McCall Idaho and the Sawtooth National Forest References to the Lawn Lake Colorado Dam flood Longs Peak and other points of interest in the area are depicted in the filmCitation neededdateJuly 2011

The Sony animation team developed a digital tool called shapers that allowed the animators to re shape the character models into stronger poses and silhouettes and subtle distortions such as squash stretch and smears typical of traditional hand drawn animation 

Martin Lawrence and Ashton Kutcher the voices of Boog and Elliot never met during production

Open Season received mixed reviews from critics Critics of Rotten Tomatoes gave the film 48 with the consensus Open Season is a cliched palette of tired jokes and CG animal shenanigans that have been seen multiple times this cinematic year

Kevin Smith gave the film a good review during an appearance as a guest critic on At the Movies with Ebert and Roeper saying If your kids like poop jokes as much as I do Open Season will put a big smile on their faces However Richard Roeper gave the film a mixed review saying Its just okay the animation is uninspired

The film opened 1 with 23 million on its opening weekend It grossed 851 million in the United States and 1048 million in foreign countries making 1899 million worldwide

Rolling Stone gave the movies soundtrack three stars out of five as did Allmusic

Open Season was released on DVD Blu ray and UMD Video on January 30 2007 It was later released on 3D Blu ray on November 16 2010

A video game based on the movie was released on many platforms in 20062007

The film was given two direct to video sequels Open Season 2 Open Season 3 and the soon to be released Open Season 4

Meave G Leakey is a renowned contemporary paleontologist She studies the origin of mankind in West Africa She is married to Richard Leakey the son of Louis and Mary Leakey

They have two children Louise and Samira Her daughter Louise Leakey continues the family business by conducting paleontological research

Dr Leakeys research team at Lake Turkana Kenya made a discovery in 1999 that completely changed our understanding of early human ancestry They found a 35 million year old skull and partial jaw thought to belong to a new branch of our early human family She named the find Kenyanthropus platyops or flat faced man of Kenya

Lake Turkana formerly known as Lake Rudolf is a lake in the Great Rift Valley in Kenya Its far northern end crosses into Ethiopia 

It is the worlds largest permanent desert lake and the worlds largest alkaline lake By volume it is the worlds fourth largest salt lake after the Caspian Sea Issyk Kul Lake and the Aral Sea Among all lakes it ranks 24th

The water is drinkable but not palatable It supports a rich lacustrine wildlife The climate is hot and very dry 

The rocks of the surrounding area are predominantly volcanic Central Island is an active volcano emitting vapors Outcrops and rocky shores are found on the East and South shores of the lake while dunes spits and flats are on the West and North at a lower elevation

On shore and off shore winds can be extremely strong as the lake warms and cools more slowly than the land Sudden violent storms are frequent Three rivers flow into the lake but lacking outflow its only water loss is by evaporation Lake volume and dimensions are variable For example its level fell by 10 meters between 1975 and 1993

Due to temperature aridity and geographic inaccessibility the lake retains its wild character Nile crocodiles are found in great abundance on the flats The rocky shores are home to scorpions and carpet vipers Although the lake and its environs have been popular for expeditions of every sort under the tutelage of guides rangers and experienced persons they certainly must be considered hazardous for unguided tourists

Lake Turkana National Parks are now listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site Sibiloi National Park lies on the lakes eastern shore while Central Island National Park and South Island National Park lie in the lake Both are known for their crocodiles

The Lake Turkana area is regarded by many anthropologists as the cradle of humankind due to the abundance of hominid fossils

Louis Leakey was a Kenyan archaeologist anthropologist and naturalist 

His work was important in establishing human evolutionary development in East Africa He also played a major role in creating organizations for future research in Africa and for protecting wildlife there 

Leakey was the third of the three great anthropologists of British origin who made Africa their home the others were Robert Broom and Raymond Dart 

He started a tradition of palaeoanthropological inquiry in Kenya His own family carried on the family firm Several of them became well known anthropologists and fossil hunters 

Louis took part in national events of British East Africa and then Kenya at critical times

In biology he asserted Charles Darwins theory of evolution unswervingly and set about to prove Darwins hypothesis that man arose in Africa He was also a devout Christianchapter 3 

Louis and Mary spent all the time they could at Olduvai Gorge starting in 1951 So far they had discovered only stone tools A more extensive excavation came in 1952 They found what Louis termed an Oldowan slaughter house an ancient bog where animals had been trapped and butchered Louis was so carried away that he worked without his hat and his hair was bleached white from the sun They stopped in 1953

In 1955 they excavated again with Jean Brown She related that he preferred to be called Louis was absent minded once had everyone looking for spectacles that were around his neck wore pants with the buttons off and shoes with holes in them charged about everywhere and once collapsed unconscious He was completely happychapter 12

In 1959 they decided to excavate Bed I While Louis was sick in camp Mary discovered the fossilized skull OH 5 which Mary called Our Man and became Dear Boy and Zinj The question was whether it was a previous genus discovered by Robert Broom Paranthropus which Broom had taken not to be in the human line or a different one in it Louis opted for Zinj a decision opposed by Wilfrid Le Gros Clark but one which attracted the attention of Melville Bell Grosvenor president of the National Geographic Society That contact resulted in an article in National Geographic and a hefty grant to continue work at Olduvai

Zinj was far older than anyone had imagined Scientists swarmed to Africa Louis had proved Darwin rightchapter 13

In 1960 unable to leave the museum except on weekends Louis appointed Mary director of excavation at Olduvai She brought in a staff of Kamba tribesmen instead of Kikuyu who she felt took advantage of Louis The first Muteva Musomba had kept her childrens ponies He recruited Kamoya Kimeu among others Mary set up Camp 5 under Jonathans direction He was 19 From then on she had her own staff and associates

Mary picked and sieved at the site from early morning dressed in old clothes chain smoking cigarettes always surrounded by her Dalmatian She and Louis communicated by radio On weekends he drove non stop at high speed the 357 miles between Olduvai and Nairobi The teen age boys Richard and Philip were on site holidays and vacations 

Their home in Nairobi was a circus figuratively speaking when they were there Dinner guests were frequent Important guests stayed for weeks if they could stand it They shared the quarters and the dinner table with the Dalmatians hyraxes a monkey a civet cat an African eagle owl tropical fish snakes such as vipers and a python 

The extended families of twenty African staff lived in cinderblock huts in the yard Mary had switched to cigars and the ashes often fell into the food Both Louis and Mary cooked Louis never stopped talking his stories were endless He literally ran through the day making long lists of things to be done which he never completed He drove recklessly through the streets of Nairobi often reading and writing as he drovechapter 5 

There was another side to the Leakey family Louis was a notorious womanizer He was faithful neither to Frida nor to Mary Mary tolerated this behavior well until his relationship with Rosalie Osborn 195455 threatened to break up her marriagechapter 17 

The two fought constantly upsetting the boys After Richard nearly died in a fall from a horse Louis broke with Rosalie for the sake of the boys

Jonathan achieved some brief fame before he quit palaeoanthropology altogether He started his own site Jonnys site in the Leakey lingo FLK NN There he discovered two skull fragments without the Australopithecine sagittal crest which Mary connected with Brooms and Robinsons Telanthropus The problem was its contemporaneity with Zinj Mailed photographs Le Gros Clark retorted casually Shades of Piltdown Louis cabled him immediately and had some strong words at this suggestion of his incompetence Clark apologizedchapter 14

In 1960 Louis his son Philip and Ray Pickering discovered a fossil he termed Chellean Man as it was in context with Oldowan tools the first such find After reconstruction Louis and Mary called it Pinhead It was subsequently included with Homo erectus and was in fact contemporaneous with Paranthropus which on that account cannot have been in the human line For many years Louis believed erectus was the user of the tools and Australopithecus was not

In 1961 Louis got a salary as well as a grant from National Geographic and turned over the acting directorship of Coryndon to a subordinate He created the Centre for Prehistory and Paleontology on the same grounds moved his collections to it and appointed himself director This was his new operations center 

He opened another excavation at Fort Ternan on Lake Victoria Shortly after Heselon discovered Kenyapithecus wickeri the species name from the owner of the property which Louis promptly celebrated with George Gaylord Simpson who happened to be present aboard the Miocene Lady with Leakey Safari Specials a drink made of condensed milk and cognac

In 1962 Louis was visiting Olduvai when Ndibo Mbuika discovered the first tooth of Homo habilis at MNK Louis and Mary thought it was female and named her Cinderella or Cindy Phillip Tobias identified Jonnys Child with it and Raymond Dart came up with the name Homo habilis at Louis request which Tobias translated as handymanchapter 16 It was seen as intermediary between gracile Australopithecus and Homochapter 16

One of Louiss greatest legacies was fostering field research of primates in their natural habitats He understood this helped to unravel the mysteries of human evolution He chose three female researchers Jane Goodall Dian Fossey and Birute Galdikas They were dubbed Leakeys Angels Each went on to become an important scholar in the field of primatology

For the below use the same rules as above using the definitions below

The Olduvai Gorge is a steep sided ravine in the Great Rift Valley that stretches through East Africa It is in the eastern Serengeti Plains in northern Tanzania

The Gorge is about convert48kmmiabbron long It is 45 km from the Laetoli archaeological site The gorge is an important prehistoric site sometimes called the Cradle of Mankind

The name is a misspelling of Oldupai Gorge which was adopted as the official name in 2005 Oldupai is the Maasai word for the wild sisal plant Sansevieria ehrenbergii which grows in the gorge

Millions of years ago the site was that of a large lake the shores of which were covered with successive deposits of volcanic ash 

About 500000 years ago seismic activity diverted a nearby stream which began to cut down into the sediments revealing seven main layers in the walls of the gorge The geology of Olduvai Gorge and the surrounding region was studied in detail by Richard L Hay who worked at the site between 1961 and 2002

The stratigraphy is extremely deep and layers of volcanic ash and stones allow radiometric dating of the embedded artifacts mostly through potassiumargon dating and argonargon dating The base of the Olduvai sediments dates to slightly older than 2 million years

The nearby site Laetoli has a much older fossil record

Olduvai Gorge is one of the most important prehistoric sites in the world and has been instrumental in furthering understanding of early human evolution Chasing a fancy butterfly in the green wilds of Tanganyika 50 years ago a German entomologist named Kattwinkel tumbled off a rocky ledge and nearly killed himself When he regained his senses he found himself in an anthropologists dream world an erosion created rift with layer after layer of fossils bones and ancient artifacts The find was named Olduvai Gorge and Kattwinkels heirs ever since have been scrambling up and down its sun baked sides in search of clues to mans earliest awakening 

Excavation work there was pioneered by Louis and Mary Leakey beginning in 1931 It is still going on

The earliest archaeological deposit known as Bed I has produced evidence of campsites and living floors along with stone tools made of flakes from local basalt and quartz Since this is the site where these kinds of tools were first discovered these tools are called Oldowan It is now thought that the Oldowan toolmaking tradition started about 26 million years ago Bones from this layer are not of modern humans but earlier hominid forms of Paranthropus boisei and the first discovered specimens of Homo habilis

The site of FLK North has the oldest known evidence of Elephant consumption attributed to Homo ergaster around 18 million years ago A nearly complete skeleton of the extinct Elephas recki was found in the lowest of its six occupation levels along with stone tools such as choppers and flakes Large numbers of bone fragments of smaller animals found with it clearly identify FLK North as an early butchering site

Above this in Bed II pebble tools begin to be replaced by more sophisticated handaxes of the Acheulean industry and made by H ergaster This layer has not yet been successfully dated but likely falls between 175 and 12 million years

Beds III and IV have produced Acheulean tools and fossil bones from more than 600000 years ago

During a period of major faulting and volcanism roughly 600000 to 400000 years ago the Masek Beds were made These beds contained tools from an industry made by modern humans followed by the Ndutu Beds and the Naisiusiu Beds

Also on the rim of the Gorge is the Olduvai Gorge Museum This Museum presents exhibitions pertaining to the Gorges history

Richard Leakey is a politician paleoanthropologist and conservationist He is second of the three sons of the anthropologists Louis Leakey and Mary Leakey

A high school dropout Leakey discovered his love of paleontology when he led an expedition to a fossil site he had discovered while flying Frustrated by the lack of recognition he received for his accomplishments Leakey left for England to catch up on his education However after six months Leakey returned home to continue his safaris He never completed his degree

In 1965 he married Margaret Cropper Their daughter Anna was born in 1969 the same year that Richard and Margaret divorced He then married his colleague Meave Epps in 1970 and they had two daughters Louise and Samira

Leakey was diagnosed with a terminal kidney disease in 1969 Ten years later he became seriously ill but received a kidney transplant from his brother Philip and recovered to full health

In 1993 a small propeller driven plane piloted by Richard Leakey crashed crushing his lower legs Both legs were later amputated Sabotage was suspected but never proved In a few months Richard Leakey was walking again on artificial limbs 

Leakey said in his autobiography that he is an atheist

Richard chose to support himself borrowed 500 pounds from his parents for a Land Rover and went into the trapping and skeleton supply business with Kamoya Kimeu 

Richard was already a skilled horseman outdoorsman Land Rover mechanic archaeologist and expedition leader he learned to identify bones All these skills pointed to a path he did not yet wish to take simply because his father was on it

Hi its been a year since we last spoke formally on here in that time I have aged a year and gotten more mature and learned from other mistakes While I still have political opinions I have learned its not right to shove them where they are not wanted There are appropriate forums for that Wikipedia is not one of them I have come to understand that this Wiki is NPOV and I must write within those rules If you approve my unban I will be a good worker and remain neutral I hope to do a quick run though of wrestling and baseball articles as they are not up to date no one really tended to these articles but myself While I would really enjoy once again being apart of this community it wont be in same way as before I have other interests besides Wikipedia as well Dont misunderstand me though I will still contribute just not obsessively I truly am sorry for all my shenanigans before but to learn you must make mistakes I have only one request that I hope comes true regardless of the outcome of this ban review dont judge me until you know me So in closing I hope you will invite me to be apart of your community again Thank you and God Bless   CR90 0016 16 March 2011

There is dispute about the closure of WikipediaRequests for deletionRequests2011List of ThunderClan characters on the RFDs talk page I nominated this article for deletion and there was debate over whether or not the subject is notableimportant enough for Simple Wikipedia In the middle of debate UserIanP userfied the article Because of this UserSEPTActaMTA8235 made a non admin closure saying The outcome of this request for deletion was to Symbol keep votesvg Keep Page userfied to UserIanPList of ThunderClan characters 

I and others have multiple problems with this action For one SEPTActaMTA8235 had already commented in the discussion so he should not be closing the RFD Secondly non admin closures should only be reserved for unanimous keep closures after the RFD has run its full course And finally this article likely would have not survived the RFD based on the forming consensus IanPs userfication of the article would make it violate the user page guidelines which say this space is not meant to keep your version of disputed or previously deleted content forever 

I would like for other admins to review this decision The article has been deleted from the article space now but I think that the way it exists now violates our user page policy and that the decision carried out was made to go around the potential deletion Either way 1003 6 April 2011

Nuclear espionage is sharing a countrys secrets about nuclear weapons to other countries without permission Since nuclear weapons have been invented there have been many cases of known nuclear espionage and also many cases where it has thought to have happened but has not been proven Because nuclear weapons are usually considered the most important of state secrets all nations with nuclear weapons have strict rules against sharing information about how nuclear weapons are designed where they are kept and other things about them There are also rules that keep countries who have signed non proliferation agreements from sharing information about such weapons with the public

During the Manhattan Project which was when the United States the United Kingdom and Canada worked together during World War II to make the first nuclear weapons there was much nuclear espionage in which scientists or technicians working for the project sent information about bomb development and designs to the Soviet Union These people are often called the Atomic Spies and their work continued into the early Cold War There has been much disagreement over the exact details of these cases though some of this was settled when VENONA Project transcripts were made public These were secret messages between Soviet agents and the Soviet government that were discovered and decoded Some issues remain unsettled however

Some of the most well known of these were 

The Soviet Union tested its first atomic bomb in 1949 There is disagreement over whether this spying helped the Soviet Union make an atomic bomb faster While some of the information given such as information given by Klaus Fuchs could probably have been very helpful the way the people in charge of the Soviet bomb project actually used the information has led later scholars to think it did not actually speed up the Soviet Unions process of making bombs much According to this account the information was mostly used as a check against the Soviet Unions own scientists work and little of it was actually shared with the Soviet scientists because neither their scientists nor spies were trusted much Later scholarship has also shown that the biggest problem with the Soviets early development was not problems designing the weapons but rather problems getting the materials

In 1986 Mordechai Vanunu who had worked at a nuclear facility in Israel gave information about Israels nuclear weapons program to the British press People had thought before that Israel had an advanced and secretive nuclear weapons program and collection but now they knew for sure Israel has never said that it does or does not have a nuclear weapons program and Vanunu was kidnapped and smuggled to Israel where he was convicted of treason and espionage

Whether Vanunu was technically involved in espionage is debated Vanunu and his supporters say that he should be called as a whistle blower while his opponents think that he is a traitor and that what he did helped enemies of Israel After Vanunu left Israel he did not give his information right away He travelled for about a year before doing so

In a 1999 report of the United States House of Representatives Select Committee on US National Security and MilitaryCommercial Concerns with the Peoples Republic of China chaired by Rep Christopher Cox it was revealed that US security agencies thought there was nuclear espionage going on by the Peoples Republic of China at Americans nuclear weapons design laboratories The report said that China had stolen classified information on all of the United States most advanced thermonuclear warheads since the 1970s including the design of advanced warheads the neutron bomb and weapons codes which allow for computer simulations of nuclear testing The United States apparently did not know of this until 1995 

The investigations described in the report eventually led to the arrest of Wen Ho Lee a scientist at Los Alamos who was at first accused of giving weapons information to China The case against Lee eventually fell apart however and he was eventually charged only with mishandling of data Other people and groups arrested or fined were scientist Peter Lee who was arrested for allegedly giving submarine radar secrets to China and Loral Space Communications and Hughes Electronics who gave China missile secrets No other arrests from the theft of the nuclear designs have been made 

In January 2004 Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan a Pakistani nuclear scientist admitted selling restricted nuclear weapons technology to Libya Iran and North Korea According to his testimony and reports from intelligence agencies Khan sold designs for centrifuges used to enrich uranium and Chinese designs for a nuclear warhead and sold centrifuges themselves to these three countries Khan had previously been said to have taken gas centrifuge designs from a uranium enrichment company in the Netherlands which he used to help Pakistans own nuclear weapons program get started On February 5 2004 the president of Pakistan General Pervez Musharraf said that he had pardoned Khan Pakistans government says that they had no part in the espionage but refuses to turn Khan over for questioning by the International Atomic Energy Agency

Anna Pavlova was a Russian and later English ballerina of the early 20th century 

She is widely regarded as one of the finest classical ballet dancers in history and was most noted as a principal artist of the Imperial Russian Ballet and the Ballets Russes of Serge Diaghilev 

Pavlova is most recognised for the creation of the rle The Dying Swan and with her own company would become the first ballerina to tour ballet around the world

The young Pavlovas years of training were difficult as classical ballet did not come easily to her Her severely arched feet thin ankles and long limbs clashed with the small and compact body in favor for the ballerina at the time Her fellow students taunted her with such nicknames as The broom and La petite sauvage Undeterred Pavlova trained to improve her technique She took extra lessons from the noted teachers of the day She was never a perfect technician but had delicacy lightness and grace

She became prima ballerina of the Imperial Ballet in 1906 She worked briefly for Diaghilev but would not dance in the new avant garde ballets which were being created such as The Firebird The role was given to the equally good Tamara Karsavina who became their regular prima ballerina

Pavlova lived in London for many years from 1912 until her death in 1931 After leaving Russia Pavlova settled in Ivy House on North End Road near Hampstead where she lived for the rest of her life While in London Pavlova was influential in the development of British ballet most notably inspiring the career of Alicia Markova 

The house had an ornamental lake where she would feed her pet swans and where there is a statue of the ballerina by the Scots sculptor George Henry Paulin It is now the London Jewish Cultural Centre but a blue plaque marks it as Pavlovas previous home and a site of significant historical interest

She toured Australia and New Zealand in the 1920s This was probably how the sticky Australian cake became known as the Pavlova

The Williams bon chretien pear commonly called the Williams pear or Bartlett pear in the US and Canada is the most commonly grown variety of pear in most countries outside Asia 

It is a summer pear not as tolerant of cold as some varieties It is often eaten raw but holds its shape well when baked and is a common choice for canned or other processed pear uses

The Williams pear is thought to date from 1765 to 1770 from the yard of an Aldermaston England schoolmaster named Mr Stair or Mr Wheeler giving rise to the now obscure names Aldermaston pear and Stairs pear A nurseryman named Williams later acquired the variety and introducing it to the rest of England which is why the pear became known as the Williams Pear However the pears full name is Williams Bon Chretien or Williams good Christian 

In 1799 James Carter imported several Williams trees into the United States and they were planted on the grounds of Thomas Brewer in Roxbury Massachusetts The Massachusetts estate was later acquired by Enoch Bartlett of Dorchester Massachusetts Unaware of their origin Bartlett named the pears after himself and introduced the variety into the United States It was not realized that Bartlett and Williams Pears were the same until 1828 when new trees arrived from Europe  By that time the Bartlett variety had become vastly popular in the United States and they are still generally known as Bartlett pears in the US and Canada although there are about 150 other names worldwide

Pear trees are typically in production for an average of 50 to 75 years although some trees still produce fruit after 100 years Height 15 20ft with slightly less spread 

Flowers White flowers grouped in a corymb 

Blooming Time April  May 

Fruit Seeds Large golden yellow skin brownish red blush classic shape with smooth white flesh Harvest from mid August to mid September But depends on which side of the earths hemisphere the plant has been placed for harvest time 

Leaves The leaves are simple glossy green leaves that alternate on the twig They grow up to 3 long are thick with slight midrib curves folding the edges inwards They have fine teeth on the margin 

Elevation 1000  5000 Feet 

Habitat Orchards and landscaping

In 1985 the pear represented 80 of US pear production and in 2004 it represented 50 of reported pear production displaced primarily by the continuing growth of dAnjou and Bosc pears both winter pears more tolerant of cold than the Bartlett

While more pears are sold fresh in the US than processed Bartlett pears are the primary choice for canned halves puree and most pear juice and nectar in the US comprising about two thirds of Bartlett production Bartletts are traditionally known as the canning pear due to their definitive flavor and sweetness making them well suited for many forms of processing 

The Williams pear is used in making Poire Williams a colourless brandy

Enoch Bartlett was a farmer from Dorchester Massachusetts 

He bought Thomas Brewers farm in Roxbury This farm had a field of pear trees which he named after himself as he did not know the fruit already had a name

In 1828 a new batch of pear trees arrived from England and it was realised that the Bartlett pear was the same as the Williams pear but by this time the name had stuck and is still the commonest name for this type of pear in Canada and the United States

A Sikh temple or Gurdwara is the name given to the Sikhs place of worship The Sikh scriptures are recited or sung and sermons are delivered Guru Granth Sahib is placed on high palanquin under a canopy in the middle of one end of the hall As well as sermons and the singing of the scriptures the congregation is expected to take part in the ceremonies of birth baptism marriage death and celebration of festivals

The Gurdwara is a place for acquiring a spiritual knowledge and wisdom It is open to every one regardless of age sex caste or creed Here all men women and children are treated as equal It offers shelter and food to any one in need It provides care for the sick elderly and handicapped It is also a centre for promoting culture and health Moral education as well as knowledge of the religion and history is often taught to children in the Sikh temple The Gurdwara is also a place for discussing problems facing the Sikh community Infringement of the Sikh code of discipline may also be considered and suitable punishment decided The Gurdwara plays a socio economic role in the Sikh community It is expected to be free from any sectional interests or party politics

The pattern of congregational worship can be divided into two categories Katha the reading of the holy hymns followed by their explanation and Kirtan the singing of the hymns Attached to every Gurdwara is a free kitchen where the food Langar is prepared and served The community attempts to establish better relations and under standing between the Sikhs and other communities through occasional visits by them to a Gurdwara Such visits are necessary not only to satisfy the curiosity of others but also to help them understand better the Sikh religion customs and culture A Gurdwara can be identified from a distance by observing the Nishan Sahib the Sikh flag The four doors of a Sikh temple represent the Door of Peace the Door of Livelihood the Door of Learning and the Door of Grace These doors must always remain open to all The Sikh temple is a place for training the devotees in the company of pious people The Gurus wanted to build a model human society through an ideal and benevolent world organization

Gurdwara Protocol If one wishes to visit a Gurdwara some protocol must be observed Consumption of tobacco liquor or narcotics is strictly forbidden to Sikhs and definitely not allowed on the Gurdwara premises Before entering the hall people take off their shoes wash their hands covers their head and think of the Guru Non Sikhs too must cover their head with a handkerchief or scarf Upon entering the hall where Guru Granth Sahib is kept they walk slowly bow humbly and touch their forehead to the ground out of respect and love for the Guru As people bow and place their offering respectfully before the Guru it may be money flowers or words of thanks Any sincere expression of gratitude is equally acceptable to the Guru After bowing and offering one should sit down in the Sangat quietly without disturbing others Usually men sit on one side and women on the other in a cross legged position Talking or whispering is not allowed

The usual service in the Gurdwara consists of Kirtan the singing of the holy hymns Katha the reading of the hymns followed by their explanation singing of 6 verses of Anand Sahib Ardas prayer and Vak or Hukam random reading of one hymn from Guru Granth Sahib This is the Gurus message or Order of the day to the Sangat Upon completion of the Hukam Karah Parshad is distributed Then Langar food from the Gurus kitchen is served

Arm wrestling is a sport with two players Each player places one arm either the right or left on a surface with their elbows bent and touching the surface and they grip each others hand The goal is to pin the others arm onto the surface with the winners arm over the losers arm

Many things can play a part in a players success in arm wrestling Skill and overall arm strength are the two greatest contributing things to winning an arm wrestling match Other things such as the length of an arm wrestlers arm hisher muscle and arm massdensity hand grip size wrist endurance and flexibility reaction time as well as countless other traits can add to the advantages of one arm wrestler over another It is sometimes used to prove who is stronger between two or more people

Some people arm wrestle in contests In the United States of America contests are held by the United States Armwrestling Federation also called the USAF The World Armwrestling Federation also called the WAF has more than 85 member countriesCitation neededdateJanuary 2009

Arm wrestling puts enormous pressuretwist on the upper arms humerus bone to a degree seen in few other physical activities Most peoples bones are not used to being so stressed in this way and injuries can occur surprisingly easily The arm typically fails because of a diagonal break at or below the midpoint between the shoulder and the elbow

The natural tendency of an inexperienced arm wrestler is to push the hand wrist and shoulder in the same coordinated direction against the force being applied by the opponent This is how we throw a baseball or hit a tennis ball

However turning ones shoulder this way simply adds to the pressure already being applied to the humerus by the opponent US Arm Sports advises of the danger of letting your shoulder get inside your hand It is better to pivot your shoulders so that you never look away from your hand

If the tendons and ligaments are too weak to support the pressure the muscles can cause a complete tendon blow However tendons can be strengthened with many methods When tendons are in pain they require blood so they can heal faster Doctors and arm wrestlers recommend doing rehabilitation training or therapy exercising with light weights and many repetitions for 30  45 minutes non stop to pump the blood into arms Tendons can get bigger with time though it is a very slow process Experienced arm wrestlers can have tendons 3 to 4 times bigger than average people

Barnaise sauce beanz is a sauce made of clarified butter egg yolks and herbs It is considered to be a child of the mother Hollandaise sauce one of the five mother sauces in French haute cuisine The difference is only in their flavouring Barnaise uses shallot chervil peppercorn and tarragon while Hollandaise uses lemon juice 

In appearance it is light yellow and opaque smooth and creamy 

Barnaise is a traditional sauce for steak

Although a similar recipe was published in 1818 Barnaise sauce was likely first created by the chef Collinet the inventor of puffed potatoes and served at the 1836 opening of Le Pavillon Henri IV a restaurant at Saint Germain en Laye not far from Paris Evidence for this is reinforced by the fact that the restaurant was named for Henry IV of France a gourmet himself who was born in the former province of Barn

 A Barnaise sauce is simply clarified butter an egg yolk a shallot a little tarragon vinegar It takes years of practice for the result to be perfect 

Like Hollandaise sauce there are several methods for the preparation of Barnaise sauce Please refer to the Preparation section of that article for basics Here we highlight the differences

The most common preparation is a Bain marie method where a reduction of vinegar is used to acidify the yolks Escoffier calls for a reduction of wine vinegar shallots fresh chervil fresh tarragon and crushed peppercorns with fresh tarragon and chervil to finish instead of lemon juice Others are similar Alternatively the flavourings may be added to a finished Hollandaise

Barnaise sauce is often wrongly called Bernaise sauce as if it were from Bern the capital city of Switzerland which is in no way connected with this sauce or its origins

Some assume Barnaise refers to the Barn region a former province now in the dpartement of Pyrnes Atlantiques in southwestern Franceto refer to the region of Barn However the sauce has no tradition in the cooking of the area and Larousse has the name honouring Henri IV of France a native of Barn and for whom the restaurant where the sauce was first shown was named Henri IV was often known as le Grand Barnais

Some recipes are called la barnaise even when they are not accompanied by a Barnaise sauce This is because the recipes themselves are linked to the Barn region This added to confusion over the naming of the sauce

A Berliner Pfannkuchen is a type of doughnut from Germany and Central Europe

They are made from sweet yeast dough fried in fat or oil with a marmalade or jam filling and usually icing powdered sugar or conventional sugar on top They are sometimes made with chocolate champagne custard mocha or advocaat filling or with no filling at all The filling is injected with a large syringe after the pastry is fried

The name of the doughnut is different in various areas of Germany While most areas call it a Berliner residents of Berlin Brandenburg and Saxony know them as Pfannkuchen which in the rest of Germany generally means pancakes  pancakes are known there as Eierkuchen In parts of southern and central Germany as well as in much of Austria they are a variety of Krapfen in Hessen they are referred to as Krppel or Kreppel or in Palatinate Fastnachtskchelchen

In South Tirol part of northern Italy the food is called krafen or krapfen In Slovenia it is krof in Croatia krafne in Bosnia and Serbia krofne In Poland they are known as pczki in the Czech Republic as kobliha In Hungary it is called fnk All of these are essentially identical preparations 

In English speaking countries Berliners are usually called doughnuts and are usually filled with jam jelly custard or whipped cream However in South Australia the Kitchener bun is a Berliner cut on the side for the filling of jam and cream In Anglophone North America the most common term for the jam or jelly filled pastry is jelly doughnut The name is somewhat misleading since the jam or jelly used is specially made with less pectin so that it does not set like jams and jellies manufactured for table use but has a consistency comparable to Bavarian cream

The cream or custard filled variety usually also feature chocolate icing and are sometimes called Bavarian cream or Boston cream doughnuts The Boston cream doughnut has been designated the official state doughnut of Massachusetts

In Ontario and the prairie western provinces of Canada as well as parts of the Midwest in the U S such a round jelly or custard filled doughnut is commonly called a Bismarck while a filled bar doughnut is called a Long John and usually contains pastry creme custard or whipped cream but can contain a jelly filling Other Canadian terms include jambuster in Manitoba and Burlington bun in Nova Scotia

Berliners are traditionally eaten to celebrate on New Years Eve as well as the carnival holidays A common German practical joke is to secretly fill some Berliners with mustard instead of jam and serve them together with regular Berliners without telling anyone

In Portugal berliners are slightly bigger than their German counterparts They are known as bolas de Berlim and the filling is always an egg yolk based yellow cream called creme pasteleiro The filling is inserted after a half length cut and is always visible Regular sugar is used to sprinkle it They can be found in almost every pastry shop in the country 

Such versions are also found in Latin America in Chile Uruguay and Argentina where its not only filled with custard but with jam or manjar blanco In Brazil berliners are called sonhos and traditionally filled with yellow cream Some modern variants filled with milk jam or a mix of chocolate and milk jam can be found in Rio de Janeiros bakeries

In Israel a version of the pastry called sufganiyah is traditionally eaten during the holiday of Hanukkah While sufganiyot are usually filled with jam many modern variants exist

Oomycetes form a distinct phylogenetic lineage of fungus like microorganisms 

That means they are not actually fungi although some have filaments as fungi do They are a group of saprophytic and pathogenic single celled protists

The Oomyceta are a class in a huge phylum of eukaryotes called the Heterokontophyta 

They are microscopic organisms which reproduce both sexually and asexually Oomycetes occupy both saprophytic and pathogenic lifestyles and include some of the most notorious pathogens of plants causing devastating diseases such as potato blight and sudden oak death 

They are often referred to as water moulds although the water loving nature which led to that name is not true of most species which are terrestrial pathogens

The tree of life is a metaphor which expresses the idea that all life is related by common descent

Charles Darwin was the first to use this metaphor in modern biology It had been used many times before for other purposes

The evolutionary tree shows the relationships among various biological groups It includes data from DNA RNA and protein analysis 

Tree of life work is a product of traditional comparative anatomy and modern molecular evolution and molecular clock research Below is a simplified version of present day understanding 

Jean Baptiste Lamarck produced the first branching tree of animals in his Philosophie Zoologique It was an upside down tree starting with worms and ending with mammals However Lamarck did not believe in common descent of all life Instead he believed that life consists of separate parallel lines advancing from simple to complex

The American geologist Edward Hitchcock published in 1840 the first tree of life based on paleontology in his Elementary Geology On the vertical axis are paleontological periods Hitchcock made a separate tree for plants and animals The plant and animal trees are not connected at the bottom of the chart Furthermore each tree starts with multiple origins However they were not evolutionary trees because Hitchcock believed that a deity was the agent of change 

The first edition of Robert Chambers Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation was published anonymously in 1844 It contained a tree like diagram in the chapter Hypothesis of the development of the vegetable and animal kingdoms It shows a model of embryological development where fish reptiles and birds represent branches from a path leading to mammals 

In the text this branching tree idea is tentatively applied to the history of life on earth there may be branchingp191

Charles Darwin was the first to produce an evolutionary tree of life He was very cautious about the possibility of reconstructing the history of life In On the Origin of Species Chapter IV he presented an abstract diagram of a theoretical tree of life for species of an unnamed large genus 

In Darwins own words Thus the small differences distinguishing varieties of the same species will steadily tend to increase till they come to equal the greater differences between species of the same genus or even of distinct genera 

This is a branching pattern with no names given to species unlike the more linear tree Ernst Haeckel made years later

In his summary to the section as revised in the 6th edition of 1872 Darwin explains his views on the Tree of Life

The model of a tree is still considered valid for eukaryotic life forms Research into the earliest branches of the eukaryote tree suggests a tree with either four supergroups or two supergroups There does not yet appear to be a consensus in a review article Roger and Simpson conclude that with the current pace of change in our understanding of the eukaryote tree of life we should proceed with caution

Biologists now recognize that the prokaryotes the bacteria and archaea have the ability to transfer genetic information between unrelated organisms through horizontal gene transfer Recombination gene loss duplication and gene creation are a few of the processes by which genes can be transferred within and between bacterial and archaeal species causing variation that is not due to vertical transfer There is emerging evidence of HGT occurring within the prokaryotes at the single and multicell level and the view is now emerging that the tree of life gives an incomplete picture of lifes evolution It was a useful tool in understanding the basic processes of evolution but cannot explain the full complexity of the situation

Theriodonts are a major group of therapsids 

They can be defined in traditional terms as a suborder of Synapsida that lived from the Middle Permian to the Middle Cretaceous 

In cladistic terms they include not only the traditional theriodonts but also their descendants the mammals as well

Theriodonts appeared about 265 million years ago in the Middle Permian Even these early theriodonts were more mammal like than their relatives 

Theriodonts fall into three main groups Gorgonopsia Therocephalia and Cynodontia Early theriodonts may have been warm blooded Early forms were carnivorous but several later groups became herbivorous during the Triassic 

Theriodont jaws were more mammal like than was the case of other therapsids because their dentary was larger which gave them more efficient chewing 

Several other bones that were previously on the lower jaw moved into the ears allowing the theriodonts to hear better and their mouths to open wider This made the theriodonts the most successful group of synapsids 

Eutheriodonts refer to all theriodonts except the gorgonopsians They included the therocephalians cynodonts and their descendants the mammals The name means true beast tooth The eutheriodonts have larger skulls accommodating larger brains and improved jaw muscles 

The theriodonts are one of the two synapsid survivors of the great PermianTriassic extinction event the other being the dicynodonts Therocephalians included both carnivorous and herbivorous forms both died out after the early Triassic 

The remaining theriodonts the cynodonts also included carrnivores such as Cynognathus as well as newly evolved herbivorous Traversodonts While Traversodonts for the most part remained medium sized to reasonably large the carnivorous forms became progressively smaller as the Triassic progressed 

By the Late Triassic the small cynodonts included the rodent like tritylodonts and the tiny shrew like trithelodonts which evolved into the first mammals The trithelodonts died out during the Jurassic and the tritylodonts survived in the Cretaceous but the mammals continued to evolve Many mammal groups managed to survive the CretaceousTertiary extinction event which wiped out the non avian dinosaurs allowing the mammals to diversify and dominate the Earth

Repenomamus is the largest mammal known from the Cretaceous period of Manchuria

There is good evidence that it fed on dinosaurs It is not known whether Repenomamus was a hunter or a scavenger

Repenomamus was carnivorous A specimen of R robustus has been discovered with the fragmentary skeleton of a juvenile Psittacosaurus preserved in its stomach 

This is the strongest evidence that Mesozoic mammals fed on dinosaurs though there were earlier indications of this

The larger species R giganticus is the largest mammal known from the Cretaceous R giganticus was more than 1 metre long and weighed about 1214 kg Its skull measures 16 cm long its body 52 cm and the preserved part of its tail 36 cm 

The fossils were recovered from the lagersttte of the Yixian Formation in the Liaoning Province of China renowned for its extraordinarily well preserved fossils of feathered dinosaurs They have been dated to 130 million years ago during the Lower Cretaceous period

Repenomamus is a genus of triconodonts a group of mammaliaformes with no modern relatives 

Frederick William III was king of Prussia from 1797 to 1840

But Alexander was defeated as well At Tilsit France made peace with Russia and Prussia Napoleon dealt with Prussia very harshly Prussia lost many of its Polish territories as well as all territory west of the Elbe and had to pay for French troops that occupied Prussia

Although Frederick William himself resigned to Prussias fate his ministers set about a reform of Prussias administration and military After Napoleons defeat in Russia Frederick William turned against France and signed an alliance with Russia Prussian troops played a key part in the victories of the allies in 1813 and 1814

At the Congress of Vienna Frederick Williams ministers succeeded in securing important territorial increases for Prussia After the war Frederick William did not keep the promises he had made in 1813 to supply Prussia with a constitution

He died on 7 June 1840 His eldest son Frederick William IV succeeded him

Child labor means that children are forced to work like adults and take part in an economic activity According to the ILO this applies to people up to age fifteen Even though only about a fourth of the ILO members have ratified the respective convention this age limit is generally accepted

Child labor is fundamentally different from casual work done by children like guarding other children or helping here and there Child labour is forbidden in most countries

There are basically two kinds of work minors can do

In general the second kind of work is usually labelled child labour Estimates are that up to 350 million children are affected by child labour 8 million of these are affected by one of the worse forms of child labour they are child soldiers they are forced into prostitution they are used for child pornography they are child slaves or affected by human trafficking

There are many prejudices against child labor in the Western world Very often such cases are known through scandals made by the mass media In that manner a working child is often seen as a slave working in a sweat shop in a third world country producing textiles or as one of the street children in South America The reality is different though Such shops exist all over the world also in countries like the United States or Italy The fact that child labor is involved is often hidden More than three quarters of this work is done in the sector of agriculture or it has to do with activities done at home in the context of the family If child slaves exist they are only a minority This form of work done by children also existed before industrialisation and globalisation the two phenomena have made it more visible at best

The Stratosphere is one of the layers of the atmosphere of the planet Earth It extends from about 8km above the polls to about 50km In the stratosphere the temperature rises with increasing height This effect is caused by a layer of ozone which absorbs some UV radiation form sunlight The absorbed radiation is converted to heat 

The Media access layer is one of the layers of the OSI reference model It is concerned with the access to the physical network medium Devices that access this medium need to be identified For this reason many network technologies amongst them Ethernet use unique addresses to identify the network card which is used to access the medium These addresses are usually called the Media Access Control address or MAC address

Each device is assigned a MAC address by its manufacturer The original Xerox Ethernet addressing scheme still used to assign MAC addresses It allows MAC addresses to be 48 bits long So there are 248 or 281474976710656 possible MAC addresses

Anna Freud was the sixth and last child of Sigmund and Martha Freud 

Born in Vienna she followed the path of her father and contributed to the newly born field of psychoanalysis 

With Melanie Klein she may be considered the founder of psychoanalytic child psychology As her father put it child analysis had received a powerful impetus through the work of Frau Melanie Klein and of my daughter Anna Freud Her work emphasized the importance of the ego and its ability to be trained socially

After a somewhat troubled childhood Anna was psychoanalysed by her father When her analysis was completed in 1922 she became a psychoanalyist herself She taught at the Vienna Psychoanalytic Training Institute on the technique of child analysis From 1925 until 1934 she was the Secretary of the International Psychoanalytical Association She continued child analysis and seminars and conferences on the subject

After the Anschluss in 1938 the Freuds fled Vienna and came to London Freud himself was dying of cancer so Anna ran the household Anna had a professional disagreement with Melanie Klein who had come to London much earlier and was already established as a child psychologist A series of controversial discussions were held by the British Psychoanalytical Society The discussions were about the training and the ideas of both parties Eventually agreement was reached that both schools should co exist inside the Society The Society now has threee training divisions Kleinian Freudian and Independent

During the war Freud studied the effect of deprivation of parental care on children She set up a centre for young war victims called The Hampstead War Nursery Here the children got foster care with mothers encouraged to visit as often as possible

From the 1950s until the end of her life Freud travelled regularly to the United States to lecture teach and visit friends During the 1970s she was concerned with the problems of emotionally deprived and socially disadvantaged children At Yale Law School she taught seminars on crime and the family

The Green River Formation is a 48 million year old Eocene rock formation It records sediment from a group of intermountain lakes Its fine fossils make this a lagersttte a place of exceptional preservation

The sediments are deposited in very fine layers in pairs A dark layer from the growing season and a light hue inorganic layer in winter 

Each pair of layers is called a varve and represents one year The sediments of the Green River Formation present a continuous record of six million years The mean thickness of a varve here is 018 mm with a minimum thickness of 0014 mm and maximum of 98 mm

The sedimentary layers were formed in a large area named after the present day Green River a tributary of the Colorado River The formation is in three separate basins around the Uinta Mountains of northeastern Utah

The formation has many evaporites minerals formed by the evaporation of lakes This suggests that high salinity was one of the causes of the superb fossilisation

Another factor was the frequent ash falls from nearby volcanoes Rapid burial also prevents normal decomposition

Fossils preserved suggest that the region was a low subtropical freshwater basin when the sediments accumulated

The Green River fossils show a transition between the moist early Eocene climate and the slightly drier mid Eocene The climate was moist and mild enough to support crocodiles which do not tolerate frost and the lakes were surrounded by sycamore forests As the lake configurations shifted each Green River location is distinct in character and time The lake system formed over underlying river deltas and shifted in the flat landscape with slight tectonic movements

The Green River Formation contains the largest oil shale deposits in the world The 213 billion tons of oil shale contain an estimated 238 10 m of shale oil This is a tribute to the high volume of organic material that was buried The source of the organic material was probably cyanobacteria which thrive in warm alkaline lake conditions

The lagersttten formed in anoxic conditions in the fine carbonate muds that formed in the lakebeds Lack of oxygen slowed bacterial decomposition and kept scavengers away Leaves of palms ferns and sycamores some showing the insect damage got during their growth were covered with fine grained sediment and preserved Insects were preserved whole even delicate wing membranes and spider spinnerets

The fauna included fish alligators bats turtles dog sized horses insects and many other species of plants and animals

Microvillus is a very tiny hair like membrane in the body The microvillus greatly increase the amount of surface area for a cell In humans the microvilli can give a cell 600 times more surface area They are good for absorbing things and for secreting things They are found in many places in a human body including the ear the tongue the nose and the intestines 

On a tongue the microvilli are the tiny hairs on the taste buds that send signals to the brain These signals are interpreted by the brain and tells the brain what things taste like Over time as a person tastes more and more things the brain stores the information the microvilli send in a databank of information This databank is used to compare new tastes to old tastes and help to classify them by comparing and contrasting their qualities 

In the intestines the microvilli are able to absorb nutrients from the digested food for the body to use

The success of the original series started two revival series one series that ran for several seasons on CBS and in syndication in the 1980s and another series that ran on UPN from 2002 to 2003 It would also lead to a feature film a radio series a comic book a magazine and various other spin offs that would go on for 50 years

The first series contained 156 episodes Seasons 1 2 3 5 were half hour shows The fourth season contained one hour episodes

A bain marie is a piece of equipment used in science industry and cooking to heat materials gently and gradually to fixed temperatures or to keep materials warm over a period of time

The bain marie comes in a wide variety of shapes sizes and types but traditionally is a wide cylindrical usually metal container made of three or four basic parts a handle an outer container that holds the working liquid an inner smaller container that fits inside the outer one and which holds the material to be heated or cooked and sometimes a base underneath Under the outer container of the bain marie is a heat source

Typically the inner container is immersed about halfway into the working liquid

The smaller container filled with the substance to be heated fits inside the outer container filled with the working liquid and the whole is heated at or below the base causing the temperature of the materials in both containers to rise as needed The insulating action of the water helps to keep contents of the inner pot from boiling or scorching

When a bain marie is filled with water the maximum temperature of the material in the lower container will not exceed 100 degrees Celsius Using different working liquids in the lower container will result in different maximum temperatures

A contemporary alternative to the traditional liquid filled bain marie is the electric dry heat bain marie heated by element below both pots The dry heat form of electric bains marie often consumes less energy requires little cleaning and can be heated more quickly than traditional versions They can also operate at higher temperatures and are often much less expensive than their traditional counterparts 

Electric bains marie can also be wet using either hot water or vapor or steam in the heating process The open bath type bain marie heats via a small hot water tub and the vapour type bain marie heats with scalding hot steam

Bains marie were originally developed for use in the practice of alchemy when alchemists needed a way to heat materials slowly and gently In that early form of chemical science it was believed by many that the best way to heat certain materials was to mimic the supposed natural processes occurring in the Earths core by which precious metals were believed to be germinated

The name comes from the medieval Latin term balneum Mariaeliterally Marys bathfrom which the French bain de Marie or bain marie is derived There are many theories as to how the name Marie came to be associated with this equipment

Hundreds of flights to Japan were cancelled due to the earthquake and tsunami affecting many people

As of 8 April 2011 the Japanese National Police Agency has officially confirmed 12915 deaths 4711 injured and 14921 people missing across eighteen prefectures as well as over 125000 buildings damaged or destroyed

Days before the main earthquake there were several foreshocks The biggest one was a 72 MW earthquake on 9 March about convert40kmmi from the main earthquakes location

The United States Geological Survey said the centre of the earthquake was convert373kmmi from Tokyo A 77 aftershock happened 30 minutes following the first quake There have been more than 600 aftershocks bigger than magnitude 45 or more

The earthquake damaged buildings and started fires The Shinkansen high speed bullet trains were stopped and Haneda Airport was closed after the quake Various train services around Japan were also stopped A large fire broke out at an oil refinery in Ichihara Chiba prefecture The quake also caused cars to fall from bridges into the water belowcndateJanuary 2012 The nuclear power plants shut down automatically At first the Japanese Prime Minister said that no radioactive material leaked About 51000 people were moved away from the nuclear reactor at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Station in Fukushima city when its cooling system failed There are fears that the nuclear reactor might meltdown

The earthquake started a tsunami warning for Japans Pacific coast and other countries including New Zealand Australia Russia Guam Philippines Indonesia Papua New Guinea Nauru Hawaii Northern Marianas and Taiwan The tsunami warning issued by Japan was the most serious on its warning scale It warned that the wave could be as much as 10 meters high A 05 meter high wave hit Japans northern coast Kyodo news agency has reported a four metre high tsunami hit the Iwate Prefecture in Japan Miyagi prefecture has been flooded with waves carrying buildings and cars along as they travelled inland In some areas the waves reached 10 km inland

At 928 pm the National Weather Service issued a tsunami warning until 7 am for all of Hawaii Tsunami waves were expected to arrive in Hawaii at 259 am local time A wave two metres high reached California after travelling across the Pacific Ocean at a speed of 500 kilometres per hour A man in California was drowned after being swept into the ocean while trying to take a photograph of the tsunami wave

The Japanese National Police Agency has officially confirmed 14036 deaths 4711 injured and 14921 people missing across eighteen prefectures as well as over 125000 buildings damaged or destroyed

The Fukushima nuclear disaster began on March 11 2011 The connection to the electrical grid was broken All power for cooling was lost and reactors started to overheat There was a partial core meltdown in reactors 1 2 and 3 hydrogen explosions destroyed the upper part of the buildings housing reactors 1 3 and 4 an explosion damaged the containment inside reactor 2 fires broke out at reactor 4 Despite being initially shutdown reactors 5 and 6 began to overheat Spent nuclear fuel rods stored in pools in each reactor building overheated as water levels in the pools dropped The accident is the second biggest nuclear accident after the Chernobyl disaster but more complex as all reactors are involved

There were 44 million households that had their electricity supply cut off including 11 nuclear power plants

The quake moved portions of northeast Japan by as much as convert24mftspus closer to North America making portions of Japans landmass wider than before according to geophysicist Ross Stein Portions of Japan closest to the epicenter experienced the largest shifts

The Pacific plate itself may have moved westwards by up to convert20mftabbronspus Other estimates put the amount of slippage at as much as convert40mftabbronspus covering an area some convert300to400kmmiabbron long by convert100kmmiabbronspus wide If confirmed this would be one of the largest recorded fault movements to have been associated with an earthquake

According to Italys National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology the earthquake shifted the Earths axis by convert25cminspus This deviation led to a number of small planetary changes including the length of a day and the tilt of the Earth The speed of the Earths rotation increased shortening the day by 18 microseconds due to the redistribution of Earths mass

The axial shift was caused by the redistribution of mass on the Earths surface which changed the planets moment of inertia Due to the conservation of angular momentum such changes of inertia result in small changes to the Earths rate of rotation These are expected changes for an earthquake of this magnitude

The Thoku Expressway which serves northern Japan had to be closed due to cracks on the roads The whole railway network was closed but was reopened hours after the earthquake

In response to the great disaster Emperor Akihito directly addressed his subjects in a television broadcast This was the first time any emperor used television in this way

There were other people from other countries helping people after this disaster For example Google set up a people finder service which allowed users to ask for or post information about missing people

Electron transfer chains are the cellular mechanisms used for extracting energy from sunlight in photosynthesis and also from redox reactions such as the oxidation of sugars in cellular respiration

In aerobic respiration each molecule of glucose leads to about 34 molecules of ADP being produced by the ETC This is by far the most productive part of respiration

The electron transport chain consists of a spatially separated series of redox reactions in which electrons are transferred from a donor molecule to an acceptor molecule The underlying force driving these reactions is the free energy of the reactants and products Any reaction that decreases the overall free energy of a system will proceed The transfer of electrons goes from an electron donor to an acceptor

ATP synthase an enzyme found among all domains of life is powered by a transmembrane proton electrochemical gradient which is the result of a series of redox reactions The function of the electron transport chain is to produce this gradient The free energy is used to drive ATP synthesis

Fukushima I nuclear power station is a disabled nuclear power plant in the town of kuma of Fukushima Prefecture Japan Fukushima I was the first nuclear powers station to be built and run only by the Tokyo Electric Power Company

In March 2011 there were nuclear emergencies at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Station and some other Japanese nuclear facilities which raised questions about the future of nuclear power Following the Fukushima nuclear disaster the International Energy Agency halved its estimate of additional nuclear generating capacity to be built by 2035 

The nuclear reactors for units 1 2 and 6 were supplied by General Electric those for units 3 and 5 by Toshiba and unit 4 by Hitachi The architectural design for the General Electrics units was done by Ebasco All of the building work was done by Kajima Since September 2010 unit 3 has been fueled by MOX fuelmixed oxide fuel Units 15 hadhave a Mark 1 type containment structure unit 6 has Mark 2 type containment structure

Unit 1 is a 439 MW boiling water reactor constructed in July 1967 It started to commercially make electricity on March 26 1971 and was planned to shutdown in March 2011 It was damaged during the 2011 Sendai earthquake and tsunami The reactor had a high atomic and earthquake safety levels when it was made but it is now both old and out of date No one know such a bad quake could happen in Japan Unit 1 was designed for a earthquake peak ground acceleration shaking motion of 018 g and a seismic response spectrum based on the 1952 Kern County earthquake All units were inspected after the 1978 Miyagi earthquake when the seismic ground acceleration was 0125 g for 30 seconds but no damage to the critical parts of the reactor was discovered

In March 2011 soon after the Sendai earthquake and tsunami the Japanese government cleared people from around the plant and started local emergency laws at Fukushima I Ryohei Shiomi of Japans nuclear safety board was worried about the chance of a meltdown at Unit 1 The next day the Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said that a partial meltdown at Unit 3 was highly possible

The Nuclear Engineering International group had reported that Units 1 2 and 3 were automatically shut down Units 4 5 and 6 had already been shut down for maintenance Back up generators were damaged by the tsunami started at first but stopped after 1 hour later

Japans government said it had and a nuclear emergency when the cooling problems happened as the back up diesel generators broke down The cooling is needed to remove decay heat even when a plant has been shut down due to the long term atomic reactions Hundreds of Japanese troops were said to be trucking generators and batteries to the site

After the back up diesel generators pumps broke down emergency batteries ran low after about eight hours Batteries from other nuclear plants were sent to the site and mobile electric and diesel generators arrived within 13 hours but work to connect portable generating equipment to power water pumps was still continuing as of 1504 on 12 March The diesel generators would normally be connected by switching gears in a basement area of the power stations buildings but this had been flooded by the tsunami

John McDouall Stuart is regarded as one of Australias greatest explorers He went on seven major exploring trips into the centre and north of Australia He was leader of six of these expeditions He spent more time out in the Australian bush exploring the land than any other explorer On each trip he was able to go further north and found water sources that helped him with his final long journey In 1862 he crossed Australia from Adelaide South Australia to Van Diemen Gulf in the Northern Territory He was the first European to cross the continent from north to south and then return again

Exploring Australia caused Stuart to become very sick from diseases such as scurvy and beriberi He pushed himself to the very limits of human endurance Each trip left him weaker and at the end of his last trip he was unable to walk or ride and had to be carried back Stuarts discoveries opened up the country for the growth of farming sheep and cattle His route was used to build the Australian Overland Telegraph Line from Adelaide to Darwin which joined an undersea line from Java This meant that for the first time Australians could communicate quickly with the rest of the world But his personal rewards were small He was given some land by the government and a small salary from his employers Stuart died poor in England at the age of 50

Stuart was born on 7 September 1815 at Dysart Fife Scotland His father William Stuart had been a captain in the British Army His mother was Mary McDouall They had nine children John McDouall was the sixthrp14 His parents died when he was ten years old The children were separated and sent to live with different relatives Stuart was educated at the Scottish Naval and Military Academy in Edinburgh He studied to be an engineer and surveyorrp14

In 1839 Stuart moved to Adelaide South Australia and began work as a surveyor Adelaide had only been settled for two years and was mainly still a tent city The government needed to have maps so that land could be sold or leased Stuart worked for three years on the edges of the settled areas measuring the land and dividing it into farm blocks He learned skills to live and travel in the Australian bush He was known as a heavy drinker often spending days at a time drunkrp20 When a recession hit the South Australian economy Stuart found himself without a job

Stuart joined Charles Sturts Central Australian Expedition to search for an inland sea in August 1844 Sturt was so sure that there was an inland sea in the centre of Australia that he took a large boat as part of his equipment Stuart joined the group as a draftsman who would draw up the maps He was paid one pound a week and provided with foodrp25 Stuart and James Poole the second in command were sent out ahead of the main group to find water The main group could only travel as fast as their flock of sheep could walk Stuart and Poole found water at Depot Glen near the current site of Milparinkarp27 

In the hot dry climate of summer the group remained trapped at the waterhole for seven monthsrp27 Sturt took a small group to find water to the north west and east but found none Stuart was left behind in charge of the main group at Depot Glen It was very hot so they dug an underground room to keep cool All the men became sick from scurvy because of the lack of fresh fruit and vegetables This caused their gums to become soft and their teeth to fall out They had headaches their noses bled and their skin began to turn black When Poole died Stuart was made second in commandrp29 He also became the surveyor and did all the mapping as Sturt could not see properly When it finally rained the group tried to keep going north but were blocked by the sand dunes of the Simpson Desert They turned south and went back to the Darling River Stuart took over as leader when Sturt became blind and too ill to lead the grouprp31 They arrived back in Adelaide after six weeks hard travelling Sturt had to be carried in a cart and Stuart crippled with scurvy and beriberi looked like a skeletonrp31

It took Stuart nearly a year to recover from the expedition He wrote in a letter I lost the power of my limbs for six months and was quite unable to do anything for myself for twelve monthsrp35 For the next few years he was unable to work The money he had made was spent on doctors and living expenses In 1849 he moved to near Port Lincoln on the Eyre Peninsula and worked on a farm He soon found work surveying in the area and met William Finke and James Chambersrp37 Finke and Chambers were rich men and they paid Sturt to explore for them They wanted him to find them new farm lands and water as well as minerals like gold and copper

Stuart learned from his trip with Sturt that large groups were not able to move quickly through the dry Australian lands He believed that a small group would have more success Finke paid him to find out if the land north of Lake Torrens would be suitable for sheep On this first trip he went with two men Forster and an unnamed Aboriginal youth They took six horses enough food for six weeks a watch and a compass In May 1858 they went through settled areas until they reached Oratunga Station one of the most remote farms in South Australia It is near the present day town of Blinman in the north of the Flinders Ranges From here they went northwest and found a permanent water hole Andamooka Waterhole on a creek Stuart named Chambers Creek It has since been renamed Stuart Creek The country was very dry and they could only find water in Aboriginal wells The stony ground hurt the horses feet At the end of July they reached the site of the present day town of Coober Pedy Their horses were in poor condition and they were running out of food Stuart decided to change direction to the south west and try and reach the coast near Fowlers Bay The Aboriginal youth would not go any further and went back He was scared of other Aborigines in the area they were going into Stuart said the land was dreary dismal dreadful desert Stuart and Forster reached the coast at Denial Bay in August 1858 and were back in settled farm lands by 11 September They had completed a journey of convert2400kmmi0lkonabbron in four months He gave his diary and maps to the South Australian government As a reward Stuart was given the lease to 1000 square miles of land at Chambers Creek

The official South Australian government explorer Benjamin Herschel Babbage followed Stuarts maps and went to Chambers Creek He reported that the map showed the creek was marked convert46kmmi0lkoffabbron too far to the northrp70 Stuart went back to Chambers Creek to survey the area again This expedition was paid for by James Chambers and William Finke who realized the value of reliable water supplies on the other side of the salt lakes Stuart left Oratunga Station on 2 April 1859rp73 with a small group three men and 14 horses The men he took with him included a Bavarian naturalist and artist David Herrgott and Louis Mller a stockman and botanistrp72 Both Herrgott and Mller had been gold miners in Victoria and would know how to look for gold in the country around Chambers Creek They did not carry much equipment only a blanket to sleep with but no tents The only food they took was flour dried beef tea sugar and tobaccorp73 He took more equipment than just his watch and compass on this trip a sextant a copy of the Astronomical Almanac and a telescope

Stuart went a different way to Chambers Creek going through a gap in between the salt lakes that had been discovered by Major Peter Warburton earlier in the year Herrgott discovered a group of 12 artesian springs which Stuart named after him This name later became the settlement of Herggott Springs The name was changed again during World War One because of strong anti German feelings in Australia The town is now called Marree after the Aboriginal word for possumrp75 These springs were mound springs over thousands of years the salt in the water had formed small hills and the water came out of them like water out of a volcano Some of the mounds were over convert50mft0lkonabbron highrp78 They were valuable because they provided reliable water for people and animals moving north to Chambers Creek 

After surveying Chambers Creek again Stuart explored the area to the north west of Chambers Creek They found more mound springs which Stuart named Elizabeth Springs after one of Chambers daughtersrp77 They continued north west and searched for gold in the Davenport Range They found more springs which they named the Spring of Hoperp80 They were able to continue and found more springs which Stuart named Freeling Springs after Major Freeling a South Australian politician By the time they had passed the current site of Oodnadatta both the men and the horses were suffering from the lack of water and proper food The horses shoes had worn out in the rocks around the Davenport Range On 12 June 1859 Stuart turned around and went backrp84 They rode south back to Port Augusta and then took a boat back to Adelaide

The South Australian government offered a prize of 2000 to the first person to cross Australia from the south to the north They hoped this would be a route for the Australian Overland Telegraph Line that would connect Australia to the line that came from Europe Stuart and Chambers plans for the trip were not accepted by the government The government sent Alexander Tolmer to lead the trip His expedition did not make it out of the settled areas In August 1859 one month after his last trip Stuart went back to do more surveying for Chambers at Chambers Creek With William Darton Kekwick and two other men they took 12 horses and explored the west side of Lake Eyre Chambers and Stuart believed that the lake might hold waterrp111 Instead Stuart found mud after he walked several kilometres into the dry salt lakerp116 He discovered another artesian mound spring more than convert30mft0lkoffabbron in height which he named William Springsrp120 after one of Chambers sons He then set off for the Spring of Hope He discovered grasslands and eventually made a base at Freeling Springs He explored much of the surrounding area hoping to find gold On 6 January 1859 with his food supplies getting low and two of the men refusing to go any further Stuart once again returned home

There was a lot of support for an expedition to cross Australia In Melbourne the biggest exploring expedition in Australian history the Victorian Exploring Expedition was being organized for the crossing This became known as the Burke and Wills expedition named after its two leaders Robert OHara Burke and William John Wills Stuart knew that he would be able to travel further and faster by only going with a small group In March 1860 with Kekwick Benjamin Head and 13 horses Stuart left Chambers Creek and headed north They were the first Europeans to enter central Australia They discovered the Finke River the MacDonnell Ranges and the strange rock formation Stuart called Chambers Pillar On 23 April Stuart worked out that they were at the very centre of Australia He named a small hill near the spot Mount Sturt after Charles Sturt Stuart and Kekwick climbed the hill and raised the British flag Stuart wrote that the flag would be a sign to the Aborigines that the dawn of liberty civilization and Christianity is about to break upon themrp120 The name was later changed to Central Mount Stuartrp121 From here Stuart tried to go northwest to reach the Victoria River This took them into the Tanami Desert but they could not find water and were forced to go back

They continued to travel north beyond the site of the town of Tennant Creek On 26 June they reached a creek now called Attack Creek about convert2400kmmi0lkoffabbron north of Adelaide A large group of Aborigines from a group called the Warramunga attacked the explorers The Warrumunga threw boomerangs at the explorers and then set fire to the grass Stuart and his men fired their guns at the Warrumunga but Stuart does not say in his diary if any were killed or injuredrp158 The men quickly left the creek and went south 

Stuart decided they could not get any further north because they were running out of food water was scarce and the horses were in poor condition He wrote I think it would be madness and folly to attempt morerp121 The return journey was very difficult Stuart could only ride for a few hours a day on one day he just dug a hole in the sand and curled up in itrp166 Head was so hungry he stole food which left them with even less Their clothes were only torn rags and their bodies were covered in bruises caused by scurvy Stuart wrote in his diary that My men have now lost all their former energyand move about as if they were a hundred years old It is sad to see themrp166 Stuart wrote in his diary that sores on his hands had made them to painful to be used and he could only just sit in the saddle He gums had become so sore and his teeth so loose that he could only eat flour boiled in water He wrote on 16 May that I almost wished that death would come and relieve me from my fearful torture The medicines he had with him did not help

The explorers made their way back to Adelaide as Burke and Wills were starting their journey north from Melbournerp121 Stuart was treated as a hero when he arrived in Adelaide In 1859 the Royal Geographical Society in London presented him with gold watch This was given to the explorer Count Paul Strzelecki to take back to Australia

The cost of Stuarts exploring had been paid for by Chambers Because of this Stuart would not make his journals and maps available to the public This led to claims that Stuart had not really travelled that far north and that he was lying about his discoveries In Victoria it was even said that Stuart had not really gone north but had been hiding in a cellar in Adelaide

The public and the newspapers began to talk about a race across the continent of Australiarp176 Could Stuart experienced and used to moving quickly beat the better equipped but very slow moving Burke and Wills expedition After their failures with Babbage and Tolmers expeditions the South Australian government now believed that Stuart would succeed if he had enough support They gave 2500 to set up another expedition and provided ten armed men to protect Stuart from any more attacks by the Aboriginesrp182 Chambers agreed to supply more horses and to pay Stuart and Kekwicks wagesrp182 In Victoria a policeman was sent off to tell Burke to get going to the Gulf of Carpentaria as fast as possible but Burke had already heard about Stuarts planned triprp182 Burke divided his group in two and leaving most of his supplies behind at Menindee on the Darling River he headed north to Cooper Creek 

On 1 January 1861 Stuart with a group of 12 men and 49 horses set off from Chambers Creek The hot weather made it hard to find water and many waterholes from his earlier trips were dry In February Stuart sent back two men with five horses They reached the northern border of South Australia at about the same time that Burke and Wills reached the Gulf of Carpentaria He was able to travel 240 km north of Attack Creek where he found a large waterhole he called Glandfield Lagoon after the mayor of Adelaiderp208 Chambers later changed the name on Stuarts maps to Newcastle Waters after the Duke of Newcastle a British politicianrp208 From here Stuart again looked for a way to go north west to the Victoria River but he was unable to find water With the food running out the men becoming sick and horses in poor condition Stuart again decided to return to Adelaide Burke and Wills had not returned to Cooper Creek and were missing

Stuart was presented with the Royal Geographical Societys Patrons Medal for 1861

Stuart set out on his third attempt to cross Australia on 25 October 1861 This expedition was called the Great Northern Exploring Expedition The group was John McDouall Stuart William Darton Kekwick Francis William Thring William Patrick Auld Stephen King Jnr John William Billiatt James Frew Jnr Heath Nash John Woodforde John McGorrery and Frederick George Waterhouse

McGorrey was a blacksmith who would be able to fix the shoes on the groups 78 horses Waterhouse was a naturalist who would be able to keep a scientific notes of their discoveries Stuart was injured when a horse stood on his right hand and remained behind for a month to recoverrp225 He learned about the deaths of Burke and Wills at Cooper Creek

The group left Chambers Creek on 8 January 1862 moving fast covering between 30 and 50 kilometres a dayrp236 The fast pace meant that in the first three weeks eight horses died and Woodforde left and went backrp238 Stuart left some of the supplies behind and cut the amount each man was allowed to eat At Mount Hay in central Australia they were again attacked by Aboriginal warriors but they were no match for the groups guns and several may have been killedrp241

They reached Newcastle Waters in three months and then took a week to rest Stuart spent the next five weeks searching for water He finally found a series of waterholes creeks and rivers which meant the whole group were able to continue to the north He gave up trying to reach the Victoria River When they got to the Roper River which had been discovered by Ludwig Leichhardt in 1845 he knew he could easily go west to the Gulf of Carpentaria but instead chose to continue northrp255 Auld later said that the mosquitos and flies were terrible Our hands feet and necks were blistered with their bites They crossed Arnhem Land and made the way along the edge of what is now Kakadu National Park He followed the Adelaide River but when the ground became too soft and muddy they went further north to the Mary River and eventually reached the sea

They arrived at Van Diemens Gulf on 24 July 1862 On a tall tree branch they raised a Union Jack flag with Stuarts name embroided on it which had been made by Chambers daughter Elizabeth Wood from the tree which has since been destroyed is in the collection of the Royal Geographical Society of South Australias collection The group then had to travel convert3400kmmi0lkoffabbron back to Adelaide Food was becoming scarce and the hot weather meant there was little water Many horses died and Stuart was again forced to leave behind equipment Waterhouse had to leave all his carefully collected plants and animals The men were very hungry and even shot and ate dingosrp269 Stuart was in poor health and became blind He was unable to speak for several days and the men thought he was going to dierp273 He was unable to ride his horse and they made a bed with long poles and blankets that could be carried between two horses Stuart was carried convert960kmmi0lkoffabbron by this method after crossing the MacDonnell Ranges they discovered that rain had fallen and there was lots of grass On reaching the settled areas Stuart learned that his friend and partner James Chambers had died He left Kekwick in charge of the group and went ahead with Auld They got on the train at Kapunda and arrived in Adelaide on 17 December 1862 

Stuart and his group were given a special welcome in Adelaide on 16 January 1863 They dressed in their old clothes and rode into the city as heroesrp282 This was also the day that Burke and Wills were buried in Melbourne after the failure of their expeditionrp283

Stuart was in poor health almost blind and had a crippled right hand after the sixth trip With Chambers dead he no longer had a job The government tried not to pay him the 2000 reward saying that they had paid for the cost of the expedition After public pressure they gave in but invested the money and only gave Stuart a small amount each year He was drinking a lot of alcohol and none of his friends would give him any help The government then wanted 500 for the lease of the land they had given him at Chambers Creek Stuart sold it to James Chambers brother John Chambers for only 200 losing money on the dealrp289

He decided to return to Great Britain in April 1864 He lived with his sister Mary in Glasgow Scotland The Royal Geographical Society asked the South Australian government for a pension for Stuart but they said he had been rewarded enough with grants of landrp292 During the debate over the pension it was said that it was not the exploring that had ruined his health but his drinking habitsrp292 He suffered from dementia and it is possible he also had tuberculosis He died in London on 5 June 1866 from a stroke and was buried in the Kensal Green Cemetery Only seven people went to the funeral four relatives two members of the Royal Geographical Society and Alexander Hay a South Australian farmer who was in London at the timerp293 The grave was damaged in World War II but was repaired in 2010 by the Stuart Society and the Royal Geographical Society of South Australia

The Australian Overland Telegraph Line was built along the route taken by Stuart Using his notes they were easily able to find water supplies and trees to make the poles The accuracy of his maps made building the line much easier His journey is remembered in the Stuart Highway one of Australias major roads which joins Port Augusta to Darwin It follows much of the same route discovered by Stuart In June 1904 a statue of Stuart was put up in Adelaide The Royal Geographical Society of South Australia has a wooden chair and table made by Stuart in 1854

Benjamin Head later said about Stuart that he was a born leader of men the sharpest little fellow you would find in a years march
