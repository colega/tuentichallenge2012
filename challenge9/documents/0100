The 2011 Norway attacks were two attacks in Norway on 22 July 2011 The first attack was a car bombing near government buildings in Oslo The second attack was a mass shooting at a summer youth camp on an island northwest of Oslo Of the total 77 deaths 55 were teenagers and another 96 people were injured The car bomb also shattered many windows of buildings in the government quarter of downtown Olso

The bomb explosion was near the office of Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg at 1526 It killed eight people and injured several others The second attack was about 90 minutes later at a youth camp organized by the youth group of the Norwegian Labour Party at the island of Utya in Tyrifjorden Buskerud A gunman disguised as a policeman opened fire at the campers and killed 69 people

The police arrested several suspects but many were released The prime suspect is Anders Behring Breivik a 32 year old Norwegian man for the shootings at Utya He was later charged with both attacks Records show he had planned the attacks for years as an act of anti immigration ideology and against multi culturalism

The European Union NATO and countries around the world have expressed their support for Norway and condemned the attacks

On 22 July 2011 at 1526 a powerful explosion went off near the offices of the Prime Minister of Norway and several other governmental buildings such as the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy and Ministry of Finance

The nearby street was filled with glass and debris following the explosion The wreckage of a car was sighted near one of the affected buildings A giant cloud of white smoke was seen as a fire burned at the Ministry of Petroleum The blast was heard at least seven kilometres away

Following the explosion police cleared the area and searched for more explosive devices The police asked people to leave central Oslo

Eight people are known to have been killed in the explosion with fifteen injured eleven seriously A doctor at the Oslo University Hospital said the hospital staff were treating head chest and abdominal injuries

Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg was not hurt in the blast Norways finance minister Sigbjrn Johnsen was on holiday in Denmark at the time

Because July is the main holiday time in Norway there were not as many people in the area as usual which may saved many lives

All roads into Oslos downtown area were closed as police moved people from the area and warned Oslo residents to stay away from the city center They were also told to limit their usage of mobile phones due to concerns of another possible terrorist attack Public transport into and out of the city was stopped The police checked cars on the road to Oslo airport which remained open as the police conducted searches in cars at the site

The Gardermoen railway line between Lillestrm and Oslo airport was shut down after a suspicious package was found close to the tracks The same happened at the offices of TV 2 which were evacuated after a suspicious package was found outside the building

About 90 minutes after the Oslo explosion a gunman in police uniform believed to be Anders Behring Breivik got on a ferry about 40 kilometres northwest of Oslo The ferry went to the island of Utya in lake Tyrifjorden The island was the site of the Labour Partys annual Workers Youth League youth summer camp Once on the island the gunman began to shoot the mainly adolescent campers before finally being captured

The shooter was dressed as a police officer and said he had come over for a routine check following the bombing event in Oslo He signalled and asked people to gather around him before firing his weapons killing and injuring many people He first shot people on the island and later started shooting at people who were trying to escape by swimming across the lake The police reported that most of the casualties were youths of about 15 and 16 years old People on the island were reported to have hidden in lavatories or undergrowth communicating by text message to avoid giving their positions away to the gunman

The shooting supposedly lasted for 90 minutesCitation neededdateJuly 2011 The police were informed about the shooting at 1727 and at 1827 the gunman had been arrested When the police arrived at the scene they were confronted with a scene of survivors begging the officers to throw away their weapons They were afraid that the men in uniforms would again open fire on them

At about 0350 on 23 July 2011 Norways National Police Commissioner ystein Mland thought the number of deaths at Utya was at least 80 with the count expected to increase The number of dead is now known to be 69

Norwegian media groups said the suspected attacker was Anders Behring Breivik He was arrested on Utya for the shootings and also linked to the Oslo bombings He has been charged for both attacks

The attorney Geir Lippestad elected to act on behalf of Breiviks defence telling the Dagbladet newspaper on Saturday that Breivik had requested him personally Lippestad said I thought carefully about it Everyone is entitled to a lawyer even in a case like this and I decided to accept Breivik has said that he is responsible for both the bomb and the shooting during police questioning but said he was not guilty Lippestad also was the attorney for the convicted neo Nazi murderer Ole Nicolai Kvisler Kvisler was sentenced in 2002 for the racially motivated murder of Benjamin Hermansen

Acting national police chief Sveinung Sponheim said that the suspected gunmans Internet postings suggest that he has some political traits directed toward the right and anti Muslim views but whether that was a motivation for the actual act remains to be seen Police have described Breivik as being a right wing extremist Breivik described himself as a conservative nationalist He has been described as a Christian fundamentalist by news sources He is reported to have written many posts on the website documentno described by Aftenposten as Islam critical and Israel friendly He went to meetings of Documents venner linked with the website He is was also once a member of the right wing Progress Party and its youth wing FpU FpU leader Ove Vanebo said Breivik was active early in the 2000s but he left the party as his viewpoints became more extreme

Media reports say that Breivik posted comments on the internet saying he is an admirer of Winston Churchill and Max Manus and also of Dutch politician Geert Wilders Breivik said Wilders Party for Freedom is the only true party for conservatives Breivik has said he is pro gay and pro Israel On Twitter he paraphrased utilitarian philosopher John Stuart Mill One person with a belief is equal to the force of 100000 who have only interests The Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation said that Breivik published a 1516 page manifesto on his anti multiculturalist and right wing militant ideologies on the day of the attacks

Several witnesses at the youth camp do not believe there was only one shooter The police have received descriptions of a second gunman and are currently checking this information Due to the uncertainty surrounding these witness descriptions and the chaotic nature of the events the police have as a matter of precaution yet to make an official comment on the matter Acting Police Chief Sveinung Sponheim has said that Its very difficult at this point to say whether he was acting alone or whether he was acting as part of a larger network 

At a press conference on the morning after the attacks prime minister Jens Stoltenberg called the attack a national tragedy and the worst atrocity since World War II Stoltenberg said that the attack would not hurt the Norwegian democracy and said the proper answer to the violence was more democracy more openness but not naivety

Eskil Pedersen of the Workers Youth League vowed to return to Utya and urged Norway to continue its tradition of openness and tolerance

King Harald sent his condolences to the victims and their families and urged unity

The European Union NATO the United Nations Security Council governments and leaders from around the world expressed their condemnation of the attack condolences and solidarity with Norway

In continuum mechanics stress is the force that an object pushes back with when it is being deformed In other words it is the internal forces acting within a deformable body 

Stress states the average force per unit of the surface area within the body where the internal forces are acting Specifically it shows the intensity of the internal forces acting between the particles in the deformable body across imaginary internal surfaces These internal forces are a reaction to the external forces applied on the body that cause it to deform External forces are either surface forces or body forces 

In continuum mechanics the loaded deformable body behaves as a continuum So these internal forces are distributed continually within the volume of the material body The forces cause deformation of the bodys shape The deformation can lead to a permanent shape change or structural failure if the material is not strong enough

Some models of continuum mechanics treat force as something that can change Other models look at the deformation of matter and solid bodies because the characteristics of matter and solids are three dimensional Each approach can give different results Classical models of continuum mechanics assume an average force and do not properly include geometrical factors 

The dimension of stress is the same as that of pressure and therefore the SI unit for stress is the pascal which is equivalent to one newton per square meter or Nm2 In Imperial units stress is measured in pound force per square inch which is often shortened to psi

In organic chemistry a pericyclic reaction is a type of chemical reaction between organic compounds In the case of pericyclic reactions the transition state of the molecule is a ring and the reaction goes forward in a concerted way Pericyclic reactions are usually rearrangement reactions The most important groups of pericyclic reactions are

In general pericyclic reactions are equilibrium processes However it is possible to push the reaction in one direction if the product is at a significantly lower energy level This is applying Le Chateliers principle to a reaction involving a single molecule

Many pericyclic reactions have similar stepwise radical processes connected with them Chemists disagree whether some reactions are pericyclic reactions For example it is not definitively known whether the 22 cycloaddition mechanism is concerted Many pericyclic reactions have similar reactions that are metal catalyzed But these metal catalyzed reactions are also not really pericyclic The metal catalysts stabilize the reaction intermediates So the reaction is not concerted but rather metal stabilized

A large photoinduced hydrogen sigmatropic shift was utilized in a corrin synthesis performed by Albert Eschenmoser containing a 16 system 

Due to the principle of microscopic reversibility there is a parallel set of retro pericyclic reactions which perform the reverse reaction

Pericyclic reactions also happen in several biological processes

A cycloaddition is a chemical reaction between reactants with double bonds that get replaced by a ring structure It is a pericyclic chemical reaction where two or more unsaturated molecules combine with the formation of a cyclic adduct in which there is a net reduction of the bond multiplicity It is a cyclization reaction it makes new ring of atoms

Cycloadditions are named by the basic size of the molecules that are being brought together This would make the DielsAlder reaction a 4 2cycloaddition and the 13 dipolar cycloaddition a 3 2cycloaddition This type of reaction is a non polar addition reaction

Heat can cause the double bonds to form a ring Thermal cycloadditions usually have electrons participating in the starting material for some whole number n Because of orbital symmetry most cycloadditions are suprafacial suprafacial Rarely they are antarafacial antarafacial There are a few examples of thermal cycloadditions which have 4n electrons These proceed in a suprafacial antarafacial sense For example the dimerisation of ketene has a orthogonal set of p orbitals Those p orbitals allow the reaction to proceed using a crossed transition state

Light can also cause the double bonds to form a ring Cycloadditions in which 4n electrons participate can also occur as a result of photochemical activation Here one component makes an electron move from the highest occupied molecular orbital to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital After the electron is promoted to the higher orbital orbital symmetry allows the reaction to proceed in a suprafacial suprafacial manner An example is the DeMayo reaction Another example is shown below the photochemical dimerization of cinnamic acid

Note that not all photochemical cyclizations are cycloadditions some are known to operate by radical mechanisms

Some cycloadditions instead of bonds operate through strained cyclopropane rings as these have significant character For example an analog for the DielsAlder reaction is the quadricyclane DMAD reaction 

In the cycloaddition notation i and j refer to the number of atoms involved in the cycloaddition In this notation a Diels Alder reaction is acycloaddition and a 13 dipolar addition such as the first step in ozonolysis is acycloaddition This notation uses parenthesis The IUPAC preferred notation however with ij counts electrons and not atoms It uses square brackets In this notation the DielsAlder reaction and the dipolar reaction both become a 42cycloaddition The reaction between norbornadiene and an activated alkyne is a 222cycloaddition

The DielsAlder reaction is a 42cycloaddition reaction

The Huisgen cycloaddition reaction is a 23cycloaddition

The Nitrone olefin cycloaddition is a 32cycloaddition

Cycloadditions often have metal catalyzed and stepwise radical analogs however these are not strictly speaking pericyclic reactions When charged or radical intermediates are involved in a cycloaddition or when the cycloaddition result is found in a series of reaction steps they are sometimes called formal cycloadditions to make a difference from true pericyclic cycloadditions 

One example of a formal 33cycloaddition between a cyclic enone and an enamine catalyzed by n butyllithium is a Stork enamine 12 addition cascade reaction

Cheletropic reactions are a type of pericyclic reaction where one atom on one of the reagents gets two new bonds A pericyclic reaction is one that involves a transition state with a cyclic array of atoms and an associated cyclic array of interacting orbitals A reorganization of and bonds occurs in this cyclic array

Cheletropic reactions are a subclass of cycloadditions What sets cheletropic reactions apart is that on one of the reagents both new bonds are being made to the same atom A few examples are shown to the right in Figure 1 In the first case the single atom is the carbon atom in the carbonyl group That carbon atom ends up in carbon monoxide The end result is making two new bonds to one atom The first two examples are known as cheletropic extrusions because a small stable molecule is given off in the reaction The driving force for these reactions is often the entropic benefit of releasing a gas

Because of the geometry of the molecules involved in cheletropic reactions they confirm a number of predictions made by theoretical chemists Cheletropic reactions confirm the conservation of molecular orbital symmetry

In the pericyclic transition state a small molecule donates two electrons to the ring Two possible geometries can explain the reaction The small molecule can approach in either a linear or non linear way In the linear approach the electrons in the orbital of the small molecule are pointed directly at the system of the big molecule In the non linear approach the orbital approaches at a slightly off angle The systems ability to rotate as the small molecule approaches is crucial in forming new bonds The direction of rotation will be different depending on how many electrons are in the system A diagram of a two electron fragment approaching a four electron system using frontier molecular orbitals is shown below The rotation will be disrotatory if the small molecule approaches linearly and conrotatory if the molecule approaches non linearly Disrotatory and conrotatory tell how the bonds in the system are rotating Disrotatory means opposite directions while conrotatory means the same direction This is also shown in the diagram below

Using Huckels Rule one can tell if the system is aromatic or anti aromatic If aromatic linear approaches use disrotatory motion while non linear approaches use conrotatory motion The opposite goes with an anti aromatic system Linear approaches will have conrotatory motion while non linear approaches will have disrotatory motion

When sulfur dioxide reacts with butadiene and isoprene two different products result The reaction mechanism will control what gets made A kinetic product and a thermodynamic product are both possible More of the thermodynamic product gets made than the kinetic product The kinetic product comes from a DielsAlder reaction while a cheletropic reaction makes a more thermodynamically stable product The cheletropic pathway is used more because it makes to a more stable five membered ring adduct The scheme below shows the difference between the two products The path to the left shows the thermodynamic product while the path to the right shows the kinetic product Suarez and Sordo showed this in 1995 They showed this both with experiments and using Gaussian calculations

One example of this is the cheletropic reactions of 13 dienes with sulfur dioxide Chemists have carefully looked at the kinetics of this reaction In 1976 Isaacs and Laila measured the kenetic factors for the addition of sulfur dioxide to butadiene derivatives Rates of addition were monitored in benzene at 30 C with an initial twentyfold excess of diene They used a spectrophotometer to study light at 320 nm to measure the disappearance of SO2 The reaction showed pseudo first order kinetics The chemists found that electron withdrawing groups on the diene decreased the rate of reaction Also the reaction rate was affected considerably by steric effects of 2 substituents with more bulky groups increasing the rate of reaction The authors attribute this to the tendency of bulky groups to favor the cisoid conformation of the diene which is essential to the reaction In addition the rates at four temperatures were measured for seven of the dienes From these measurements chemists used the Arrhenius equation to calculate the enthalpy of activation and entropy of activation for each reaction This was one of the first important efforts to study the kenetics of a cheletropic reaction 

Monnat Vogel and Sordo in 2002 measured the kinetics of addition of sulfur dioxide to 12 dimethylidenecycloalkanes They wrote that the reaction of 12 dimethylidenecyclohexane with sulfur dioxide can give two different products depending on reaction conditions The reaction makes the corresponding sultine through a hetero Diels Alder reaction under kinetic control but under thermodynamic control the reaction makes the corresponding sulfolene through a cheletropic reaction The activation enthalpy for the hetero Diels Alder reaction is about 2 kcalmol smaller than that for the corresponding cheletropic reaction The sulfolene is about 10 kcalmol more stable than the isometric sultine in CH2Cl2SO2 solution

The effect of the solvent of the cheletropic reaction of 34 dimethyl 25 dihydrothiophen 11 dioxide was kinetically investigated in 14 solvents The reaction rate constants of the forward and reverse reaction in addition to the equilibrium constants were found to be linearly correlated with the ET solvent polarity scale 

Reactions were done at 120 C and were studied by 1H NMR spectroscopy of the reaction mixture The forward rate k1 was found to decrease by a factor of 45 going from cyclohexane to methanol The reverse rate k 1 was found to increase by a factor of 53 going from cyclohexane to methanol while the equilibrium constant Keq decreased by a factor of 140 It is suggested that there is a change of the polarity during the activation process as evidenced by relationships between the equilibrium and kinetic data The authors say that the reaction appears to be influenced by the polarity of the solvent and this can be shown by the change in the dipole moments when going from reactant to transition state to product The authors also state that the cheletropic reaction doesnt seem to be influenced by either solvent acidity or basicity 

The results of this study lead the authors to expect the following behaviors 

1 The change in the solvent polarity will influence the rate less than the equilibrium

2 The rate constants will be characterized by opposite effect on the polarity k1 will slightly decrease with the increase of ET and k 1 will increase under the same conditions

3 The effect on k 1 will be larger than on k1

One of the most synthetically important cheletropic reactions is the addition of a singlet carbene to an alkene to make a cyclopropane A carbene is a neutral molecule containing a divalent carbon with six electrons in its valence shell Because of this carbenes are highly reactive electrophiles and generated as reaction intermediates A singlet carbene contains an empty p orbital and a roughly sp2 hybrid orbital that has two electrons Singlet carbenes add stereospecifically to alkenes and alkene stereochemistry is retained in the cyclopropane product The mechanism for addition of a carbene to an alkene is a concerted 21 cycloaddition Carbenes derived from chloroform or bromoform can be used to add CX2 to an alkene to give a dihalocyclopropane while the Simmons Smith reagent adds CH2

Interaction of the filled carbene orbital with the alkene system creates a four electron system and favors a non linear approach It is also favorable to mix the carbene empty p orbital with the filled alkene orbital Favorable mixing occurs through a non linear approach However while theory clearly favors a non linear approach there are no obvious experimental implications for a linear vs non linear approach

A sigmatropic reaction in organic chemistry is a pericyclic reaction A sigmatropic reaction does not use a catalyst and involves a single molecule It changes one bond into a different bond The name sigmatropic is the result of a compounding of the long established sigma name for single carbon carbon bonds and the Greek word tropos meaning turn This is a rearrangement reaction which means that the bonds in a molecule shift between atoms without any atoms leaving or new atoms added to the molecule In a sigmatropic reaction a substituent moves from one part of a bonded system to another part in an intramolecular reaction with simultaneous rearrangement of the system True sigmatropic reactions usually do not need a catalyst Some sigmatropic reactions are catalyzed by a Lewis acid Sigmatropic reactions often have transition metal catalysts that form intermediates in analogous reactions The most well known of the sigmatropic rearrangements are the 33 Cope rearrangement Claisen rearrangement Carroll rearrangement and the Fischer indole synthesis 

A special notation is used to describe sigmatropic shifts Each of the carbon atoms on the backbone of the molecule are assigned a position number Sigmatropic rearrangements are described by an order term ij This means the migration of a bond adjacent to one or more systems to a new position and atoms removed from the original location of the bond When the sum of i and j is an even number this is an indication of the involvement of a neutral all C atom chain An odd number suggests that there is a charged C atom or of a heteroatom lone pair replacing a carbon carbon double bond Thus 15 and 33 shifts become 14 and 23 shifts with heteroatoms while preserving symmetry considerations Hydrogens are omitted in the third example for clarity 

Here is a way to find the order of a given sigmatropic rearrangement The first step is to give numbers to each atom starting with the atoms of the bond being broken as atom 1 Chemists count the atoms in each direction from the broken bond to the atoms that form the new bond in the product The numbers that correspond to the atoms forming the new bond are then separated by a comma and placed within brackets This creates the sigmatropic reaction order descriptor

Chemists also count atoms when naming a sigmatropic shift where a hydrogen atom moves The carbon chain does not break in a hydrogen atom migration So chemists count across all atoms involved in the reaction rather than only across the closest atoms For example the following hydrogen atom migration is of order 15 attained by counting counterclockwise through the system rather than the 13 order through the ring CH2 group that would mistakenly result if counted clockwise

Chemists have studied sigmatropic reactions where the migrating group has a sterocenter In principle all sigmatropic shifts can occur with either the same or the opposite geometry of the migrating group This depends on whether the original bonding lobe of the migrating atom or its other lobe is used to form the new bond

In cases of stereochemical retention the migrating group translates without rotation into the bonding position In the case of stereochemical inversion the migrating group both rotates and translates to reach its bonded conformation

There is another way that a sigmatropic reaction can produce products with different sterochemistry The migrating group can stay on the original face of the system after rebonding Or it can go to the opposite face of the system If the migrating group remains on the same face of the system the shift is known as suprafacial If the migrating group transfers to the opposite face is called an antarafacial shift Transformations that occur within small or medium sized rings cannot make antarafacial shifts 

In a thermal 13 hydride shift a hydride moves three atoms The Woodward Hoffmann rules dictate that it would proceed in an antarafacial shift Although such a shift is symmetry allowed the Mobius topology required in the transition state prohibits such a shift It is geometrically impossible This is why enols do not isomerize without an acid or base catalyst

Thermal alkyl 13 shifts similar to 13 hydride shifts must proceed antarafacially The geometry of the transition state is prohibitive But an alkyl group due to the nature of its orbitals can invert its geometry and form a new bond with the back lobe of its sp3 orbital This reaction will result a suprafacial shift These reactions are still not common in open chain systems because of the highly ordered nature of the transition state So the reactions work better in cyclic molecules

Photochemical 13 shifts should be suprafacial shifts however most are non concerted because they proceed through a triplet state

A 15 shift involves the shift of 1 substituent down 5 atoms of a system Hydrogen has been shown to shift in both cyclic and open chain systems at temperatures at or above 200 C These reactions are predicted to proceed suprafacially by a Huckel topology transition state  

Photoirradiation would require an antarafacial shift of hydrogen Although such reactions are rare there are examples where antarafacial shifts are favored

In contrast to hydrogen 15 shifts there have never been any observed 15 alky shifts in an open chain system Chemists have determined rate preferences for 15 alkyl shifts in cyclic systems carbonyl and carboxyl hydride phenyl and vinyl alkyl 

Alkyl groups undergo 15 shifts very poorly and usually require high temperatures However for cyclohexadienes the temperature for alkyl shifts is not much higher than that for carbonyls the best migratory group A study showed that this is because alkyl shifts on cyclohexadienes proceed through a different mechanism First the ring opens followed by a 17 shift and then the ring reforms electrocyclically

This same mechanistic process is seen below without the final electrocyclic ring closing reaction in the interconversion of lumisterol to vitamin D2

17 sigmatropic shifts are predicted by the Woodward Hoffmann rules to proceed in an antarafacial fashion by a Mobius topology transition state An antarafacial 17 shift is observed in the conversion of lumisterol to vitamin D2 where following an electrocyclic ring opening to previtamin D2 a methyl hydrogen shifts 

Bicyclic nonatrienes also undergo 17 shifts in a so called walk rearrangement which is the shift of divalent group as part of a three membered ring in a bicyclic molecule

33 sigmatropic shifts are well studied sigmatropic rearrangements The Woodward Hoffman rules predict that these six electron reactions would proceed suprafacially using a Huckel topology transition state 

Discovered in 1912 by Rainer Ludwig Claisen the Claisen rearrangement is the first recorded example of a 33 sigmatropic rearrangement This rearrangement is a useful carbon carbon bond forming reaction An example of Claisen rearrangement is the 33 rearrangement of an allyl vinyl ether which upon heating yields a unsaturated carbonyl The formation of a carbonyl group makes this reaction unlike other sigmatropic rearrangements inherently irreversible 

The ortho Claisen rearrangement involves the 33 shift of an allyl phenyl ether to an intermediate which quickly tautomerizes to an ortho substituted phenol

When both the ortho positions on the benzene ring are blocked a second ortho Claisen rearrangement will occur This para Claisen rearrangement ends with the tautomerization to a tri substituted phenol

The Cope rearrangement is an extensively studied organic reaction involving the 33 sigmatropic rearrangement of 15 dienes It was developed by Arthur C Cope For example 34 dimethyl 15 hexadiene heated to 300 C yields 26 octadiene

The Oxy Cope rearrangement a hydroxyl group is added at C3 forming an enal or enone after Keto enol tautomerism of the intermediate enol

The Carroll rearrangement is a rearrangement reaction in organic chemistry and involves the transformation of a keto allyl ester into a allyl ketocarboxylic acid This organic reaction can be followed by decarboxylation and the final product is a allylketone The Carroll rearrangement is an adaptation of the Claisen rearrangement and effectively a decarboxylative allylation

The Fischer indole synthesis is a chemical reaction that produces the aromatic heterocycle indole from a phenylhydrazine and an aldehyde or ketone under acidic conditions The reaction was discovered in 1883 by Hermann Emil Fischer 

The choice of acid catalyst is very important Successful acid catalysts include Bronsted acids such as HCl H2SO4 polyphosphoric acid and p toluenesulfonic acid Lewis acids such as boron trifluoride zinc chloride iron chloride and aluminium chloride are also useful catalysts

Several reviews have been published

Similar to 33 shifts the Woodward Hoffman rules predict that 55 sigmatropic shifts would proceed suprafacially Huckel topology transition state These reactions are rarer than 33 sigmatropic shifts but this is mainly a function of the fact that molecules that can undergo 55 shifts are rarer than molecules that can undergo 33 shifts

The migration of a divalent group such as O S NR or CR2 which is part of a three membered ring in a bicyclic molecule is commonly referred to as a walk rearrangement This can be formally characterized according to the Woodward Hofmann rules as being a sigmatropic shift An example of such a rearrangement is the shift of substituents on tropilidenes When heated the pi system goes through an electrocyclic ring closing to form bicycle410heptadiene Thereafter follows a 15 alkyl shift and an electrocyclic ring opening 

Proceeding through a 15 shift the walk rearrangement of norcaradienes is expected to proceed suprafacially with a retention of stereochemistry Experimental observations however show that the 15 shifts of norcaradienes proceed antarafacially Theoretical calculations found the 15 shift to be a diradical process but without involving any diradical minima on the potential energy surface

A Group transfer reaction is pericyclic reaction where one pi bond is converted to one sigma bond at the same time that a sigma bond migrates

The best known group transfer reaction is the ene reaction

Arlington National Cemetery is a cemetery in Arlington County Virginia People who served in the United States military are buried here The cemetery started during the American Civil War It is located on a big farm called Arlington House Arlington House was the home of Mary Anna Custis Lee Mary Anna Custis Lee was a great granddaughter of Martha Washington She was also the wife of Confederate general Robert E Lee Although most of the farm now has graves the old farmhouse still stands in the middle of the cemetery The cemetery is across the Potomac River from the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC

The cemetery covers convert624acrekm2 Veterans and people who died in United States wars are buried in the cemetery People are buried here who fought in wars from American Civil War to the military actions in Afghanistan and Iraq People who were buried here before the Civil War were reburied after 1900

Arlington National Cemetery is taken care of by the United States Army Arlington House and its land are taken care of by the National Park Service as a memorial to Lee Recently the way the cemetery is managed caused controversy

George Washington Parke Custis was the grandson of Martha Washington He got the land that now is Arlington National Cemetery in 1802 He began building Arlington House The estate was passed down to Custis and his wifes only surviving adult child Mary Anna Custis Lee She was married to Robert E Lee a West Point graduate and United States Army officer When Fort Sumter was forced to surrender at the beginning of the American Civil War President Abraham Lincoln offered Lee command of the federal army Lee did not give an answer right away wanting to see if his home state of Virginia would leave the Union

Lee quit being an officer in the Union army when Virginia said it was leaving the United States He became the leader of the armed forces of the Commonwealth of Virginia He then became commander of the Army of Northern Virginia Lee soon showed that he was a good commander He won battles against several Union generals But in the end he lost and surrendered at the McLean House Most Union officers thought Lee had broken his promises to the Union because he chose to fight against them Part of Arlington was taken away from the Lee family and became a graveyard Mostly Union dead are buried there

Before the Civil War the United States did not have large military only cemeteries Important generals were buried in Congressional Cemetery with other important leaders American military cemeteries came from the duty of commanders on the frontier and in battle to care for their wounded soldiers When Civil War wounded soldiers overflowed hospitals and burial grounds near Washington DC Quartermaster General Montgomery C Meigs proposed in 1864 that convert200acrekm2 of the Robert E Lee family property at Arlington be taken for a cemetery

During the Civil War people invented tricks to capture or to make life hard for Americans that fought on the other side of the war The government assessed taxes on properties and insisted that the owners appear in person to pay them If the plantation owner did not come the government would sell the land The government had acquired Arlington at tax sale in 1864 for 26800 Mrs Lee had not appeared in person but rather had sent an agent attempting to timely pay the 9207 in property taxes assessed the estate The government turned away her agent refusing to accept the tax payment In 1874 Custis Lee heir under his grandfathers will passing the estate in trust to his mother sued the United States claiming ownership of Arlington After the US Supreme Court ruled 5 4 in Lees favor in United States v Lee deciding that Arlington had been confiscated without due process Congress returned the estate to him The next year Custis Lee sold it back to the government for 150000 Custis Lee and Robert Todd Lincoln Secretary of War both were present when the property was formally turned over to government

In organic chemistry torquoselectivity describes electrocyclic reactions that produce one isomer more than the other An official definition is the preference for inward or outward rotation of substituents in conrotatory or disrotatory electrocyclic reactions In other words a chemical reaction is torquoselective if the groups of atoms that hang from a ring of atoms are more likely to have rotated in a particular direction during the reaction Torquoselectivity is different from the normal diastereoselectivity of pericyclic reactions Instead it is more selectivity beyond the WoodwardHoffmann rules The name comes from the idea that the substituents in an electrocyclization appear to rotate during the reaction The reaction produces a single product because only one direction of rotation was allowed The concept was originally developed by Kendall N Houk

When a chemical reaction closes a ring its torquoselectivity is the same as enantioselectivity A single enantiomer of a cyclization product is formed from the selective ring closure of the starting material In a typical electrocyclic ring closing selection for either conrotatory or disrotatory reactions modes still produces two enantiomers Torquoselectivity is a discrimination between these possible enantiomers that requires asymmetric induction

Torquoselectivity also happens in selective electrocyclic reactions that break open rings The different directions of rotation produce distinct structural isomers In these cases steric strain is often the driving force for the selectivity Studies have shown that the selectivity can also be changed by the presence of electron donating and electron withdrawing groups

Torquoselectivity can also apply to other mechanisms including chiral Lewis acid catalysts induction by neighboring stereocenters and axial to tetrahedral chirality transfer An example of axial to tetrahedral chirality transfer is shown below for the torquoselective Nazarov cyclization reaction of a chiral allenyl vinyl ketone

Firefighters go to special classes to learn firefighting skills They earn certificates after taking the classes One major class is called DoD Fire Emergency Services Training  

The Bongo is a nocturnal antelope It has two subspecies the western or lowland bongo and the eastern or mountain bongo The western bongo is near threatened and the mountain bongo is critically endangered Bongos eat plants They live in forests in Africa Kenya is the only place eastern bongos live in the wild Like the west African giraffe the eastern or mountain bongo is one of the most threatened animals in Africa Bongos live in both captivity and the wild

As bongos grow their horns appear Both male and female bongos have horns 

A dyotropic reaction is a type of chemical reaction It is when an organic compound changes its structure Two substituents jump from one place on the molecule to another It is a pericyclic valence isomerization when two sigma bonds move at the same time to a new place on the same molecule Dyotropic reactions are important in organic chemistry They can explain how certain reactions work Dyotropic reactions can be a useful step in making large and complicated molecules Dyotropic reactions were first described by Manfred T Reetz in 1971 The name dyotropic reaction comes from the Greek word dyo meaning two Rearrangement means that the reaction changes the bonds between atoms on a single molecule

In a type I reaction two migrating groups trade their relative positions A type II reaction  involves migration to new bonding sites without positional interchange

In type I rearrangements the two migrating groups are oriented trans to each other The reaction leaves both groups on the opposite sides The first example of a dyotropic rearrangement involving a carbon carbon bond was reported by Cyril A Grob and Saul Winstein They saw the exchange of two bromine atoms in a certain steroid 

In a simple example the two bromine atoms in 3 tert butyl trans 12 dibromohexane mutarotate by heating In the transition state both bromine atoms connect symmetrically two both carbon atoms on opposite sides and the reaction is concerted Chemists have also investigated stepwise mechanisms in dyotropic reactions 

In organic synthesis an important dyotropic reaction is the conversion of 4 substituted gamma lactones to butyrolactones Type I dyotropic rearrangements also occur around carbon oxygen bonds One example is using heat to change RRSi1R3C O Si2R3 to RRSi2R3C O Si1R3 Another example is the 12 Wittig rearrangement Dyotropic reactions can also happen with N O bonds or N N bonds

Type II rearrangements often involve two hydogen atoms moving along a carbon skeleton This reaction type can be found in certain transfer hydrogenations An example is hydrogen transfer in syn sesquinorbornene disulfones

The DielsAlder reaction is a chemical reaction between organic compounds The reaction causes the compounds to form a new six sided compound This is called a cyclohexene A conjugated diene joins with an alkene to make the cyclohexene This compound looks like a ring 

This reaction was discovered by Otto Diels and Kurt Alder in 1928 In 1950 they were given the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work on this reaction The DA reaction is very useful as it means cyclohexenes can be made with very little energy Cyclohexenes are used to make complex organic molecules One of the first uses of the DA reaction was to make insecticides 

The DA reaction makes a new hexagonal ring shaped compound A compound with two double bonds which are one carbon atom apart from each other is joined to another compound with at least one double bond A DA reaction can also happen if some of the atoms in the newly formed ring are not carbon Some of the DA reactions are reversible The reaction caused during this breaking up of the cyclic system is called the retro DielsAlder These retro DielsAlder compounds are often seen when they are analyzed by mass spectrometry

Some chemists call the Diels Alder reaction the Mona Lisa of organic reactions Like the simple smile on the painting the reaction may be far more complex than chemists have so far discovered

Lewis acids act as catalysts by coordinating to the dienophile The complexed dienophile becomes more electrophilic and more reactive toward the diene This increases the rate and often the stereoselectivity of a DA reaction

Dagestan is a federal subject of Russia in the Caucasus with capital in Makhachkala Dagestan has population of 3 mln people and is inhabited by over 30 different nationalities who speak almost 30 different languages Most people of Dagestan are Muslims and belong to Shafii school of Sunni Islam 

Dagestan takes its name from two Persian words Dag  meaning  Mountain and Stan  meaning  Land

Theoretical chemistry tries to explain data from chemistry experiments It uses mathematics and computers Theoretical chemistry predicts what happens when atoms combine to form molecules It also predicts chemical properties of molecules An important part of theoretical chemistry is quantum chemistry This is using quantum mechanics to understand valency Other important parts include molecular dynamics statistical thermodynamics and theories of electrolyte solutions reaction networks polymerization and catalysis 

Theoretical chemists use a wide range of tools These tools include analytical models and computational and numerical simulations 

Theorists in chemistry create theoretical models Then they find things that experimental chemists can measure from those models This helps chemists to look for data that can prove a model not true The data helps to chose between several different or opposite models

Theorists also try to generate or modify models to fit any new data If the data can not fit the model chemists try to make the smallest change to the model to fit the data In some cases chemists throw out a model if a lot of data will not fit over time

Theoretical chemistry uses physics to explain or predict chemical observations In recent years it has been mainly about quantum chemistry The main parts of theoretical chemistry are electronic structure dynamics and statistical mechanics 

All of these areas are used in the process of predicting chemical reactivities Other less central research areas include the mathematical description of bulk chemistry in various phases Theoretical chemists want to explain chemical kinetics

Scientists call a lot of this work computational chemistry Computational chemistry usually uses theoretical chemistry to work on industrial and practical problems Examples of computational chemistry are projects to approximate chemical measurements such as certain types of post Hartree Fock Density Functional Theory semiempirical methods or force field methods Some chemical theorists use statistical mechanics to create a link between the microscopic phenomena of the quantum world and the macroscopic bulk properties of systems

Modern theoretical chemistry started when Austrian physicist Erwin Schrdinger discovered the Schrdinger equation Currently chemists use Quantum Field Theory and Nonequilibrium Green Function Theory to successfully explain experimental data At first theoretical chemistry helped understand simple chemical reactions Today using density functional theory and molecular mechanics theoretical chemistry now helps biochemistry condensed matter physics nanotechnology or molecular biology

Historically researchers use theoretical chemistry to study

A pebble is a piece of rock with a particle size of 4 to 64 millimetres They are often made of flint

Pebbles are larger than granules and smaller than cobbles A rock made predominantly of pebbles is termed a conglomerate Pebble tools are among the earliest known man made artifacts dating from the Palaeolithic period of human history

A beach composed chiefly of surface pebbles is commonly termed a shingle beach This type of beach resists wave erosion and has ecological niches which can provide habitat for animals and plants

In psychology compensation is a way people hide something that they cannot do well by doing something else really well They may not even be aware that they are doing it Compensation can hide real or imagined problems and personal or physical inferiority However it does not really solve the cause of the problem Positive compensations may help a person overcome difficulties But negative compensations do not and can even make the problems worse

There are two kinds of negative compensation

A well known example of failing overcompensation can be seen in people going through a midlife crisis Approaching midlife many people lack the energy to maintain their psychological defenses including their compensatory acts

Alfred Adler founder of individual psychology used the word compensation in relation inferiority feelings In his book Study of Organ Inferiority and Its Physical Compensation he wrote if a person feels inferior then they will try to compensate for it somewhere else 

Adlers reason to explore this was from his own experience He was shy and yet he pushed himself to give lectures 

Adler also transferred this idea of compensation to psychic training

Narcissistic people by compensation theory hide their feelings of low self esteem by

Narcissistic children try to compensate for their jealousy and anger by fantasizing about

Christopher Lasch an American historian and social critic wrote in his book The Culture of Narcissism that North American society in the 1970s was narcissistic The narcissistic society

Therefore it is fascinated with fame

Consumption can be an example of compensation Examples

A shingle beach is a beach which is formed of pebbles These beaches strongly resist erosion by waves

This beach landform is quite common in Western Europe because the pebbles come from the lines of flint in the chalk Chesil Bank is an example When the chalk erodes the tough flint stays as pebbles

Other examples are found in Bahrain North America and in a number of other world regions 

On the east coast of New Zealands South Island there are mixed shingle and sand fans amongst braided rivers The ecosystems formed by this mix of pebbles and sand allow colonization by rare and endangered species

Puddingstone is a kind of sedimentary rock It is formed when pebbles perhaps from a shingle beach are cemented together by silica coming out of solution

The rock which forms is extremely hard and resistant to wear It is used for grindstones and building The pebbles are usually made of flint and both they and the matrix are made of silica

An eponym is a persons name that is used to name something else This is common in science politics and medicine

An injective function or an injection is a function in math that does not map more than one element from its domain to its codomain An injective function is often called one to one because there is only one way to reach any one element in the range 

An injection does not always reach every element in its codomain The special ones that do are called bijections For example mapping houses to their pets is an injective function since a pet cannot belong to more than one house but not every animal belongs to a house at all

Lorient is a commune It is found in the Morbihan department in the west of France

Lorient is twinned with

Bongo may mean

In other uses

A surjective function or surjection is a function in math which maps to every element in its codomain from its domain A surjective function is often called onto because the range fits perfectly on to the codomain

A surjection does not always have unique paths to some of the elements in its range The special ones that always do are called bijections For example mapping names to people is a surjection because every person has a name but many people have the same name

The codomain of a function is the set where any output of the function will be A surjective function can reach any element of its codomain but not all functions do 

The range of a function is the set of elements that the function outputs 

Organic reactions are chemical reactions involving organic compounds The basic organic chemistry reaction types are addition reactions elimination reactions substitution reactions pericyclic reactions rearrangement reactions photochemical reactions and redox reactions In organic synthesis organic reactions build new organic molecules Organic reactions produce many man made chemicals such as drugs plastics food additives and fabrics

Shikasta is a 1979 science fiction novel The full title is Re Colonised Planet 5 Shikasta British Nobel Prize in Literature winner Doris Lessing wrote it as the first book in her five book Canopus in Argos series Alfred A Knopf published it first in the United States in October 1979 Jonathan Cape published the book in the United Kingdom in November 1979 Shikasta is also the name of the fictional planet featured in the novel 

The book has a subtitle Personal psychological historical documents relating to visit by Johor Emissary 87th of the Period of the Last Days The novel is the history of the planet Shikasta under the influence of three galactic empires Canopus Sirius and their shared enemy Puttiora The book is a series of reports by Canopean visitors to Shikasta They record what happens on the planet which is very similar to Earth The novel shows the Earths prehistory how things became worse the Century of Destruction and the Apocalypse

Shikasta uses stories and images from the Old Testament and is influenced by spiritual and mystical themes in Sufism Lessing had become interested in this Islamic belief system in the mid 1960s The book was a major shift of focus in Lessings writing from realism to science fiction Many of her readers were unhappy with the change Critics gave the book both good and bad reviews Some were impressed by the way the book showed a wide view of humanity and the universe One reviewer called it a brave and disturbing work from one of the worlds great living writers Others reviewers disliked the novel because it was depressing and humanity had no free will Peoples lives were controlled by galactic empires

The story of Shikasta is retold in the third book of the Canopus series The Sirian Experiments In that book the story is told from the point of view of Sirius Shikasta appears again in the fourth book in the series The Making of the Representative for Planet 8 The Zones that are briefly mentioned in Shikasta are the subject of the second book in the series The Marriages Between Zones Three Four and Five

HOMO stands for highest occupied molecular orbital LUMO stands for lowest unoccupied molecular orbital The energy difference between the HOMO and LUMO is termed the HOMO LUMO gap HOMO and LUMO are sometimes referred to as frontier orbitals

Each molecular orbital has a calculated energy level Chemists sort the molecular orbitals by energy levels Chemists assume that the electrons will occupy the lowest energy level MOs first For example if a molecule has enough electrons to fill 15 MOs the 15 MOs with the lowest energy levels will be occupied The 15th MO on the list would be called the highest occupied molecular orbital and the 16th MO on the list would be the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital The difference in the HUMOs energy level and the LUMOs energy level is called the band gap The band gap can sometimes serve as a measure of the excitability of the molecule the smaller the energy the more easily a molecules electrons will be excited For example this can help predict whether a substance will have luminescence

A SOMO is a singly occupied molecular orbital such as half filled HOMO of a radical

Roald Hoffmann is an American theoretical chemist who won the 1981 Nobel Prize in Chemistry He currently teaches at Cornell University in Ithaca New York

In organic chemistry and biochemistry substituent is the name for a single atom or for a group of atoms that take the position of another atom in a molecule They replace this atom This reaction is called a substitution reaction The atom or group of atoms that gets replaced is called the leaving group

The terms substituent side chain group branch or pendant group are used in the same way to describe branches from a parent structure These terms have different meanings in polymer chemistry In polymers side chains extend from a backbone structure while they are attached to the alpha carbon atoms of the amino acid backbone in proteins 

Organic chemistry has rules for naming compounds with substituent groups The substituent group is listed first with a suffix to describe how it is attached to the main carbon chain The suffix yl is used when naming organic compounds that contain a single bond replacing one hydrogen ylidene and ylidyne are used for double bonds and triple bonds respectively When naming hydrocarbons that contain a substituent position numbers may be used These number will indicate which carbon atom the substituent is attached to One case where this information is needed is that of isomers

The phrases most substituted and least substituted are often used to describe molecules and predict their products For example

In a structural diagram or formula the letters R or X are used to represent a substituent group An organic substituent such as methyl ethyl aryl can be written as R This is a generic placeholder The R derived from radical or rest The R can represent as many atoms as the author wants The first to use this symbol was Charles Frdric Gerhardt in 1844

The symbol X can represent electronegative substituents such as the halides

Till Eulenspiegels Merry Pranks is a very well known piece of music for orchestra by Richard Strauss It is a tone poem In this work Richard Strauss describes the adventures of Till Eulenspiegel who was the character in a series of stories written in Germany many years ago Till Eulenspiegel was a kind of folk hero He was a naughty boy who got up to all kinds of tricks The music is very humorous and describes his adventures

The music is played by a large orchestra There is a small clarinet that describes the character of Till Till is also represented by a French horn

The music starts with the main theme which is like saying Once upon a time The horn plays one of Tills themes and this is taken up by the orchestra The small clarinet is then heard sounding like Till laughing He rides his horse through the market and knocks lots of things off the stalls then flirts with the girls

Till gets on his horse again Then suddenly there is a funeral march Till has been caught and he is sentenced to death Till pleads to be let free and tries to joke his way out of his troubles but the executioner takes no notice Till is taken to the gallows the flutes rattle as he reaches the top The small clarinet describes his death scream and then he is executed strings playing pizzicato There is a short silence then the music returns to the opening Once upon a Time theme but the music finishes with a little joke as if saying that someone like Till can never be destroyed

Beatov s slvy is something like the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Czech Radio Beat appreciates the greatest legend of Czech rock music who greatly influenced the rock scene Nominations are preparing music publicists on the final classification Beat Hall of Fame radio listeners decide their vote

In organic chemistry a diene or diolefin is a hydrocarbon that contains two carbon pi bonds Conjugated dienes are functional groups with a general formula of CnH2n 2 Dienes and alkynes are functional isomers Dienes occur occasionally in nature but are widely used in the polymer industry

Dienes can be divided into three classes depending on the relative location of the double bonds 

Compounds that contain more than two double bonds are called polyenes Polyenes and dienes share many of their properties

An important reaction for conjugated dienes is the DielsAlder reaction Many specialized dienes have been developed to exploit this reactivity for the synthesis of natural products eg Danishefskys diene

In chemistry a conjugated system is a system of connected p orbitals with delocalized electrons Conjugated systems are created by several multiple bonds each separated by single bonds In general conjugated systems may lower the overall energy of the molecule and increase how steady it is They can contain lone pairs radicals or carbenium ions The compound may be cyclic acyclic linear or mixed In most cases the atoms in a molecule are held together by single bonds Molecules which have a conjugaated system have special properties created by the greater sharing of the delocalized electrons among many atoms

Conjugation is the overlap of one p orbital with another across a sigma bond that is in between

A conjugated system has a region of overlapping p orbitals bridging the single bonds that are between They allow a delocalization of pi electrons across all the adjacent aligned p orbitals The pi electrons do not belong to a single bond or atom but rather to a group of atoms

The largest conjugated systems are in graphite conductive polymers and carbon nanotubes

Different types of molecular structures can result in conjugation For conjugation all the neighboring atoms in a chain must have an available p orbital In many cases conjugated systems are a series of a single bonds each followed by a double bond Other systems exist For example furan is a five membered ring with two alternating double bonds and an oxygen in position 1 The Oxygen in furan has two lone pairs one of which fills a p orbital on that position The lone pair electron makes conjugation possible on a five membered ring The presence of a nitrogen in the ring can be a source of pi orbitals needed for conjugation Also pi orbitals needed for conjugation can come from substituent groups to the ring like a carbonyl group an imine group a vinyl group or an anion

Cyclic compounds can be partly or completely conjugated Annulenes completely conjugated monocyclic hydrocarbons may be aromatic non aromatic or anti aromatic

Conjugated planar cyclic compounds that follow Hckels rule are aromatic and have an unusual stability A well known example is benzene Benzene has a system of six electrons above and six below the flat planar ring

Not all compounds with alternating double and single bonds are aromatic For example cyclooctatetraene has alternating single and double bonds The molecule usually goes into a bath tub shape Because the p orbitals of the molecule do not move themselves into the right place well in this non planar molecule the electrons are not as easily shared between the carbon atoms The molecule is still conjugated but it is is not aromatic or antiaromatic In such cases the lowest energy level for the molecule is not a conjugated system

Conjugated systems have special properties that give their compounds strong colors Many pigments have conjugated systems For example beta carotene has a strong orange color This comes from its long conjugated hydrocarbon chain When an electron in beta carotenes conjugated system absorbs a photon of light of the right wavelength the electron can be promoted to a higher energy level Most of these electron shifts are from one conjugated system molecular orbital with a even kind of symmetry to an other conjugated system MO with an odd kind of symmetry Electrons from other states can also be promoted to a system MO as often happens in charge transfer complexes Often an HOMO to LUMO change is made by an electron if it is allowed by the selection rules for electromagnetic transitions Conjugated systems of fewer than eight conjugated double bonds absorb only in the ultraviolet area and are colorless to the human eye With every double bond added the system absorbs photons of longer wavelength and the compound ranges from yellow to red in color The color of blue or green compounds is not caused by conjugated double bonds alone

Chemists can measure the absorption of light by using UVVIS spectroscopy Such measurements are the basis for the entire field of photochemistry

Conjugated systems that are widely used for synthetic pigments and dyes are diazo and azo compounds and phthalocyanine compounds

Conjugated systems have a low energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO that corresponds to the frequency of visible light Conjugated systems also take in or give out electrons easily Phthalocyanines like Phthalo Blue and Phthalo Green often contain a transition metal ion Phthalocyanines exchange an electron with the complexed transition metal ion that easily changes its oxidation state Pigments and dyes like these tranfers electric charges from one part to another Because they selectively absorb photons in the visible spectral region each compound has its own strong characteristic color

Porphyrins have conjugated molecular ring systems that appear in many enzymes of biological systems As a ligand porphyrin forms many complexes with metallic ions One example is hemoglobin Hemoglobin colors blood red Hemoglobin has a bound iron atom Hemoglobin transports oxygen to the cells of human bodies Things that are made of porphyrin metal often have strong colors A similar molecular structural ring unit called chlorin is similarly complexed with magnesium instead of iron when forming part of the most common forms of chlorophyll molecules giving them a green color Another similar macrocycle unit is corrin which complexes with cobalt when forming part of cobalamin molecules constituting Vitamin B12 which is intensely red The corrin unit has six conjugated double bonds but is not conjugated all the way around its macrocycle ring 

Conjugated systems are the main things that make up chromophores Chromophores are light absorbing parts of a molecule that can cause a compound to have a visible color Chromophores are often present in various organic compounds and sometimes present in polymers that are colored or glow in the dark Chromophores often consist of a series of conjugated bonds andor ring systems which can include C C CC CO or NN bonds Many times chromophores have aromatic rings 

Conjugated chromophores are found in many organic compounds including azo dyes compounds in fruits and vegetables Conjugated chromophores are found in the photoreceptors of the eye They also include the following pharmaceutical compounds

Alder was born in the industrial area of Knigshtte Silesia He received his early schooling there Alder left the area for political reasons when Knigshtte became part of Poland in 1922 He studied chemistry at the University of Berlin from 1922 and later at the University of Kiel where his earned a PhD in 1926 for work supervised by Diels

In 1930 Alder was appointed reader for chemistry at Kiel and promoted to lecturer in 1934 In 1936 he left Kiel to join I G Farben Industrie at Leverkusen where he worked on synthetic rubber In 1940 he was appointed Professor of Experimental Chemistry and Chemical Technology at the University of Cologne and Director of the Institute of Chemistry there Throughout this time and despite the many obstacles to original research in Europe at the time he continued a systematic program of investigations of his particular interests in the synthesis of organic compounds In all he published more than 151 papers in this field  

Alder received several honorary degrees and other awards most famously the 1950 Nobel Prize in Chemistry which he shared with his teacher Diels for their work on what is now known as the DielsAlder reaction The lunar crater Alder is named in his honour The insecticide aldrin created through a DielsAlder reaction is also named for him

Kenichi Fukui shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1981 with Roald Hoffmann They worked separately on the mechanisms of chemical reactions His prize winning work focused on the role of frontier orbitals in chemical reactions He studied how molecules share loosely bonded electrons which occupy the frontier orbitals that is the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital and the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital

Fukui was the eldest of three sons of Ryokichi Fukui a foreign trade merchant and Chie Fukui He was born in Nara Japan While Fukui was a student between 1938 and 1941 his became interested in quantum mechanics and in Erwin Schrdingers equation He also had developed the belief that a breakthrough in science occurs through the unexpected fusion of remotely related fields

Following his graduation from Kyoto Imperial University in 1941 Fukui worked at the Army Fuel Laboratory of Japan during World War II In 1943 he was appointed a lecturer in fuel chemistry at Kyoto Imperial University and began his career as an experimental organic chemist

He was professor of physical chemistry at Kyoto University from 1951 to 1982 president of the Kyoto Institute of Technology between 1982 and 1988 and a member of the International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science and honorary member of the International Academy of Science

In 1952 Fukui with his young collaborators T Yonezawa and H Shingu presented his molecular orbital theory of reactivity in aromatic hydrocarbons which appeared in the Journal of Chemical Physics At that time his did not get a lot of attention from other chemists Fukui observed in his Nobel lecture in 1981 that his original paper received a number of controversial comments This was in a sense understandable because for lack of my experiential ability the theoretical foundation for this conspicuous result was obscure or rather improperly given

More chemists adopted the frontier orbitals concept after the 1965 publication by Robert B Woodward and Roald Hoffmann of the WoodwardHoffmann stereoselection rules which could predict the reaction rates between two reactants These rules depicted in diagrams explain why some pairs react easily while other pairs do not The basis for these rules lies in the symmetry properties of the molecules and especially in the disposition of their electrons Fukui had acknowledged in his Nobel lecture that It is only after the remarkable appearance of the brilliant work by Woodward and Hoffmann that I have become fully aware that not only the density distribution but also the nodal property of the particular orbitals have significance in such a wide variety of chemical reactions

What is remarkable about Fukuis significant contributions is that he developed his ideas before chemists had access to large computers for modeling Apart from exploring the theory of chemical reactions Fukuis contributions to chemistry also include the statistical theory of gelation organic synthesis by inorganic salts and polymerization kinetics

Woodwards rules are a set of rules which give information about the wavelength of the absorption maximum in an ultraviolet visible spectrum of a compound The rules are named after Robert Burns Woodward He was a Harvard University chemistry professor who won the Nobel Prize in chemistry The rules are sometimes called the Woodward Fieser rules to also honor Louis Fieser The rules build the prediction on the type of chromophores present the substituents on the chromophores and changes due to the solvent Examples are conjugated carbonyl compounds conjugated dienes and polyenes

One set of Woodward Fieser rules for dienes is shown in table one A diene is either homoannular with both double bonds contained in one ring or heteroannular with two double bonds distributed between two rings

These rules predict the UV absorption maximum of compounds Here are two examples

In the compound on the left the base value is 214 nm This diene group has 4 alkyl substituents and the double bond in one ring is exocyclic to the other In the compound on the right the diene is homoannular with 4 alkyl substituents Both double bonds in the central B ring are exocyclic with respect to rings A and C

Schooling and shoaling is a kind of collective animal behaviour by fish Any group of fish that stay together for social reasons is said to be shoaling and if the shoal is swimming in the same direction together it is schoolingp365 About one quarter of fish shoal all their lives and about one half of fish shoal for part of their lives

Fish get many benefits from shoaling These include defence against predators if fish swim in schools it is less likely any one of them will be eaten Also it may help a fish find food and a mate The school may even swim faster than a lone fish 

Fish generally prefer larger shoals shoalmates of their own species shoalmates similar in size and appearance to themselves healthy fish and kin

Any shoal member which stands out in appearance may be targeted by predators This may explain why fish prefer to shoal with individuals that resemble themselves This is called the oddity effect

Some fish spend most of their time schooling Tuna herring and anchovy spend all of their time shoaling or schooling and become agitated if separated from the group Others such as Atlantic cod school only some of the time

Shoaling fish can shift into a disciplined and coordinated school then shift back to an amorphous shoal within seconds Such shifts are triggered by changes of activity from feeding resting travelling or avoiding predators

When schooling fish stop to feed they break ranks and become shoals Shoals are more vulnerable to predator attack The shape a shoal or school takes depends on the type of fish and what the fish are doing Schools that are travelling can form long thin lines or squares or ovals or amoeboid shapes Fast moving schools usually form a wedge shape while shoals that are feeding tend to become circular

Small fish which are preyed on by larger fish seabirds and marine mammals Small fish form schools and may swim with their mouths open to filter feed on plankton These schools can become huge moving along coastlines and migrating across open oceans The shoals are concentrated fuel resources for the great marine predators

These immense gatherings fuel the ocean food web Most forage fish are pelagic fish which means they form their schools in open water and not on or near the bottom The predators are keenly focused on the shoals acutely aware of their numbers and whereabouts and make migrations themselves often in schools of their own that can span thousands of miles to connect with or stay connected with them

Herring are among the more spectacular schooling fish They aggregate together in huge numbers The largest schools are often formed during migrations by merging with smaller schools Chains of schools one hundred kilometres long have been observed of mullet migrating in the Caspian Sea Radakov estimated herring schools in the North Atlantic can occupy up to 48 cubic kilometres with fish densities between 05 and 10 fishcubic metre Thats about three billion fish in one school These schools move along coastlines and cross the open oceans Herring schools have very precise arrangements which allow the school to maintain relatively constant cruising speeds Herrings have excellent hearing and their schools react very fast to a predator The herrings keep a certain distance from a moving scuba diver or cruising predator like a killer whale forming a vacuole which looks like a doughnut from a spotter plane

Many species of large predatory fish also school including many highly migratory fish such as tuna and some ocean going sharks Cetaceans such as dolphins porpoises and whales operate in organised social groups called pods

Schooling behaviour is generally described as a trade off between the anti predator benefits and the costs of increased competition for food 

Schooling is a classic example of emergence where there are properties that are possessed by the school but not by the individual fish Emergent properties give an evolutionary advantage to members of the school which non members do not receive

Fish are in danger of being eaten if they are separated from the school Several anti predator functions of fish schools have been proposed

Schooling forage fish are subject to constant attacks by predators An example is the attacks that take place during the African sardine run The African sardine run is a spectacular migration by millions of silvery sardines along the southern coastline of Africa In terms of biomass the sardine run could rival East Africas great wildebeest migration

Sardines have a short life cycle living only two or three years Adult sardines about two years old mass on the Agulhas Bank where they spawn during spring and summer releasing tens of thousands of eggs into the water The adult sardines then make their way in hundreds of shoals towards the sub tropical waters of the Indian Ocean A larger shoal might be 7 kilometres long 15 kilometres wide and 30 meters deep Huge numbers of sharks dolphins tuna sailfish Cape fur seals and even killer whales congregate and follow the shoals creating a feeding frenzy along the coastline

When threatened sardines instinctively group together and create massive bait balls Bait balls can be up to 20 meters in diameter They are short lived seldom lasting longer than 20 minutes

The fish eggs left behind at the Agulhas Banks drift north west with the current into waters off the west coast where the larvae develop into juvenile fish When they are old enough they aggregate into dense shoals and migrate southwards returning to the Agulhas banks in order to restart the cycle

US Route 40 is a federal highway from Park City Utah to Atlantic City New Jersey It is 2286 miles long and passes through twelve states It used to go from Park City to Reno Nevada and San Francisco California but that route is now part of Interstate 80 Much of the eastern part of US Route 40 from Vandalia Illinois to Cumberland Maryland was part of the National Road This part has been around since 1839 Part of US Route 40 was also called the Lincoln Highway

US Route 40 passes or passed through many cities Some of these are

The current capitals are Denver Topeka Indianapolis and Columbus Vandalia was a former capital of Illinois Zanesville was a former capital of Ohio and Wheeling was a former capital of West Virginia 

Physical chemistry uses physics to study chemical systems It studies them at macroscopic atomic subatomic and particulate levels It looks at concepts like motion energy force time thermodynamics quantum chemistry statistical mechanics and dynamics

Physical chemistry is not the same as chemical physics Physical chemistry is mostly a macroscopic or supra molecular science The majority of physical chemistry concepts relate to bulk properties rather than to molecularatomic structure alone These include chemical equilibrium and colloids

Some of the relationships that physical chemistry tries to resolve include the effects of

The term physical chemistry was first used by Mikhail Lomonosov in 1752 He presented a lecture course with the title A Course in True Physical Chemistry to the students of Petersburg University 

Modern physical chemistry was developed in the 1860s to 1880s with work on chemical thermodynamics electrolytes in solutions chemical kinetics and other subjects In 1876 Josiah Willard Gibbs wrote an article called On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances This paper introduced many of the main parts of physical chemistry such as Gibbs energy chemical potentials Gibbs phase rule Other important discoveries include Heike Kamerlingh Onnes work on enthalpy and macromolecular processes 

The first scientific journal about physical chemistry was the German journal Zeitschrift fr Physikalische Chemie It was founded in 1887 by Wilhelm Ostwald and Jacobus Henricus van t Hoff  The two chemists and Svante August Arrhenius were the leading men in physical chemistry in the late 19th century and early 20th century All three were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry

Important discoveries were made in the 20th century These include applying statistical mechanics to chemical systems and Irving Langmuirs work on colloids and surface chemistry In the 1930s Linus Pauling and others applied quantum mechanics to develop quantum chemistry Chemical theories have grown with new experimental discoveries New forms of spectroscopy started in the 20th century including infrared spectroscopy microwave spectroscopy EPR spectroscopy and NMR spectroscopy

Physical chemistry also improved with discoveries in nuclear chemistry especially in isotope separation This happened around the time before and during World War II Chemists discovered important facts in astrochemistry

These journals cover physical chemistry

A historical journal that covered both chemistry and physics was Annales de chimie et de physique It started in 1789 and was published under the name given here from 18151914

The founders of the band played before 1977 in clubs of Vienna In 1977 Palden won a boogie woogie contest The first prize was a record contract They decided to form a band which they named Mojo Blues Band The line up was

Being the only blues band in Vienna they were often booked as backing band for blues artists who were touring in Austria They played for example with Johnny Shines J B Hutto Charlie Musselwhite Louisiana Red Sunnyland Slim Champion Jack Dupree Homesick James Honeyboy Edwards Leon Thomas Katie Webster Hal Singer Jan Harrington and Eddie Clearwater They also played together with Axel Zwingenberger This is documented on CDs

In 1980 they teamed with Dana Gillespie and changed their style more to Rhythm n Blues At the early 1990s their song Alligator Walk became a hit in the US Shag 8 a special dance scene Following this they toured North and South Carolina 1989 they visited Chicago and came back with 16 hours material they have recorded with musicians from Chicago The CD The Wild Taste of Chicago was made out of this tapes 1993 Christian Dozzler left the band to form his own group So Eric Trauner had to learn playing the harp

2001 the band played her last concert consisting of

Peter Mller founded the label Styx Records But soon Trauner formed the band again Members are

Ozone is a gas that is present in the ozone layer in the stratosphere of the Earth There it will absorb almost all ultraviolet light which is harmful to many organisms The term Ozone depletion can refer to a number distict but related phenomena

The details of polar ozone hole formation differ from that of mid latitude thinning but the most important process in both is catalytic destruction of ozone by atomic halogens The main source of these halogen atoms in the stratosphere is photodissociation of man made Halocarbon refrigerants These compounds are transported into the stratosphere after being emitted at the surface Both types of ozone depletion were observed to increase as emissions of Halocarbons increased

CFCs and other substances contributing to this effect are referred to as ozone depleting substances Since the ozone layer prevents most harmful UVB wavelengths of ultraviolet light from passing through the Earths atmosphere observed and projected decreases in ozone have generated worldwide concern As a result the Montreal Protocol has been adopted The treaty bans the production of CFCs halons as and other ozone depleting chemicals such as carbon tetrachloride and trichloroethane The biological consequences of this change in ozone levels may include an increases in skin cancer cataracts damage to plants and the reduction of plankton populations in the ocean

The estimates how quickly the ozone layer will regenerate vary by about two decades NASA estimated in 2006 that it wil take to 2068 for the ozone layer in Antarctica to recover to the level before human induced thinning According to the World Meteorology Organisation the state of the ozone layer over Antarctica will not change noticeably in the next twenty years The state before 1980 will be reached between 2060 and 2075 25 years later than predicted in 2002 Over the Arctic there will be bigger losses in ozone over the next fifteen years esp in cold winters For the Arctic regions the state before 1980 will be reached around 2050

Photodissociation photolysis or photodecomposition is a chemical reaction in which a chemical compound is broken down by photons One or more photons interact with the target molecule

Photodissociation is not limited to visible light Any photon with sufficient energy can affect the chemical bonds of a chemical compound Since a photons energy is inversely proportional to its wavelength electromagnetic waves with the energy of visible light or higher such as ultraviolet light x rays and gamma rays are usually involved in such reactions

One example where this is used is the Light dependent reaction of photosynthesis

The Audi Cup 2011 was a two day tournament that took place in Munich Germany The tournament featured four teams AC Milan SC Internacional FC Bayern Munich and FC Barcelona The winners of the tournament were FC Barcelona defeating Bayern Munich 2 0 SC Internacional took third place defeating AC Milan 2  2

Vector calculus is a branch of mathematics that investigates vector fields and how they change over time Vector calculus usually studies two or three dimensional vector fields but can be used in higher dimensions too It is a part of the study of multivariable calculus Vector calculus is useful in physics and engineering because of how it can look at electromagnetic and gravitational fields

A vector field is an arrangement of vectors over an area They can exist in any dimension Vector fields are useful for describing things that we cannot see such as magnetic attraction and gravity Vector calculus is the study of vector fields

Multivariable calculus is the extension of regular one dimensional calculus to more that one dimension Most of the concepts from calculus still work in more than one dimension Special multivariable uses include partial dervatives or differentiation with only one dimension at a time and multiple integration or integrating over more than one dimension

Hockenheim is a German town in northwest Baden Wrttemberg about 20 km south of Mannheim It is in the Upper Rhine valley on the tourist routes of the Baden Asparagus Route and the Bertha Benz Memorial Route The town is known for its motor racing circuit the Hockenheimring

In 1984 an old brick kiln was found during an excavation in Hockenheim The kiln had stamped bricks inside it from the Roman Empire The Roman Legio XIV Gemina was near Mainz from 71 AD until 92 AD The bricks indicate an early settlement in the Hockenheim area

Hockenheim was first mentioned 769 as Ochinheim in a document of the Lorsch Codex The name Hockenheim was first used in official documents in 1238 During the Middle Ages Hockenheim was owned by several local authorities

In the 17th century Hockenheim was severely destroyed twice by French troops In 1644 during the Thirty Years War and in 1674 during the Franco Dutch War Tobacco was brought to the area by the French During this time the growing of hops started to be replaced with tobacco In 1803 Hockenheim was merged into Baden The tobacco crop grew well and prospered and Hockenheim was awarded town rights on 22 July 1895

At the beginning of the 20th century asparagus growing replaced most of the remaining hops growing On 29 May 1932 the Hockenheimring opened with a motorcycle race In January 1973 Hockenheim was assigned to the new Rhein Neckar Kreis

The town is led by the Lord Mayor The Lord Mayer is elected every 8 years by the population This office has been held by Dieter Gummer since 2004 The local council of Hockenheim consists of 22 members and the Lord Mayor presiding the council

In 1975 the Hockenheim government agreed upon a municipal association with the neighboring villages Altluheim Neuluheim and Reilingen

Adopted in 1609 the coat of arms of Hockenheim has diagonally crossed silver hooks in a sign below a crowned golden lion The lion is the animal of the Electoral Palatinate to which Hockenheim belonged the hooks are probably derived from the place name The form of the symbols was changed several times but has been specified in its current form by municipal law since 1895

Video High Density was a videodisc format which was marketed predominantly in Japan by JVC There was also an audio only variant Audio High Density

VHD discs are 25 cm in diameter and store up to 60 minutes of video per side Each disc is stored in a plastic case similar to a CEDs case so that the user could not touch the disc itself The entire case was put into the player which would take out the disc and then the now empty case could be taken back out After one side has finished playing the disc would have to be taken out flipped and put back in to continue playing

Similar to the RCAs CED the signal on the VHD is recorded by varying capacitance on the disc However unlike the CED the VHD does not contain any groves and the needle is made of diamond instead of titanium Instead of having grooves the needle is kept on track electronically so the needle does not have to actually touch the disc therefor resulting in less wear on the disc and on the needle In one rotation of the disc 2 frames of picture and audio were read

VHD was designed to be very interactive and was used in some video game systems as well as in car engine diagnostic tools

The VHD was first demonstrated in 1978 and after many advertisements in National Geographic magazines It was eventually released in Japan and in the USA in 1983 However by this time both Laserdisc and CED were already not selling well compared to the VHS and Betamax VCR systems As a result of this JVC did not let the VHD be sold in North America but made it available to the general public in Japan and commercially in the UK and the US

During the time the VHD was made it was mostly used for karaoke systems anime video games and interactive training systems In the UK the VHD was used for training demonstration and fault diagnostics

In Japan a 3D version of the VHD using double speed discs and special glasses

The VHD was not very successful as a consumer product but it sold well for commercial purposes In Japan the CED is still somewhat popular and the discs and players are both still collected

The McLafferty rearrangement is a organic reaction seen in mass spectrometry A mass spectrometer breaks apart the molecule being studied The molecule breaks apart in consistent ways that chemists can predict Most times a carbon carbon bond breaks and the atoms do not jump across the break between the fragments The McLafferty rearrangement is an example of a hydrogen atom jumping to the other fragment as a part of the process of the bond breaking It happens in an organic molecule containing a keto group

The American chemist Fred McLafferty was the first to describe the reaction in 1959

The keto group undergoes cleavage with the gain of the hydrogen atom This rearrangement may take place by a radical or ionic mechanism

Xiaotingia is an extinct genus of Archaeopteryx like theropod dinosaur from early Upper Jurassic deposits of western Liaoning China

The Chinese team claims the fossils dated to 155 million years ago whereas the Solnhofen limestone where Archaeopteyx was found is 144 mya in age The new fossil Xiaotingia cannot be dated so accurately as they were originally been purchased from a dealer Prof Xu first saw the specimen at the Shandong Tianyu Museum The other question to be asked of all early dinobirds is could they fly 

A cladistic analysis by Xu and his team showed that Xiaotingia formed a clade with Archaeopteryx the Dromaeosauridae and the Troodontidae This clade excludes other birds They thereforedefined the concepts of Deinonychosauria and Avialae so Archaeopteryx and Xiaotingia belonged to the Deinonychosauria and Archaeopteryx no longer was an avian This led to popular reports that Archaeopteryx is no longer a bird 

However the team explicitly allowed for a traditional Aves with Archaeopteryx as a specifier Such a clade would in their opinion include the Deinonychosauria

A double bond in chemistry is when two chemical elements are joined together in a chemical bond and share four bonding electrons instead of the usual two The most common double bond is between two carbon atoms and can be found in alkenes There are many types of double bonds such as in a carbonyl group with a carbon atom and an oxygen atom Other common double bonds are found in azo compounds imines and sulfoxides In skeletal formula the double bond is shown as two parallel lines between the two joined atoms When this formula is printed the equals sign is used

Double bonds are stronger than single bonds and double bonds are also shorter The bond order is two Double bonds are also electron rich which makes them more reactive

Mass spectrometry is a process that measures the mass to charge ratio of charged particles It is used to find out the mass of particles and to find the basic chemical elements in a sample or molecule It can also make clear the chemical structures of molecules such as peptides and other chemical compounds It works by ionizing chemical compounds to make electrically charged molecules or molecule pieces and measuring their mass to charge ratios

The first mass spectroscope was invented by the British physicist JJ Thomson in 1912 His student Francis Aston developed the mass spectroscope for practical use They are now widely used for agriculture brewing food processing geology petroleum exploration medical drugs and space exploration

A tornado warning is an alert that means that a tornado or funnel cloud has been spotted around the area and that people should take cover When tornadoes have been spotted the tornado sirens make sound in that place letting people know that they have been seen

Tornado warnings are higher than the warning of a Tornado watch but there is an even higher level which is a tornado emergency

A tornado watch is a warning that means that weather conditions are right for tornadoes to form So people should be careful

A tornado watch must not be confused with a tornado warningIt does not mean that a tornado has been seen it just means that you should be careful because the weather is perfect for a tornado

Dust Devils are twirling masses of air that form in the desert and send sand spinning

The Samaritan Pentateuch or Samaritan Torah is a special version of the Torah used by the Samaritans This version was created at the latest 127 BC when the Temple in Jerusalem was destroyed and the Samaritans split from the other group in the Temple As the name says this version contains the first five books of Moses or the Torah 

Scholars use the Samaritan Pentateuch when they want to find the meaning of words in the original Pentateuch or if they want to learn about the history of the different versions of the Bible Some scrolls among the Dead Sea scrolls look like Samaritan Pentateuch

Samaritan practices are based on their version of the Five Books of Moses which is slightly different from the Masoretic text or the Greek Septuagint texts Some differences are small such as the ages of different people mentioned in genealogy while others are major such as the commandment to only have one wife which appears in the Samaritan text but not in the other versions

Special importance is attached to the Abisha Scroll which is used in the Samaritan synagogue of Nablus The Samaritans claim it was penned by Abishua great grandson of Aaron thirteen years after the entry into the land of Israel under the leadership of Joshua son of Nun But modern scholars have observed that the scroll appears to include work by different scribes from different centuries with the oldest texts dating to the 12th century AD

John Jacob Astor born Johann Jakob Astor was a German American businessman He was born in Germany and moved to London and then to New York City in 1784 He started a business trading furs By 1800 he had made half a million dollars trading furs In the early 1800s his company was trading furs in Oregon His fur traders found the pass through which the Oregon Trail passes He also made money in real estate When he died in 1848 he was worth over 20 million Today his fortune would be over 100 billion The city of Astoria Oregon was named for him So was the neighborhood Astoria Queens

In chemistry pi bonds are covalent chemical bonds where the orbital path of one electron crosses with the path of another The electrons have a lobe shaped figure of eight path There are two areas of overlap as the paths overlap on both lobes Only one of the orbitals nodal planes passes through both of the involved nuclei 

The Greek letter in their name refers to p orbitals The orbital symmetry of the pi bond looks the same as the p orbital when seen down the bond axis P orbitals usually have this sort of bonding D orbitals are also assumed to use pi bonding but this is not necessarily what happens in reality The idea of bonding d orbitals fits in with the theory of hypervalence

Pi bonds are usually weaker than sigma bonds Quantum mechanics says this is because the orbital paths are parallel so there is much less overlap between the p orbitals 

Pi bonds happen when two atomic orbitals are in contact through two areas of overlap Pi bonds are more spread out bonds than the sigma bonds Electrons in pi bonds are sometimes called pi electrons Molecular fragments joined by a pi bond cannot rotate about that bond without breaking the pi bond The rotation destroys the parallel paths of the two p orbitals

Atoms that are joined by a double bond have one sigma bond and one pi bond If they are joined by a triple bond they have one sigma bond and two pi bonds

A pi bond is weaker than a sigma bond but the combination of pi and sigma bond is stronger than either bond by itself The extra strength of a multiple bond versus a single is shown in many ways The most obvious is a contraction in bond lengths For example in organic chemistry carbon carbon bond lengths are in ethane in ethylene and in acetylene More bonds make the total bond shorter and stronger

Pi bonds do not necessarily join a pair of atoms that are also sigma bonded

In certain metal complexes pi interactions between a metal atom and alkyne and alkene pi antibonding orbitals form pi bonds

In some cases of multiple bonds between two atoms there is no sigma bond at all only pi bonds Examples include diiron hexacarbonyl dicarbon and the borane B2H2 In these compounds the central bond has only pi bonding In order to get the most orbital overlap the bond distances are much shorter than expected

Chesil Beach sometimes called Chesil Bank in Dorset southern England is one of three major shingle structures in Britain Its name is derived from the Old English ceosel or cisel meaning gravel or shingle 

It is a kind of offshore barrier which has joined the mainland with Portland Bill The lagoon between the chesil and the mainland is called The Fleet or The Fleet Lagoon

The shingle beach is 18 miles long 220 yards wide and 50 feet high The beach and the Fleet are part of the Jurassic Coast a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the location for a book On Chesil Beach by Ian McEwan

At the eastern end of the beach at the village of Chiswell against the cliffs of the Isle of Portland the beach curves round sharply to form Chesil Cove This part of the beach protects the low lying village from flooding Westwards the shingle forms a straight line along the coast enclosing the Fleet a shallow tidal lagoon The lagoon is 9 feet at its deepestp99

The beach provides shelter from the prevailing winds and waves for the town of Weymouth and the village of Chiswell which would otherwise probably not exist

Varying with the Banks unbroken increase in height to convert147mft above mean high water the size of the flint and chert shingle varies from pea sized at the north west end to orange sized at the south east end It is said that smugglers who landed on the beach in the middle of the night could judge exactly where they were by the size of the shingle

A radiator is a device used to move heat from one location to another location Some radiators are used to cool things such as a car engine Some radiators are used to heat things such as a house

Most cars use a radiator to cool the engine To produce power engines must burn a fuel This creates a lot of heat If the heat is not removed the engine will overheat and stop running The radiator is connected to the engine with hoses 

A liquid flows into the engine Heat is moved from the engine to the liquid The heat moves because of Newtons Law of Cooling This law says that heat will move from something hot to something cooler

The liquid then moved into the radiator The radiator has many small tubes for the liquid to flow through Air moves around to the tubes to cool them This cools the liquid The liquid then return to the engine This is a closed loop

Many houses are located in areas that get cold Heat needs to be added to the house so the people are comfortable A radiator is placed in a room to add heat to the room The heat is created by a furnace A heating radiator works just like a cooling radiator The heat from the furnace moves to the radiator The room is cooler than the radiator The heat move from the radiator into the room to warm the room

Zvonko Bui is a terrorist mastermind of the 1976 hijacking of TWA Flight 355 and a bombing at Grand Central Station in New York For this crime he was sentenced to the mandatory minimum term of life imprisonment

Zvonko Bui was born in 1946 in Gorica a village in Bosnia and Herzegovina Yugoslavia and finished high school in Imotski At the age of 20 he emigrated to Vienna In Vienna three years later in 1969 he met the American student Julienne Eden Schultz who was studying German there and who soon thereafter became involved in the activities of the Croatian emigration In coordination with Zvonko Bui she and a friend traveled to Zagreb and threw anti Yugoslav leaflets on Republic Square after which they were arrested and imprisoned After release Julienne returned to Vienna and in 1972 Julienne and Zvonko married in Frankfurt Later they moved to the US where he became a member and leader of the Croatian terrorist group called Croatian National Resistance

A group of Croatian terrorists composed of Zvonko and his wife Julienne Bui Petar Matani Frane Peut and Slobodan Vlai hijacked a commercial Trans World Airlines plane on September 10 1976 Boeing 727 Flight 355 heading from New York to Chicago The mastermind of these terrorists Zvonko Bui delivered a sealed letter to Captain Carey in which he informed Captain that the airplane is hijacked the terrorists were in possession of five gelignite bombs a bomb is planted in a locker across from the Commodore Hotel on 42nd Street in New York with the further instructions that the US authorities should follow The terrorists demanded heading the plane in the direction of London England Their ultimate demands given in the instructions were

The plane took refueling stop in Montreal and flew to Paris France During the new refueling stop in Newfoundland the terrorist agreed to release thirty passengers Zvonko Bui reminded Captain Carey that the aircraft could be blown up at any time if the demands were not met and that the passengers released at Newfoundland if failed to distribute leaflets as ordered the remaining passengers fate would be on their consciences

In Paris the terrorists after receiving information that their demands were met surrendered to the French police which extradited them to the USA

During efforts to deactivate the explosives four hours later at the detonation site American policeman Brian Murray died and three other officers were wounded

Zvonko Bui was charged with and convicted of air piracy resulting in death which carried a mandatory life sentence Three years after the trial Judge John Bartels declared Bui eligible for parole after Dec 31 1979 

On April 17 1987 Bui escaped from the Otisville Correctional Institution a medium security Federal prison in Orange County NY Two days later Bui was caught and surrendered peacefully

On June 13 1989 Bartels wrote a letter opinion to the US Parole Commission in which he stated that the death of the police officer was partly due to the polices negligence and that he had no recommendation to the Commission nor objection to Buis release However the Commission rejected this parole

His second request for parole was denied in 2006 after service of 30 years although the others in the group had already been free for at least 17 years After this parole denial Croatian government along with the Croatian Helsinki Committee launched a campaign to secure his release on humanitarian grounds arguing that Bui had served out his sentence and therefore should be released

Bui was granted parole in July 2008 and turned over to immigration authorities for deportation proceedings A condition of his parole was that he could not return to the US

Freeing this terrorist from a life sentence and shipping him to his homeland caused the disgust of relatives of the city cop he murdered more than 30 years ago

Lt Terence McTigue who was blinded in the blast that killed Murray had spoken against the release of Bui and his crew at earlier parole hearings but he said he was never notified of the last fateful one McTigue saw this event as a political favor done for the Croatian government and said It is like killing Brian Murray and injuring me all over again Sen Chuck Schumer protested Buis release without hearing from the victims to Attorney General Michael Mukasey

Zvonko Bui had been the object of suspicion of many of those who looked into the La Guardia bombing which happened on December 29 1975 The suspicion was raised by Lt McTigue Edwin T Dreher who as a deputy police chief at the time was put in charge of solving this case Frank McDarby a detective who interrogated Zvonko Bui in an FBI office 33 years ago the crime writer Kevin F McMurray who spoke with Zvonko Bui for three hours in 1997 in a visitors room at the federal penitentiary in Lewisburg Pa and Robert K Tanenbaum a former prosecutor from the Manhattan district attorneys office Each of them reviewed this case anew and wondered anew if Zvonko Bui escaped punishment for one of the biggest unsolved terrorist acts in the USA Zvonko Bui denied any involvement it the La Guardia bombing But Lt McTigue was struck by the similarities in the two bombings Both bombs were in a public locker in a transportation facility a few days after a holiday and both were large and heavy Mr McTigue said He noted that both devices utilized dynamite and a 9 volt battery possibly for a lantern 

Luna 1 was a space probe of the Soviet Union It was the first mission in the Luna programme and it was the first spacecraft to reach the Moon Luna 1 made some key scientific discoveries and it is one of the best achievements of the Soviet Union space programme

The spacecraft was sphere shaped Five antennae came out of one end Instrument ports came out of the surface of the sphere It also had various metallic emblems with the Soviet coat of arms

Luna 1 had radio equipment a tracking transmitter and a telemetering system for communication with Earth The spacecraft carried several scientific devices too These included a magnetometer a device for measuring magnetic fields a scintillation counter a device for detecting high energy particles and a geiger counter a device for measuring radiation Luna 1 also carried a micrometeorite detector and other equipment

The space probe was launched on January 2 1959 at Baikonur Cosmodrome by a SS 6 Sapwood rocket The launch was successful and Luna 1 became the first man made object ever to reach the escape velocity of the Earth

On January 3 1959 the spacecraft released a cloud of sodium gas so that astronomers could track the probe and also to serve as an experiment on the behaviour of gas in space

Luna 1 was intended to impact the Moons surface However on January 4 1959 it passed within 5995 km of the Moon and began to orbit the Sun between the orbits of Earth and Mars where it is still orbiting now on a 450 day orbit Thus Luna 1 became the first spacecraft to orbit the Sun

The spacecraft made some key discoveries One is the Moon has no magnetic field Another is the fact that there is a flow of ionized plasma coming from the Sun now called solar wind The probe also found out useful data about Earths radiation belt the Van Allen radiation belt

Lyonel Charles Feininger was a German American painter He also drew cartoons

Lyonel Feiningers father was the German violinist Karl Feininger His mother was the American singer Elizabeth Feininger Feininger grew up in New York City

Feininger married Clara Frst the daughter of the painter Gustav Frst They had two daughters He also had several children with Julia Berg whom he later married His sons Andreas Feininger and T Lux Feininger both became artists Andreas was a photographer and T Lux became a photographer and a painter

He moved to Berlin in 1887 to study at the Knigliche Akademie Berlin under Ernst Hancke Then he studied at art schools in Berlin with Karl Schlabitz and in Paris with sculptor Filippo Colarossi He started as a caricaturist in 1894 for several German French and American magazines These included Harpers Round Table Harpers Young People Humoristische Bltter Lustige Bltter Das Narrenschiff Berliner Tageblatt and Ulk

In February of 1906 James Keeley editor of The Chicago Tribune traveled to Germany He was looking for artists to draw cartoons for his newspaper He recruited Feininger to draw two comic strips for the Chicago Tribune People liked the comic strips for their humor and experimental drawing style Fenininger also worked as a commercial caricaturist for 20 years for various newspapers and magazines in both the USA and Germany Later Art Spiegelman wrote in The New York Times Book Review that Feiningers comics have achieved a breathtaking formal grace unsurpassed in the history of the medium

Feiningers art was chosen to be a part of the annual Berlin Secession art show in the years 1901 through 1903

Feininger started to work as a fine artist at the age of 36 He was a member of the Berliner Sezession in 1909 He was associated with expressionist group Die Brcke the Novembergruppe Gruppe 1919 the Blaue Reiter circle and The Blue Four When Walter Gropius founded the Bauhaus in Germany in 1919 Feininger became the master artist in charge of the printmaking workshop He designed the cover for the Bauhaus 1919 manifesto an expressionist woodcut cathedral He taught at the Bauhaus for several years Among the students who attended his workshops were Ludwig Hirschfeld Mack GermanAustralian Hans Friedrich Grohs and Margarete Koehler Bittkow

In 1933 the Nazi Party came to power in Germany Feiningers wife was partly Jewish and they decided to leave Germany The Nazi Party declared his work to be degenerate They moved to America after his work was exhibited in the degenerate art in 1936 but before the 1937 exhibition in Munich After moving to the United States Feininger taught at Black Mountain College

In addition to drawing Feininger created art with painted toy figures being photographed in front of drawn backgrounds

Feininger also worked sometimes as a pianist and composer Music historians still keep several of Feiningers piano compositions and fugues for organ

Margaret Olley was an Australian artist She was well known for generous gifts of paintings and money to public art galleries in Australia These gifts included works by Cezanne and Picasso She is also famous for being the model for portraits Two paintings of her won the Archibald Prize William Dobells painting in 1948 and Ben Quiltys in 2011 She was described by Julia Gillard the Prime Minister of Australia as a great artist and a true Australian national treasure

She grew up on sugarcane farms in Queensland and her artistic talent was noticed at school Her teachers convinced her parents she should study art at the Brisbane Technical College She then moved to Sydney and studied art at the East Sydney Technical College She held the first of her 90 exhibitions in 1948 Many of her paintings were of things around her home such as flowers and bowls of fruit In 1996 she was given Australias highest honour the Companion of the Order of Australia

Sir William Dobell was a famous Australian artist well known for his portrait painting He won the 1943 Archibald Prize with a portrait of another artist Joshua Smith The painting became the centre of a court case when two other artists said it was not a portrait but a caricature They said this meant it should not have won the prize Dobell won the legal case but it caused him many health problems and led to a nervous breakdown He kept away from people and went to live in his parents holiday house Wangi Wangi on the shores of Lake Macquarie

The Archibald Prize is the most important prize for portraits in Australia It was first awarded in 1921 The money for the prize was left by J F Archibald the editor of The Bulletin magazine who died in 1919 The prize is awarded by the Trustees of the Art Gallery of New South Wales for the best portrait of a person famous in Art Letters Science or Politics The artist must have lived in Australia for at least one year The Archibald Prize is awarded every year In 2008 the prize was worth A50000

The first prize awarded in 1921 was worth 400 Early winners included William Beckwith McInnes John Longstaff and William Dargie Dargies painting which won in 1942 had been painted when he was an official war artist during World War 2 in Syria The ship carrying the painting back to Australia sank and the painting was underwater for some time

In 1946 the trustees selected works for entry instead of displaying all the entries Less than a third of the entries were chosen for exhibition

Dargie also won 1956 prize with a portrait of Australias celebrated Aboriginal painter Albert Namatjira The portrait was done while the Namatjira was visiting Sydney from the Central Desert 

In 1964 and 1980 the prize was not awarded as there were no works that the trustees thought were good enough

There are usually about 700 entries in the Archibald Prize but only about 40 are selected as finalists for display Only one entry is allowed per person each year Some of the winning artists have had to enter for many years before they made the final display of paintings 

Portraits in 2006 included a painting of one of the The Wiggles by Patrick Whiteley actor Steve Bisley by Bronwyn Graham actor Garry McDonald by Paul Jackson politician Steve Bracks by Garry Anderson actor Cate Blanchett by McLean Edwards actor Ernie Dingo by Marie Klement cricketer Dennis Lillee by Melinda Mackay musician and TV personality Wilbur Wilde by Phillip Howe Peter Slipper by Wayne Strickland The 2010 prize winner was Sam Leach with his painting of musician Tim Minchin

The prize has often been the centre of argument and there have even been several court cases The most famous case was in 1943 when William Dobells winning painting of artist Joshua Smith was claimed to be a caricature and not a portrait 

The Archibald is one of the few art prizes in which the artists signature is covered up The judges do not know who did the paintings This is to try and stop the judges some of whom are artists from simply giving the prize to their friends and not the best painting

Max Meldrum criticised the Archibald Prize winner in 1938 saying that women could not be expected to paint as well as men Nora Heysen was the first woman to win the Archibald Prize with a portrait of Madame Elink Schuurman the wife of the Consul General for the Netherlands

In 1953 several art students including John Olsen protested William Dargies winning portrait It was the seventh time he had won the prize One protester tied a sign around her dog which said Winner Archibald Prize William Doggie Dargie went on to win the prize again in 1956

After Prime Minister Gough Whitlam was dismissed he refused to sit for the traditional portrait which is done of Australian Prime Ministers He said that the 1972 Archibald Prize winning portrait by Clifton Pugh be used instead This is now on display at New Parliament House in Canberra

In 1975 John Bloomfields portrait of Tim Burstall was rejected because it had been painted from a photograph and not from life The prize was then given to Kevin Connor John Bloomfield took action in 1981 saying that the winner that year Eric Smith had not painted his subject from life In 1983 John Bloomfield went to court to try to get back the 1975 prize but was unsuccessful In 1995 the application form of the Archibald Prize was changed to make it clear that the subject must be painted from life 

In 1985 control of the trust was given to the Art Gallery of New South Wales after a court case In 1997 the painting of the Bananas in Pyjamas television characters by Evert Ploeg not allowed because it was not a painting of a person Hundreds of portraits each year are not accepted as finalists

The 2000 Archibald winner Adam Cullen took action against the American Broadcasting Company who had used his painting Portrait of David Wenham in a television commercial

In 2002 head packer Steve Peters chose a painting of himself by Dave Machin as a possible winner for the Packing Room Prize It did not win but it was on display outside the Archibald exhibition After this portraits of the head packer were no longer allowed

In 2004 Craig Ruddys portrait of actor David Gulpilil won both the main prize and the Peoples Choice award It was challenged because it was a charcoal sketch rather than a painting The claim was dismissed in the Supreme Court in June 2006

In 2008 Sam Leachs portrait of himself as Hitler made the front page of Melbournes newspaper The Age This started a national argument about of his choice of subject matter The prize money was also changed to 50 000

Since 1935 there have been two extra awards added to the Archibald prize event In 1991 the Packing Room Prize was established The staff who receive the portraits and put them in the gallery vote for their choice of winner Although the prize is said to be awarded by the staff the gallerys head storeman As of2011lcy Steve Peters holds 51 of the vote The other award is the Peoples Choice Award in which votes from the viewing public are collected to find a winner This award also comes with a prize of 2500 To date there has never been a matching Archibald Prize winner and a Packing Room Prize chosen in the same year but there were two Peoples Choice Awards given to Archibald Prize winners in 1988 and 2004 

Twice there has been a matching Packing prize winner and Peoples choice award The first was Paul Newtons portrait of Roy Slaven and HG Nelson in 2001 and second was Jan Williamsons portrait of singersongwriter Jenny Morris the following year in 2002

The Archibald is held at the same time as the Sir John Sulman Prize the Wynne Prize the recent Australian Photographic Portrait Prize and was held with the Dobell Prize before 2003 The Archibald Prize is the next richest portrait prize in Australia after the Doug Moran National Portrait Prize However the Archibald is the only artists prize that receives much attention in the general press Part of the reason is probably that many of the paintings feature well known Australians such as actors sportspeople and politicians making the art more accessible than other genres It is also longer running with a richer tradition than the newer established portrait prizes 

In 1978 Brett Whiteley won the Archibald Wynne and Sulman Prizes all in the same year the only time this has happened It was his second win for the Archibald and the other prizes as well

Some paintings which do not make the Archibald Prize finalists are shown at the S H Ervin Gallery in the Salon des Refuss exhibition which began in 1992

The satirical Bald Archy Prize supposedly judged by a cockatoo was started in 1994 at the Coolac Festival of Fun as a parody of the Archibald Prize it attracted so many visitors that it has moved to Sydney

The Geraniales are a small order of flowering plants included within the rosid subgroup of dicotyledons The largest family in the order is the Geraniaceae with over 800 species In addition the order includes some small families contributing together another less than 40 species Most Geraniales are herbaceous but there are also shrubs and small trees

Pithole or Pithole City is a ghost town in Cornplanter Township Venango County in the US state of Pennsylvania It is about convert6mi from Oil Creek State Park and the Drake Well Museum The first oil well was in that area The quick growing of Pithole and then fast decline made it one of the most famous of the oil boomtowns

Oil was found at wells close to Pithole in January 1865 A large number of people moved to the area Many of these people were land speculators The town was built in May By December the area became an official town with about 20000 people living in it Pithole had at least 54 hotels 3 churches the third biggest post office in Pennsylvania a newspaper a theater a railroad the worlds first pipeline and a red light district the likes of Dodge Citys By 1866 less oil was being made in Pithole Oil was found in other towns near Pithole This made many people from Pithole leave to live in those places By 1877 the town no longer existed

The site was cleared of plants and was given to the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission in 1961 A visitors center with information about the history of Pithole was built in the 1970s Pithole was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973

Cornales is an order of flowering plants basal among the asterids containing about 600 species Plants within Cornales usually have four parted flowers drupaceous fruits and inferior gynoecia topped with disc shaped nectaries Under the APG system Cornales includes the following families

Cornplanter Township is a township in Venango County Pennsylvania United States The population was 2687 at the 2000 census

Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria was a Colombian drug lord He is known as one of the Worlds Greatest Outlaws Escobar was the hardest cocaine dealer to catch He is probably the richest and most successful criminal in world history Some sources say that he was the second richest criminal ever after Amado Carrillo Fuentes In 1989 Forbes magazine said that Escobar was the seventh richest man in the world The magazine said that he had about US 25 billion He owned many luxury residences and automobiles In 1986 he tried to enter Colombian politics with success Escobar even offered to give money to pay the nations US 10 billion national debt He had to stop his political career because he was charged as criminal

Escobar was born in Rionegro in Antioquia Colombia He was the third of seven children to Abel de Jesus Escobar and Hemilda Gaviria His father was a farmer and his mother an elementary school teacher Escobar and his family lived in an adobe hut They had no electricity but had running water Pablo Escobar and his brothers school once sent them home because they had no shoes and no money to buy them Pablo Escobar studied political science at a university nearby He had to stop studying because he could not pay the fees This was when he began his criminal career He started to steal gravestones and removed the words from them to resell them His brother Roberto Escobar said that this was not the truth He said that the gravestones came from cemetery owners whose clients had stopped paying for site care Escobar then studied for a short time at the University of Antioquia

After this Pablo started doing whatever else he could do to make money He sold illegal cigarettes and fake lottery tickets He even stole money from people when they left the bank At the age of 20 he was already a famous car thief In the early 1970s he was a thief and bodyguard He made 100000 for kidnapping an executive from Medelln Then he entered the drug trade His next aim was to become a millionaire Therefore Escobar worked for the multi millionaire and smuggler Alvaro Prieto Escobar became a millionaire at the age of 22

The book The Accountants Story which Pablo Escobars brother published Roberto Escobar discusses how his brother became rich It explains how he rose from poverty The book also says how Escobar became one of the richest men of the world He lead the largest and most successful criminal enterprise in world historyfact At times the Medelln drug cartel was smuggling 15 tons of cocaine a day This was worth more than half a billion dollars They sent it to the United States and sold it there According to Roberto Escobar Pablo Escobars accountant they spent 2500 a month for buying rubber bands to wrap the stacks of cash They had more illegal money than they could store in banks Therefore they stored the bricks of cash in their warehouses About 10 were destroyed each year because of rats 

In 1975 Escobar started to develop his cocaine trade He even flew a plane himself several times mainly between Colombia and Panama He smuggled a plane load into the United States Escobar later bought 15 newer and bigger airplanes and 6 helicopters His reputation grew after he murdered the famous Medelln dealer Fabio Restrepo in 1975 Then all of Restrepos workers were told that they now worked for Pablo Escobar Restrepo had tried to kill Estrobar before but failed In May 1976 Escobar and several of his men were arrested for dealing drugs Firstly Pablo Escobar tried unsuccessfully to bribe the judges in Medelln They were building the case against him At this time he began dealing with the authorities He either bribed them or killed them

There were no drug cartels then and only a few drug barons There was a lot of business for everyone They bought the cocaine paste in Peru They refined it in a laboratory in a two story house in Medelln At first they smuggled the cocaine in old planes The pilot could earn as much as 500000 for each flight depending on how much he could smuggle

Soon the demand for cocaine in the United States increased Escobar started to organize more smuggling ships and routes He also improved the sale networks in South Florida California and other parts of the USA Escobar and Carlos Lehder worked together to develop a new drug center in the Bahamas called Normans Cay Lehder and Robert Vesco bought most of the land on the island This included an airstrip a harbor hotels houses and boats They also built a warehouse to store the cocaine From 1978 to 1982 this was used as a central smuggling route for the Medelln Cartel Escobar bought convert77sqmikm2sigfig2 of land which included Hacienda Napoles for several million dollars He created a zoo a lake and other things for his family and organization At one point about 70 to 80 tons of cocaine were brought from Colombia to the United States every month At the peak of Escobars power in the mid 1980s he sent about 11 tonnes per flight in planes to the United States In addition to using the planes Roberto Escobar said he also used two small submarines to transport the massive loads

In 1982 Escobar was elected as a deputy representative to the Chamber of Representatives of Colombias Congress He was part of the Colombian Liberal Party During the 1980s Escobar became known internationally because his drug network became famous The Medelln Cartel controlled a large part of the drugs that entered the United States Mexico Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic The cocaine was mostly from Peru and Bolivia The Colombian coca was not of best quality Escobars product reached many other nations mostly around the Americas His network reportedly reached as far as Asiafact

Corruption characterized Escobars dealings with the Colombian system He had an effective way of dealing with law enforcements and the government This is often referred to as plata o plomo This resulted in the deaths of hundreds of individuals This included civilians policemen and state officials At the same time Escobar bribed many government officials judges and other politicians Escobar was responsible for the murder of Colombian presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galn The Cartel de Medelln was also involved in a deadly drug war their enemy was the Cartel de Cali

Pablo Escobar once said that the cocaine business was simple  you bribe someone here you bribe someone there and you pay a friendly banker to help you bring the money back In 1989 his Medelln cartel controlled 80 of the global cocaine market

The United States and Colombian governments saw Escobar as an enemy At the same time Escobar was a hero to many people in Medelln especially to the poor people as he built houses for them He was a sports fan and built football fields and multi sports courts He also sponsored childrens football teams

Escobar was responsible for the construction of many hospitals schools and churches in western Colombia This made him popular with the local Roman Catholic Church He worked hard for his Robin Hood image Escobar often gave money to the poor through housing projects and other civic activities The population of Medelln often helped Escobar by watching the police They also hid information from the authorities and did whatever else they could do to protect him

Despite his popular image among Medellns community Escobar was well known among his business associates to be a calm and sensible partner to deal with He preferred to use his money before his gun His brother said that Pablo Escobar knew that money generated more loyalty than fear Violence was often unnecessary

The Colombian cartels quickly managed to make Colombia the worlds capital for murder with 25100 violent deaths in 1991 and 27100 in 1992 Escobar gave money to his hitmen as a reward for killing police officers 600 officers died this way Today other countries such as Guatemala South Africa and Venezuela have more murders than Columbia

In March 1976 when he was 26 Escobar married Maria Victoria She was 15 years older than him Together they had two children Juan Pablo and Manuela Escobar built and lived in a luxurious house with his family He wanted to construct a Greek style citadel near it They began the construction of the citadel but never finished The ranch the zoo and the citadel were expropriated by the government They were given to poor families in the 1990s under a law called extincin de dominio The property has been converted into a theme park

After the murder of Luis Carlos Galn a presidential candidate the administration of Csar Gaviria moved against Escobar and the drug cartels Eventually the government talked with Escobar They wanted to him to capitulate and to stop all criminal activity

Escobar declared an end to a series of previous violence and terrorism and turned himself in He was held in what became his own luxurious private prison La Catedral Before Escobar gave himself up the government approved the extradition of Colombian citizens This was controversial People suspected that Escobar or other drug lords influenced members of the government

Escobar continued his criminal activities He began to influence the media The government discovered that Escobar was continuing his criminal activities within La Catedral They wanted to move Escobar to another prison on July 22 1992 Escobars influence allowed him to discover the plan in advance and escape He was still worried that he could be sent to the United States

In 1992 United States Special Forces joined the manhunt for Escobar They trained and advised a special Colombian police task force called the Search Bloc It was created to locate Escobar Later as the conflict between Escobar and the governments grew a group known as Los Pepes formed His rivals and former associates financed it They wanted to find Escobar Los Pepes carried out a bloody campaign and more than 300 of Escobars associates were killed Also a lot of his cartels property was destroyed

Rumors said that members of the Search Bloc and of the Colombian and the United States intelligence agencies cooperated with Los Pepes One of the leaders of Los Pepes was Diego Murillo Bejarano also known as Don Berna Before he was a Medelln Cartel associate

The fight against Escobar ended on December 2 1993 The police used radio triangulation technology to find Escobar The United States provided this technology to a Colombian electronic surveillance team The group was led by Brigadier Hugo Martinez The team found him hiding in a middle class barrio in Medelln With the permission from authorities a firefight with Escobar and his bodyguard Alvaro de Jess Agudelo AKA El Limn happened They tried to escape by running across the roofs of nearby houses to reach a back street but both were shot and killed by Colombian National Police Escobar suffered gunshots to the leg torso and the fatal one in his ear It is not known who actually fired the final shot into Escobars head It is also unknown whether this shot was made during the gunfight or as part of possible execution There is wide speculation about this Some of the family members believe that Escobar could have committed suicide His two brothers Roberto Escobar and Fernando Snchez Arellano believe that he shot himself through the ears He committed suicide he did not get killed During all the years they went after him he would say to me every day that if he was really cornered without a way out he would shoot himself through the ears The autopsy showed that there was no stippling pattern found around the ear which suggested that the shot which killed Escobar was fired from further than an arms length away

After Escobars death and the fragmentation of the Medelln Cartel the rival Cali Cartel took over the cocaine market

The Robin Hood image of Escabor still influenced Medelln after his death People there especially the poor ones regretted his death

On October 28 2006 Escobars body was exhumed by request of his nephew Nicols Escobar This was two days after the death of mother Hermilda Gaviria who opposed the exhumation Nicols Escobar wanted to verify that the body in the tomb was in fact that of Escobar Escobars nephew also collect DNA for a paternity test claim According to the report by the El Tiempo newspaper Escobars widow Maria Victoria was present recording the exhumation with a video camera

On July 4 2006 Virginia Vallejo the television news speaker offered information in the trial against former Senator Alberto Santofimio to the Colombian Attorney General Mario Iguaran Vallejo was romantically involved with Escobar between 1983 and 1987 The Senator was accused of conspiracy in the 1989 murder of Presidential Candidate Luis Carlos Galn Iguaran said that although Vallejo contacted his office on the 4th the judge had decided to close the trial on the 9th This was several weeks before the prospective closing date and in opinion too soon

In 1866 a group of 35 artists founded the Chicago Academy of Design in a studio on Dearborn Street The group wanted to run a free school with its own art gallery The organization was modeled after European art academies such as the Royal Academy People who worked there were called Academians and Associate Academians The Academys charter was granted in March 1867

Classes started in 1868 Classes met every day Students paid the school 10 per month The new Academy was a success The school next built a five story stone building at 66 West Adams Street which opened on November 22 1870

When the Great Chicago Fire destroyed the building in 1871 the Academy began to owe a lot of money The Academy tried and failed by renting facilities By 1878 the Academy owed 10000 Members tried to rescue the weak institution by making deals with local businesses Some people gave up in 1879 and started a new new organization named the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts When the Chicago Academy of Design went bankrupt the same year the new Chicago Academy of Fine Arts bought its assets in an auction

In 1882 the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts changed its name to the current name Art Institute of Chicago The same year it purchased a lot on the corner of Michigan Avenue and Van Buren Street for 45000 The school rented the propertys existing building and a new building was constructed behind it to house the schools facilities

S2011 P 1 more accurately S2011 1 is a small moon of the dwarf planet Pluto Is has also been called P4 The present name is a lemma a temporary label to use before it gets officially named

The satellite was discovered in June 2011 It is Plutos fourth known moon The others are Charon discovered in 1978 and Nix and Hydra which were discovered in 2005

The moon was discovered by a Hubble Space Telescope observing team led by Mark Showalter while they were trying to find out if Pluto had any rings S2011 P 1 was first seen in a photo taken with Hubbles Wide Field Camera 3 on June 28 2011 More photos were taken on July 3 and July 18 2011 to confirm that it exists The moon was officially verified and announced on July 20 2011 S2011 P 1 was not seen in earlier Hubble photos because the exposure times were shorter The moon may have appeared as a very faint smudge in photos taken in 2006 but was ignored because it was not clear S2011 P 1 is possibly also visible in images taken in 2010

S2011 P 1 has an estimated diameter of 1334 km This makes it the smallest known moon of Pluto S2011 P 1 and Plutos other moons are thought to have been created by cosmic collision between the dwarf planet and another celestial body early in the Solar Systems history

For most animals defence against predators is vital Being eaten is not the only threat to life parasites and diseases may also be fatal But animals especially small animals are often eaten Since life is about reproduction anything that keeps a creature alive long enough for it to take part in reproduction will be selected for The next generation comes from the fertilised eggs of the previous generation

Not surprisingly then animals have developed a wide range of defences against predation Some of these defences apply also to plants herbivory on plants can be very damaging and reduce a plants fertility Many plants have some defence against herbivores

Primary defences make it less likely that there will be a meeting between the predator and the prey In many cases this means the predator has not noticed or recognised the prey

There are various definitions of what a primary defence is

These work when a predator detects a prey or when a prey notices a predator The function of secondary defences is to increase the chance of the prey surviving the encounter

Everything costs something All defences incur costs For survival an animals needs food and needs to stay alive to reproduce Energy and time spent on defence can be considerable but justified if it makes reproduction more likely There are these kinds of costs

The Chinstrap Penguin is a penguin that gets its name from the narrow band of black feathers that goes under their chin from ear to ear

These little penguins are only 28 to 29 inches tall Chinstraps may be small but they are the boldest penguins of all

The Adelie Penguin is a penguin that is white in the front and black on the back There are white rings around their eyes There are about 25 million Adelie penguins in Antarctica

Adelies come ashore to breed in the summer In the winter they live on ice that floats off the Antarctic shore

Adelie parents take turns keeping their chicks warm and fed While one watches the nest the other goes into the ocean to catch krill The penguins carry the krill back the the nest in their stomachs Then they regurgitate it to feed their chicks

Most Adelie penguins incubate two eggs at a time The little chicks hatch out at more or less the same time One is usually stronger than the other and has a better chance of surviving

When first born the chicks are kept warm by their parents But after two or three weeks they make a thick woolly gray down Then they join other chicks in creches or nursery groups

Adelies weigh only about 85 pounds They are about 28 inches tall

A katabatic wind is a very strong wind which blows downhill They can be warms winds like the fhn wind on the north slopes of the Alps in Europe or the Chinook which blows down the Rockies in the US They can also be very cold winds like those in Antarctica or Greenland They are made when cold dense air flows down from the ice cap to the coast Sometimes these winds are called fall winds Along the Adriatic coast the cold katabatic wind is called the bora and in France it is called the mistral

Galapagos penguins live on the Galapagos Islands Because these islands are located at the equator the waters are warm  not all penguins live in cold climates They do not migrate

Galapagos penguins have two bands of brown feathers on their faces and their beaks are thin and slender

They weigh 5 pounds and are 1 and a half feet tall

Macaroni Penguins are penguins that get their names from their funny hair Macaroni penguins are known for their black faces and the orange yellow crests that create a band across their foreheads Macaroni penguins live on islands on the edge of Antarctica as well as on islands that lie south of Africa and the Americas They make their nests on cliffs and hillsides

Macaroni penguins weigh 10 pounds and are a little over 2 feet tall

Little Penguins are also known as Fairy Penguins Little Blue Penguins or Blue Penguins They are a species of penguin that lives near the coasts of Australia and New Zealand The Little Penguin is the smallest of all the penguins

The penguins around 09 kg and are up to 40 cm tall On average they are 33 cm tall 

The little penguin is slate grey or indigo along the head at back with a white belly and neck The flippers  wings  are dark blue with a white edge along the back Males and females of the species look the same Juvenile little penguins which are younger than adults have lighter colors Little penguin chicks have blue grey bellies and brown feathers

The scientific name of the little penguin is a combination of Greek and Latin Minor Latin for smaller refers to the small size of the penguin while Eudyptula means good little diver

Originally the Eudyptula genus contained two different species of penguin the little penguin and the fairy penguin In 1976 scientists combined these two species into one species with six subspecies However new research on the penguins mitochondrial DNA shows that the DNA of populations in the Australia and southern New Zealand region is different in important ways from that of little penguins in northern New Zealand Therefore some researchers still argue about whether these two populations should be divided into two different species Another common argument is over the classification of the White flippered Penguin While most believe the white flippered penguin is a subspecies of the little penguin some argue that it is a different species Others argue that it is not a subspecies at all but a morph that just has different colors

The six subspecies of the little penguin are

The little penguin has different common names depending on their location In Australia they are often called fairy penguins because the Australia group was originally considered a part of that species In New Zealand they are called little blue penguins or blue penguins because their gray feathers look more blue in the sun They are also called Koror in Mori the language of New Zealand natives

Little Penguins live in sandy burrows at night and go to the ocean during the day At Phillip Island off the coast of Victoria there is a Penguin Parade where lights and viewing stands have been set up so that people can watch the penguins return to their homes at dusk They can be found right around the south coast of Australia from Perth in the west to Coffs Harbour on the east coast They are found all around Tasmania The largest Little Penguin colonies in New South Wales are on Montague Island Tollgate Island and Brush Island

The little penguin is known for its wide variety of calls In fact one of the main ways scientists identify different little penguin subspecies is by the differences in the noises the penguin groups make

Because little penguins live together in large groups called colonies it is important they can tell each other apart Little penguins can find their mates even in crowded and loud areas by the distinctive call that each penguin makes

Little penguins have one call that changes to mean different things Most calls have a rhythm of two repeated sounds

Little penguins are the only penguin species that breeds nocturnally  that is at night

Egyptian temples were buildings for the official worship of the gods in ancient Egypt These temples were seen as houses for the gods Sometimes they were specially for the pharaohs Within these temples the Egyptians performed a variety of rituals of the Egyptian religion People would give offerings to the gods They would show the stories of the gods through festivals These festivals would also help normal life to continue The pharaohs were responsible for providing the temples and caring for the gods This required a lot of labor and material for building and maintenance It was necessary for the pharaohs to give this responsibility to priests Most of the ordinary people did not take part in ceremonies and could not enter special parts of the temple The temple was an important religious place for all classes of Egyptians They went there to pray give offerings and seek guidance from the god dwelling within

The most important part of the temple was the sanctuary The sanctuary was the most secret and special place and usually had a statue of a god In the early years of Egypt about 3000 BCE the temples were small Priests and pharaohs added more rooms and the temples became bigger The rooms would have a lot of decoration of the religion By the time of the New Kingdom the temples were huge buildings made of stone The buildings were arranged in special ways for the religion The temple would have halls open areas and very large entrance pillars Some of these temples still exist today Beyond the main temple was an outer wall There would be other buildings inside the walls

A large temple also had a lot of land and employed thousands of ordinary people to supply its needs Temples were also economic centers The priests who managed the temples had a lot of influence They would sometimes oppose the king

Plovers are water birds birds belonging to the subfamily Charadriinae There are about 40 species most of them called plover or dotterel The closely related lapwing subfamily Vanellinae has another 20 odd species

Plovers are found throughout the world and have short bills They wade in the water and hunt by sight rather than by feel as longer billed waders like snipe do 

They feed mainly on insects worms or other invertebrates They use a run and pause technique rather than the steady probing of some other waders

The plover group of birds has a defence against predators called false brooding They sit on an imaginary nest site changing position sometimes as if real eggs were under them

The plover has been known to attack when the young are threatened The birds secrete an acidic compound from a gland located in their mouth On contact with skin causes a burning sensation 

The Gay Nigger Association of America is an anti blogging and Internet trolling group The group takes their name from the 1992 Danish movie Gayniggers from Outer Space They have trolled many popular websites and Internet people They have trolled many bloggers and site such as Slashdot Wikipedia and CNN They have also released software and made available secret information about operating systems In addition they maintain a wiki based site that makes fun of Slashdot posts and have a software archive that has many GNAA coding projects

Members of the GNAA also started Goatse Security a grey hat computer safety group Members of Goatse Security told media groups in June 2010 about a problem located on ATTs website that made the privacy of people who pre ordered the iPad publicfact After the mistake in the website was talked about the then president of the GNAA weev and GNAA member JacksonBrown were arrested by the policefact

The group says that it was started in 2002 There is not much information about the groups structure Researcher Andrew Lih has said that it is not clear if there was a actual group of GNAA members at the start Also not known is if the first members of the GNAA were online pranksters who used the name in order to disturb or disrupt websites

The groups name has been causing trouble on the Internet having been described as causing alarm in anyone with even a little bit of good taste and as being amazingly offensive However the group claims that it is neither racist nor homophobic GNAA members deny it when people say that they are racist They say that these words are said only to get people to make angry responses and to undermine or challenge long standing social norms and say that the name of the group came from the 1992 Danish satirical blaxploitation film Gayniggers from Outer Space

The GNAA uses more than one way of disrupting the Internet One way is flooding weblogs with a very big amount of words and sentences called crapflooding They have also made shocking websites that have malware that infects people who visit the sites One website Last Measure had malware that opened up pop up windows that had shocking pictures On Wikipedia the group made a page about itself while following every rule of Wikipedia in order to use the rules against themselves

They have also attacked many Internet Relay Chat channels using IRC flooding GNAA used an old but little known way to force users of the Freenode IRC network to flood IRC channels after going to websites that have malware They also have used bugs in Firefox to crapflood IRC channels They have also shown people new bugs and problems These actions have sometimes stopped the day to day working of big websites such as Slashdot even making some websites to shut down for a little bit of time

In July 2004 two GNAA members sent secret pictures of the future operating system Mac OS X v104 to the popular Apple Macintosh news website MacRumors which read With WWDC just days away the first Tiger information and pictures appears to have been leaked Sources say Apple might give our coders a Mac OS X 104 preview copy at WWDC on Monday The pictures were said to have come from this future coder sneak peek Later when people said that the images were fake the GNAA made a press release which said that the screenshots were real and said that they had trolled the Apple websites

In June 2005 the GNAA said that they had made a Mac OS X Tiger release for Intel x86 processors which made media stories from many sources The next day the suspicious leak and was talked about on the G4 show Attack of the Show The DVD put on BitTorrent just showed an image of hellojpg when you started your computer and not the OS X Tiger as many people were led to believe

On February 3 2007 the GNAA tricked CNN reporter Paula Zahn into thinking that one in three Americans think that the September 11 2001 terror attacks were done by Israeli agents CNN then decided to publish a story not truthfully reporting this adding pictures of the GNAA owned website jewsdidwtccom The story had a round table talk about people who hate Jews and a talk with the father of a Jewish 911 victim The GNAA owned website had claims that over 4000 Jews were not at work at the World Trade Center on 911

Many members of the GNAA with experience in grey hat computer safety research began giving out details about security problems under the name Goatse Security They chose a new name to publish their work under because they were afraid that their work would not get talked about if given out by the Gay Nigger Association of America

In June 2010 Goatse Security got much attention from the media for their finding of 114000 email addresses owned by people who pre ordered Apples 3G iPad The data was retrieved from ATTs own servers The FBI soon investigated the event This search for the truth led to the arrest of then GNAA President Andrew weev Auernheimer on drug charges that happened because of an FBI search of his house and were not having anything to do with his hacking

The charge is named after Maj Gen George Pickett Pickett was one of three Confederate generals who led the attack under Longstreet

Lee hoped to attack the Union center on the third day of the Battle of Gettysburg Confederate attacks on both Union sides had failed the day and night before On the night of July 2 General Meade said at a council of war that he thought Lee would try an attack on his lines in the center the next day

A large attack by artillery took place before the infantry charge The Confederates hoped the artillery attack would make the Union weaker It did not work too well About 12500 men in nine infantry brigades marched over open fields for three quarters of a mile under heavy Union artillery and rifle fire Some Confederates were able to get past the low stone wall that many of the Union defenders hid behind However they could not hold this area The Union pushed the Confederates back Over 50 of the Confederate soldiers on the charge suffered casualties This defeat ended the three day battle and Lees campaign into Pennsylvania Years later when asked why his charge at Gettysburg failed General Pickett said Ive always thought the Yankees had something to do with it

Ragtime is a musical genre which enjoyed its peak popularity between 1897 and 1918 

Its main characteristic trait is its syncopated or ragged rhythm It began as dance music in the red light districts of American cities such as St Louis and New Orleans years before being published as popular sheet music for piano 

Ragtime was a modification of the march made popular by John Philip Sousa with additional polyrhythms typical of African music The ragtime composer Scott Joplin became famous through the publication in 1899 of the Maple Leaf Rag and a string of ragtime hits that followed For at least 12 years after its publication the Maple Leaf Rag heavily influenced subsequent ragtime composers with its melody lines harmonic progressions or metric patterns 

Ragtime fell out of favor as jazz claimed the publics imagination after 1917 but there have been numerous revivals since First in the early 1940s many jazz bands began to include ragtime in their repertoire and put out ragtime recordings on 78 rpm records A more significant revival occurred in the 1950s as a wider variety of ragtime styles of the past were made available on records and new rags were composed published and recorded 

In 1971 Joshua Rifkin brought out a compilation of Scott Joplins work which was nominated for a Grammy Award In 1973 the motion picture The Sting brought ragtime to a wide audience with its soundtrack of Joplin tunes Subsequently the films rendering of Joplins 1902 rag The Entertainer was a Top 5 hit in 1974

Ragtime has been cited as an American equivalent of minuets by Mozart mazurkas by Chopin or waltzes by Brahms Ragtime influenced classical composers including Erik Satie Claude Debussy and Igor Stravinsky Ragtime was included in the dance styles of Vernon and Irene Castle and influenced the English ballroom dances the foxtrot and the quickstep

In 192526 Stenhousemuir goalkeeper Joe Shortt was offered a 50 bribe to throw a match against Broxburn but he rejected the offer and the Warriors won the match 62 A bookmaker from Bainsford a small village on the outskirts of Falkirk was subsequently jailed for attempted match fixingCitation neededdateJune 2011

In 1928 the wooden grandstand at Ochilview Park burnt down in a fire which lead to a new stand being built in its place although staircases had to be added later due to planning errors During the 193637 season saw the club record a record victory a 92 win against Dundee United More than a decade later in 194950 a Scottish Cup quarter final tie against East Fife drew a record crowd of 12500 the highest ever at Ochilview ParkCitation neededdateJune 2011 In November 1951 the first floodlit game between two Scottish senior teams occurred at Ochilview Park between Stenhousemuir and HibernianCitation neededdateJune 2011

In the summer of 1964 Rangers FC revealed a plan to The Scottish Football League to remove the Warriors from the league along with four other clubs on the basis that they were poorest supported clubs over the previous three seasons Four years later Stenhousemuir along with Albion Rovers Berwick Rangers Brechin City and Stranraer with support from a number of clubs including Celtic FC Hamilton Academical FC and Airdrieonians FC successfully defeated this plan

In 197273 the Warriors defeated Rangers 21 at Ibrox Stadium in the Scottish League Cup Notably Rangers were the holders of the UEFA Cup Winners Cup at the timeCitation neededdateJune 2011

In 199293 the team allowed their rivals Stirling Albion to share their stadium Ochilview Park In the 199394 season the Warriors moved out of the bottom league for the first time due to the formation of the Scottish Third Division The mid 90s was one of the clubs most successful periods in its history in 199495 they defeated St Johnstone 40 and Aberdeen 20 both higher league opposition en route to the Scottish Cup quarter finals In the 199596 season Stenhousemuir won the Scottish Challenge Cup defeating Dundee United 54 on penalties after a goalless 90 minutes and extra time In the process reaching their first national semi final since 1902

Stenhousemuir was relegated from the Scottish Second Division to the Scottish Third Division for the first time in the history of the clubCitation neededdateJune 2011 However the next season winning promotion back to the Second Division also a first in its history

In 200607 the club announced a plan to lay fake grass at Ochilview Park It became the first in the UK to pass the FIFA 2 Star category accreditation

Stenhousemuir were promoted to the Scottish Second Division after defeating Cowdenbeath 54 on penalties after drawing 00 on aggregate in the play off final at the end of the 200809 season The 201011 season saw the club narrowly avoid relegation after spending most of the season in the relegation zone On the final day of the season the club defeated Peterhead 30 to move above Alloa Athletic and therefore avoided the relegation play offs

Stenhousemuir Supporters Club is the official supporters club of Stenhousemuir FC It is a democratic organisation based on one vote per person and its committee is elected every year by the members It is the largest shareholder in the club with about 11 of the shares with the aim to increase the shareholding so that no individual can take control of the club away from its supporters

The Kriss Akabusi Loyal is a band of traveling supporters It has a democratically elected representative on the Stenhousemuir FC Board to relay supporters ideas and wishes This person serves two years on the Board before being replaced by another member of the committee

The club also has many foreign supporters the Norwegian Supporters Club is a small supporters organisation based in Oslo Norway The Supporters Club was founded on New Years Eve 1992 by Rolf Erik Wulff Christian Wulff and Kjell Jarslett In 1996 it was given one share of Stenhousemuir FC as a recognition of their support and promotion of the club As of today the supporters club and its members owns about 5 of the shares in Stenhousemuir Also the Stenhousemuir FC Danish Support The Denmark based supporters club is an unofficial Warriors fan club founded and established in the summer 2000 The fan club has approximately 30 members

Stenhousemuir Supporters Trust also The Warriors Supports Trust is registered with the Financial Services Agency as a not for profit Industrial and Provident Society It was established in 2003 It works with the Board of the football club and the Supporters Club to develop a more successful football club The annual membership subscription of the Trust is 5 but Trust members can take out either a silver membership of 5 a month or a gold membership of 10 a month The cash obtained from membership of the Trust is used to buy shares the football club has for sale and hence the club benefits financially Since its inception the Trust has given money to the club and its members have given their time and labour towards several projects The current Chairman of the Stenousemuir Supporters Trust is Graeme Wallace who is also the stadium announcer at Ochilview

The Great Attractor is a gigantic mass in space which pulls our Milky Way galaxy and many other galaxies towards itp60 

The Great Attractor is a localised concentration of mass equivalent to tens of thousands of Milky Ways It is known by its effect on the motion of galaxies over a region hundreds of millions of light years across 

These galaxies are all redshifted in accordance with the expansion of the Universe They are receding relative to us and to each other but the variations in their redshift reveal the existence of the Attractor The variations in their redshifts range from about 700 kms to 700 kms depending on the angular deviation from the direction to the Great Attractor

The position of the Great Attractor was finally worked out in 1986 It is between 150 and 250 million light years away Objects in that direction lie in the Zone of Avoidance and so are difficult to study with visible wavelengths However X ray observations have revealed that the region of space is dominated by the Norma Cluster a massive cluster of galaxies with large old galaxies many of which are colliding with their neighbours andor radiating large amounts of radio waves

In 2005 astronomers conducting an X ray survey of part of the sky known as the Clusters in the Zone of Avoidance The survey confirmed earlier theories that the Milky Way galaxy was in fact being pulled towards a much more massive cluster of galaxies near the Shapley Supercluster which is beyond the Great Attractor

The Cubs Win Flag is a flag that is flown at Wrigley Field after every Chicago Cubs home win The flag is called by about a dozen names These names usually include several of the following words either Cubs or Chicago Cubs Win W White White W or W Win and flag banner or banner flag Other common names for the symbol include Chicago Cubs W Win Flag and Chicago Cubs Win Banner Flag It has become an important symbol for fans Days when the win flag is flown are known as White Flag Days The tradition of flying a win or loss flag over the stadium began soon after the scoreboard was built in 1937

The flag has used two different colors with the letter W on a solid background The flag used now is white with a blue W There is a flag used for losses with a letter L This flag is blue with a white L on it Additionally lights are shone on the flags that show if it was a win or loss A new flag is used for each win Some stores sell versions of the flag that also have the Cubs logo at the bottom

Wrigley Field is a sports stadium the baseball park where the Chicago Cubs play in Major League Baseball The ballpark is in Chicago Illinois The Cubs have been playing there since 1916 

The ballpark is located on the north side of Chicago It is on a block bounded by Addison Street Clark Street Waveland Avenue and Sheffield Avenue It was built in 1914 for the Chicago Whales of the Federal League The Federal League disbanded after the 1915 season The Cubs moved from their previous home West Side Park to this ballpark in 1916

The Chicago Bears of the National Football League played their home games at Wrigley Field from 1921 through 1970 They moved to Soldier Field in 1971

Wrigley Field has also hosted events such as soccer and hockey It has also been used as a filming location for some Hollywood movies

The ballpark has a cozy feel Fans often call it The Friendly Confines That nickname was made famous by former Cubs player Ernie Banks

The Zone of Avoidance is the area of the night sky that is obscured by our own galaxy the Milky Way

Dust and stars in the plane of the Milky Way obstruct our view of about 20 of the sky at visible wavelengths As a result optical galaxy catalogues are usually very incomplete close to the galactic plane

In more recent years many projects have attempted to bridge the gap in our knowledge caused by the Zone of Avoidance However the effects of the Zone drops at longer wavelengths such as the infrared and the Milky Way is effectively transparent at radio wavelengths Surveys in the infrared have given us a more complete picture of the extragalactic sky Indeed two very large nearby galaxies Maffei 1 and Maffei 2 were discovered in the Zone of Avoidance by Paolo Maffei by their infrared emission in 1968 Even so about 10 of the sky remains difficult to survey because extragalactic objects can be confused with stars in the Milky Way 

Projects to survey the Zone of Avoidance at radio wavelengths have detected many galaxies that could not be detected in the infrared Examples of galaxies detected from their HI emission include Dwingeloo 1 and Dwingeloo 2

Important superclusters of galaxies lying hidden or partly hidden by ZOA are The Great Attractor and the Norma Cluster

The Norma Cluster is a rich cluster of galaxies near the center of the Great Attractor 

It is both nearby and bright but it is difficult to observe because it is in the Zone of Avoidance This is a region near the plane of the Milky Way which obscures our view The cluster is hidden by interstellar dust at optical wavelengths Its mass is estimated to be on the order of 1015 solar masses

The concept of Lewis acid and Lewis base is one of acids and bases which is independent of the idea of protons Gilbert Newton Lewis developed this idea in the early 20th century In this concept a Lewis acid can accept and bind electrons Lewis acid is a substance that accepts two electrons to form a covalent bond A Lewis base is a substance that gives two electrons in the bonding A Lewis acid together with a Lewis base will react to make a compound called a Lewis adduct

Shamrock Rovers Football Club is a football club from Dublin Ireland They play in the Premier Division of the League of Ireland The club is the most successful in Irelands football history

The club was founded in 1901 and is named after Shamrock Avenue in Dublin where the club was founded They started playing friendly matches In 190405 they began to play in a league From 1907 till 1914 they were not allowed to play because they had no homeground 1921 they missed the founding of the league of Ireland but the next season they played in this league an won the title The next decades the Rovers were very successful 1967 they played as Boston Rovers one season in the United Soccer Association in the USA

In 1987 Glenmalure Park the homeground was sold by the club owners as building area The club started to build a new stadium in Dublins surburb Tallaght but came into financal troubles The County South Dublin finished the construction in 2009 and so the Rovers have a new homeground During the troubles the club was also relegated to the first division of the League of Irland in 2005 but 2007 they won and were again promoted to the Premier Divison

Through a 21 after extra time against the Rovers are qualified for the UEFA Euro League group stage 201112 They will play in group A versus Tottenham Hotspur Rubin Kasan and PAOK Saloniki

The galactic plane is the plane in which most of a disk shaped galaxys mass lies 

The directions perpendicular to the galactic plane point to the galactic poles In actual use the terms galactic plane and galactic poles usually refer specifically to the plane and poles of the Milky Way the galaxy where the Earth is

Some galaxies are irregular and do not have any well defined disk Even in the case of a spiral galaxy like the Milky Way defining the galactic plane is imprecise since the stars are not perfectly in the plane 

The Great Wall sometimes referred to as the CfA2 Great Wall is one of the largest known super structures in the Universe

It is a huge group of galaxies about 200 million light years away The Great Wall is like a long filament it is over 500 million light years long 300 million light years wide and 15 million light years thick It was discovered in 1989 by Margaret Geller and John Huchra from redshift survey data

We do not know how much farther the wall extends Our view is blocked by the galactic plane of the Milky Way The gas and dust from the Milky Way obscures the view of astronomers This makes it impossible to find out if the wall ends or continues on further 

In the standard model of the evolution of the universe such structures as the Great Wall form along and follow web like strings of dark matter It is thought that this dark matter dictates the structure of the Universe on the grandest of scales Dark matter gravitationally attracts baryonic matter and it is this normal matter that astronomers see forming long thin walls of super galactic clusters

The Local Group is the group of galaxies that includes Earths galaxy the Milky Way 

The group has more than 30 galaxies Its gravitational center is somewhere between the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy The galaxies of the Local Group cover a 10 million light year diameter and have a binary shape The group has a total mass of aboute12Ms The group itself is part of the Virgo Supercluster

The term The Local Group was introduced by Edwin Hubble in 1936 He describes it as a typical small group of nebulae which is isolated in the general field He listed the galaxies by decreasing luminosity as the Andromeda Galaxy the Milky Way Triangulum Galaxy the Large Magellanic Cloud the Small Magellanic Cloud and half a dozen others 

By 2003 the number of known Local Group members has increased from his initial twelve to thirty six by way of the discovery of almost two dozen low luminosity galaxies

In chemistry a proton is a positively charged hydrogen ion According to IUPAC the name hydron should be used for such a particle In this sense a hydron can be a proton in the sense of physics a deuteron or a triton A deuteron is the ion of deuterium a triton that of tritium In 1923 Johannes Nicolaus Brnsted and Thomas Lowry used hydrons to describe acids and bases They defined acids as proton donors and bases as proton acceptors

Hexactinellid sponges are sponges with a skeleton made of four andor six pointed silaceous spicules often referred to as glass sponges They are usually classified along with other sponges but some researchers consider them sufficiently distinct to deserve their own phylum Symplasma

The Demospongiae are the largest class in the phylum Porifera Their skeletons are made of spicules consisting of fibers of the protein spongin the mineral silica or both Where spicules of silica are present they have a different shape from those in the otherwise similar glass sponges

An Eephus pitch is a kind of pitch in baseball It is a kind of junk pitch An Eephus pitch is very slow and is used to catch the batter off guard The pitch was invented by Rip Sewell of the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1940s The name Eephus pitch comes from the Hebrew word efes which means nothing Pirates manager Frankie Frisch claimed that the pitch was named by outfielder Maurice Van Robays Van Robays explained that Eephus aint nothing and thats a nothing pitch

 Common features 

The Eephus pitch is thrown overhand like other pitches in baseball It is unusually slow and has a high arc trajectory The trajectory looks more like a pitch from slow pitch softball than baseball 

The Eephus pitch is unusually slow It appears to move in slow motion The ball travels convert55mph or less Baseball pitches in Major League Baseball usually travel between convert70to100mphkmh The Eephus pitch is considered a trick pitch because it is so slow

The Eephus pitch is sometimes called by other names These names usually refer to an Eephus pitch thrown by a specific pitcher Some of the most famous of these names are

Some other nicknames are bloop curve and gravity curve It is sometimes also called the Bugs Bunny curve This name comes from a Bugs Bunny cartoon called Baseball Bugs In the cartoon batters swing three times at a very slow pitch before it reaches home plate

The University of Antofagasta is a university located in Antofagasta Chile It is one of the universities in the north of Chile

Simon Denis Poisson was a French mathematician and physicist From 1798 he studied mathematics at the cole polytechnique where he met Pierre Simon Laplace and Joseph Louis Lagrange In 1802 he became professor in 1806 he took the position Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier had before him Napoleon sent Fourier to Grenoble Poisson was a disciple of Laplace Poisson worked on the mathematical bases of wave theory acoustics elasticity electricity and heat He was also interested in the electric properties of solids In 1812 he published his extension of Laplaces equation which allowed its use for electric charge at the surface of solids In the year 1818 he predicted the existence of a phenomenon called the Poisson spot in the case that light should have the character of a wave Poisson thought that was not the case and that it had the character of particles He had long discussions with Christiaan Huygens who thought that light was indeed a wave This discussion only ended when Huygens could show the existence of the spot Poisson had predicted in an experiment In 1838 Poisson published his ideas on probability theory which also included what is now known as Poisson distribution This distribution was already known to Abraham de Moivre 

The relation between pressure and volume in the adiabatic process is constant this is known as Poissons Law today In thermodynamics the same relation is formulated as a number of equations which are known as Poissons equations Poissons ratio which gives the amount an object is stretched under load is also named after him 

His name is one of 72 honored on the Eiffel tower 

Like most viruses rotaviruses are made from RNA and protein The RNA carries the genes that are used to make more rotaviruses They are called rotaviruses because they sometimes look like little wheels and rota is the latin word for wheel Rotaviruses get into the body through the mouth and are not present in the air like the viruses that cause colds The disease is most often spread by dirty hands and things used for cooking but the viruses can contaminate water Rotaviruses are very small They are a lot smaller than bacteria and can only be seen using an electron microscope 

Children who have not been vaccinated usually get infected more than once But when children are about five years old they are usually immune and cannot get it any more This is because their bodies have become resistant to the viruses

Rotaviruses infect the cells that the small intestine is made from This makes it difficult for the body to digest food Children usually make a complete recovery from the infection But it is very important to make sure they drink enough water to replace what they are losing In many countries the medicine used is called oral rehydration solution This comes in a small packet that is added to drinking water It contains salt and sugar which helps the body take up the water

Rotaviruses were discovered in the 1970s Since then doctors and scientists have shown that they are a problem to children all over the world More than 500000 children die from rotavirus infection each year and almost two million more become severely ill The Bill Melinda Gates Foundation are helping to pay for rotavirus vaccines in countries that cannot afford to buy them Between 2006 and 2011 he gave more than 82 million US dollars

The Croatian National Resistance was a terrorist Ustae emigrant organization The goal of this organization was to destroy Yugoslavia and to establish an independent Croatia following the vision of Ustae leader Ante Paveli and ideology of Mile Budak It was founded in 1955 by escaped Ustae war criminal Vjekoslav Luburi a chief guard of the Jasenovac concentration camp

While Luburi was the head of this organization Odpor maintained regular contacts with associations of Nazi war veterans in Germany and Spain Very close relations were established with fascist Spanish Blue Guard veterans Odpor had stated that We regard Yugoslavism and Yugoslavia as the greatest and only evil that has caused the existing calamity We therefore consider every direct or indirect help to Yugoslavia as treason against the Croatian nation Yugoslavia must be destroyed  be it with the help of the Russians or the Americans of Communists non Communists or anti Communists  with the help of anyone willing the destruction of Yugoslavia destroyed by the dialectic of the word or by dynamite  but at all costs destroyed 

Odpor was heavily involved in racketeering attempted murder extortion hijacking terrorist bombing and other violent crimes After Luburis death his successors on the organization commanding post sought out criminal organization ties with La Cosa Nostra the Provisional Irish Republican Army and the Croatian Mafia in San Pedro

Odpor most spectacular action was the 10 September 1976 hijacking of Trans World Airlines flight en route from New York to Chicago Odpors five hijackers diverted the plane to Newfoundland from there to Iceland and ultimately to Paris with passengers aboard The terrorists had planted a bomb in Grand Central Station After authorities met the terrorists demands the bomb location was revealed The bomb deactivation killed one policeman and another three wounded when they tried to deactivate it After terrorists learned that the bomb in New York had exploded and killed a policeman they surrendered to French police

The leaders of the hijackers of TWA Flight 355 Zvonko Bui and his wife Julienne Bui were both convicted on US federal charges of air piracy and murder in May 1977 and sentenced to life imprisonment 

Julienne Bui was released from prison on lifelong parole in 1989 Zvonko Bui briefly escaped from prison on 16 March 1987 but was quickly captured two days later Julienne Bui was appointed by President Franjo Tudjman to the diplomatic post of adviser to the Croatian ambassador to the United States This appointment of a convicted terrorist to a diplomatic post within the United States drew protests in December 1994 from the New York Patrolmens Benevolent Association as well as from Kathlyn Murray the widow of the police officer killed by the bomb in Grand Central Station in 1976 

Her husband Zvonko Bui was paroled in July 2008 and expelled from the US to Croatia

In 1980es Odpor carried out five bombings in the United States Bombed were

Odpor was banned in Germany for terrorist activities and operated between legitimate emigre functions and a thuggish underworld Its leaders tried to distance the organization from the acts of the so called renegade elements that hijacked international flights and served prison sentences for extortion It embraced a radical nationalist ideology that differed only marginally from Ustae ideology 

A number of terrorist attacks against Yugoslavia were organized by this Ustae organization They were Miro Bareis killing of ambassador Vladimir Rolovi bomb attacks in Belgrade cinemas terrorist group actions in Krajina region during the Croatian Spring of 1971 and the JAT Flight 367 bombing of 1972

The organization published its own magazine Drina Odpor was dissolved in 1991

Bat and ball games are field games played by two teams These teams take turns batting and fielding The team that is batting can score The team that is fielding is defending Both teams have equal chances batting and fielding Bat and ball games are not timed but are counted

The name bat and ball games comes from some common parts of most of these games In most games a player on the fielding team puts a ball into play Then a player on the batting team tries to hit the ball usually with a bat A bat is a kind of club though the size and shape depend on the rules

The two most popular bat and ball games in the world are cricket and baseball Games like golf and hockey which also use clubs are not bat and ball games

Virus classification is the way viruses are put into groups by scientists There are many different kinds of viruses Scientists classify viruses to make it easier to learn about them Classification also helps scientists to remember viruses and the diseases they cause The International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses is in charge of virus classification 

Sometimes different viruses have things in common This is used in classification For example if they are made from DNA and protein or RNA and protein Other things that are taken into account are the size and shape of the viruses and the diseases they cause

Similar viruses are first put into families Each family has a name This family name always ends with viridae For example rotaviruses are in the Reoviridae family and herpes viruses are in the Herpesviridae family

Viruses in any one family that are almost the same are then put in a smaller group called a genus

Another way of classifying viruses is called the Baltimore Classification This is different from the ICTV one Some scientists prefer the Baltimore Classification because it is based on how viruses grow in cells 

Enteroviruses are a group of viruses that usually live in the gut of humans and other mammals Most do not cause disease there They can cause a mild form of meningitis which is an infection near the brain Some members of this group of viruses such as poliovirus can sometimes be more dangerous They are viruses made for RNA and there are many different kinds of them

Firstly apologies for the format I do this because I think it needs to be done

In my opinion we should delete all these pages from this wiki They are basically unreadable by our target audience and likely to damage us It has become clear that the pages are unsimplified copies of very technical enWP articles Most of the chemistry is at graduate level or advance undergraduate level which is an issue worth considering

More important is that the user who brought the material over has not and maybe cannot simplify the contents adequately Apparently he tries but may not know enough chemistry and does not have the editing skills at present to simplify them I would say informally one would need to be a pretty experienced chemistry professor to simplify concepts at this level 

Because the simplification cannot be done quickly if at all the pages should not sit there as they are It is asking for trouble Pages like these are a hostage to fortune we could find extracts used by unfriendly persons against us

It would always be possible for an editor to re introduce any of these topics in a manner which satisfies our rules

Barnards Star also known as Barnards Runaway Star is a very low mass red dwarf star approximately six light years away from Earth in the constellation of Ophiuchus It is very old and moving relatively fast

In 1916 the American astronomer EE Barnard measured its proper motion as 103 arcseconds per year This is the largest known proper motion of any star relative to the Sun At a distance of about 18 parsecs from the Solar System or just under six light years Barnards Star is the nearest known star in the constellation Ophiuchus and the fourth closest known individual star to the Sun after the three components of the Alpha Centauri system Despite its proximity Barnards Star at a dim apparent magnitude of about nine is not visible with the unaided eye however it is much brighter in infrared light than it is in visible light

Barnards Star has been the subject of much study and it has probably received more attention from astronomers than any other class M dwarf star due to its proximity and favorable location for observation near the celestial equator Barnards Star is also notable as the target for Project Daedalus a study on the possibility of fast unmanned travel to nearby star systems

At seven to 12 billion years of age Barnards Star is considerably older than the Sun and it might be among the oldest stars in the Milky Way galaxy Barnards Star rotates just once every 130 days In 1998 astronomers observed an intense stellar flare showing that Barnards Star is a flare star Barnards Star has the variable star designation V2500 Ophiuchi 

The proper motion of Barnards Star is sideways relative to our line of sight to the Sun of 90 kilometers per second The 103 seconds of arc it travels annually amount to a quarter of a degree in a human lifetime roughly half the angular diameter of the full Moon

The radial velocity of Barnards Star towards the Sun can be measured by its blue shift These measurements combined with proper motion suggest a true velocity relative to the Sun of about 140 kms

While Barnards Star has the largest proper motion the largest known true velocity of another star in the Milky Way belongs to Wolf 424 at 555 kms 

Barnards Star will make its closest approach to the Sun around AD 11700 when it approaches to within about 38 light years However at that time it will not be the nearest star since Proxima Centauri will have moved even closer to the Sun Barnards Star will still be too dim to be seen with the naked eye at the time of its closest approach since its apparent magnitude will be about 85 then After that it will gradually recede from the Sun

A pyramid scheme is a way of making money that cannot continue very long It involves promising people payment services or ideals primarily for enrolling other people into the scheme or training them to take part It does not supply any real investment or sale of products or services to the public Pyramid schemes are a form of fraud For this reason pyramid schemes are illegal in many countries 

This type of scheme has existed for at least a century The way the scheme is described is sometimes changed to hide what it is doing Many people believe that multilevel marketing is also a pyramid scheme

A successful pyramid scheme combines a business that seems real with a simple to understand money making description which is used for profit The idea is that the first person Mr X makes a payment To get money Mr X has to recruit others like him who will also make a payment Mr X gets paid out of money received from those new people The recruits go on to involve others As each new recruit makes a payment Mr X gets a part He is promised always increasing benefits as the business expands Such businesses do not have real products or services To make them more believable most such scams are well equipped with fake letters from successful members and information Only the first person and a very few at the top levels of the pyramid make a lot of money The amounts get much smaller further down the pyramid Someone at the bottom of the pyramid loses money They paid to enter but cannot get anyone else to joinThis is not MLM Multi Level Marketing

Recruiting a large number of others into a scheme can be difficult so a system is used that seems more simple In this model each person must recruit only two others However a larger number of levels is needed before the person gets paid any money The scheme requires a person to recruit two others who must each recruit two others who must each recruit two others  The eight ball model contains a total of fifteen members This scheme has been called the Airplane Game and the four tiers labelled as captain co pilot crew and passenger to denote a persons level Such schemes may hide their pyramid nature by calling themselves as gifting circles with money being gifted The eight passengers must each pay a sum to join the scheme This total of 8000 goes to the captain who leaves the scheme Everyone remaining moves up one level There are now two new captains so the group splits in two with each group requiring eight new passengers A person who joins the scheme as a passenger will not get any money until they advance through the crew and co pilot levels to captain Therefore the participants in the bottom 3 tiers of the pyramid lose their money if the scheme collapses Popular schemes such as the Women Empowering Women do this

BMW has been in Formula One since the beginning of the World Drivers Championship in F11950 BMW entered several races in the 1950s and 1960s Often they ran using the Formula Two rules In the 1980s they built the BMW M1213 inline four turbocharged engine This engine was built for the Brabham team Nelson Piquet won the F11983 championship driving a Brabham BMW BMW also supplied the M1213 engine to the ATS Arrows Benetton and Ligier teams In F11988 Brabham left F1 for the F11988 season and BMW stopped its official backing of the engines Arrows still used the engine with the Megatron name When Formula One banned turbocharged engines in F11989 the M1213 could no longer be used

BMW returned to Formula One in F12000 They made a deal to supply engines to only the Williams team The engine was a new V10 engine The engine deal with Williams ended after the F12005 season BMW then bought the rival Sauber team The BMW Sauber project lasted from F12006 until F12009 Sauber a former privateer team became more competitive In F12008 Robert Kubica won the teams only race the Canadian Grand Prix with Nick Heidfeld finishing second After the 2009 season BMW withdrew from F1 They sold the team back to its founder Peter Sauber

The early years of the World Drivers Championship saw private BMW racing cars based on the pre war BMW 328 chassis They were entered in the German Grands Prix in F11952 and F11953 A modified 328 with a rear engine became standard in Formula One in the early 1960s It was known as the Heck the German automotive term for back or rear This design later found success with the Cooper team

In F11967 German Grand Prix BMW entered Hubert Hahne in a Lola chassis powered by an larger BMW engine and David Hobbs in the Lola with the standard smaller BMW engine For the F11968 German Grand Prix Hahne returned and finished tenth BMWs best result in Formula One to that date BMW then entered three of its own 269 F2 chassis for the F11969 German Grand Prix for Hahne Gerhard Mitter and Dieter Quester Mitter was killed in a practice accident The remaining BMW team withdrew from the race BMW left F1 for a number of years

In F11977 Renault entered Formula One with a turbocharged engine After the success Renault had BMW decided to develop its own turbo engine BMW announced the new program in April 1980 The engine was based on the BMW M10 a four cylinder 15 litre normally aspirated engine designed in the late 1950s The racing version the M12 had been successful in Formula Two and other series The prototype 14 litre turbo engine soon developed 600 bhp It used a single Khnle Kopp Kausch turbocharger Bosch electronics and fuel injection This engine was developed into the M1213 the race engine BMW supplied to five teams from 1982 to 1988

BMW first made a deal to supply the M1213 engine only to the Brabham Testing of the M1213 started in late 1980 A new car Brabham BT50 was design for the engine The new car was not finished until will into the F11981 season The teams lead driver Nelson Piquet tested the BT50 throughout 1981 The car was unreliable until Bosch improved the electronics

Brabham began the 1982 season with two BMW powered BT50 chassis Because of reliability problems the BT50 was not used at all the races that year BMW saw their first win in F11982 Canadian Grand Prix where the cool conditions helped the turbocharged engine The BT50 was used for the rest of the season The car was still unreliable and the drivers only made four finishes the rest of the season 

In F11983 the reliability of the BMW engine was improved The new Brabham BT52 allowed Nelson Piquet to win the Drivers Championship Brabham finished third in the Constructors Championship BMW also began supplying its engines to the German ATS team this season Manfred Winkelhock the only driver for the team was unable to score any points

For F11984 BMW expanded to three teams supplying the M1213 to Arrows In F11985 BMW was back to two teams ATS had left Formula One Piquet won one race the F11995 French Grand Prix It was the only win for BMW that year

For the 1986 season BMW was back to three teams with the addition of Benetton Benetton had the most success scoring 19 points and winning the Mexican Grand Prix In F11987 BMW only supplied Brabham with works engines Arrows and Ligier used the Megatron a rebadged BMW engine At the end of the year Benetton team owner Bernie Ecclestone decided not to compete the following year This ended the BMW turbo engine The Arrows team still used the Megatrons engine for F11988 They finished fifth in the Constructors Championship their best finish in the teams 25 year history

For F11989 the technical regulations were changed to ban turbocharged engines During the M1213 engines time in F1 the engine had won the 1983 Drivers Championship and nine Grands Prix It also took 14 pole positions and set 13 fastest laps

Williams had been very successful using Renault engines They won the F11992 F11993 F11996 and F11997 Drivers Championships They also won the F11992 F11993 F11994 F11996 and F11997 Constructors Championships When Renault left F1 at the end of 1997 Williams needed a new engine In F11998 the BMW signed a contract to supply the Williams team with engines 

BMW spent 18 months building and testing a normally aspirated 30 litre V10 engine The E41 engine was ready to race in the 2000 season The Williams FW22 with the BMW E41 engine was driven by Ralf Schumacher and Jenson Button Schumacher scored a podium finish in the engines first race The team finished the year with two more podium finishes and third in the Constructors Championship

For F12001 BMW designed a more aggressive P80 engine The engine had a big power improvement Schumacher and new team mate Juan Pablo Montoya scored four race wins For F12002 the team won only one race with Schumacher at the Malaysian Grand Prix Montoya took seven pole positions but was not able to win a single race

The Williams team was more competitive in F12003 Both drivers won on two time For F12004 Williams produced the FW26 chassis with a radical nose section This design did not work very well Williams slipped to fourth in the Constructors Championship Montoyas victory in the Brazilian Grand Prix the teams only win Both Schumacher and Montoya left the team at the end of the season

BMW bought Swiss team Sauber in June 2005 to form the BMW Sauber F1 Team The takeover came after BMWs relationship with Williams had deteriorated in the previous months the partnership ending at the end of the f12005 season The team was based at Saubers headquarters in Hinwil Switzerland and BMWs headquarters in Munich Germany

The team scored two podium finishes and came fifth in 2006 its first season in Formula One This was followed by a second place in 2007 after the McLaren team had been excluded from the championship Polish driver Robert Kubica took the teams only Grand Prix victory at the 2008 Canadian Grand Prix Following a poor f12009 season BMW withdrew from Formula One and sold the team back to founder Peter Sauber

For the 2006 season BMW Sauber signed Nick Heidfeld from Williams to be the lead driver while F11997 World Champion Jacques Villeneuve had his existing two year contract with Sauber honoured Robert Kubica was signed as the teams third driver The team continued to use Saubers facilities mostly for chassis construction and wind tunnel testing while BMWs headquarters in Munich were responsible for building the new 24 litre P86 V8 engine revised technical regulations forcing a change from the 3 litre V10 formula This replaced the Petronas badged Ferrari engines which the team had used since 1997 The Sauber teams existing major sponsors Petronas and Credit Suisse renewed their contracts with BMW The team also announced a technical partnership with technology company Intel The teams new livery which was maintained throughout its tenure in Formula One consisted of the traditional BMW blue and white with a hint of red

Villeneuve scored the teams first points with a seventh place finish at the Malaysian Grand Prix after Heidfeld retired from fifth with an engine failure late in the race Over the first two thirds of the season the drivers picked up points with a succession of seventh and eighth place finishes plus a fourth place finish for Heidfeld at the Australian Grand Prix The team ran a radical twin towers aero enhancement on the front of the car for the French Grand Prix which was meant improve the flow of air over the top of the chassis The parts were promptly banned by the Fdration Internationale de lAutomobile as they were adjudged to impede the drivers vision and thus compromise safety

Heidfeld scored the teams first podium finish at the Hungarian Grand Prix from tenth on the grid This race also saw the dbut of Robert Kubica who replaced Villeneuve after the latter had crashed heavily at the preceding German Grand Prix Kubica finished seventh although he was later disqualified after his car was found to be underweight The official reason for Villeneuves absence was that he was recovering from his previous accident but the team later announced that the driver change was permanent Kubica scored BMW Saubers second podium finish of the season at the Italian Grand Prix after running in third place for most of the race and leading briefly during the first round of pit stops Heidfeld finished in eighth but set the teams first fastest lap The team scored a total of 36 points to finish fifth in the Constructors Championship an improvement on Saubers eighth position with 20 points in F12005

On 19 October 2006 BMW announced that Robert Kubica would partner Nick Heidfeld for the 2007 Formula One season with Sebastian Vettel taking the test and reserve driver role Timo Glock was later signed as the teams second test driver The team launched its 2007 car the F107 on January 16 2007

The new car showed promising form throughout winter testing topping the times sheets on occasions However team principal Mario Theissen declared some reliability concerns before the seasons opening race in Australia Kubica retired from fourth place with a gearbox problem but Heidfeld took over the position and held it to the end of the race In the early races of the season Heidfeld and Kubica scored a series of points finishes and established BMW Sauber as the third fastest team behind Ferrari and McLaren Theissen also made the point that the performance gap between BMW Sauber and the two top teams was less than the gap between BMW Sauber and the teams behind it

The Canadian Grand Prix brought mixed fortunes for the team While Heidfeld scored BMW Saubers best result thus far with a second place finish Kubica suffered a huge crash that resulted in a long safety car period The media was initially told Kubica had broken his leg but it later proved that he had escaped with only a sprained ankle and concussion Vettel took his place in the United States Grand Prix finishing in eighth place and therefore becoming the youngest driver to score a Formula One World Championship point Later in the season Vettel moved teams to take a race seat at the Toro Rosso team

Kubica returned to racing action at the French Grand Prix and proved his recovery by finishing in fourth position Over the remainder of the season he and Heidfeld continued their form to score a total of 101 points which secured the team second in the Constructors Championship after McLarens disqualification Heidfeld scored another podium finish at the Hungarian Grand Prix and scored 61 points to Kubicas 39 while Vettels sole appearance produced an additional point

On August 21 2007 BMW confirmed its driver line up of Heidfeld and Kubica for the F12008 season Their 2008 car the F108 was officially launched in Munich at BMW Welt on January 14 2008 It made its track debut at Valencia the next day with Robert Kubica driving Team principal Mario Theissen set the target of the teams first win

BMW Sauber started the season well with Kubica narrowly missing out on pole after a mistake in his main qualifying lap in Melbourne He later retired after being hit by Kazuki Nakajima but Heidfeld finished second Kubica took second in Malaysia with Heidfeld in 6th setting the fastest lap of the race The teams points total of 11 was their largest score up to that time In Bahrain Kubica scored his and the teams first ever pole position beating Felipe Massa by just under three hundredths of a second The team went on to finish 3rd and 4th in the race equalling their highest round points total and promoting them to first place in the constructors championship for the first time

The team also attained a second place finish in the Monaco Grand Prix with Robert Kubica beating both Ferraris and only trailing the McLaren of Lewis Hamilton by three seconds

BMW Saubers first race victory came in the 2008 Canadian Grand Prix the team achieving a one two finish with Robert Kubicas first race win and Nick Heidfeld taking second place The victory came after Lewis Hamilton collided with Kimi Rikknen in the pitlane ending the race for both drivers Kubica was on a different refueling strategy from Heidfeld who also briefly led the race before securing the one two finish for BMW Sauber in comfortable fashion

After the teams breakthrough win development was switched to the 2009 season where new regulations come into play This greatly annoyed Kubica as he felt they could have had a realistic chance of taking at least one title The lack of development was reflected with a drop of form throughout the second half of the season causing BMW to be outpaced by Renault Toyota and even Toro Rosso by the end of the season Despite this Kubica remained with an outside chance of taking the drivers championship until the Chinese Grand Prix the 17th round out of 18

In October the team confirmed that they would stick with Robert Kubica and Nick Heidfeld as their drivers for the F12009 Season

Although BMW Sauber targeted the F12009 season as the year they would challenge for the title their start to the season was a disappointment Kubica was running in 3rd place in the opening round when he collided with Vettel while battling for 2nd place and was forced to retire Heidfeld then secured the teams first podium of the year in Malaysia but after 6 races BMW Sauber had collected a mere 6 points and occupied 8th place in the Constructors Championship out of 10 teams A raft of upgrades were set for Turkey including an improved regenerative braking system and a double deck diffuser While the new diffuser was implemented the KERS could not be made to fit the new car and both drivers raced without the device After the qualifying session for the British Grand Prix Mario Theissen announced that the team had decided to halt further development KERS of which BMW had been one of the strongest proponents and focus instead on improving the cars aerodynamics This left Ferrari and McLaren as the only remaining users of the KERS system In the European Grand Prix at Valencia Robert Kubica scored the teams first points since the race in Turkey

Following a meeting of the BMW board on July 28 the company held at press conference the following morning in which it confirmed the teams withdrawal from Formula One at the end of 2009 Chairman Dr Norbert Reithofer described the decision as a strategic one The Formula One Teams Association released a statement in response pledging its support to help the team remain in F1

On 15 September 2009 it was announced that BMW Sauber had secured a buyer Qadbak Investments Limited which said to represent European and Middle Eastern interests However Lotus had been given the 13th and final slot in the 2010 Championship The team were awarded what was termed a 14th entry which hinges either on another team dropping out or all the other teams agreeing to allow 28 cars to enter the 2010 Championship

On November 22 Swiss newspaper SonntagsZeitung revealed that Qadbaks attempt to purchase the team had failed as it did not have the necessary funds Qadbak turned out to be a shell company with no assets and no investors behind it On November 27 2009 it was announced that Peter Sauber would repurchase the team conditional upon the team receiving a FIA entry for the 2010 season The FIA subsequently granted Sauber an entry on December 3 The team used Ferrari engines in F12010

The team retained the BMW Sauber name for the f12010 season despite using Ferrari engines

Primary Interstate Highways are the major interstate highways of the United States and have a one or two digit route number Even route numbers are given to eastwest routes with the smaller numbered routes in the south and bigger numbered routes in the north Similarly odd route numbers are given to northsouth routes with the smaller numbered routes in the west and the bigger numbered routes in the east

There are five sets of numbers that are used more than once throughout the system the highways whose numbers are used more than once are separated by big distances to avoid confusion Below these are made separate from each other by West and East

Three digit Interstates are spur or loop Interstates that usually are in big cities and areas outside of cities The last two digits of a three digit Interstate are always the number of the route it is related to If the first digit is odd the Interstate is usually a spur route while if the first digit is even the Interstate is usually a loop route 

There are 66 primary Interstates that are in the table below with 43 of them having three digit routes The lengths in the table are as of October 31 2002

Routes ending in 0 or 5 are marked in green

Interstate Highways are not only in the 48 states of the United States that border but there are also Interstates in Hawaii Alaska and Puerto Rico

The Interstate Highways in the island of Ookinaahu Hawaii are signed with the normal Interstate shield with the letter H added before the number They are fully controlled access routes built to the same standards as the Interstate routes in the main part of the United States

The Federal Highway Administration gives money to four routes in Alaska and three routes in Puerto Rico under the same program as the rest of the Interstate Highway System However these routes do not have to meet the same standards as the Interstate routes in the main part of the United States

Alaskas Interstates do not have signs to mark them although they all have state highway numbers that are not the same as the Interstate numbers

Like Alaska Puerto Rico signs its Interstates as territorial routes and the numbers are not the same as their official Interstate designations Many of the territorys routes are freeway standard toll roads

JIT Just In Time compilation is a way to translate bytecode instructions to instructions the processor understands Bytecode is a set of computer instructions for a processor that only exists on paper 

The alternative to a JIT is an interpreter that looks at each bytecode instruction individually and then decides what to with it When you run over the same part of the program again an interpreter has to make the decisions again While a JIT makes the decisions on how to handle the bytecode once and then stores it as native processor instructions Properly deciding how to translate bytecode take some time so you have some minor slowdown in startup speed A proper modern JIT first runs a regular interpreter and then does the JIT step once it knows something is used frequently

Dragan Klaric born 1965 is a Swedish blogger and former Sweden Democrats politician of Croatian origin He was the head of SD television the Sweden Democrats own TV station and a full time party employee He left the party in temper motivating his resignation by writing the reason for my resignation is that I was assfucked a mere month before the election as I was requested to resign from my chair at SD television Two years and eight months of faithful and loyal service to the party is suddenly forgotten

Klaric has been found guilty of libel three times in tort cases and has been forced to pay damages in every case In 2009 the Helsingborg district court found him guilty of libel against Tommy Funebo and once more in 2010 against Fredrik Jnsson However he was not found guilty of the comments somebody wrote about Jnsson on Klarics blog which Klaric approved The court of appeal of Skne and Blekinge later overruled the district court finding him guilty

Klarics blog was investigated by the Swedish anti racist newspaper Expo during its review of the atmosphere of the Sweden Democrats community on the Internet On May 20 2010 press ombudsman Yrsa Stenius stated that Klaric from a press ethical point of view was to be considered a public person

On January 7 2011 Swedish newspaper Helsingborgs Dagblad reported that the party and Dragan Klaric will end their cooperation in a legal dispute since they do not agree on Klarics time as chair of SD television According to SD the party holds the copyright to all of the material from SD television and in addition SD demands that Klaric returns all equipment he has taken from the station Klaric refuses to comply arguing that SD television was his own private project and not a part of his employment and thus that he alone owns the physical as well as intellectual property of the station The events surrounding his resignation were covered by Expo

After leaving the party Klaric has intensively criticized the SD leadership on his blog

The George Medal is the second highest civil award of the United Kingdom and Commonwealth It ranks below the George Cross It is only awarded for non combat acts of bravery 

The GM was created on 24 September 1940 by King George VI At this time during the height of The Blitz there was a desire to reward acts of civilian courage It was decided that the George Cross and the GM would recognise civilian bravery in the face of enemy action and brave deeds more widely

Announcing the new award the King said 

The Warrant for the GM was published in the London Gazette on 31 January 1941 The medal is granted in recognition of acts of great bravery The GM was originally not issued posthumously but the warrant was amended in 1977 to allow posthumous awards several of which have been subsequently made

The medal is primarily a civilian award but it may be awarded to military personnel for gallant conduct that is not in the face of the enemy As the Warrant states

Bars are awarded to the GM in recognition of the performance of further acts of bravery meriting the award In undress uniform or on occasions when the medal ribbon alone is worn a silver rosette is worn on the ribbon to indicate each bar Recipients are entitled to the postnominal letters GM

The details of all awards to British and Commonwealth recipients are published in the London Gazette

The Croix de guerre is a military medal of both France and Belgium 

It was first created in 1915 in both countries It consists of a square cross medal on two crossed swords hanging from a ribbon with various degree pins The decoration was awarded during World War I again in World War II and in other conflicts The Croix de guerre was also often awarded to foreign military forces allied to France and Belgium

The Croix de guerre may be given to a unit or to individuals who for acts of heroism involving combat with enemy forces The medal is also awarded to those who have been mentioned in despatches This means a heroic deed was performed meriting a citation from an individuals headquarters unit The unit award of the Croix de guerre was issued to military commanders who performed heroic deeds in combat and were subsequently recognized by headquarters

A scallop is a marine bivalve mollusc of the family Pectinidae Scallops live in all of the worlds oceans They have a good reputation as a food source As bivalves they have two shells The lower shell is usually white It can also be orange or Lemon Yellow Shell collectors often collect the coloured fan shaped shells

The name scallop comes from the Old French escalope which means shell Their shells can be up to 15 centimetres wide

There are more than 300 types of scallop

Scallops have a central adductor muscle This is the same as true oysters The inside of their shell has a scar in the middle This shows where this muscle attaches to the shell The adductor muscle of scallops is larger and more developed than the adductor muscle of oysters This is because they swim a lot Some fishermen and scientists think that scallops migrate However there is not much evidence to support this Their shell shape is quite regular It is an archetypal form of a seashell The scallop shell is a common decorative motif

Scallops have over 100 blue eyes It is common for them to grow more so the number changes often When they are injured scallops can grow their eyes again When they lose all their eyes scallops can grow them back within two months The eyes are around the edges of their mantles They are reflector eyes about one millimetre in diameter Their retinae are more complex than other bivalves retinae Their eyes have two retina types One responds to light and the other responds to darkness such as the shadow of a close predator They cannot resolve shapes However they can see patterns of light and motion that change

Reflector eyes are similar to a lens It is as if mirrors formed the inside of the eye These mirrors then reflect the image to focus at a central point This means if someone looked into the pupil of one of these eyes he would see the same image that the organism would see The scallop Pecten has up to 100 millimetre scale reflector eyes on the edge of its shell It detects moving objects when they pass each lens

Most scallops are filter feeders They eat plankton The plankton sometimes has scallop larvae in it Siphons bring water over a filtering structure Mucus then traps the food Next the cilia on the structure moves the food to the mouth Then the scallop digests the food in the stomach and digestive gland Waste goes through the intestine and exits through the anus

Most scallops live freely However some species attach to a substrate by a structure called a byssus Some cement to their substrate as adults Other scallops can extend a foot from their shell When they contract the foot they can go deeper into the sand A free living scallop swims by opening and closing its shell very fast The scallop can defend itself in this way It protects the scallop from threatening predators Singing Scallops can make a small popping sound when they open and close their shells underwater

Some scallops such as the Atlantic bay scallop Argopecten irradians do not live for a long time Others can live 20 years or more One can estimate their age from the annuli the concentric rings on their shells

The scallop family is unusual because of the variety in arrangements for sexual reproduction In some members of the family one scallop has only one sex They are either male or female However others are simultaneous hermaphrodites so a single scallop has both male and female reproductive organs at the same time A few scallops even change sexes They are male when they are young and they become female when they grow older

Red roe comes from female scallops White roe comes from males Scallops release Spermatozoa and ova freely into the water during the mating season Fertilized ova sink to the bottom The immature scallop hatches after a few weeks The larvae drift in the plankton until they go to the bottom again to grow They usually attach by means of byssal threads

The largest wild scallop fishery is for the Atlantic sea scallop off northeastern United States and eastern Canada Most of the rest of the worlds production of scallops is from Japan and China In 2005 China accounted for 80 of the global scallop and pecten catch according to a Food and Agriculture Organization study 

Scallops are most often harvested using scallop dredges or bottom trawls Recently fishmongers have started selling scallops harvested by divers They catch them by hand on the ocean floor They are often less gritty than scallops collected by dredges They may also be more ecologically friendly This is because the harvesting method does not damage the undersea plants or animals Also dredge harvesting methods sometimes delay the arrival of the scallops at the market This can cause the flesh to deteriorate and it results in a much shorter shelf life

In New Zealand numbers of scallops have fallen Therefore the Tasman Bay area has been closed to commercial scallop harvesting for the past two years Scientists are conducting research funded by the industry to study harvesting patterns Forest and Bird list scallops as Worst Choice in their Best Fish Guide for sustainable seafood species

Over the last 100 years on the east coast of the United States the numbers of bay scallops have fallen a lot This is because of several things The main factor is the reduction in sea grasses because of the development on the coast Bay scallop spat attach to these grasses Another possible factor is the reduction of shark numbers They are often fished too much This variety of shark feeds on rays Rays are the main predator of bay scallops With fewer sharks rays can freely eat scallops This is greatly decreasing their numbers By contrast the Atlantic sea scallop is very abundant after recovery from overfishing 

Scallops are popular in both Eastern and Western cooking They have two types of meat in one shell The adductor muscle is white and meaty The roe called coral is red orange or white and soft

In Western cuisine scallops are often sauted in butter or breaded and deep fried The byssus is often tough It is usually discarded or used later on for stock Sometimes markets sell scallops already prepared in the shell with only the adductor muscle Outside the US the scallop is often sold whole and people eat the adductor muscle and roe 

Dry packed scallops have no additives in them Wet packed scallops have sodium tripolyphosphate put in them STPP makes the scallops absorb moisture before the freezing process This way fishermen get a better price per unit of weight 

In Japanese cuisine scallops may be served in soup or prepared as sashimi or sushi 

In a sushi bar hotategai is the traditional scallop on rice Kaibashira might be scallop but it can also be the adductor muscle of any kind of shellfish such as mussels oysters or clams In Cantonese Chinese cuisine dried scallop is called conpoy

Scallops have given their name to the culinary term scalloped It originally referred to seafood creamed and served hot in the shell Today it means a creamed casserole dish such as scalloped potatoes which contains no seafood at all

 Shell of Saint James The scallop shell is the traditional emblem of James son of Zebedee It is popular with pilgrims on the Way of St James to the apostles shrine at Santiago de Compostela in Spain Medieval Christians making the pilgrimage to his shrine often wore a scallop shell symbol on their hat or clothes The pilgrim also carried a scallop shell with him He would go to churches castles abbeys etc Here he would get as much food as he could pick up with the shell He would probably get oats or barley to eat and maybe beer or wine to drink This way even the poorest household could give charity without it being too expensive for them Saint James association with the scallop probably comes from a legend This legend says that the apostle once rescued a knight covered in scallops 

Throughout antiquity scallops and other hinged shells have symbolized the feminine principle 

Many paintings of Venus the Roman goddess of love and fertility have a scallop shell in the painting to identify her For example Botticellis painted one in The Birth of Venus

One legend of the Way of St James says that the route is a kind of fertility pilgrimage It could be made when a young couple desire to have children Historians believe the pagans first used the scallop shell as a symbol of fertility

Heraldry included the scallop shell symbol as a badge for people who had made the pilgrimage to Compostela Later it became a symbol of pilgrimage in general Winston Churchills family coat of arms includes scallops However symbols in heraldry do not always have the same meaning Sometimes no family member has been on a pilgrimage but there are still scallops on the coat of arms 

Over 45 communes of France have one or more scallop shells on their coat of arms

The US state of New York has had the Atlantic bay scallop as its state shell since 1988 In design scalloped edges or ridges means a wavy pattern which reminds people of the edge of a scallops shell Shell petroleum company has had a logo with a scallop shell on it since 1904

QWOP is a Flash game created by Bennett Foddy and released on the Internet in 2008 to his website called Foddynet Players play as an athlete named Qwop who is participating in a 100 meter sprint event at the Olympic Games Using only the Q W O and P keys players must control the movement of the legs to make the character move forward When the player has successfully reached 50 meters they must jump a hurdle and at 100 meters the player is encouraged to perform a long jump although simply passing the finish line is sufficient to complete the game

The structured program theorem is a theory in programming and computer science A computer program can be split into pieces of code that do a certain task According to the structured program theory these smaller tasks can be combined in only three ways to get any larger task done

A program gets a large task done by splitting it into many smaller tasks that the computer can do easily These smaller tasks are called subprograms in computer science According to the structured program theorem the three ways subprograms can be combined are

The theorem was first published in 1966 by Corrado Bhm and Guiseppe Jacopini It comes from the 1946 description of the von Neumann architecture and the normal form theorem developed by Stephen Kleene

The Lower Triassic is the first of three epochs of the Triassic period It lasted from 251 04 million years ago and 245 15 mya The Lower Triassic is the oldest epoch of the Mesozoic era These rocks were laid down just after the great PermianTriassic extinction event

The Lower Triassic was called the Scythian stage which can be found in older literature In Europe most of the Lower Triassic is composed of sandstone It is a lithostratigraphic unit of continental red beds They were formed on land under desert conditions

The massive extinctions that ended the Paleozoic era caused extreme hardship for the surviving species Many types of corals brachiopods molluscs echinoderms and other invertebrates had completely disappeared The most common hard shelled marine invertebrates were bivalves gastropods ammonites echinoids and a few articulate brachiopods The most common land animal was the herbivorous synapsid Lystrosaurus 

The earliest Triassic faunas lacked biodiversity and were like that throughout the epoch Recovery on land took 30 million years 

The first ichthyosaurs evolved in this epoch

The climate during the Lower Triassic was generally dry Deserts were widespread The poles had a temperate climate The relatively hot climate of the epoch may have been caused by widespread volcanic eruptions

The Middle Triassic is the second of three epochs of the Triassic period It lasted from 245 15 million years ago and 228 2 mya 

Once the middle series in the Triassic was known as the Muschelkalk This name is now only used for a unit of rock strata of Middle Triassic age found in western Europe

Archosaurs were initially rarer than the therapsids which had dominated Permian terrestrial ecosystems but they began to displace therapsids in the Middle Triassic This Triassic takeover may have contributed to the evolution of mammals It forced the surviving therapsids and their mammalian successors to live as small mainly nocturnal insectivores Nocturnal life probably forced the proto mammals to develop fur and higher metabolic rates In their burrows keeping warm looking after the young and feeding them with milk were keys to their later success

The ancestors of crocodiles and the ancestors of pterosaurs and dinosaurs were the most important archosaurs of this epoch

In the Tethys sea the first sauropterygia were present the nothosaurs and early plesiosaurs Ichthyosaurs had arrived in the Lower Triassic

The Pectinidae are a family of bivalve molluscs The family includes the scallop It is closely related to clams and oysters They are generally hermaphrodite The male gonads mature first Pectinidae can live attached to things with a filament they create Otherwise they just rest on the sand or on rocks They can move in the water if they need to They can be found in all the oceans Many species are bought and sold

Usually shells of Pectinidae have two valves They are circular Most Pectinidae have radial ribs and concentric ridges A few are smooth The ctenolium is an important feature that separates Pectinidae from all other families

Distribution and Habitat  Pectinidae live in all the oceans of the world Most live in the Indo Pacific region Lots of species of Pectinidae live in quite shallow waters This is about from the low tide line to 100 meters deep Some species prefer much deeper water Some species only live in very specific environments However most species can live under many different conditions Pectinidae can live in on or under rocks coral rubble sea grass kelp sand or mud Adult specimens are either byssally attached or cemented to a substrate Others swim freely

Fossil record  There are many Pectinidae species living and fossil True Pectinidae first appeared in the Triassic period over 200 Million years ago There were two groups at first One had a nearly smooth exterior Pleuronectis The other had radial ribs or riblets and auricles Praechlamys 

The Pectinidae family had a large number of species in the Mesozoic era but they almost disappeared at the end of the Cretaceous period The survivors evolved rapidly during the Tertiary period There are nearly 7000 species and subspecies for the fossil and recent Pectinidae

There are more than 30 genera and around 350 species in the Family Pectinidae Raines Poppe list nearly 900 species Many are considered either questionable or non valid Theywho say that there are more than 50 genera and around 250 species and subspecies

A fishing dredge also known as a scallop dredge or an oyster dredge is a kind of fishing net It is pulled along the bottom of the sea by a fishing boat to collect scallops oysters and other kind of clams crabs and sea cucumber Fishermen then lift the dredge into the boat and empty it 

In Europe used to have teeth at the bottom called tynes These teeth raked or ploughed the sand and mud This dug up buried clams The New Bedford dredge does not have teeth

Dredge nets have a gross mesh in order to let organisms smaller than the target organisms through The net catches the larger organisms in the case of scallop dredging that includes the scallops predators such as whelks starfish and octopus 

Sometimes three or four dredges are attached to a wheeled rigid axle A number of these dredges can be towed from a heavy spreading bar Usually there is one on each side of the ship The length of the bar and number of dredges towed depends on the power of the ship and the room on the side deck for working the dredges The number might be 3 on each side on a small 10 metre boat There might be up to 20 on each side for a 30 metre ship with 1500 hp The weight and strength of this can dig up the ground It overturns rocks and can crush organisms in its path

Scallops often contain sand when fishermen use dredges It can also damage the seabed if they use dredges carelessly These days scallop dredging is sometimes replaced by scuba diving However inventors are trying to invent a better dredge

A Pacifier is a object that a baby sucks to comfort them Sucking is a natural instinct for babies and it soothes them In the UK and Australia it is known as a dummy It generally consists of a teat made from either silicone or latex Silicone is becoming more popular as it is more durable and easier to keep clean The teat is mounted on a plastic plate which can vary in shape from circular oval or butterfly shape It can come in a variety of different colors with different designs like Disney characters to make it look more appealing to the baby The main purpose of the plastic mouth guard is to stop the baby from accidentally swallowing the pacifier If for some reason the child is able to swallow it the mouth guard is made to be to large to pass through the throat and if it should get lodged in the throat it also has holes to allow air to pass through so the child can still breathe Finally there is sometimes a ring attached to allow the parent to remove the pacifier There is some concern that the use of pacifiers can affect the childs teeth so many teats now are a special shape to allow the teeth to form properly these are called orthodontic teats non orthodontic teats are sometimes called cherry teats

The Wilmington Quicksteps were a baseball team in the Union Association They finished with a 216 record and were managed by Joe Simmons The team played home games in Union Street Park in Wilmington Delaware

Games played is a statistic It is used in team sports to show the total number of games in which a player has participated in

In baseball the statistic also applies to players who are included on a starting lineup card whether they play or not 

In baseball a triple is when a batter reaches third base on a hit without an error occurring in the field Chief Wilson hit the most triples recording 36 in 1912

Cosmic dust is a type of dust It is very small crystals sent out from stars

It is formed when a star such as the Sun sends out atoms Some of the atoms become ions by gaining or losing electrons and becoming negatively and positively charged These oppositely charged ions form an ionic bond sticking together in tiny crystals a few thousand nanometres across to form cosmic dust

Cosmic dust is split into further types of dust based on the dusts location These types include intergalactic dust which can be found between galaxies interstellar dust found between stars circumplanetary dust which can be found around planets and in planetary rings and interplanetary dust which can be found between planets 

The coming together of large amounts of dust over time leads to the creation of planets the Earth for example

Sauting is a method of cooking food It uses a small amount of fat in a shallow pan The heat must be quite high Ingredients are often cut into pieces or sliced thinly It makes things cook faster Food that is sauted is browned but it keeps the same texture moisture and flavor If meat or fish is sauted the saut is sometimes finished by deglazing the pans residue to make a sauce

Sauting is different from pan frying People sometimes confuse the two In pan frying larger pieces of food are cooked quickly Sauting is also different from searing Searing only browns the surface of the bath Olive oil or clarified butter are commonly used for sauting Most others fats will work too Regular butter will produce more flavor However it burns at a lower temperature and more quickly than other fats This is because of the milk solids in it Therefore clarified butter is better for sauting

Astrid Lindgren first thought of Pippi Longstocking in 1941 when her 7 year old daughter Karin was sick and had to be kept in bed She asked her mother to tell her a story about Pippi Longstocking so Astrid Lindgren made up a character named Pippi Longstocking and some stories about her with which she entertained her daughter In 1944 she wrote them down and sent the manuscript of the book to Bonnier Publishers who said that they didnt want to publish the book When the publishing company Rabn and Sjgren announced a childrens book contest on January 28 of the next year she sent a new version of the book to the company It won first prize and was published in 1945 Afterwards Rabn and Sjgren would also publish the sequels Pippi Goes on Board and Pippi in the South Seas Since then the series has been translated into many other languages It has also been adapted into a television series and two movies

Pippi is a girl who is 9 years old She lives alone in Villa Villekulla an old house in a garden way out at the end of a small town She lives there all alone because her father a sea captain called Captain Efraim Longstocking disappeared when he was washed overboard in a storm and her mother died when she was very young Pippi believes that her mother is now an angel in Heaven watching her through a peephole and her father instead of drowning after being washed overboard had actually floated to an island filled with cannibals and become a cannibal king

Luckily for her her father had bought Villa Villekulla many years ago so that when he would grow old he would move into the house with his daughter So Pippi decides to move into the house with the two things she had taken from her fathers ship her pet monkey named Mr Nilsson and a suitcase filled with gold coins After moving into the house she also buys a horse which she keeps on the porch She likes living alone because nobody orders her to go to bed and no one forces her to take cod liver oil when she likes candy more

Beside the house there is another house in which there live two well behaved siblings named Annika and Tommy They first meet Pippi when she is out on the road in the morning walking backwards They ask her about this and she answers that a person can walk any way she wants to in a free country She continues to tell them that in Egypt all the people walk backwards and nobody thinks it is strange After they ask her whether she actually has been to Egypt she answers that she has and that in Farthest India the people have an even stranger way of walking they walk on their hands At this they accuse her of lying and then she admits that she was lying and that in Congo nobody speaks the truth

Afterwards she invites them over to her house where they eat pancakes and Pippi tells them about Brazilians who always have eggs in their hair Then she shows them some of the things which she and her father brought home from their journeys around the world From these Pippi gives them some gifts Tommy gets a small knife with a handle of pearl and Annika gets a ring with a green stone Annika and Tommy then go back to their home

The Ringstraeis a street in Austrias capital Vienna It goes around the first district in almost the shape of a circle The street is 52 km long and divided into nine sections It is one of the main sights in Vienna

On December 20th 1857 emperor Franz Joseph I ordered to destroy the old city walls and to build a street which should show the glory of the Habsburg empire The old walls were a traffic block because in 1850 the surburbs became part of the city as districts II till IX The order of the emperor outlined the exact size of the boulevard as well as the geographical positions and functions of the new buildings The only building which was erected by the city was the Town Hall

During the following years a large number of important public and private buildings were erected Nobility and bourgeoisie began to build mansions along the street Most of them were built in the Ringstraenstyle which mainly quotes older styles 

The Ringstrae has several sections It surrounds the central area of Vienna on all sides except for the northeast where its place is taken by the Franz Josephs Kai the street going along the Donaukanal Starting from the Ringturm at the northern end of the Franz Josephs Kai the sections are

Rocket candy is a type of fuel that pushes model rockets The fuel burns and pushes air out of the rockets nozzle which pushes the rocket in a forward direction Rocket candy is not really a type of candy It is made of sugar but it is used to power rockets Rocket candy is made of three different parts The three parts are the fuel the part that uses oxygen to make the fuel burn more completely and the extra chemicals The fuel is made of a sugar Sucrose is the most commonly used type of sugar Sucrose is known as table sugar The most common part that uses oxygen to make the fuel burn more completely is potassium nitrate This part is also called an oxidizer The extra chemicals can be many different things They can change the speed of the fuel burning Extra chemicals can also make the liftoff and flight more exciting and interesting to watch A normal rocket candy recipe is made of 65 oxidizer and 35 fuel 

Rocket candy is made in different ways One of these ways is dry compression For dry compression the rocket candy does not need to be heated The parts need to be ground into small particles Then the mixture is packed into the motor Another way to make rocket candy is called dry heating Dry heating does not actually melt the KNO3 but it melts the sugar and then the KNO3 is mixed into the sugar There is also a third way of making rocket candy called dissolving and heating In dissolving and heating the mixture of fuel ingredients is heated and both the oxidizer and the fuel are melted and then combine together 

Rocket candy should never be made right above a flame This is for safety reasons If the mixture of ingredients is heated over direct heat it could explode It could also cause the fuel to be weaker Making rocket candy in a microwave oven is also dangerous This can cause the fuel to catch on fire Rocket candy catches on fire very easily Therefore it should be made in small amounts It should also be made outside or in another safe place One should also use safety eye glasses

Rocket candy does not perform as well as some other kinds of fuel used in model rockets The total amount of power is lower The amount of power based on the amount of fuel is also lower However rocket candy costs a lot less to make than many other fuels

Rocket candy is made of three main parts It is made out of the fuel the oxidizer and the extra chemicals The fuel is the part that burns When it burns it makes hot gases that move quickly out of the rocket motor These quickly moving gases push the rocket as they exit the motor The oxidizer helps to add oxygen which the fuel needs to burn The extra chemicals can do a few things Some can speed up the burning Some can also make the fuel burn more completely Some extra chemicals make the rocket look better when it is launched They can add sparks and flames to liftoff They can also add smoke when the rocket flies

Many different sugars can be used as the fuel for rocket candy Sucrose which is the sugar used in home kitchens is the most common type of sugar used Sorbitol a common sugar substitute is also used Sorbitol makes the rocket candy break less easily It also causes the fuel to burn more slowly Fructose and glucose are harder to use They make the rocket candy more likely to explode Fructose and glucose do not have to be heated as much This makes preparation easier There are more sugars that can be used They are not as well known including erythritol xylitol lactitol maltitol or mannitol 

The oxidizer helps there be more oxygen in the rocket candy when the fuel is burning The most common oxidizer is a chemical called potassium nitrate Its chemical formula is KNO3 Other oxidizers can be used instead Potassium nitrate can be bought from stores that carry garden supplies 

There are two problems that people often have when they use potassium nitrate The most important thing is to make sure that the potassium nitrate used is pure potassium nitrate It is possible to buy potassium nitrate However potassium nitrate for sale may not be pure potassium nitrate Another important thing about the oxidizer is the size of the particles Many people who make rocket candy have an exact size that they want the potassium nitrate to be This can be done using a coffee grinder 

Extra chemicals are often added to rocket candy They are used to change the way the fuel burns These extra chemicals can make the rocket candy burn faster or slower Some are used to change the color of the flame Other chemicals are used to make smoke when the rocket flies Some extra chemicals are used to change the way the fuel feels and acts They can make the fuel less likely to break They can also make the fuel more like a flowing liquid This can make it easier to put the rocket candy into the motor 

People use many different extra chemicals These are just the ones that are used the most Metal oxides are one group of extra chemicals These make the rocket candy burn faster Metal oxides work best at levels from 1 to 5 percent This means between one and five grams of extra chemical for every one hundred grams in the fuel The most common metal oxide is called iron oxide The most common type of iron oxide is red iron oxide There are also other colors Red is the most easy to buy There is also yellow brown and black iron oxide 

Another extra chemical that is sometimes added to rocket candy is carbon Carbon is found in charcoal or graphite It is sometimes used as a fuel It is used more often as an extra chemical It makes the rocket leave a smoke trail in the sky When the fuel burns it makes heat The heat usually goes to the case of the motor The carbon keeps some of the heat in the fuel instead 

A metal called titanium is sometimes used as an extra chemical It is added in flakes to the rocket candy Titanium makes the rocket make sparks and flames when it is launched

Rocket candy is normally made with 65 oxidizer and 35 fuel This has a little more fuel than one needs This way allows the rocket candy to be more liquid when it is melted Extra chemicals can take the place some of the fuel When extra chemicals are added the recipe can change It might change to 65 oxidizer 25 fuel and 10 extra chemicals These are not the only combinations that work There are many different combinations that will still make a rocket fly 

There are a number of different ways to make rocket candy Most of the ways include heating the rocket candy The different ways to make rocket candy are called dry compressed dry heated and dissolved and heated 

In dry compression the sugar and potassium nitrate are chopped They should be ground as small as possible Some people use a mortar and pestle to grind them Others use a coffee grinder Then they are mixed They can be mixed in something called a ball mill or a tumbler These machines make sure that the two are mixed completely Then the mixture is pressed into the motor tube Most people who are serious about experiments do not use this method People should think carefully before they choose this method 

Another way to make rocket candy is called dry heating This is more common than dry compression First the potassium nitrate is ground or milled It needs to be made into a powder Then the potassium nitrate is mixed with powdered sugar in a pot When the heat is turned on the sugar melts However this method does not actually melt the potassium nitrate Potassium nitrate needs to be very hot before it melts Its melting temperature is 613 degrees Fahrenheit So instead of melting the grains of potassium nitrate are coated with the melted sugar 

Dissolving and heating is another way to make rocket candy James Yawn is a well known person who experiments on rockets He uses dissolving and heating This method completely combines both the sugar and the potassium nitrate First the potassium nitrate and sugar are placed in a pot Then a little bit of water is added The sugar and the potassium nitrate combine with the water and make a liquid When this happens you cannot see the particles anymore This is called dissolving Then the pot is heated It is heated until the water is hot enough to become a gas and leave the mixture The mixture will go through several steps First it will boil Then it will bubble and spit Spitting means that the fuel might splatter After that it becomes creamy Dissolving and heating is good for several reasons The potassium nitrate and sugar do not have to be powder This is because they both end up together as part of a liquid This way to make rocket candy also means that the person preparing the fuel has more time to pack it into the motors 

Performance of a model rocket is shown by two or three things 1Highest force How much force the gases make when they move out of the rocket motor is different at different times People often want to know what is the highest force a rocket motor makes Highest force is measured in Newtons 2Impulse Impulse is a measurement of how much force a rocket motor makes and for how long A motor that makes a low force for a long time can sometimes have a higher impulse than a motor that makes a high force for a short time Impulse is measured in Newtons times seconds 3Specific Impulse If a motor has more fuel then it will have a higher impulse There is a way to find out if one fuel makes the same impulse as another fuel When the number for impulse is divided by the number for the weight of the fuel that was burned it is called specific impulse To find out how much fuel was burned the rocket motor must be weighed before and after firing The specific impulse can be compared for different fuels and different sizes of rocket motors Specific impulse is measured in seconds Sugar based rocket fuels have an average Isp of between 115 and 130 seconds Compare that to the average Isp of an APCP which is 150 to 180 seconds The most force that sorbitol and KNO3 based fuel with a typical 6535 ratio can make is 110 N an Isp of between 110 and 125 seconds and may have an average force of about 40 N However sorbitol and KNO3 rockets with extra chemicals have been recorded as having average forces of up to 100N total impulses of up to 735 Ns and specific impulses of up to 128 seconds

Xylitol and KNO3 based rocket fuels can make a specific impulse of 100 seconds and can have a total impulse of up to 230Ns

Dextrose and KNO3 based fuels can make an average force of about 80N a total impulse of 144 Ns and an Isp of 118 seconds

Rocket candy is also sometimes called caramel candy Rocket candy was used in some of the model rockets created by Homer Hickam He describes these in his best selling true book Rocket Boys 

Rocket candy might have been made well known to beginning rocket enthusiasts by Lt Col Charles M Parkin in a long magazine article It continued over several issues The article was published in July 1958 Parkin wrote about how to make rocket candy by using an electric frying pan Parkin also wrote a book It was called The Rocket Handbook for Amateurs It was published in 1959 

Today there is a program called the Sugar Shot to Space Program This program is trying to make a very powerful rocket powered by rocket candy The goal is to get this kind of rocket into space Space is defined as 100 kilometers high This is the same as 60 miles from the earths surface One of the rockets is called the Double Sugar Shot rocket It has reached 33 kilometers or twenty miles from the earths surface This means that it is one third of the way to space The Mini Sugar Shot rocket is another rocket It is a smaller version of the Extreme Sugar Shot rocket The Mini Sugar Shot Rocket reached a height of about seven miles Then it exploded The Extreme Sugar Shot rocket is the rocket that might get into space It is not yet finished being built

Comet Shoemaker Levy 9 was a comet It broke apart and crashed into Jupiter in July 1994 The event was special because people could see for the first time how objects in the Solar System outside Earth collided It caused a large amount of coverage in the media The comet was carefully watched by astronomers worldwide The crash gave new information about Jupiter It also showed up its role in reducing space debris in the inner Solar System

The comet was discovered by astronomers Carolyn and Eugene M Shoemaker and David Levy on March 24 1993 It was found in a picture taken by the convert40cmftin Schmidt telescope at the Palomar Observatory in California When it was discovered it was orbiting Jupiter It was the first comet seen to be orbiting a planet Scientists think that it had been orbiting the planet for 20  30 years before its discovery

Calculations showed that its unusual broken up form was due to a previous closer approach to Jupiter in July 1992 At that time the orbit of Shoemaker Levy 9 passed within Jupiters Roche limit Jupiters tidal forces had acted to pull the comet apart The comet was later observed as a series of pieces up to Convert2kmmiabbron in diameter These fragments collided with Jupiters southern hemisphere between July 16 and July 22 1994 The pieces were moving at a speed of approximately 60 kms The impact scars were more easily seen than the Great Red Spot and they stayed for many months

The International League is a minor league baseball league based in the Eastern United States Like the Pacific Coast League and the Mexican League the International League plays at the Triple A level It was so named because it had teams in both the United States Canada and Cuba However all of the leagues teams are now based in the US

Cigerxwn or Cegerxwn was a renowned Kurdish polymath and nationalist

In mathematics division by two is when a number is divided by two Some cultures like the ancient Egyptians thought this was a different operation than division Some mathematicians up until the 16th century thought this too Today division by two is handled specially in modern computer programming

Division by two is also called halving mediation and dimidiation

In a binary number system there are only two digits 0 and 1 All other numbers are represented with those two digits For example one is 1 two is 10 three is 11 four is 100 and so on Most of the time people use a number system with ten digits This is called the decimal number system

Division by two in binary is very easy It is done by dropping the last digit on the right of the number This is called a bit shift operation For example if we performed a bit shift operation on the binary number 100 wed get 10 Since binary 100 is decimal 4 and binary 10 is decimal 2 this makes sense

Another example is performing a bit shift operation on 1101 This would leave us with 110 but we dropped a 1 from the end not a zero This also makes sense because 1101 in binary is 13 in decimal If we divide 13 by 2 we get 6 with a remainder of 1

Even though it is fastest for computers to do division using bit shift operations most computer code does not do it this way This is because programmers want their programs to be portable and readable Portable means that a program can be run on many different kinds of computers and operating systems Readable means that the source code is easy to read and understand Most of the time the compiler will change the division into bit shifts automatically

Imprinting is a term used in ethology and psychology to describe a special type of automatic learning

It usually occurs early in life during a critical period The animal fixes on a particular signal which is said to be imprinted onto the subject The process of imprinting is caused by an inherited instinct

The best known form of imprinting is the imprinting of the newly hatched on one or both parent Its function is to keep the young near their parent during the early learning period It is most obvious in birds such as ducks and geese after the fledglings have left the nest They imprint on their parents and then follow them around often in a long line on land and on water 

It was first reported in domestic chickens by the 19th century amateur biologist Douglas Spalding It was rediscovered by the early ethologist Oskar Heinroth and studied extensively and popularised by his disciple Konrad Lorenz and by Niko Tinbergen 

Lorenz showed how incubator hatched geese would imprint on the first suitable moving stimulus they saw within what a critical period of 1316 hours after hatching For example the goslings would imprint on Lorenz himself He is often shown in photographs being followed by a gaggle of geese who had imprinted on him 

In child development the term is used to refer to the process by which a baby learns who its mother and father are The process is recognised as beginning in the womb when the unborn baby starts to recognise its parents voices

The filial imprinting of birds was a primary technique used to create the movie Winged Migration which contains footage of migratory birds in flight The birds imprinted on handlers who wore yellow jackets and honked horns constantly The birds were then trained to fly along with a variety of aircraft usually ultralights

De Dion Bouton is a French motor car company that began making cars in 1882 The company was started by Count Albert De Dion Georges Bouton and Charles Trepardoux Their first cars were steam powered and they made their first petrol internal combustion engine car in 1895

A four wheeled De Dion Bouton et Trepardoux a steam powered car said to be the oldest car in the world that still going sold in 2007 The car had belonged to Count Albert De Dion Built in 1884 it has a top speed of 35 miles per hour

The Vienna Secession was formed in 1897 by a group of Austrian artists who left the Association of Austrian Artists housed in the Vienna Knstlerhaus due to its conservatism This movement included painters sculptors and architects The first president of the Secession was Gustav Klimt and Rudolf von Alt was made honorary president

It was founded on 3 April 1897 by artists Gustav Klimt Koloman Moser Josef Hoffmann Joseph Maria Olbrich Max Kurzweil and others Although the architect Otto Wagner is one of the most important members he was not a founding member The first exhibition was held in 1898 In 1898 the groups exhibition house was built near Karlsplatz It was designed by Joseph Maria Olbrich the exhibition building soon became known simply as the Secession Their work was also published in a magazin called Ver sacrum

1903 Josef Hoffmann and Koloman Moser founded the Wiener Werksttten a union of artists who wanted to reform the applied arts 1905 Klimt and other artists left the group due to different opinions about art

The International Ice Hockey Federation is the worldwide governing body for ice hockey and in line hockey It is based in Zurich Switzerland and has 70 members It is responsible for the management of international ice hockey tournaments and maintains the IIHF World Ranking 

Despite its worldwide authority the IIHF has little control of hockey in North America where the National Hockey League is the highest hockey organization Its base of power rests in Europe with the respective national governing bodies and leagues Canada and the United States are the only members who have their own rulebooks

Decisions of the IIHF can be appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne Switzerland

The IIHF museum was located within the International Hockey Hall of Fame Museum located in Kingston Ontario from 1992 to 1997 After terminating the partnership with the International Hockey Hall of Fame the IIHF signed an agreement with the NHL to house their museum within the Hockey Hall of Fame In 1998 the IIHF museum relocated to Toronto Ontario occupying over convert3500sqftm2 within the Hockey Hall of Fame 

As part of the centennial celebrations of the IIHFs founding the 2008 IIHF World Championship was held in Canada the perennial leaders of the sport This was the first time the championships were hosted in Canada Russia went on to win the 2008 Championship

The main functions of the IIHF are to govern develop and organize hockey throughout the world Also to promote friendly relations among the member national associations and to operate in an organized manner for the good order of the sport The federation may take the necessary measures in order to conduct itself and its affairs in accordance with its statutes bylaws and regulations as well as in holding a clear jurisdiction in what concerns to ice hockey and in line hockey at the international level The IIHF is the body responsible with arranging the sponsorships license rights advertising and merchandising in connection with all IIHF competitions

Another purpose of the federation is to provide aid in the young players development and in the development of coaches and game officials On the other hand all the events of IIHF are organized by the federation along with establishing and maintaining contact with any other sport federations or sport groups The IIHF is responsible for processing the international players transfers It is also the body that presides over ice hockey in the Olympic Games as well as over all levels of the IIHF World Championships The federation works in collaboration with local committees when organizing its 25 World Championships at five different categories

Even though the IIHF runs the world championships it is also responsible for the organization of several European club competitions such as the Champions Hockey League or the Continental Cup With its 100 anniversary the federation launched a new annual club competition in 2008 the Victoria Cup named after the Montreal Victoria Skating Rink the site of the first organized indoor ice hockey match The federation is governed by the legislative body of the IIHF which is the General Congress along with the executive body which is the Council The Congress is entitled to make decisions with regard of the games rules the statutes and bylaws in the name of the federation It is also the body that elects the president and the council or otherwise known as board The president of the IIHF is basically the representative of the federation He represents the federations interests I all external matters and he is also responsible that the decisions are made according to the federations statues and regulations The president is assisted by the General Secretary who is also the highest ranked employee of the IIHF

The recipe came over the Ottoman Empire to Austria A sweet related to Strudel is Baklava Strudel is named for the first time in 1696 It gaind popularyty through Empress Maria Theresia 

The Strudel consists of a thin elastic pastry The filling consists of sliced apples sugar cinnamon raisins and bread crumbs The apples should be juicy firm and sweet and sour Preparing of the original strudel dough is a difficult process so you can also buy Strudel pastry Another way to make Apple strudel is the using of puff pastry which you can also buy in a super market Traditionally the strudel is served warm with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream Also vanilla sauce is popular in many countries

Another strudel which is poular in Austria is the Topfenstrudel Here the apple filling is replaced by a Topfen filling 

The order Ostreoida includes the true oysters and other families of bivalves such as Pectinidae 

There are eleven families recognised within it However there are many suborders superfamilies and subfamilies in this order There are almost 100 genera in this order

Pectinina is a suborder in the Bivalve order Ostreoida It contains the superfamilies Pectinoidea and Anomioidea

Constantine Samuel Rafinesque Schmaltz was a nineteenth century polymath He contributed to botany zoology the study of prehistoric earthworks in North America and Mesoamerican ancient linguistics

Rafinesque was eccentric People often say he was an erratic genius He was an autodidact He was successful in many things He was good as a zoologist botanist writer and polyglot He wrote prolifically on such diverse topics as anthropology biology geology and linguistics Today scholars say that he was far ahead of his time in many of these fields

Ostreidae are the true oysters The family includes most species eaten under the name oyster Pearl oysters are not true oysters They belong to the distinct order Pterioida

Like scallops true oysters have a central adductor muscle This causes a scar in the middle of the shell It is the point of attachment The shell is often irregular because oysters attach to substrates

The crystalline lens is a transparent biconvex structure in the eye With the cornea it helps to refract light to be focused on the retina The lens changes shape This changes the focal distance of the eye so that it can focus on objects at various distances This adjustment of the lens is called accommodation It is similar to the focusing of a photographic camera when it focuses its lenses The lens is flatter on the inside

The lens is also called the aquula or crystalline lens In humans the refractive power of the lens in its natural environment is approximately 18 dioptres This is about one third of the eyes total power

Pecten is a genus of large scallops or saltwater clams marine bivalve mollusks in the family Pectinidae This is the type genus of the family

The name Pecten is the Latin word for a comb or rake 

Shell petroleum company has used its logo with a shell since 1904

Species in the genus Pecten include

Byssus means a silky filament by which certain molluscs attach to hard surfaces It also means a rare fabric It is also called sea silk and is its fibre source

There are more than 1400 lakes in Estonia and there are several lakes near to Tallinn the capital city Lake lemiste is the largest of the lakes near to the capital The city of Tallinn takes its drinking water from this lake The lake gets its water mostly from the small Kurna stream and the larger Pirita River

There is a nice old legend about this lake The legend says that the Old Man of Lake lemiste lives in the lake When anyone meets him he always asks Is Tallinn ready yet If the other person answers Yes the city is ready then the old man will send the lake waters out to cover the city of Tallinn In this way if anyone meets this old man they should answer No the city is not ready There is a lot of work to do still In this way the city can be saved

The Sachertorte is a chocolate cake with a chocolate icing and a apricot jam filling It is a typical sweet from Vienna It is named after Franz Sacher who invented the recipe

The first cake was made by Franz Sacher in 1832 when Klemens Frst Metternich ordered the kitchen to create a new sweet for his evening guests The chef was ill so Sacher who was apprentice in his second year invented the first Sachertorte After this the cake was nearly forgotten Sacher worked in Budapest and Presburg and opened in 1848 a high class delicatessen and winery in Vienna His son Eduard Sacher who learned in the Demel bakery which supplyed the court brought the recipe in the form we know today First the cake was sold by Demel but after Eduard bought the Hotel Sacher also there

In the 20th century there was a legal battle between the Sacher and the Demel about selling the Original Sacher Torte In 1963 the both parties agree that the Hotel Sacher is allowed to use the name Original Sacher Torte The Demel could now sell a Eduard Sacher Torte 

The Sachertorte consists of a chocolate sponge cake with a thin layer of apricot jam in the middle and dark chocolate icing on the top and sides The main difference between the cake from the Hotel Sacher and from the Demel bakery is that the Original Sacher Torte has a layer of apricot jam under the icing and in the middle of the cake The cake from Demel has only jam under the icing

You can buy the Original Sacher Torte only at the Vienna and Salzburg locations of the Hotel Sacher at the Cafes Sacher in Innsbruck and Graz at the Sacher Shop in Bozen in the Duty Free area of the Vienna airport and via the web at the Hotel Sachers online shop The recipe is a secret but it is known that the icing consists of three different types of choclate which are produced exclusively by different producers for this single purpose

Most of the time the cake is served with whipped cream without sugar

Salzburger Nockerl a typical sweet souffl from the city of Salzburg Austria

The sweet dumplings are made of egg yolk flour sugar salt vanilla and milk mixed into a thin dough Then you put in stiff egg white and some raisins You form three dumplings and put them in a form and bake it at low heat The dessert is always freshly prepeared and is served warm with powder sugar on it The dusting of powdered sugar is said to represent the snow covered peaks of the Gaisberg Moenchsberg and Nonnberg 

In the operetta Saison in Salzburg by Fred Raymond the dessert is praised in a song as Suess wie die Liebe und zart wie ein Kuss A legend says that they were invented by Salome Alt the concubine of Salzburgs Archbishop Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau in the early 17th century

Thermochemistry is the study of the energy and heat to do with chemical reactions and physical transformations Physical transformations are when a state of matter changes to another state Examples of transformations include melting and boiling

A reaction gives out or takes in energy A physical transformation also gives out or takes in energy Thermochemistry looks at these energy changes particularly on a systems energy exchange with its surroundings Thermochemistry is useful in predicting reactant and product quantities at all times during a given reaction Thermochemists do this by using data including entropy determinations Thermochemists will tell if a reaction is spontaneous or non spontaneous favorable or unfavorable 

Endothermic reactions take in heat Exothermic reactions give out heat Thermochemistry combines the concepts of thermodynamics with the idea of energy in the form of chemical bonds It includes calculations of such quantities as heat capacity heat of combustion heat of formation enthalpy entropy free energy and calories

Thermochemistry started with two ideas

These discoveries came before the first law of thermodynamics in 1845 They helped scientists understand this law

The measurement of heat changes is called calorimetry It measures the heat of chemical reactions or physical changes A calorimeter a device for calorimetry is usually an closed in chamber

Calorimetry has these steps Chemists make the change happen inside the chamber The temperature of the chamber is looked at either using a thermometer or thermocouple The temperature is plotted against time to give a graph The graph can be used to calculate fundamental quantities 

Modern calorimeters have small computers that measure the temperature and give the calculated data quickly One example is a differential scanning calorimeter

Several thermodynamic definitions are very useful in thermochemistry A system is the specific section of the universe that is being studied Everything outside the system is considered the surrounding or environment A system may be 

A system undergoes a process when one or more of its properties changes A process relates to the change of state An isothermal process happens when the temperature of the system stays the same An isobaric process happens when the pressure of the system stays the same An adiabatic process happens when no heat moves around

Kurt Alois Josef Johann Schuschnigg was the 15th Chancellor of Austria He was in office between the assassination of his predecessor Engelbert Dollfuss in 1934 and the annexation of Austria in 1938 The time of Dollfuss and Schuschniggs reign is known as Austrofascism today He survived the war as a prisoner After the war he took US citizenship and became a professor for state law in the United States In 1968 he returned to Austria where he died in 1977 

Schuschnigg studied law in Freiburg im Breisgau and Innsbruck The nazi Otto Planetta killed Dollfuss in 1934 in an event that is known as July putsch today During the war the NSDAP saw Planetta as a hero Schuschnigg became the next Chancellor and at age 36 is the youngest person to become chanellor to this date 

During his time in office he was opposed to the idea of Austria becoming a part of Germany Schuschnigg was forced to step down on 11th March 1938 and to hand power to Dr Arthur Sey Inquart One day later Austria was annexed to Germany

In the eighties Diario Frontera became a generalist newspaper printed in black and white and with 20 pages Since 1989 it has printed a page or a section dedicated to the University of the Andes due to the great amount of students and the importance of the University in the life of the city

In June 2005 it printed an inquiry about a student of the university killed by the police Diario wrote that the student had been hit by the policemen but also revealed his belonging to an armed political group The headquarter of the newspaper was attacked by groups of students it was the beginning of riots that then spread all over the city The pleas of Reporters Without Borders remained unheard

In 2008 on the occasion of the thirtieth anniversary Diario has revamped graphics

Charles Doolittle Walcott was an American geologist and invertebrate paleontologist He became known for his discovery in 1909 of well preserved fossils in the Burgess Shale of British Columbia Canada

Walcott became Director of the US Geological Survey 18941907 and Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution 19071927 He discovered a number of important fossil sites At the Walcott Quarry the lowest of the Burgess Shale deposits Walcott collected 65000 specimens between 1910 and 1924 The site dates to the Middle Cambrian and is in the Canadian Rockies

The Walcott Rust quarry is near Russia New York This site has produced some of the best preserved trilobites ever found including enrolled specimens with soft body parts

This article is about the Formula One racing team For other uses of the term arrow see Arrow

Arrows Grand Prix International was a Formula One team active from 1978 to 2002 The team was also known as Footwork

The Arrows Grand Prix International team was founded in 1977 by Italian financier Franco Ambrosio Alan Rees Jackie Oliver Dave Wass and Tony Southgate when Rees Oliver Wass and Southgate left the Shadow team They named the team after the first letter of each persons last name in order spelling out AROWS The name was then changed to the correct spelling of Arrows

The team earned their first podium at the 1978 Swedish Grand Prix with future Williams driver Riccardo Patrese earning second The rest of the season consisted of him earning points occasionally Arrows fielded Patrese until 1981 In 1984 the team used BMW M12 turbo engines and later Megatron turbos and results improved as the turbo era moved along going at its peak in 1988 when the team finished fifth in the constructors championship In between 1984 and 1988 the team had gotten two podium positions Eventually when turbo engines were banned from the regulations making them illegal to run in a race Arrows performance dropped despite a third place podium finish at the 1989 USA Grand Prix in Phoenix

The team was renamed Footwork in 1991 until being changed back to Arrows after the 1996 season Arrows performance dropped with the usage of the Porsche engines Footwork eventually changed to Mugen Honda engines The team also ran Ford and Hart engines as well

In 1997 Tom Walkenshaw bought a part of Arrows and hired 1996 Drivers Champion Damon Hill and Pedro Diniz Diniz was very wealthy and helped pay for Hills salary placing Diniz as the role of a pay driver Hill nearly won the Hungarian Grand Prix but a component failure meant that Hill had slowed down and fell to second place where Hill would finish In the next few years Walkenshaw would buy out what Jackie Oliver had owned

As the seasons went on Arrows started to go in debt In 2002 at times the two drivers Heinz Harald Frentzen and Enrique Bernoldi deliberately failed to qualify for a couple of races in an attempt to save some money The team could not finish the season and went into liquidation and folded at the end of the season However Phoenix Finance purchased the teams assets and tried to enter in the 2003 season but was not allowed

The Burgenland is one of the nine federal states of the Federal Republic of Austria It is the youngest of the nine states and came to Austria after the First World War in 1921 The name Vierburgenland was created in 1919 It was derived from the name of the four vrmegye of the Kingdom of Hungary known in Hungarian as Pozsony Moson Sopron and Vas or in German as Pressburg Wieselburg denburg and Eisenburg Because Pressburg was given to Czechoslowakia the number was dropped In 1922 the name was adopted by the province assembly

Burgenland has an area of 396180 km It is divided in 3 regions

Sometimes Middleburgenland is seen as a part of southern Burgenland

The highest point of the state is the Geschriebenstein with 884 m the lowest point is near Apetlon with 114 m Burgenland and Hungary share the Neusiedler See Leitha Pulka and Raab are important rivers

In 1043 a peace treaty between Henry III and King Samuel Aba of Hungary fixed the western border of the Kingdom of Hungary along the Leitha and Lafnitz rivers among others The territory of the present day Burgenland became the western border zone of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary until the 16th century The majority of the population was Germanic There was also immigration in the Middle Ages from the neighbouring Austria During occupation of Hungary by the Ottoman Empire some parts of todays Burgenland stayed within the Habsburg rule After forming the Austro Hungary empire the Burgenland was part of the hungarian part of the monarchy Because 74 of the inhabitants were of German origin the area came to the new formed Republic of Austria In the time till the Second World War many people emigrated to the United States It is said that Chicago is the largest town of the Burgenland

During the Nazi occupation the state was part of Styria and Lower Danube In addition to the oppression of the Jews the ethnic groups Roma and Sinti also suffered under the Nazi regime The Lackenbach concentration camp for Gypsies was located in the area

After the Second World War Burgenland was part of the Sowjet occupation zone After the Staatsvertrag it had a long border to the communist area in eastern Europe The economic development was very slow After joining the European Union this development became faster

Organometallic chemistry is the study of chemical compounds containing bonds between carbon and a metal Organometallic chemistry combines aspects of inorganic chemistry and organic chemistry

Organometallic compounds are distinguished by the prefix organo Examples of such organometallic compounds include all Gilman reagents which contain lithium and copper Tetracarbonyl nickel and ferrocene are examples of organometallic compounds containing transition metals Organomagnesium compounds include iodomagnesium MeMgI diethylmagnesium Grignard reagents are organometallic compounds Organolithium compounds include n butyllithium Organozinc compounds include chlorozinc Organocopper compounds include lithium dimethylcuprate

The term metalorganics usually refers to metal containing compounds lacking direct metal carbon bonds but which contain organic ligands Metal beta diketonates alkoxides and dialkylamides are representative members of this class

In addition to the traditional metals lanthanides actinides and semimetals elements such as boron silicon arsenic and selenium form organometallic compounds eg organoborane compounds such as triethylborane

Many complexes have coordination bonds between a metal and organic ligands The organic ligands often bind the metal through a heteroatom such as oxygen or nitrogen in which case such compounds are called coordination compounds However if any of the ligands form a direct M C bond then complex is usually considered to be organometallic eg Ru32 Furthermore many lipophilic compounds such as metal acetylacetonates and metal alkoxides are called metalorganics

Many organic coordination compounds occur in nature For example hemoglobin and myoglobin contain an iron center coordinated to the nitrogen atoms of a porphyrin ring magnesium is the center of a chlorin ring in chlorophyll The field of such inorganic compounds is known as bioinorganic chemistry However methylcobalamin with a cobalt methyl bond is a true organometallic complex one of the few known in biology This subset of complexes are often discussed within the subfield of bioorganometallic chemistry

The metal carbon bond in organometallic compounds is half way between being ionic and covalent Primarily ionic metal carbon bonds are encountered either when the metal is very electropositive or when the carbon containing ligand exists as a stable carbanion Carbanions can be stabilized by resonance or by the presence of electron withdrawing substituents So the bonding in compounds like sodium acetylide and triphenylmethylpotassium is primarily ionic On the other hand metal carbon bonds in the organometallic compounds of transition metals poor metals and metalloids have less ionic character This is because of the moderate electronegativity of such metals

Organometallic compounds with bonds that have characters in between ionic and covalent are very important in industry They are both relatively stable in solutions but ionic enough to undergo reactions Two important classes are organolithium and Grignard reagents In certain organometallic compounds such as ferrocene or dibenzenechromium the pi orbitals of the organic moiety ligate the metal

Organometallics find practical uses in stoichiometric and catalytic processes especially processes involving carbon monoxide and alkene derived polymers All the worlds polyethylene and polypropylene are produced with organometallic catalysts usually heterogeneously using Ziegler Natta catalysis Acetic acid is produced using metal carbonyl catalysts in the Monsanto process and Cativa process Most synthetic aldehydes are produced by hydroformylation The bulk of the synthetic alcohols at least those larger than ethanol are produced by hydrogenation of hydroformylation derived aldehydes Similarly the Wacker process is used in the oxidation of ethylene to acetaldehyde

Organolithium organomagnesium and organoaluminium compounds are highly basic and highly reducing They catalyze many polymerization reactions They are also useful stoichiometrically

III V semiconductors are produced from trimethylgallium trimethylindium trimethylaluminum and related nitrogen phosphorus arsenic antimony compounds These volatile compounds are decomposed along with ammonia arsine phosphine and related hydrides on a heated substrate by metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy process for applications such as light emitting diodes fabrication

Organometallic compounds may be found in the environment Environmentalists worry about organo lead and organo mercury compounds They are toxic hazards

As in other areas of chemistry electron counting is useful for organizing organometallic chemistry The 18 electron rule is helpful in predicting the stabilities of metal carbonyls and related compounds The isolobal principle predicts chemical bonding and reactivity in organometallic compounds

Chemists use NMR and infrared spectroscopy to determine the structure of organometallic compounds Chemists test the dynamic properties of organometallic compounds with variable temperature NMR and chemical kinetics

Darwinopterus is a genus of pterosaur discovered in China and named after Charles Darwin It is the first known pterosaur to display features of both long tailed and short tailed pterosaurs Darwinopterus is a transitional fossil between the two groups 

Between 30 and 40 fossil specimens have been found all collected from the Tiaojishan Formation which dates to the Middle Jurassic 160 million years ago The type species D modularis was described in February 2010 

Two additional species D linglongtaensis and D robustodens were described from the same fossil beds in December 2010 and June 2011 respectively

The specimens showed sexual dimorphism the males had crests on their heads and narrower hips than the females

This genus and its near relatives show a combination of primitive and advanced pterosaurian features This is characteristic of transitional fossils and is called modular evolution or mosaic evolution

Darwinopterus had long tails and other features of rhamphorhynchoids they also had distinct pterodactyloid features such as long vertebrae in the neck and a single skull opening in front of the eyes

The specimen preserved along with an egg gave information on the reproductive strategies of Darwinopterus and pterosaurs in general 

Like the eggs of later pterosaurs and modern reptiles the eggs of Darwinopterus had a parchment like soft shell In modern birds the eggshell is hardened with calcium carbonate completely shielding the embryo from the outside environment Soft shelled eggs are permeable to water and allow significant amounts to be absorbed into the egg during development Eggs of this type are more vulnerable to the elements and are typically buried in soil 

David Unwin a co author of the paper suggested that Darwinopterus probably laid many small eggs at a time and buried them Juveniles could fly upon hatching and required little to no parental care 

These results imply that reproduction in pterosaurs was more like that in modern reptiles and significantly differed from reproduction in birds

Transitional fossils are the fossilised remains of lifeforms that show features typical of two distinct groups It may be a rare fossil such as Archaeopteryx which shows early features of a group which later becomes widespread

The rarity of transitional forms is interesting It suggests the new forms are not yet dominant in the ecology of their time and their populations are relatively small It follows that their fossils would be scarce In the Solnhofen limestone where Archaeopteryx was found there are more examples of pterosaurs of several genera than there are of the proto bird In the Jurassic the pterosaurs were dominant in the air 

But in the Lower Cretaceous the situation is reversed The pterosaurs are in decline and large numbers of different bird species are found in the famous Chinese lagerstatten deposits such as the Jehol biota The Lower Cretaceous birds are clearly more bird like and the features they developed evidently evidently enabled them to invade habitat niches which had been the preserve of pterosaurs or maybe were not previously exploited at all

Typical of transitional fossils is that some features are clearly basal or primitive Other features are advanced With Archaeopteryx the front legs are derived and show clearly the capacity for flight Also the feathers had the rachus off centre a feature of all bird flight feathers The rest of the skeleton was just like any other small carnivorous dinosaurp35 

When transition takes place between one group and another not all features change at the same time This is called mosaic evolution408 Transitions between higher groups would involve a series of transitional species only a few of which may be found as fossils

Cornish cookery denotes the cooking styles traditions and recipes associated with Cornwall It has been heavily influenced by the geography of the county as well as its social history

Being a peninsula fish dishes form a major part of the historical and modern recipes in Cornwall with the fishing industry playing a major part in its economy The iconic dish of Cornwall the pasty has its roots in the mining industry 

Cornwalls cookery has influenced and been influenced by other British cuisine as well as having similarities with the cuisine of its neighbour Devon

Much of Cornwalls farming land is suitable for milk production and one of the by products is clotted cream This forms the basis for many local specialities including Cornish fudge and Cornish ice cream and is used in Cornish cream teas Cornish clotted cream is protected under EU law and cannot be made anywhere else 

Cornwall is perhaps best known for its pasties a savoury baked dish made from pastry Todays pasties usually contain a filling of beef steak onion potato and swede with salt and white pepper but historically pasties had a variety of different fillings Pasties are often locally referred to as oggies

Mariner 2 was a NASA spacecraft It was the second spacecraft in the Mariner program Mariner 2 was the first successful mission from Earth to another planet

Mariner 2 was launched on August 27 1962 aboard an Atlas Agena B rocket at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station The aim of the Mariner 2 mission was to fly by the planet Venus and return information on the planets atmosphere magnetic field charged particle environment and mass Mariner 2 was at its closest to Venus at a distance of 34773 km on December 14 1962 The spacecraft then went into orbit with the Sun on Secember 27 1962 105464560 km away The last transmission from Mariner 2 was received on January 3 1963 Mariner 2 is still orbiting around the Sun today

The spacecrafts design was exactly the same as that of Mariner 1 Mariner 1 was the first spacecraft in the Mariner program but it had to be destroyed shortly after launch because its trajectory was wrong

The spacecraft found out that the surface temperature on Venus was at least 425C on both the day and night sides It discovered that Venus rotates in the opposite direction from most planets in the Solar System The spacecraft also found that the atmosphere of Venus is mostly of carbon dioxide and that there is a very high pressure at the planets surface Continuous cloud cover was detected but no magnetic field was however It also found that solar wind is continuous and that the density of cosmic dust between planets is much lower than it is near Earth

Candidatus is a term in the taxonomy of bacteria

It is a label put before the name of a bacterium which cannot be grown in a Bacteriology Culture Collection An example would be Candidatus Phytoplasma allocasuarinae Candidatus status may be used when a species or genus is well studied but cannot be cultured Nowadays much information is got by 16S ribosomal RNA sequence analysis

For correct publication of a species bacteria must be isolated cultured described and deposited in a Bacteriology Culture Collection However some bacteria require special culture conditions and cannot be maintained in Bacteriology Culture Collections This includes bacteria which live inside other organisms or cells These include obligately intracellular pathogens and endosymbionts insect symbionts and populations from oceans or sludge 

In 1994 Murray and Schleifer published a taxonomic note They recommended that the new category of indefinite rank be established for certain putative taxa that could not be described in sufficient detail to warrant establishment of a new taxon It was also recommended that a Candidatus list should be established in the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology

According to the IRPCM PhytoplasmaSpiroplasma Working Team Phytoplasma taxonomy group the abbreviation for Candidatus should be Ca

Candidatus Carsonella ruddii is an endosymbiotic Gamma Proteobacterium It has the smallest known genome of any bacterium

The species is an endosymbiont that is present in all species of phloem sap feeding insects known as psyllids The endosymbionts occurs in a specialised structure known as the bacteriome

In 2006 the genome of one strain of Ca C ruddi was sequenced at RIKEN in Japan and the University of Arizona The genome is a circular chromosome of 159662 base pairs and has a high coding density with many overlapping genes and reduced gene length The number of predicted genes was 182 also the lowest on record Numerous genes considered essential for life seem to be missing suggesting that the species may have achieved organelle like status

Saint Cuthbert was an Anglo Saxon monk bishop and hermit associated with the monasteries of Melrose and Lindisfarne in the Kingdom of Northumbria at that time including in modern terms northern England as well as south eastern Scotland as far north as the Firth of Forth Afterwards he became one of the most important medieval saints of England his cult being centred at Durham Cathedral Cuthbert is regarded as the patron saint of northern England His feast day is 20 March

In 676 he began the life of a hermit and retired to a cave on Lindisfarne After a time he settled on one of the Farne Islands south of Lindisfarne and made his life more simple 

In 684 Cuthbert was chosen to be bishop of Lindisfarne at a synod at Twyford but was unwilling to leave his retirement and take up his charge It was only after a visit from a large group including King Ecgfrith that he agreed to return and take up the duties of bishop He was consecrated at York on 26 March 685 After Christmas 686 however he returned to his cell on Inner Farne Island which was where he eventually died on 20 March 687 AD He was buried at Lindisfarne and his remains later moved to Durham Cathedral

The Cathedral Church of Christ Blessed Mary the Virgin and St Cuthbert of Durham is a cathedral in the city of Durham England the seat of the Anglican Bishop of Durham The Bishopric dates from 995 with the present cathedral being founded in AD 1093 The cathedral is known as one of the finest examples of Norman architecture and has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site along with nearby Durham Castle which faces it across Palace Green

The present cathedral replaces the 10th century White Church built as part of a monastic foundation to house the shrine of Saint Cuthbert of Lindisfarne The treasures of Durham Cathedral include relics of St Cuthbert the head of St Oswald of Northumbria and the remains of the Venerable Bede 

Durham Cathedral occupies a strategic position on a promontory high above the River Wear The cathedral is a major tourist attraction the central tower of 217 feet giving views of Durham and the surrounding area

Lofoten is an archipelago and a traditional district in the county of Nordland Norway Though lying within the Arctic Circle Lofoten has one of the worlds largest higher temperature anomalies relative to its high latitude

Lofoten is well known for its natural beauty within Norway Lofoten includes the municipalities of Vgan Vestvgy Flakstad Moskenes Vry and Rst The main islands running from north to south are

whilst further to the south are the small and isolated islands of Vry and Rst The total land area amounts to 1227 km and the population totals 24500

Between the mainland and the Lofoten archipelago is the vast open Vestfjord and to the north is Vesterlen The main towns in Lofoten are Leknes in Vestvgy and Svolvr in Vgan

The islands have for more than 1000 years been the centre of great cod fisheries especially in winter when the cod migrate south from the Barents Sea and gather in Lofoten to spawn In the lowland areas particularly Vestvgy agriculture is important and has been so since the Bronze Age

The black hole information paradox is a phenomenon in astrophysics It is when quantum mechanics and general relativity are put together 

This phenomenon states that the information a physical system has can be lost when it enters a black hole The object that falls into a black hole only keeps information about its spin mass and charge However the quantum mechanics says that information cannot be lost This makes it paradox

An Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty is an area of countryside considered to have significant landscape value in England Wales or Northern Ireland Natural England designates them on behalf of the United Kingdom government The Countryside Council for Wales designates them on behalf of the Welsh Government The Northern Ireland Environment Agency designates them on behalf of the Northern Ireland Executive

The chief purpose of the AONB designation is to conserve and enhance the natural beauty of the landscape with two secondary aims meeting the need for quiet enjoyment of the countryside and having regard for the interests of those who live and work there To achieve these aims AONBs rely on planning controls and practical countryside management

As they have the same landscape quality AONBs may be compared to the national parks of England and Wales AONBs are created under the same legislation as the national parks the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 Unlike AONBs national parks have their own authorities have special legal powers to prevent unsympathetic development and are well known to many inhabitants of England Wales and Northern Ireland 

There are 35 AONBs in England four in Wales one that is in both England and Wales and nine in Northern Ireland The first AONB was awarded in 1956 to the Gower Peninsula south Wales The most recently confirmed is the Tamar Valley AONB in 1994 The smallest AONB is the Isles of Scilly convert16km2sqmiabbron and the largest AONB is the Cotswolds convert2038km2sqmiabbron The AONBs of England and Wales together cover around 18 of the countryside in the two countries

Chaturanga is the earliest known form of chess 6th century AD 

This precursor of modern chess originated in the northern Indian subcontinent during the Gupta empire Chaturanga translates as the four divisions meaning infantry cavalry elephantry and chariotry They were the four divisions of an Indian army at the time and no doubt the game was thought of as a war game At that time the game had no female piece what we now call the queen was called Mantri meaning a minister or advisor  

The game eventually spread to the rest of the world after the Muslim conquest of Persia It was then called Shatranj

From the beginning until the end of the 15th century the pieces we call bishops and queens had limited movement and it took longer to get the pieces into action In modern chess the original pieces evolved into the modern pawn knight bishop and rook respectivelyp173 p74

Chatrang or Shatranj was the name given to the early game of chess when it travelled to Persia and then to the Arab world

In Sassanid Persia around 600 the name became Chatrang and the rules were developed further and players started calling Shh when threatening the opponents king and Shh mt when the king could not escape from attack These exclamations persisted in chess as it traveled to other lands

The game was taken up by the Muslim world after the Islamic conquest of Persia with the pieces largely retaining their Persian names in Arabic mt or mta means died is dead In Arabic the game became Shatranj In all other languages the name of the game is derived either from shatranj or from shah

One interesting fact is that the Arabs divided their game into the same three stages which we do today opening middlegame and endgamep234

At the start of a game the Arabic masters took a number of moves before the pieces were in contact with the other side

The following table provides a glimpse of the changes in the names and character of chess pieces as they passed from one culture to another from India through Persia to Europep221

An ice cap is a large mass of ice Ice caps cover less than 50 000 km of land area Sheets of ice covering more than 50 000 km are called ice sheets Ice caps are usually in high areas but they are not limited to them

Carbonhydrogen bond activation or CH activation is a reaction that breaks a carbonhydrogen bond Most times the reaction involves organometallic complexes The reaction path has coordination of a hydrocarbon to the inner sphere of the metal atom The reaction path includes either an intermediate alkane or arene complex or as a transition state leading to a MC intermediate The reaction path makes CH activation different from other reactions During the CH breaking event the hydrocarbyl group remains linked in the inner sphere and under the influence of the metal atom

Chemists study CH activation because for many years chemists believed that CH bonds were unreactive Both theoretical studies as well as experiments now show that CH bonds can be broken This is done by a nearby metal atom changing the electron distribution of the CH bond Much chemical research looks at the design and synthesis of new reagents and catalysts that can affect CH activation The goal of this research is the conversion of cheap and abundant alkanes into valuable functionalized organic compounds

Historians say that Otto Dimroth discovered the first CH activation reaction In 1902 he reported that benzene reacted with mercury acetate but some scholars do not view this reaction as being a CH activation Goldman Goldberg later wrote CH activation looks like HH activation both can be achieved by electrophilic or oxidative addition The first true CH activation reaction was reported by Joseph Chatt in 1965 with insertion of a ruthenium atom ligated to dmpe in the CH bond of naphthalene 

Egyptian literature is some of the earliest known literature The Egyptians were the first culture to develop the book

The ancient Egyptians wrote on papyrus They also wrote on walls tombs pyramids obelisks and more A well known example of ancient Egyptian literature is the Story of Sinuhe

Alexandria became an important center of early Christianity from around the 1st to 4th century CE Writing by Coptic Christians was important to Christian literature at that timeThe Nag Hammadi library protected some books from being lost or destroyed

Muslim Arabs controlled Egypt by the eighth century Libraries and literature were important in Arab Egypt Several important changes for writers happened at this time Cloth paper replaced papyrus Writers began using calligraphy Also writers began to write mostly about Islam The earliest novel written in Egypt was Ibn al Nafis Theologus Autodidactus It was an early science fiction and religious novel

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the Arab world experienced a cultural change like the Renaissance This was called al Nahda movement It touched nearly all areas of life including literature One of the most important people from this time was Naguib Mahfouz He was first Egyptian to win the Nobel Prize in Literature Another important modern writer was Muhammad Husayn Haykal He wrote Zaynab in 1914 It is an Islamic novel and is called the first modern Egyptian novel

Phormium tenax is an evergreen perennial plant from New Zealand and Norfolk Island It is an important fibre plant and also a popular garden plant The plant grows as a clump of long straplike leaves up to two meters long It grows a much taller flowering shoot with dramatic yellow or red flowers

The fibre from the plant was used by the Mori of New Zealand to make baskets It was also used in rope and sail making after the arrival of Europeans up until at least WWII

In other countries Phormium tenax is an invasive species On Saint Helena it is taking over the land from the critically endangered species Elaphoglossum dimorphum 

Ecology  The jumping spider Trite planiceps lives in the rolled up leaves of this species Phormium tenax grows on the coast where it is important in the breeding habitat for the endangered Yellow eyed Penguin

Several forms of this species have been selected for cultivation as decorative garden plants including The Royal Horticultural Society in England gave an Award of Garden Merit to the plant 

Extensive reading is a way of learning a language especially a second or foreign language

Free voluntary reading is one name for extensive reading in first language education Learners can choose a book that they like and to read it quickly or slowly A free voluntary reading program is to help students to enjoy reading so there are often no grades In some schools this approach is also called Drop Everything and Read

In 1988 Day and Bamford described extensive reading for learning a second or foreign language Students read as much as possible Reading materials should use simple grammar and vocabulary so learners feel comfortable Learners should read many different kinds of writing about different subjects 

Many extensive reading programs use special series of books These books use simplified grammar and vocabulary They may be original stories but many are shorter easier versions of classic books

Many teachers and some learners believe that extensive reading alone is enough to improve vocabulary McQuillan and Krashen also believe thisHowever other researchers say that extensive reading alone is not enough Cobb and Parry have done research to show that there is a limit Extensive reading may not improve vocabulary as much as people thought especially less common words

Chemistry education is the study of the teaching and learning of chemistry in schools colleges and universities Topics in chemistry education include understanding how students learn chemistry and how best to teach chemistry Researchers in chemistry education try to improve learning results by changing teaching methods and appropriate training of chemistry teachers Researchers study many teaching modes including classroom lecture demonstrations and laboratory activities There is always a need to update the skills of chemistry teachers People working in this field do that

There is a world wide shortage of chemistry teachers This is because people with science training can get jobs that pay more outside of teaching It is hard to keep science teachers More than 45000 math and science teachers left teaching in the United States just after the 19992000 school year

There are at least four different philosophical perspectives that describe how the work in chemistry education is carried out The first is a practitioners perspective The individuals who are responsible for teaching chemistry are the ones who ultimately define chemistry education by their actions

A second perspective is defined by a self identified group of chemical educators Dr Robert L Lichter then Executive Director of the Camille and Henry Dreyfus Foundation speaking in a plenary session at the 16th Biennial Conference on Chemical Education posed the question why do terms like chemical educator even exist in higher education when there is a perfectly respectable term for this activity namely chemistry professor One criticism of this view is that few professors bring any formal preparation in education or background about education to their jobs Most chemistry professors do not have a professional perspective on teaching and learning efforts They may not know about effective teaching methods and how students learn

A third perspective is chemical education research Following the example of physics education research CER tends to take the theories and methods developed in pre college science education research and applies them to understanding comparable problems in post secondary settings Like science education researchers CER practitioners tend to study the teaching practices of others as opposed to focusing on their own classroom practices Chemical education research is typically carried out in situ using human subjects from secondary and post secondary schools Chemical education research collects both quantitative and qualitative data Quantitative methods typically involve collecting data that can then be analyzed using various statistical methods Qualitative methods include interviews observations journaling and other methods common to social science research

Finally there is a newer perspective called The Scholarship of Teaching and Learning There is debate on how to best define SoTL One of SoTLs primary methods is for mainstream faculty members to develop a more informed view of their teaching practices SoTL asks faculty to carry out research and to reflect on their own teaching SoTL asks faculty what constitutes deep understanding in student learning

Chemistry education is based on a combination of these four perspectives

There are many academic journals about chemistry education Historically the circulation of many of these journals was limited to the country of publication Some journals concentrate on chemistry at different education levels while others cover all education levels Most of these journals carry a mixture of articles that range from reports on classroom and laboratory practices to educational research

Bisphenol A is an organic compound with two phenol functional groups It is used to make polycarbonate plastic epoxy resins and other things

Scientist found out in the mid 1930s that people and animals react to BPA as if it were a hormone Government reports say BPA is not safe for humans So in 2008 some retail stores removed products made with BPA Many news stories wrote about BPA safety 

A 2010 report from the United States Food and Drug Administration warned about harm when fetuses infants and young children contact BPA In September 2010 Canada became the first country to declare BPA as a toxic substance In the European Union and Canada BPA can not be used to make baby bottles

The world could make 1 million tonnes of BPA per year in the 1980s and more than 22 million tonnes in 2009 In 2003 US consumption was 856000 tonnes 72 of which was used to make polycarbonate plastic and 21 going into epoxy resins In the US less than 5 of the BPA made each year is used in ways that would touch food

Bisphenol A was first made in a laboratory by the Russian chemist AP Dianin in 1891 This compound is synthesized by the condensation of two equivalents of phenol with acetone The reaction is catalyzed by a strong acid such as hydrochloric acid or a sulfonated polystyrene resin When large batches are made in factories a large excess of phenol is used to ensure full condensation The product mixture of the cumene process may also be used as starting material

Many types of ketones can make a condensation reaction under these conditions When factories make BPA the BPA must be separated from the resin impurities that are made from these other ketones So after the BPA is made the factories separate the BPA from many resinous byproducts under high vacuum or solvent based extraction using additional phenol followed by distillation

Most bisphenol A is used to make plastics Commercial products containing bisphenol A based plastics have been used since 1957 Manufacturers use at least 8 billion pounds of BPA each year It is a key monomer in production of epoxy resins and in the most common form of polycarbonate plastic The chemical equation to make polycarbonate is

Polycarbonate plastic which is clear and nearly shatter proof is used to make a variety of common products including baby and water bottles sports equipment medical and dental devices dental fillings and sealants eyeglass lenses CDs and DVDs and household electronics BPA is also used in the synthesis of polysulfones and polyether ketones as an antioxidant in some plasticizers and as a polymerization inhibitor in PVC Epoxy resins containing bisphenol A are used as coatings on the inside of almost all food and beverage cans however due to BPA health concerns in Japan epoxy coating was mostly replaced by PET film Bisphenol A is also a precursor to the flame retardant tetrabromobisphenol A and was formerly used as a fungicide Bisphenol A is a preferred color developer in carbonless copy paper and thermal paper with the most common public exposure coming from some thermal point of sale receipt paper BPA based products are also used in foundry castings and for lining water pipes

The chemical industry puts a symbol on plastic items to identify the type of plastic In general plastics that are marked with recycle codes 1 2 4 5 and 6 are very unlikely to contain BPA Some but not all plastics that are marked with recycle codes 3 or 7 may be made with BPA 

There are seven classes of plastics used in packaging applications Type 7 is the catch all other class and some type 7 plastics such as polycarbonate and epoxy resins are made from bisphenol A monomer When such plastics are exposed to hot liquids bisphenol A leaks out 55 times faster than it does under normal conditions

Type 3 can also contain bisphenol A as an antioxidant in plasticizers This is particularly true for flexible PVC It is generally not true for rigid PVC pipes

Bisphenol A hurts the way hormones regulate the human body BPA can pretend to be the bodys own hormones BPA may lead to negative health effects Very young children are most sensitive to BPA Some studies have linked BPA exposure before birth to later neurological difficulties Regulatory bodies have determined safety levels for humans but those safety levels are currently being questioned or under review as a result of new scientific studies A 2011 study that investigated the number of chemicals to which pregnant women in the US are exposed found BPA in 96 of women

In 2009 The Endocrine Society said it was concerned over current human exposure to BPA

In 2011 the United Kingdom Food Standards Agencys chief scientist said the evidence is that BPA is rapidly absorbed detoxified and eliminated from humans therefore is not a health concern

In 2007 38 experts on bisphenol A wrote a consensus statement which said average levels in people are above those that cause harm to many animals in laboratory experiments However the experts noted that 1 BPA is not persistent in the environment or in humans 2 biomonitoring surveys indicate that exposure is continuous 3 it is hard to use acute animal exposure studies to estimate daily human exposure to BPA and 4 no studies that had examined BPA pharmacokinetics in animal models had followed continuous low level exposures The measurement of BPA levels in human serum and other body fluids suggests that either BPA intake is much higher than previously thought or that BPA can bioaccumulate in some conditions such as pregnancy or both A 2011 study the first to examine BPA in a continuous low level exposure throughout the day did find an increased absorption and accumulation of BPA in the blood of mice

In 2007 153 government funded BPA experiments on lab animals and tissues found adverse effects and 14 did not In contrast all 13 studies funded by chemical corporations reported no harm The studies indicating harm reported a variety of deleterious effects in rodent offspring exposed in the womb abnormal weight gain insulin resistance prostate cancer and too much mammary gland development 

A panel convened by the US National Institutes of Health in 2007 determined that there was some concern about BPAs effects on fetal and infant brain development and behavior The concern over the effect of BPA on infants was also heightened by the fact that infants and children are estimated to have the highest daily intake of BPA A 2008 report by the US National Toxicology Program later agreed with the panel expressing some concern for effects on the brain behavior and prostate gland in fetuses infants and children at current human exposures to bisphenol A and minimal concern for effects on the mammary gland and an earlier age for puberty for females in fetuses infants and children at current human exposures to bisphenol A The NTP had negligible concern that exposure of pregnant women to bisphenol A will result in fetal or neonatal mortality birth defects or reduced birth weight and growth in their offspring

A 2008 review has concluded that BPA exposure increases obesity which merits concern among scientists and public health officials A 2009 review of available studies has concluded that perinatal BPA exposure acts to exert persistent effects on body weight and adiposity Another 2009 review has concluded that Eliminating exposures to and improving nutrition during development offer the potential for reducing obesity and associated diseases Other reviews have come with similar conclusions A later study on rats has suggested that perinatal exposure to drinking water containing 1 mgL of BPA increased adipogenesis in females at weaning Another study suggested that larger size for age was due to a faster growth rate rather than obesity

A US National Institutes of Health panel determined that there was some concern about BPAs effects on fetal and infant brain development and behavior A 2008 report by the US National Toxicology Program later agreed with the panel expressing some concern for effects on the brain In January 2010 the FDA expressed the same level of concern

A 2007 review has concluded that BPA like other xenoestrogens can affect the human nervous system BPA can regulate or alter nervous system functions several possible ways A 2007 review article said that low doses of BPA during development have long term effects on brain structure function and behavior in rats and mice A 2008 review concluded that low dose BPA maternal exposure causes long term consequences at the level of neurobehavioral development in mice A 2008 review concluded that exposure to BPA before birth can affect sexually dimorphic brain morphology and neuronal adult phenotypes in mice A 2008 review has concluded that BPA altered long term potentiation in the hippocampus Even a nanomolar BPA dosage could cause significant effects on memory A 2009 review raised concerns about BPA effect on anteroventral periventricular nucleus

A 2008 study by the Yale School of Medicine demonstrated that adverse neurological effects occur in non human primates regularly exposed to bisphenol A at levels equal to the United States Environmental Protection Agencys maximum safe dose of 50 gkgday This research found a connection between BPA and interference with brain cell connections vital to memory learning and mood

A 2010 study with rats prenatally exposed to 40 microgkg bw BPA has concluded that corticosterone and its actions in the brain are sensitive to the programming effects of BPA

A 2005 review concluded that prenatal and neonatal exposure to BPA in mice can make the central dopaminergic systems more active This can result in the supersensitivity to the drugs of abuse induced reward effects and hyperlocomotion

A 2008 review has concluded that BPA mimics estrogenic activity and impacts various dopaminergic processes to enhance mesolimbic dopamine activity This can result in hyperactivity attention deficits and higher sensitivity to drugs of abuse

A 2009 study on rats has concluded that prenatal and neonatal exposure to low dose BPA causes deficits in development at dorsolateral striatum by altering the function of dopaminergic receptors Another 2009 study has found associated changes in the dopaminergic system

A 2007 review has concluded that bisphenol A has been shown to bind to thyroid hormone receptor BPA may have selective effects on thyroid functions

A 2009 review about environmental chemicals and thyroid function raised concerns about BPA effects on triiodothyronine It concluded that available evidence suggests that governing agencies need to regulate the use of thyroid disrupting chemicals particularly as such uses relate exposures of pregnant women neonates and small children to the agents

A 2009 review summarized BPA adverse effects on thyroid hormone action

According to the WHOs INFOSAN animal studies have not provided convincing evidence of risk of cancer from BPA exposure

Neither the US Environmental Protection Agency nor the International Agency for Research on Cancer has evaluated bisphenol A for possible carcinogenic activity

A 2010 review at Tufts University Medical School concluded that Bisphenol A may increase the chances that a person will get cancer

A 2008 review concluded that perinatal exposure to low doses of BPA alters breast development and increases breast cancer risk Another 2008 review concluded that animal experiments and epidemiological data strengthen the hypothesis that fetal exposure to xenoestrogens may be an underlying cause of the increased incidence of breast cancer observed over the last 50 years 

A 2009 laboratory study concluded that BPA is able to induce neoplastic transformation in human breast epithelial cells Another 2009 study concluded that maternal oral exposure to low concentrations of BPA during lactation increases mammary carcinogenesis in a rodent model

A 2010 study with the mammary glands of the offspring of pregnant rats treated orally with 0 25 or 250 g BPAkg body weight has found that BPA regulated key proteins involved in signaling pathways such as cellular proliferation

A 2010 study has found that BPA may reduce sensitivity to chemotherapy treatment of specific tumors

In vitro studies have suggested that BPA can promote the growth of neuroblastoma cells A 2010 in vitro study has concluded that BPA potently promote invasion and metastasis of neuroblastoma cells through overexpression of MMP 2 and MMP 9 as well as downregulation of TIMP2

A 1997 study in mice has found that neonatal BPA exposure of 2 gkg increased adult prostate weight A 2005 study in mice has found that neonatal BPA exposure at 10 gkg disrupted the development of the fetal mouse prostate A 2006 study in rats has shown that neonatal bisphenol A exposure at 10 gkg levels increases prostate gland susceptibility to adult onset precancerous lesions and hormonal carcinogenesis A 2007 in vitro study has found that BPA within the range of concentrations currently measured in human serum is associated with permanently increase in prostate size A 2009 study has found that newborn rats exposed to a low dose of BPA increased the prostate cancer rates when those rats become adults

Bisphenol A suppresses deoxyribonucleic acid methylation which is linked to epigenetic changes

In 2007 biologists found that BPA changes the expression of key developmental genes that form the uterus in female mice embryos For example it affects the HOXA10 gene This may impact female reproductive tract development and the future fertility of female fetuses the mother is carrying

A series of studies made in 2009 found

In 2009 the scientists at the United States Environmental Protection Agency studied rodents exposed to either ethinyl estradiol or to low dose exposures of bisphenol A There was no difference between the two groups regarding several reproductive functions and behavioral activities measured in female rats That study was criticized as flawed for using polycarbonate cages in the experiment and the claimed resistance of the rats to estradiol but that claim was contested by the authors and others Another 2009 rodent study found that BPA exposure during pregnancy has a lasting effect on one of the genes that is responsible for uterine development and subsequent fertility in both mice and humans The authors concluded We dont know what a safe level of BPA is so pregnant women should avoid BPA exposure

In a 2010 study mice were given BPA at doses thought to be equivalent to levels currently being experienced by humans The research showed that BPA exposure affects the earliest stages of egg production in the ovaries of the developing mouse fetuses This suggests that the next generation may suffer genetic defects in such biological processes as mitosis and DNA replication In addition the research team noted that their study revealed a striking down regulation of mitoticcell cycle genes raising the possibility that BPA exposure immediately before meiotic entry might act to shorten the reproductive lifespan of the female by reducing the total pool of fetal oocytes Another 2010 study with mice concluded that BPA exposure in utero leads to permanent DNA alterations in sensitivity to estrogen Also in 2010 a rodent study found that by exposing fetal mice to BPA during pregnancy and examining gene expression and DNA in the uteruses of female fetuses BPA exposure permanently affected the uterus by decreasing regulation of gene expression The changes caused the mice to over respond to estrogen throughout adulthood long after the BPA exposure This suggests that early exposure to BPA genetically programmed the uterus to be hyper responsive to estrogen Extreme estrogen sensitivity can lead to fertility problems advanced puberty altered mammary development and reproductive function as well as a variety of hormone related cancers One of the authors concluded that BPA may be similar to diethylstilbestrol caused birth defects and cancers in young women whose mothers were given the drug during pregnancy

A 2011 study found that prenatal exposure to BPA causes changes in female rhesus monkeys uterus development A 2011 rodent study found that male rats exposed to BPA had lower sperm counts and testosterone levels than those of unexposed males A 2011 mice study found that male mice exposed to BPA became demasculinized and behaved more like females in their spatial navigational abilities The BPA exposed male mice were also less desirable to female mice

At an Endocrine Society meeting in 2009 new research reported data from animals experimentally treated with BPA Studies presented at the groups annual meeting show BPA can affect the hearts of women can permanently damage the DNA of mice and appear to be entering the human body from a variety of unknown sources

A 2009 in vitro study on cytotrophoblasts cells has found cytoxic effects in exposure of BPA doses from 00002 to 02 micrograms per millilitre and concluded this finding suggests that exposure of placental cells to low doses of BPA may cause detrimental effects leading in vivo to adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preeclampsia intrauterine growth restriction prematurity and pregnancy loss

A 2009 study in rats concluded that BPA at the reference safe limit for human exposure was found to impact intestinal permeability and may represent a risk factor in female offspring for developing severe colonic inflammation in adulthood

A 2010 study on mice has concluded that perinatal exposure to 10 microgramsmL of BPA in drinking water enhances allergic sensitization and bronchial inflammation and responsiveness in an animal model of asthmaand a 2011 study found that higher BPA concentrations in the urine of the pregnant women at 16 weeks were associated with wheezing a symptom of asthma in their babies

The first large study of health effects on humans associated with bisphenol A exposure was published in September 2008 by Iain Lang and colleagues in the Journal of the American Medical Association The cross sectional study of almost 1500 people assessed exposure to bisphenol A by looking at levels of the chemical in urine The authors found that higher bisphenol A levels were significantly associated with heart disease diabetes and abnormally high levels of certain liver enzymes An editorial in the same issue concludes

Based on this background information the study by Lang et al1 while preliminary with regard to these diseases in humans should spur US regulatory agencies to follow the recent action taken by Canadian regulatory agencies which have declared BPA a toxic chemical requiring aggressive action to limit human and environmental exposures4 Alternatively Congressional action could follow the precedent set with the recent passage of federal legislation designed to limit exposures to another family of compounds phthalates also used in plastic Like BPA5 phthalates are detectable in virtually everyone in the United States6 This bill moves US policy closer to the European model in which industry must provide data on the safety of a chemical before it can be used in products

A later similar study performed by the same group of scientists published in January 2010 confirmed despite of lower concentrations of BPA in the second study sample an associated increased risk for heart disease but not for diabetes or liver enzymes Patients with the highest levels of BPA in their urine carried a 33 increased risk of coronary heart disease

Studies have associated recurrent miscarriage with BPA serum concentrations oxidative stress and inflammation in postmenopausal women with urinary concentrations externalizing behaviors in two year old children especially among female children with mothers urinary concentrations altered hormone levels in men and declining male sexual function with urinary concentrations The Canadian Health Measures Survey 2007 to 2009 published in 2010 found that teenagers carry 30 percent more l bisphenol A in their bodies than older adults The reason for this is not known A 2010 study that analyzed BPA urinary concentrations has concluded that for people under 18 years of age BPA may negatively impact human immune function A study done in 2010 reported the daily excretion levels of BPA among European adults in a large scale and high quality population based sample and it was shown that higher BPA daily excretion was associated with an increase in serum total testosterone concentration in men A 2011 study found higher BPA levels in women with polycystic ovary syndrome compared to controls Furthermore researchers found a statistically significant positive association between male sex hormones and BPA in these women suggesting a potential role of BPA in ovarian dysfunction A 2010 study found that people over age 18 with higher levels of BPA exposure had higher CMV antibody levels which suggests their cell mediated immune system may not be functioning properly

A 2009 study on Chinese workers in BPA factories found that workers were four times more likely to report erectile dysfunction reduced sexual desire and overall dissatisfaction with their sex life than workers with no heightened BPA exposure BPA workers were also seven times more likely to have ejaculation difficulties They were also more likely to report reduced sexual function within one year of beginning employment at the factory and the higher the exposure the more likely they were to have sexual difficulties

The first evidence of the estrogenicity of bisphenol A came from experiments on rats conducted in the 1930s but it was not until 1997 that adverse effects of low dose exposure on laboratory animals were first reported

There is evidence that bisphenol A functions as a xenoestrogen by binding strongly to estrogen related receptor This orphan receptor acts as a constitutive activator of transcription BPA seems to bind strongly to ERR But BPA does not bind to the estrogen receptor BPA binding to ERR preserves its basal constitutive activity It can also protect it from deactivation from the selective estrogen receptor modulator 4 hydroxytamoxifen

Different expression of ERR in different parts of the body may account for variations in bisphenol A effects For instance ERR has been found in high concentration in the placenta explaining reports of high bisphenol accumulation in this tissue

Bisphenol A can leached from the plastic lining of canned foods and polycarbonate plastics especially those that are cleaned with harsh detergents or those which contain acidic or high temperature liquids BPA is an ingredient in the internal coating of metal food and beverage cans used to protect the food from direct contact with the can A recent Health Canada study found that the majority of canned soft drinks it tested had low but measurable levels of bisphenol A Also in 2010 the University of Texas School of Public Health found BPA in 63 of 105 samples of fresh and canned foods foods sold in plastic packaging and in cat and dog foods in cans and plastic packaging This included fresh turkey canned green beans and canned infant formula While most human exposure is through diet exposure can also occur through air and through skin absorption

A 2011 study published in Environmental Health Perspectives Food Packaging and Bisphenol A and Bis Phthalate Exposure Findings from a Dietary Intervention selected 20 participants based on their self reported use of canned and packaged foods to study BPA Participants ate their usual diets followed by three days of consuming foods that were not canned or packaged The studys findings include 1 evidence of BPA in participants urine decreased by 50 to 70 during the period of eating fresh foods and 2 participants reports of their food practices suggested that consumption of canned foods and beverages and restaurant meals were the most likely sources of exposure to BPA in their usual diets The researchers note that even beyond these 20 participants BPA exposure is widespread with detectable levels in urine samples in more than an estimated 90 of the US population

BPA is used both by itself and also bound into resins or plastics Thermal paper and carbonless copy paper have a high concentration of free BPA Popular uses of thermal paper include receipts event and cinema tickets labels and airline tickets A Swiss study found that 11 of 13 thermal printing papers contained 8  17 gkg Bisphenol A Upon dry finger contact with a thermal paper receipt roughly 1 g BPA was transferred to the forefinger and the middle finger For wet or greasy fingers approximately 10 times more was transferred Scientists could find BPA on peoples fingers up to 2 hours after they touched the paper receipts While there is little concern for dermal absorption of BPA free BPA can readily be transferred to skin and residues on hands can be ingested

Studies conducted by the CDC found bisphenol A in the urine of 95 of adults sampled in 19881994 and in 93 of children and adults tested in 200304 While the EPA considers exposures up to 50 gkgday to be safe the most sensitive animal studies show effects at much lower doses 

In 2009 a study found that drinking from polycarbonate bottles increased bisphenol A levels in urine by two thirds from 12 microgramsgram creatinine to 2 microgramsgram creatinine Consumer groups recommend that people wishing to lower their exposure to bisphenol A avoid canned food and polycarbonate plastic containers unless the packaging indicates the plastic is bisphenol A free In order to avoid the possibility of BPA leaching into food or drink the National Toxicology Panel recommends avoiding microwaving food in plastic containers putting plastics in the dishwasher or using harsh detergents  In the US consumption of soda school lunches and meals prepared outside the home was statistically significantly associated with higher BPA in urine

BPA is also used to form epoxy resin coating of water pipes In older buildings such resin coatings are used to avoid replacement of deteriorating hot and cold water pipes

Children may be more sensitive to BPA exposure than adults A recent study found higher BPA concentrations in the urine of young children than in adults under typical exposure conditions This increased susceptibility is most likely based on chidrens reduced capacity to eliminate xenobiotics and also their estimated higher daily exposure to BPA adjusted for weight compared to adults 

Infants fed with liquid formula are among the most exposed and those fed formula from polycarbonate bottles can consume up to 13 micrograms of bisphenol A per kg of body weight per day In the US and Canada BPA has been found in infant liquid formula in concentrations varying from 048 to 11 ngg BPA has been rarely found in infant powder formula While breast milk is the optimal source of nutrition for infants it is not always an option The US Department of Health Human Services states that the benefit of a stable source of good nutrition from infant formula and food outweighs the potential risk of BPA exposure

A 2010 study of people in Austria Switzerland and Germany has suggested polycarbonate baby bottles as the most prominent role of exposure for infants and canned food for adults and teenagers In the United States the growing concern over BPA exposure in infants in recent years has lead the manufacturers of plastic baby bottles to stop using BPA in their bottles However babies may still be exposed if they are fed with old or hand me down bottles bought before the companies stopped using BPA 

One often overlooked source of exposure occurs when a pregnant woman is exposed thereby exposing the fetus Animal studies have shown that BPA can be found in both the placenta and the amniotic fluid of pregnant mice A small US study in 2009 funded by the EWG detected an average of 28 ngmL BPA in the blood of 9 out of the 10 umbilical cords tested After the baby is born maternal exposure can continue to effect the infant through transfer of BPA to the infant via breast milk Because of these exposures that can occur both during and after pregnancy mothers wishing to limit their childs exposure to BPA should attempt to limit their own exposures during that time period 

While the majority of exposures have been shown to come through the diet accidental ingestion can also be considered a source of exposure One study conducted in Japan tested plastic baby books to look for possible leaching into saliva when babies chew on them While the results of this study have yet to be replicated it gives reason to question whether exposure can also occur in infants through ingestion by chewing on certain books or toys

Physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling is a mathematical representation of the absorption distribution metabolism and excretion of synthetic or natural chemical substances in humans and other animals Scientists do not agree on a PBPK BPA model for humans The effects of BPA on an organism depend on how much free BPA is available and how long cells are exposed to it Glucuronidation in the liver by conjugation with glucuronic acid to form the metabolite BPA glucuronide reduces the amount of free BPA however BPAG can be deconjugated by the enzyme beta glucuronidase Free BPA can also be inactivated by sulfation a process that can also be reverted by arylsulfatase C A 2010 vitro study has shown that placenta P glycoprotein may cause BPA to flow out of placenta cells

Scientists disagree on the best test methods for studying BPA effects

A 2010 review of 80 biomonitoring studies concluded that the general population is internally exposed to significant amounts of unconjugated BPA Using GCMS on 20 samples BPA was detected in 100 of urine samples with a median of 125 ngml and 10 of blood samples

A 2009 research has found that some drugs like naproxen salicylic acid carbamazepine and mefenamic acid can in vitro significantly inhibit BPA glucuronidation

A 2010 study on rats embryos has found that genistein may enhance the developmental toxicity of BPA

In general studies have shown that BPA can affect growth reproduction and development in organisms that live in water Among freshwater organisms fish appear to be the most sensitive species Evidence of endocrine related effects in fish aquatic invertebrates amphibians and reptiles has been reported at environmentally relevant exposure levels lower than those required for acute toxicity There is a widespread variation in reported values for endocrine related effects but many fall in the range of 1gL to 1 mgL

BPA can contaminate the environment either directly or through degradation of products containing BPA such as ocean borne plastic trash

As an environmental contaminant this compound interferes with nitrogen fixation at the roots of leguminous plants associated with the bacterial symbiont Sinorhizobium meliloti BPA concentration in the soil drops in half in only 110 days It decays quickly but its widespread use still makes it an important pollutant According to Environment Canada initial assessment shows that at low levels bisphenol A can harm fish and organisms over time Studies also indicate that it can currently be found in municipal wastewater

A 2009 review of the biological impacts of plasticizers on wildlife published by the Royal Society with a focus on annelids molluscs crustaceans insects fish and amphibians concluded that BPA have been shown to affect reproduction in all studied animal groups to impair development in crustaceans and amphibians and to induce genetic aberrations

A large 2010 study of two rivers in Canada found that areas contaminated with hormone like chemicals including bisphenol A showed females made up 85 per cent of the population of a certain fish At the same time in uncontaminated areas females made up only 55 per cent

The Broads are a network of mostly navigable rivers and lakes in the English counties of Norfolk and Suffolk The Broads and some nearby land were made into a special protected area by The Norfolk and Suffolk Broads Act of 1988 The Broads Authority has managed the area since 1989

The total area is convert303km2 mostly in Norfolk with over convert200km of navigable waterways There are seven rivers and 63 broads mostly less than convert4m deep Thirteen broads are generally open to navigation with a further three having navigable channels 

Although the terms Norfolk Broads and Suffolk Broads are used to identify specific areas within the two counties respectively the whole area is frequently referred to as the Norfolk Broads 

Boko Haram is an Islamist splinter group that has been active in Nigeria since 2009 The name of the group means Western or non Islamic education is a sin The group is active in the north of Nigeria and wants to impose Islamic law as the only law in Nigeria It also wants to outlaw education that is not based on Islam in the country The group sees itself as similar to the Taliban which are active in Afghanistan Locally the group is known as the Taliban The official name of the group is Jamaatu Ahlis Sunna Liddaawati wal Jihad which in Arabic means People Committed to the Propagation of the Prophets Teachings and Jihad

The group was formed in Maiduguri in 2002 Local residents of the area soon called the group Boko Haram Loosely translated from the local Hausa language this means Western education is forbidden Residents gave it the name because of its strong opposition to Western education which it sees as corrupting Muslims The term Boko Haram comes from the Hausa word boko meaning Animist western or otherwise non Islamic education and the Arabic word haram figuratively meaning sin

Boko Haram opposes not only Western education but Western culture and modern science as well The group also forbids the wearing of shirts and pants and the act of voting in elections In its view the Nigerian state is run by non believers

In a 2009 BBC interview Mohammed Yusuf the groups leader at the time stated that he rejects the fact that the earth is a sphere and views it as contrary to Islam along with Darwinism and the fact that rain comes from water evaporated by the sun

Boko Haram is not associated with the group Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta which fights against the oil industry in the Niger delta since 2006

The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta is one of the largest militant groups in the Niger delta Many people in the delta are poor The Nigerian government has contracts that allow international companies to extract crude oil in the delta This extraction causes massive damage to the environment According to the magazine The Economist the organization wants more of the profit of the oil extraction to go to the poor region where the oil is extracted According to the magazine the organisation is used by several armed groups these groups are sometimes paid to launch attacks The payment is done either with weapons or with money MEND has been linked to attacks on petroleum operations in Nigeria as part of the Conflict in the Niger Delta engaging in actions including sabotage theft property destruction guerrilla warfare and kidnapping

MENDs stated goals are to localize control of Nigerias oil and to secure reparations from the federal government for pollution caused by the oil industry In an interview with one of the groups leaders who used the alias Major General Godswill Tamuno the BBC reported that MEND was fighting for total control of the Niger Deltas oil wealth saying local people had not gained from the riches under the ground and the regions creeks and swamps 

In a January 2006 email MEND warned the oil industry It must be clear that the Nigerian government cannot protect your workers or assets Leave our land while you can or die in it Our aim is to totally destroy the capacity of the Nigerian government to export oil Additionally MEND has called upon President Olusegun Obasanjo to free two jailed Ijaw leaders Mujahid Dokubo Asari who is jailed and charged with treason and Diepreye Alamieyeseigha a former governor of Bayelsa State convicted of corruption Obasanjos successor President Umaru Musa YarAdua authorised the release of Dokubo Asari and Alamieyeseigha in 2007

Urbanization is a term from geography The base of the word is the latin urbs which means city The term urbanisation means that lifestyle that is common in a city becomes prevalent This can happen in two different ways

Physical urbanization has been observed for centuries In developing countries this is the main form of urbanization In developed countries functional urbanization is the main form of urbanization With functional urbanization people living in the city center move to the countryside next to the city this is known as suburbanization

Environmental scientists are studying the urban heat island The urban heat island is made when industrial and urban areas are developed and heat becomes plentiful In country areas a large part of the incoming solar energy is used to evaporate water from vegetation and soil But cities have less vegetation and soil In cities most of the suns energy is absorbed by urban building and asphalt paving During warm daylight hours there is less evaporative cooling in cities than in country areas So surface temperatures rise higher in cities than in country areas Also vehicles factories and industrial and domestic heating and cooling units give off more heat in cities This problem is growing This effect causes the city to become 2 to 10o F warmer than surrounding rural areas Environmental impacts also include reducing soil moisture and intensification of carbon dioxide emissions

Stewart Brands book Whole Earth Discipline argues that urbanization helps the environment overall First the birth rate of new urban dwellers falls immediately to replacement rate and keeps falling This can prevent overpopulation in the future Secondly it puts a stop to destructive subsistence farming methods like slash and burn agriculture Finally it reduces land use by humans leaving more for nature

You Suffer is a song by the British grindcore band Napalm Death It is from their debut album Scum Guinness Book of Records has mentioned the song as the shortest recorded song ever It is precisely 1316 seconds long

The song was written by band members Nicholas Bullen and Justin Broadrick This was during the sessions for the From Enslavement to Obliteration demo recording in March 1986 The song is featured on the album Scum released in 1987

According to Broadrick You Suffer was meant as a joke He called it retarded ridiculous but hilarious He added that they played the song in front of 30 local kids like every weekend for about thirty times

Nic Bullen said that the short length of the song was inspired by Wehrmachts 1985 song E

Zak Smith quotes the lyrics to the song which he describes as the shortest punk song on the subject of suffering at the conclusion of his memoir We Did Porn

A music video produced by Earache records was released for the song in March 2007 This was on the same day that the Scum dualdisc was released

These terms describe two classes of an electrocyclic reaction In a conrotatory mode the substituents located at the ends of a conjugated double bond system move in the same direction during ring opening or ring closure In a disrotatory mode they move in opposite directions

An example is the conversion of trans cis trans 246 octatriene to cis dimethylcyclohexadiene The orbital mechanics of the reaction needs a disrotatory mode The orbital symmetry of the octatrienes highest occupied molecular orbital requires for the end pi orbitals to move in opposite directions to form the correct symmetry found in the sigma bond 

Thermal rearrangements of all conjugated systems containing 4n 2 pi electron are stereospecific This is based on preservation of orbital symmetry in the highest occupied molecular orbital Systems containing 4n pi electrons show the opposite conrotatory mode This is also true for rearrangements of 4n 2 pi electrons driven by light Photoinduced rearrangements of 4n pi electron systems follow the disrotatory rule

The WoodwardHoffmann rules summarize the above different reactions

The following picture also shows the difference between conrotatory and disrotatory reactions

The Odontoceti are a suborder of the cetaceans They are the toothed whales

The Odontoceti includes all the whales which eat prey larger than plankton Examples are sperm whales beaked whales dolphins and others As the name suggests the suborder has teeth rather than the baleen of Mysticeti whales This means they are predators of small to large sized prey 

The Sperm Whale Physeter the Killer Whale Orca and the Pilot Whale Globicephala all take large prey By means of co operation Killer Whales can take prey larger than themselves up to and including Blue Whale calves Sperm Whales are specialist feeders on giant squid

There are about 73 species

The Allen Telescope Array was developed by the SETI Institute and the Radio Astronomy Laboratory at the University of California Berkeley to construct a radio interferometer that is dedicated to astronomical observations At the same time it is also used for the search for extraterrestrial intelligence

The ATA is at the Hat Creek Radio Observatory convert290mi northeast of San Francisco California The goal is to have 350 antennas To start 42 antennas were put to work on 11 October 2007 However a lack of money stopped operations in April 2011 In August 2011 ATA got short term funding

It is named after Paul Allen the co founder of Microsoft Its old name was the One Hectare Telescope

The Herring Gull is a large gull and is the most abundant and best known of all gulls along the shores of western Europe It breeds across Northern Europe Western Europe Scandinavia and the Baltic states 

Some Herring Gulls especially those resident in colder areas migrate further south in winter but many are permanent residents eg in the British Isles Iceland or on the North Sea shores European Herring Gulls are also abundant around inland garbage dumps and some have even adapted to life in inland cities

The taxonomy of the Herring Gull Lesser Black backed Gull group is very complicated with different authorities recognising between two and eight species

This group has a ring distribution around the northern hemisphere Differences between adjacent forms in this ring are fairly small but by the time the circuit is completed the end members Herring Gull and Lesser Black backed Gull are clearly different species

The Lesser Black backed Gull is a large gull that breeds on the Atlantic coasts of Europe It is migratory wintering from the British Isles south to West Africa It is a regular winter visitor to the east coast of North America probably from the breeding population in Iceland

This species breeds in colonies on coasts and lakes It makes a lined nest on the ground or a cliff Normally three eggs are laid In some cities the species nests in towns and cities often with Herring Gulls

They are similar in size but slightly smaller than the Herring Gull The taxonomy of the Herring Gull Lesser Black backed Gull group is very complicated Different authorities recognise between two and eight species This group has a ring distribution around the northern hemisphere Differences between adjacent forms in this ring are fairly small but by the time the circuit is completed the end members Herring Gull and Lesser Black backed Gull are clearly different species

The only species it might be confused with in Europe is the Great Black backed Gull Lesser is a smaller bird with slimmer build yellow rather than pinkish legs and smaller white mirrors at the wing tips 

The bill is yellow with a red spot When the young peck the red spot The adults feed them by regurgitation This is an inherited behaviour called a fixed action pattern or innate releasing mechanism

Aldershot is known for its connection with the British Army This led to rapid growth from a small village to a Victorian town Today Aldershot is known as the Home of the British Army 

Cuckoo is a Federal style house in the small unincorporated area Cuckoo Virginia near Mineral Virginia The house was built in 1819 for Henry Pendleton On August 19 1994 Cuckoo was added to the list of National Register of Historic Places The house is located near the US Route 33 which curves around the house Cuckoo has Federal details and Colonial Revival elements from the early 20th century The house is known for its design prominence and its association with the Pendleton family of doctors The house was named for the Cuckoo Tavern The Pendleton family owns the house since its construction

The first construction had a two storied front section with a one story extension to the rear In the one story section the dining room and the winter kitchen were located Between 1839 and 1907 the house was owned by Dr Philip Barbour Pendleton He added a second floor to the rear part of the house and extended the main roof to cover the new rooms of the house A later generation of Pendletons rebuilt the house in the Colonial Revival style after 1910 They added the present Neoclassical portico The next owners Anne Pendleton Forrest and Dr William Mentzel Forrest added to the back a design by architect Stanislaw J Makielski of Charlottesville The complex includes a number of outbuildings including two separate doctors office buildings a garage barn a house for smoking and the Pendleton family cemetery

Cuckoo is a house made of bricks It has two floors and a center hall which is divided into three parts Single rooms are flanking the stair hall The house has a porch on its entire front A semicircular closet with a small window is between the fireplaces of the rooms to the right of the center hall The fireplaces and chimneys are on both sides of the elevation The Makielski addition to the back of the house has a porch that echoes the curve of the closet The addition includes a back stairway

The small doctors office was probably built in the early to mid 19th century for Dr Robert Barret It is located to the north of Cuckoo and was moved to Cuckoo by Dr Philip Barbour Pendleton before the American Civil War The large doctors office was built around 1888 for Dr Eugene Pendleton It was expanded to also include his sons practice around 1908 It was moved to Cuckoo in 1910 when Eugene moved there The office was moved again in 1972 when the highway was built and was used as a medical office by Dr Eugene Barbour Pendleton until 1979 A house for smoking was built in the late 19th century and a barn in the early 20th century A garage was built in the 1930s 

The Pendleton cemetery is located in an oak grove at the top of a small rise about 14 mile from the house It is surrounded by a low stone wall The cemetery has three gravestones and several unmarked graves

Cuckoo was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 19 1994 The house was damaged in the 2011 Virginia earthquake The tall chimneys broke down

Maria Anna of Austria was an Archduchess of Austria as she was a daughter of Leopold I Holy Roman Emperor She would become Queen consort and regent of Portugal by her marriage to John V of Portugal She was the Regent of Portugal from 1742 until 1750 during the illness of her spouse 

The fifth of Leopold I Holy Roman Emperors children by Eleonore Magdalene of Neuburg she was baptised Maria Anna Josepha She was born in Linz as the Austrian royal family had to flee Vienna from the Turkish army which destroyed the capital Maria Anna was a sister of two future Holy Roman Emperors Joseph I and Charles VI Through Charles VI she was an aunt of Empress Maria Theresa Her first cousins included Elisabetta Farnese as well as Charles II of Spain 

On 27 October 1708 she married her first cousin John V of Portugal Both of their mothers were sisters Maria Anna thus became Queen of Portugal as the wife of the ruling king She was the mother of six children

In 1742 Maria Anna took over power as regent after her husband suffered a stroke which left him partially paralyzed When John V died on 31 July 1750 she gave up power to their eldest son Joseph I of Portugal She died at he Palace of Belm in 1754 Her body was buried in Lisbon her heart was brought to Vienna and buried there in the imperial crypt

Sportklub Niedersterreich St Plten is a football club from St Plten the capital of the Austrian federal state Lower Austria St Poelten plays in the Austrian Football First League the second division in the Austrian football league system

SKN St Poelten was founded in June 2000 The new club took over all belongings of the predecessor FCN St Poelten Most important was the ownership of the Bundesliga junior center Through this the club did not enter in the lowest class but was allowed in the 2nd League West the fifth level of Austrian football

The next two seasons they won the championships and reached the Regionalliga OstIn the 200304 season the club reached the 4th place The following season the club reached sixth place in the league reached in the Austrian Cup the quarter finals They won over SV Wrgl SW Bregenz and a sensational 5 1 victory overAustria Salzburg in the third round In the quarter finals St Poelten was beaten by Austria Wien 6 0 In autumn 2009 the club could present the plans for the new stadium which is currently built in the Ratzersdorf district of StPlten

In the 200708 season they won the Regionalliga and were promoted to the First League

As of 15 August 2011

The SKN St Poelten currently has ten youth teams for children from the age of 7 to 15 with a total of 150 children and youths In addition to the junior teams the club has a second team which plays their games in the Mid Western League with the squad mostly consisting of squad players under the age of 18

The Bourbons of Parma are a royal family who ruled the duchy of Parma from 1748 till 1854 when Italy was created The family was founded by the Infante Philip of Spain third son of Philip V of Spain and Elisabetta Farnese The Treaty of Aix la Chapelle ended the War of the Austrian Succession and gave the land to Philip

Philip married Louise lisabeth of France and the present pretending duke of Parma is a direct descendant The duchy was taken by the House of Savoy when the state of Italy was created 

The history of English poetry stretches from the middle of the 7th century to the present day Over this period English poets have written some of the most enduring poems in Western culture and the language and its poetry have spread around the globe

The earliest surviving poetry from the area currently known as England was likely transmitted orally and then written down in versions that do not now survive thusthe earliest poetry remains difficult and often controversial

A number of major national poetries including the American Australian New Zealand Canadian and Indian poetry have emerged and developed Since 1921 Irish poetry has also been increasingly viewed as a separate area of study

A rearrangement reaction are organic reactions where the carbon skeleton of a molecule is rearranged The result is a structural isomer of the original molecule Often a substituent moves from one atom to another atom in the same molecule In the example below the substituent R moves from carbon atom 1 to carbon atom 2

Intermolecular rearrangements also take place 

Sometimes chemists draw diagrams with arrows that show how electrons are transferred between bonds during a rearrangement reaction Many organic chemistry text books have such diagrams But they do not tell the full story of the reaction mechanism The actual mechanism of a rearrangment with an alkyl group moving is for the group to slide smoothly along a bond not ionic bond breaking and forming One example of this is the Wagner Meerwein rearrangement

In pericyclic reactions the orbital interactions are important The reactions can not be explained by a series of simple discrete electron transfers But the curved arrows showing a sequence of discrete electron transfers can give the same result as a rearrangement reaction Yet the diagrams are not necessarily realistic In allylic rearrangement the reaction is ionic

Three important rearrangement reactions are 12 rearrangements pericyclic reactions and olefin metathesis

A 12 rearrangement is an organic reaction where a substituent moves from one atom to another atom in a chemical compound In a 12 shift the substituent moves between two adjacent atoms But moves over larger distances are possible Examples are the Wagner Meerwein rearrangement

and the Beckmann rearrangement

A pericyclic reaction is a type of reaction with multiple carbon carbon bond making and breaking The transition state of the molecule has a cyclic geometry The reaction progresses in a concerted fashion Examples are hydride shifts

and the Claisen rearrangement

Olefin metathesis is a formal exchange of the alkylidene fragments in two alkenes It is a catalytic reaction with carbene It has transition metal carbene complex intermediates

Computational chemistry is a branch of chemistry that uses computer science to help solve chemical problems It uses the lessons of theoretical chemistry to write efficient computer programs These programs calculate the structures and properties of molecules and solids Chemist needs computational chemistry because the quantum n body problem cannot be solved analytically The n body problem also cannot be solved in closed form Computational chemistry normally complement the information obtained by chemical experiments It can predict chemical phenomena that have not yet been observed It is widely used in the design of new drugs and materials

Computational chemistry can predict structure absolute and relative energies electronic charge distributions dipoles and higher multipole moments vibrational frequencies reactivity or other spectroscopic quantities and cross sections for collision with other particles

Computational chemistry looks at both static and dynamic systems In all cases as the size of the system being studied grows the computer time and other resources used also grows That system can be a single molecule a group of molecules or a solid Computational chemistry methods range from highly accurate to very approximate highly accurate methods are typically feasible only for small systems Ab initio methods are based entirely on theory from first principles Other methods are called empirical or semi empirical because they employ experimental results often from acceptable models of atoms or related molecules to approximate some elements of the underlying theory

Both ab initio and semi empirical approaches use approximations These range from simplified forms of the first principles equations that are easier or faster to solve to approximations limiting the size of the system to fundamental approximations to the underlying equations that are required to achieve any solution to them at all For example most ab initio calculations make the BornOppenheimer approximation which greatly simplifies the underlying Schrdinger equation by freezing the nuclei in place during the calculation In principle ab initio methods eventually converge to the exact solution of the underlying equations as the number of approximations is reduced In practice however it is impossible to eliminate all approximations and residual error inevitably remains The goal of computational chemistry is to minimize this residual error while keeping the calculations to a size that a computer can perform

In some cases the details of electronic structure are not as important as the long time phase space behavior of molecules So chemists study the conformational studies of proteins and protein ligand binding thermodynamics Classical approximations to the potential energy surface are used as they are computationally less intensive than electronic calculations to enable longer simulations of molecular dynamics Furthermore cheminformatics uses even more empirical methods like machine learning based on physicochemical properties One typical problem in cheminformatics is to predict the binding affinity of drug molecules to a given target

In 1927 Walter Heitler and Fritz London made the first theoretical chemistry calculations They built on the founding discoveries and theories in the history of quantum mechanics Influential books in the early development of computational quantum chemistry include Linus Pauling and E Bright Wilsons 1935 Introduction to Quantum Mechanics with Applications to Chemistry Eyring Walter and Kimballs 1944 Quantum Chemistry Heitlers 1945 Elementary Wave Mechanics with Applications to Quantum Chemistry and later Coulsons 1952 textbook Valence each of which served as primary references for chemists in the decades to follow

The development of efficient computer technology in the 1940s made calculating elaborate wave equations for complex atomic systems possible In the early 1950s the first semi empirical atomic orbital calculations were carried out Theoretical chemists used the early digital computers a lot Smith and Sutcliffe wrote a very detailed account of such use in the United Kingdom The first ab initio HartreeFock calculations on molecules with two atoms were carried out in 1956 at MIT using a basis set of Slater orbitals For molecules with two atoms a systematic study using a minimum basis set and the first calculation with a larger basis set were published by Ransil and Nesbet respectively in 1960 The first polyatomic calculations using Gaussian orbitals were carried out in the late 1950s The first configuration interaction calculations were carried out in Cambridge on the EDSAC computer in the 1950s using Gaussian orbitals by Boys and coworkers By 1971 when a bibliography of ab initio calculations was published the largest molecules included were naphthalene and azulene Abstracts of many earlier developments in ab initio theory have been published by Schaefer

In 1964 Hckel method calculations were generated on computers at Berkeley and Oxford They worked on molecules ranging in complexity from butadiene and benzene to ovalene These empirical methods were replaced in the 1960s by semi empirical methods such as CNDO

In the early 1970s efficient ab initio computer programs such as ATMOL GAUSSIAN IBMOL and POLYAYTOM began to be used to speed up ab initio calculations of molecular orbitals Of these four programs only GAUSSIAN now massively expanded is still in use But many other programs are now in use At the same time the methods of molecular mechanics such as MM2 were developed primarily by Norman Allinger

One of the first mentions of the term computational chemistry can be found in the 1970 book Computers and Their Role in the Physical Sciences by Sidney Fernbach and Abraham Haskell Taub where they state It seems therefore that computational chemistry can finally be more and more of a reality During the 1970s computational chemistry adopted many different methods The Journal of Computational Chemistry was first published in 1980

Chemists define theoretical chemistry as a mathematical description of chemistry Computational chemistry uses mathematical methods that are well developed These methods are automated as computer programs In theoretical chemistry chemists physicists and mathematicians develop algorithms and computer programs to predict atomic and molecular properties and reaction paths for chemical reactions Computational chemists in contrast may simply apply existing computer programs and methodologies to answer specific chemical questions

There are two different aspects to computational chemistry

So computational chemistry can assist experimental chemists It also can challenge experimental chemists to find entirely new chemical objects

Computational chemistry has five major parts

A single molecular formula can represent a number of molecular isomers Each isomer is a local minimum on the energy surface created from the total energy as a function of the positions of all the nuclei A stationary point is a geometry where the derivative of the energy with respect to all displacements of the nuclei is zero The local minimum that is lowest is called the global minimum and corresponds to the most stable isomer If there is one particular coordinate change that leads to a decrease in the total energy in both directions the stationary point is a transition structure and the coordinate is the reaction coordinate This process of determining stationary points is called geometry optimization

As computers grew more powerful mathematicians discovered efficient ways to calculate the first derivatives of the energy with respect to all atomic coordinates The allowed chemists to determine molecular structure by geometry optimization Evaluation of the related second derivatives allows the prediction of vibrational frequencies by estimating harmonic motion Second derivatives also identify stationary points in molecular vibration The frequencies are related to the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix which contains second derivatives If the eigenvalues are all positive then the frequencies are all real and the stationary point is a local minimum If one eigenvalue is negative then the stationary point is a transition structure If more than one eigenvalue is negative then the stationary point is a more complex one and is usually of little interest However most experimental chemists are looking solely for local minima and transition structures

Approximate solutions of the time dependent Schrdinger equation give the total energy of the system usually with no relativistic terms included The BornOppenheimer approximation which allows for the separation of electronic and nuclear motions can simplify the Schrdinger equation With this simplification the total energy is a sum of the electronic energy at fixed nuclei positions and the repulsion energy of the nuclei For very large systems the relative total energies can be compared using molecular mechanics The ways of determining the total energy to predict molecular structures are

The computer programs used in computational chemistry are based on many different quantum chemical methods that solve the molecular Schrdinger equation associated with the molecular Hamiltonian Methods that do not include any empirical or semi empirical parameters in their equations being derived directly from theoretical principles with no inclusion of experimental data are called ab initio methods This does not imply that the solution is an exact one they are all approximate quantum mechanical calculations The name means that a particular approximation is defined on first principles and then solved within an error margin that is qualitatively known beforehand If numerical iterative methods have to be used the program will repeat the calculation until full machine accuracy is obtained

The simplest type of ab initio electronic structure calculation is the HartreeFock scheme HF is an extension of molecular orbital theory in which the correlated electronelectron repulsion is not specifically taken into account only its average effect is included in the calculation As the basis set size is increased the energy and wave function tend towards a limit called the HartreeFock limit Many types of calculations begin with a HartreeFock calculation and subsequently correct for electronelectron repulsion As these methods are pushed to the limit they approach the exact solution of the non relativistic Schrdinger equation To better match experiment data relativistic and spin orbit terms are added to the calculation Both of these are only really important for heavy atoms In all of these approaches in addition to the choice of method it is necessary to choose a basis set This is a set of functions usually centered on the different atoms in the molecule which are used to expand the molecular orbitals with the LCAO ansatz Ab initio methods need to define a level of theory and a basis set

The HartreeFock wave function is a single configuration or determinant In some cases particularly for bond breaking processes this is does not work and several configurations need to be used Here chemists optimize the coefficients of the configurations and the coefficients of the basis functions together

The total molecular energy can be evaluated as a function of the molecular geometry in other words the molecules potential energy surface Such a surface can be used for reaction dynamics The stationary points of the surface lead to predictions of different isomers and the transition structures for conversion between isomers but these can be determined without a full knowledge of the complete surface

Computational thermochemistry calculates thermochemical quantities such as the enthalpy of formation to chemical accuracy Chemists calculate large problems accurately by using a series of post HartreeFock methods and combining the results These methods are called quantum chemistry composite methods

Density functional theory methods are often considered to be ab initio methods for determining the molecular electronic structure even though many of the most common functionals use parameters derived from empirical data or from more complex calculations In DFT the total energy is expressed in terms of the total one electron density rather than the wave function In this type of calculation there is an approximate Hamiltonian and an approximate expression for the total electron density DFT methods can be very accurate for little computational cost Some methods combine the density functional exchange functional with the HartreeFock exchange term and are known as hybrid functional methods

Semi empirical quantum chemistry methods are based on the HartreeFock formalism but make many approximations and obtain some parameters from empirical data They are very important in computational chemistry for treating large molecules where the full HartreeFock method without the approximations is too expensive The use of empirical parameters appears to allow some inclusion of correlation effects into the methods

Semi empirical methods follow what are often called empirical methods where the two electron part of the Hamiltonian is not explicitly included Erich Hckel proposed the Hckel method for electron systems Roald Hoffmann proposed the extended Hckel method for all valence electron systems

In many cases large molecular systems can be modeled successfully without any quantum mechanical calculations Molecular mechanics simulations for example use a single classical expression for the energy of a compound for instance the harmonic oscillator All constants appearing in the equations must be obtained beforehand from experimental data or ab initio calculations

The database of compounds used for parameterization is called the force field It is crucial to the success of molecular mechanics calculations A force field parameterized against a specific class of molecules for instance proteins would be expected to only have any relevance when describing other molecules of the same class

These methods can be applied to proteins and other large biological molecules and allow studies of the approach and interaction of potential drug molecules

Computational chemical methods can be applied to solid state physics problems The electronic structure of a crystal is in general described by a band structure which defines the energies of electron orbitals for each point in the Brillouin zone Ab initio and semi empirical calculations yield orbital energies therefore they can be applied to band structure calculations The amount of time to calculate the energy for the entire list of points in the Brillouin zone is more than the number of points multiplied by the time needed to calculate the energy for each molecule at one of those points

The following steps are used in the time dependent approach First the electronic and nuclear variables are separated Then the wave packet corresponding to the nuclear degrees of freedom is propagated using the time evolution operator associated to the time dependent Schrdinger equation

In the complementary energy dependent approach the time independent Schrdinger equation is solved using the scattering theory formalism Potential energy surfaces give potential representing the interatomic interaction In general the potential energy surfaces are coupled using the vibronic coupling terms

The most popular methods for propagating the wave packet associated to the molecular geometry are

Molecular dynamics uses Newtons laws of motion to examine the time dependent behavior of systems including vibrations or Brownian motion It uses a classical mechanical description of the system MD combined with density functional theory leads to the CarParrinello method

Richard Bader developed the atoms in molecules model to effectively link the quantum mechanical view of a molecule as an electronic wavefunction to chemically useful older models such as the theory of Lewis pairs and the valence bond model Bader showed that these empirically useful models are connected with the topology of the quantum charge density This method improves on the use of Mulliken population analysis

Computational chemists use many self sufficient software packages Some include many methods covering a wide range Others concentrate on a very specific range or even a single method Details of most of them can be found in

Polymer chemistry is the science of chemical synthesis and chemical properties of polymers or macromolecules According to IUPAC recommendations macromolecules refer to the individual molecular chains and are the domain of chemistry Polymers describe the bulk properties of polymer materials and belong to the field of polymer physics

The different kinds of macromolecules include

Polymers are formed by polymerization of monomers Chemists describe a polymer by its degree of polymerization molar mass distribution tacticity copolymer distribution the degree of branching by its end groups crosslinks and crystallinity Chemists also study a polymers thermal properties such as its glass transition temperature and melting temperature Polymers in solution have special characteristics for solubility viscosity and gelation

Polymer chemistry started by studying the long fibers in plants The work of Henri Braconnot in 1777 and the work of Christian Schnbein in 1846 led to the discovery of nitrocellulose Nitrocellulose treated with camphor makes celluloid Chemists dissolve celluloid in ether or acetone to make collodion Doctors have used collodion as a wound dressing since the US Civil War Cellulose acetate was first prepared in 1865 In 1834 Friedrich Ludersdorf and Nathaniel Hayward independently discovered that adding sulfur to raw natural rubber helped prevent the material from becoming sticky In 1844 Charles Goodyear received a US patent for vulcanizing rubber with sulfur and heat Thomas Hancock had received a patent for the same process in the UK the year before

In 1884 Hilaire de Chardonnet started the first artificial fiber factory based on regenerated cellulose or viscose rayon as a substitute for silk but it was very flammable In 1907 Leo Baekeland invented the first synthetic polymer a thermosetting phenol formaldehyde resin called Bakelite Around the same time Hermann Leuchs reported the synthesis of N carboxyanhydrides and their high molecular weight products upon reaction with nucleophiles But Leuchs did not call them polymers possibly due to the strong views held by Emil Fischer his direct supervisor denying the possibility of any covalent molecule exceeding 6000 daltons Cellophane was invented in 1908 by Jocques Brandenberger who squirted sheets of viscose rayon into an acid bath

In 1922 Hermann Staudinger proposed that polymers were long chains of atoms held together by covalent bonds He also proposed to name these compounds macromolecules Before that scientists believed that polymers were clusters of small molecules without definite molecular weights held together by an unknown force Staudinger received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1953

Wallace Carothers invented the first synthetic rubber called neoprene in 1931 Neoprene was the first polyester Carothers went on to invent nylon a true silk replacement in 1935 Paul Flory was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1974 for his work on polymer random coil configurations in solution in the 1950s Stephanie Kwolek developed an aramid or aromatic nylon named Kevlar patented in 1966

There are now a large number of commercial polymers They include composite materials such as carbon fiber epoxy polystyrene polybutadiene acrylonitrile butadiene styrene Chemists design commercial polymers to combine the best properties of their various components For example special polymers used in automobile engines are designed to work at high temperatures

It took a long time before universities introduced teaching and research programs in polymer chemistry An Institut fur Makromolekulare Chemie was founded in 1940 in Freiburg Germany under the direction of Hermann Staudinger In America a Polymer Research Institute was established in 1941 by Herman Mark at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn Several hundred graduates of PRI played an important role in the US polymer industry and academia Other PRIs were founded in 1961 by Richard S Stein at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 1967 by Eric Baer at Case Western Reserve University and in 1988 at the University of Akron

In chemistry chemical synthesis means using chemical reactions to get a product or several products This happens by physical and chemical manipulations Often several different chemical reactions are used one after another In modern laboratory usage a chemical synthesis is reproducible reliable and established to work in multiple laboratories

Chemists start to design a chemical synthesis by selecting compounds to combine These starting compounds are known as reagents or reactants Chemists use various reaction types to these to synthesize the product or an intermediate product This requires mixing the compounds in a reaction vessel Many reactions require some form of work up procedure before the final product is isolated

The amount of product in a chemical synthesis is the reaction yield Typically chemical yields are expressed as a weight in grams or as a percentage of the total theoretical quantity of product that could be produced A side reaction is an unwanted chemical reaction taking place that reduces the yield of the wanted product

The chemist Adolph Wilhelm Hermann Kolbe was the first to use the word synthesis in its present day meaning

In most cases a single reaction will not convert a reactant into the desired reaction product Chemists have many strategies to find the best sequence of reactions to make the desired product In cascade reactions multiple chemical changes take place within a single reactant In multi component reactions up to 11 different reactants form a single reaction product In a telescopic synthesis one reactant goes through multiple transformations without isolating intermediates after each step

Organic synthesis is a special type of chemical synthesis Only organic compounds are created in organic synthesis The total synthesis of a complex product may take many steps to reach the goal product These steps can take too much time Chemists want to have skill in organic synthesis and being able to find a synthesis path with the least number of steps The synthesis of very valuable or difficult compounds has earned chemists such as Robert Burns Woodward the Nobel Prize in Chemistry

If a chemical synthesis starts from basic laboratory compounds and yields something new it is a purely synthetic process If it starts from a product isolated from plants or animals and then proceeds to a new compounds the synthesis is called a semisynthetic process

Most times chemical synthesis means the overall many step procedure for making a desired product Sometimes chemists use chemical synthesis to mean just a direct combination reaction In a direct combination reaction two or more reactants combine to form a single product The chemical equation for a direct combination reaction is

where A and B are elements or compounds and AB is a compound consisting of A and B Examples of combination reactions include

Four special synthesis rules are

Organic synthesis is a special part of chemical synthesis It builds organic compounds using organic reactions Organic molecules can have a higher level of complexity compared to inorganic compounds So the synthesis of organic compounds has developed into one of the most important parts of organic chemistry There are two main areas of research fields within the general area of organic synthesis total synthesis and methodology

A total synthesis is the complete chemical synthesis of complex organic molecules from simple commercially available or natural precursors In a linear synthesisoften used for simple structuresseveral steps are performed one after another until the molecule is complete The chemical compounds made in each step are usually called synthetic intermediates For more complex molecules a different approach may be preferable convergent synthesis involves the individual preparation of several pieces which are then combined to form the goal product

Robert Burns Woodward who received the 1965 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for several total syntheses is regarded as the father of modern organic synthesis Some latter day examples of total synthesis include Wenders Holtons Nicolaous and Danishefskys synthesis of Taxol

Each step of a synthesis involves a chemical reaction and reagents and conditions for each of these reactions need to be designed to give a good yield and a pure product with as little work as possible A method may already exist in the literature for making one of the early synthetic intermediates and this method will usually be used rather than trying to reinvent the wheel However most intermediates are compounds that have never been made before These will normally be made using general methods developed by methodology researchers To be useful these methods need to give high yields They must also be reliable for a broad range of substrates For practical applications additional requirements include industrial standards of safety and purity Methodology research usually involves three main stages discovery optimization and studies of scope and limitations The discovery requires extensive knowledge of and experience with chemical reactivities of appropriate reagents Optimization is where one or two starting compounds are tested in the reaction under a wide variety of conditions of temperature solvent reaction time etc Researchers try different conditions until they find the best conditions for product yield and purity Finally researchers try to extend the synthesis method to a broad range of different starting materials to find its scope and limitations Total synthesis are sometimes used to highlight the new method and demonstrate its value in a real world application Major industries focused especially on polymers and on pharmaceuticals have used this research

Most complex natural products are chiral Each enantiomer can have a different bioactivity Traditional total syntheses targeted racemic mixtures ie as an equal mixture of both possible enantiomers The racemic mixture might then be separated via chiral resolution

In the latter half of the twentieth century chemists began to develop methods of asymmetric catalysis and kinetic resolution These reactions could be directed to produce only one enantiomer rather than a racemic mixture Early examples include Sharpless epoxidation and asymmetric hydrogenation For their achievement these workers went on to share the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2001 Such reactions gave chemists a much wider choice of enantiomerically pure molecules to start an organic synthesis Previously only natural enantiomer starting materials could be used Using techniques pioneered by Robert Burns Woodward and other new synthetic methods chemists became more able to make complex molecules without unwanted racemisation This is called stereocontrol This allowed the final target molecule to be synthesised as one pure enantiomer without any resolution being necessary Such techniques are referred to as asymmetric synthesis

Elias James Corey brought a more formal approach to synthesis design based on retrosynthetic analysis for which he won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1990 In this approach the research is planned backwards from the product using standard rules The steps are shown using retrosynthetic arrows which in effect means is made from Computer programs have been written for designing a synthesis based on sequences of generic half reactions

Morozevich has been one of the best chess players in the world for nearly a decade He is famous for employing unusual openings for example the Chigorin Defense and more recently the Albin Countergambit both systems are hardly ever seen at the top level He is also well known for preferring complicated rather than clear positions Perhaps because of his style which produces relatively few draws Morozevich is popular among chess fans 

Among his most notable results are 7510 at the 2000 Chess Olympiad and 711 at the 2002 Chess Olympiad He took first place in the overall standings at the Amber tournament in 2002 2004 and 2006 first place in Biel tournament three times 2003 2004 and 2006 and twice winning the Russian championship

ALI AKISH is a famous journalist one of the leaders of the Tatar nationalist movement the Honorary President of the World League of Tatars

Ali Aksih was a preeminent leader of the Tatar nationalist movement in diaspora He was born in the city of Hailar where he attended a local Tatar elementary school before entering a Russian lycee After completing the lycee in 1936 he went to study at Al Azhar University in Cairo and in 1938 along with another young nationalist Ahat Ginish went to Poland Akish and Ginish served as technical assistants to Ayaz Iskhaki at the Idel Ural National Center where the newspaper Yanga Milli Yul was published Their work was interrupted by the invasion of Poland by the Nazi and Soviet forces

Akish lived from 1940 to 1966 in Turkey where he was involved with the diaspora national movement His pamphlet Problems of Idel Ural and Soviet Imperialism printed in 1963 received great attention and provoked repercussions in the USSR in the form of two books one ostensibly written by the President of the Tatar ASSR Salikh Batiyev in 1977 In 1966 Ali Akish joined the Tatar Bashkir Service of Radio Liberty Inc In 1983 he retired from this position and went again to Ankara Over the years he wrote numerous articles in emigree publications and other forums such as Turk Kulturu and in 1985 published a 59 page booklet similar to his first called Idel Uralda Hurriyet Mucadelesi

In 1994 after reading Vladimir Zhirinovskys book Last Thrust to the South he wrote an article for the Turkish newspaper Milliyet in which he denounced the Russian nationalists imperial and anti Turkish aspirations The article was highly significant as one of the first published in Turkey critical of Zhirinovsky and his views

He was able to visit Kazan the capital of the Republic of Tatarstan in Russia On his first visit to Kazan he brought at his own expense a computer that he donated to the Tatar Public Center Akish dedicated his whole life to the liberation of the Tatar people from colonial oppression The World Tatar League named him honorary president in recognition of his achievements A school was named in his honor in the city of Chally in Tatarstan 

In chemistry yield is the amount of product resulting from a chemical reaction The absolute yield gives the weight in grams and the molar yield gives the number of moles

To get the percentage yield one must multiply the fractional yield by 100

The ideal percentage yield of a chemical reaction is 100 but it cannot be achieved because measurements are never completely accurate According to Vogels Textbook of Practical Organic Chemistry yields around 100 are quantitative yields above 90 are excellent yields above 80 are very good yields above 70 are good yields below 50 are fair yields below 40 are poor Yields may appear to be above 100 when products are not pure Purification always lowers the yield

An impulse is a feeling of wanting to do something

Dry cleaning is any cleaning process for clothing and textiles using a chemical solvent rather than water The solvent used is typically tetrachloroethylene The solvent is called perc in the industry and dry cleaning fluid by the public It is often used instead of hand washing delicate fabrics People use dry cleaning because it takes less work than hand washing

The ancient Romans used ammonia and fullers earth to launder their woolen togas Fullonicae were very prominent industrial facilities with at least one in every town of any notability and frequently the largest employer in a district These laundries obtained urine from farm animals or from special pots situated at public latrines The industry made so much money that fullers guilds were an important political force Also the government taxed the collection of urine

Modern dry cleaning uses non water based solvents to remove soil and stains from clothing Jean Baptiste Jolly discovered that petroleum based solvents can be used for dry cleaning in the mid 19th century Jolly was a French dye works owner He noticed that his tablecloth became cleaner after his maid spilled kerosene on it He subsequently developed a service cleaning peoples clothes this way which became known as nettoyage sec or dry cleaning

Early dry cleaners used petroleum based solvents such as gasoline and kerosene Fire concerns led William Joseph Stoddard a dry cleaner from Atlanta to develop Stoddard solvent as a slightly less flammable alternative to gasoline based solvents The government started to regulate dry cleaners because the highly flammable petroleum solvents caused many fires and explosions

After World War I dry cleaners began using chlorinated solvents These solvents were much less flammable than petroleum solvents and had improved cleaning power By the mid 1930s the dry cleaning industry had adopted tetrachloroethylene widely called perc as the best solvent It has excellent cleaning power and is stable nonflammable and gentle to most clothing However perc was also the first chemical to be classified as a carcinogen by the Consumer Product Safety Commission In 1993 the California Air Resources Board adopted regulations to reduce perc emissions from dry cleaning operations The dry cleaning industry is in the process of replacing perc with other chemicals andor methods

Traditionally the actual cleaning process was carried out at centralized factories high street cleaners shops received garments from customers sent them to the factory and then had them returned to the shop where the customer could collect them This was due mainly to the risk of fire or dangerous fumes created by the cleaning process At this time dry cleaning was carried out in two different machines one for the cleaning process itself and the second to dry the clothing

Machines of this era were called vented their fumes and drying exhausts were sent to the atmosphere in the same way as with modern tumble dryer exhausts This added to environmental contamination Also much potentially reusable perc was lost to the atmosphere Much stricter controls on solvent emissions have ensured that all dry cleaning machines in the western world are now fully enclosed No solvent fumes are vented to the atmosphere In enclosed machines solvent recovered during the drying process is returned condensed and distilled So it can be reused to clean further loads or safely thrown away The majority of modern enclosed machines also incorporate a computer controlled drying sensor which automatically feels when most traces of perc have been removed from the load during the drying process This system ensures that only the smallest amount of perc fumes will be released when opening the door at the end of the cycle

A dry cleaning machine is similar to a combination of a domestic washing machine and clothes dryer Garments are placed into a washingextraction chamber The chamber is the core of the machine The washing chamber contains a horizontal perforated drum that rotates within an outer shell The shell holds the solvent while the rotating drum holds the clothing The basket can hold between about 10 and 40 kg

During the wash cycle the chamber is filled approximately one third full of solvent and begins to rotate agitating the clothing The solvent temperature is maintained at 30 degrees Celsius as a higher temperature may damage it During the wash cycle the solvent in the chamber is filtered and then fed back into the chamber This is known as the cycle and is continued for the wash duration The solvent is then removed and sent to a distillation unit that has both a boiler and condenser The condensed solvent is fed into a separator unit where any remaining water is separated from the solvent and then fed into the clean solvent tank The ideal flow rate is one gallon of solvent per pound of garments per minute depending on the size of the machine

Operators also check clothing for foreign objects before placing them into the machine Items such as plastic pens will dissolve in the solvent bath and may damage textiles beyond recovery Some textile dyes are loose and will release dye during solvent immersion Operators will dry clean red clothing separately from lighter color textiles to avoid color transfer The solvent used must be distilled to remove impurities that may transfer to clothing Operators checked clothing for dry cleaning compatibility including fasteners Many fasteners that decorate clothing either are not dry cleaning solvent proof or will not withstand the mechanical action of cleaning Operators will remove them and restitched them after the cleaning Or operators will wrap them in a small padded protector Fragile items such as feather bedspreads or tasseled rugs or hangings may be enclosed in a loose mesh bag The density of perchloroethylene is around 17 gcm at room temperature and the sheer weight of absorbed solvent may cause the textile to fail under normal force during the extraction cycle unless the mesh bag provides mechanical support

Many people believe that all marks or stains can be removed by dry cleaning Not every stain can be cleaned just by dry cleaning Some need to be treated with spotting solvents sometimes by steam jet or by soaking in special stain remover liquids before garments are washed or dry cleaned Also garments stored in soiled condition for a long time are difficult to bring back to their original color and texture Natural fibers such as wool cotton and silk of lighter colors should not be left in dirty or soiled condition for long amounts of time as they absorb dirt in their texture and are unlikely to be restored to their original color and finish

The main reason that washing in water has a different result than dry cleaning is that water is a polar solvent while dry cleaning uses a non polar solvent

A typical wash cycle lasts for 815 minutes depending on the type of garments and degree of soiling During the first three minutes solvent soluble soils dissolve into the perchloroethylene and loose insoluble soil comes off It takes approximately ten to twelve minutes after the loose soil has come off to remove the ground in insoluble soil from garments Machines using hydrocarbon solvents require a wash cycle of at least 25 minutes because of the much slower rate of solvation of solvent soluble soils A dry cleaning surfactant soap may also be added

At the end of the wash cycle the machine starts a rinse cycle wherein the garment load is rinsed with fresh distilled solvent from the pure solvent tank This pure solvent rinse prevents discoloration caused by soil particles being absorbed back onto the garment surface from the dirty working solvent

After the rinse cycle the machine begins the extraction process which recovers dry cleaning solvent for reuse Modern machines recover approximately 9999 of the solvent that was used The extraction cycle begins by draining the solvent from the washing chamber and accelerating the basket to 350 to 450 rpm causing much of the solvent to spin free of the fabric Until this time the cleaning is done in normal temperature the solvent is never heated in dry cleaning process When no more solvent can be spun out the machine starts the drying cycle

During the drying cycle the garments are tumbled in a stream of warm air that circulates through the basket evaporating any traces of solvent left after the spin cycle The air temperature is controlled to prevent heat damage to the garments The exhausted warm air from the machine then passes through a chiller unit where solvent vapors are condensed and returned to the distilled solvent tank Modern dry cleaning machines use a closed loop system in which the chilled air is reheated and recirculated This results in high solvent recovery rates and reduced air pollution In the early days of dry cleaning large amounts of perchlorethylene were vented to the atmosphere because it was regarded as cheap and believed to be harmless

After the drying cycle is complete a deodorizing cycle cools the garments and removes even more of the solvent by circulating cool outside air over the garments and then through a vapor recovery filter made from activated carbon and polymer resins After the aeration cycle the garments are clean and ready for pressingfinishing

In fact dry cleaning does not remove all of the solvent There are no government standards for how much solvent is allowed to remain in the fabric Detectable amounts of the solvent remain in clothes with wool clothes retaining the most solvent

Working solvent from the washing chamber passes through several filtration steps before it is returned to the washing chamber The first step is a button trap which prevents small objects such as lint fasteners buttons and coins from entering the solvent pump

Over time a thin layer of filter cake accumulates on the lint filter The muck is removed regularly and then processed to recover solvent trapped in the muck Many machines use spin disc filters which remove the muck from the filter by centrifugal force while it is back washed with solvent

After the lint filter the solvent passes through an absorptive cartridge filter This filter is made from activated clays and charcoal and removes fine insoluble soil and non volatile residues along with dyes from the solvent Finally the solvent passes through a polishing filter which removes any soil not previously removed The clean solvent is then returned to the working solvent tank

To enhance cleaning power small amounts of detergent are added to the working solvent and are essential to its functionality These detergents help dissolve hydrophilic soils and keep soil from redepositing on garments Depending on the machines design either an anionic or a cationic detergent is used

Since the solvent recovery is less than 100 and because dry cleaning does not remove water based stains well entrepreneurs have developed the wet cleaning process which is in essence cold water washing and air drying using a computer controlled washer and dryer In general wet cleaning is still being improved and developed although low tech versions of it have been used for centuries

People who make clothes have special symbols to say how they should be cleaned The international GINETEX laundry symbol for dry cleaning is a circle It may have a letter P inside to indicate perchloroethylene solvent or a letter F inside to indicate a hydrocarbon solvent A bar underneath the circle means that only mild cleaning processes should be used A crossed out empty circle means the the clothes should not be dry cleaned

Cooked Powder Residue the waste material generated by cooking down or distilling muck Cooked powder residue is a hazardous waste and will contain solvent powdered filter material carbon non volatile residues lint dyes grease soils and water Laws say how this material can be discarded

The waste sludge or solid residue from the still contains solvent water soils carbon and other non volatile residues Material removed from the bottom of the stills at chlorinated solvent dry cleaning operations are hazardous wastes

Perc is classified as a hazardous air contaminant by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and must be handled as a hazardous waste To prevent it from getting into drinking water dry cleaners that use perc must take special precautions against site contamination Landlords are becoming increasingly reluctant to allow dry cleaners to operate in their buildings When released into the air perc can contribute to smog when it reacts with other volatile organic carbon substances California declared perchloroethylene a toxic chemical in 1991 and its use will become illegal in that state in 2023

Some alternatives such as CO2 avoids the toxic risks of perc But CO2 does not clean some forms of grime as well as perc

Various commercial products on the marketplace today such as Procter Gambles Dryel allow elements of the dry cleaning process to be performed in the household using home laundry machines Though not the complete process that would be performed by a professional dry cleaner they allow the convenience of home laundry and work for certain types of garments

The Cetaceans are mammalian marine descendants of land mammals Their terrestrial origins are indicated by

The question of how land animals evolved into ocean going leviathans was a mystery until recent discoveries in Pakistan revealed several stages in the transition of cetaceans from land to sea

After many years when palaeontologists thought whales had evolved from mesonychids DNA sequence analysis showed the closest relationship was with artiodactyls the even toed ungulates A new clade was created to include Cetacea and their nearest relatives the hippopotamus family This clade is called the Cetartiodactyla

Hippo fossils are not observed until the Miocene but whale ancestors have been dated to the Eocene This leaves a gap of nearly 30 million years where no hippo ancestors are found The most recent hypothesis is that hippos and whales shared a common semi aquatic ancestor which branched off from other Artiodactyls around 60 million years ago This hypothesized ancestral group probably split into two branches around 54 mya One branch evolved into cetaceans possibly beginning with the proto whale Pakicetus from 52 mya These early cetaceans eventually became adapted to life in the sea They became the completely aquatic cetaceans

Indohyus is a small deer like creature which lived about 48 million years ago in Kashmir It belongs to the artiodactyls family Raoellidae and is believed to be the closest sister group of Cetacea 

About the size of a raccoon or domestic cat this herbivorous creature shared some of the traits of whales It also showed signs of adaptations to aquatic life including a thick and heavy outer bone coating This is similar to the bones of modern creatures such as the hippopotamus and reduces buoyancy so that they can stay underwater This suggests a similar survival strategy to the African mousedeer or water chevrotain which when threatened by a bird of prey dives into water and hides beneath the surface for up to four minutes

Coal balls are calcium rich masses of permineralised life forms They generally have a round shape Coal balls are not made of coal despite their name Coal balls were formed 300 million years ago They were formed the Carboniferous Period They can preserve organic matter very well That makes them useful to scientists They cut and peel the coal balls This is used to research the geological past of the Earth

In 1855 two English scientists Joseph Dalton Hooker and Edward William Binney found coal balls in England Because of that the initial research on coal balls was done in Europe Coal balls were found and identified in North America in 1922 Since then coal balls have been found in other countries and several theories on their formation have been proposed

Coal balls are in coal seams across North America and Eurasia North American coal balls are in more places than in Europe The oldest known coal balls were found in Germany and former Czechoslovakia

Coal balls were first found by Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker and Edward William Binney in northern England in 1855 The early work on these objects was done by European scientists North American studies on coal balls began in 1922 when coal balls were correctly identified in Illinois Before 1922 they were merely reported as rock masses in the coal seams Over a hundred new species have been discovered in coal balls in other countries Many paleobotanists made theories about how coal balls were made

Hooker and Binney found Westphalian age coal balls in Yorkshire and Lancashire England They proposed a theory on how coal balls were formed That theory is commonly agreed upon in scientific papers

According to Hooker and Binney coal balls were formed in situ organic matter gently accumulated near a peat bog and was permineralised Water containing a high content of dissolved rock was buried along with the plant in a peat bog As the mixture crystallised concretions containing plant material were formed and preserved as round lumps of stone This prevented coalification and preserved the peat That became a coal ball later Most coal balls are in coal seams They are usually in places where the peat was not squished enough to turn the material into coal

Marie Stopes and David Watson also examined their own coal ball samples They agreed with Hooker and Binney when they decided that coal balls formed in situ They also added that interaction with a marine environment was necessary for a coal ball to form

Coal balls are not made of coal They are calcium rich permineralised life forms James Lomax described them as calcium carbonate and iron pyrites in varying proportions and in a few places a mixture of silica with carbonate of lime Their sizes range from the size of a walnut to up to three feet in diameter They are commonly about the size of a mans fist

Coal balls commonly contain microdolomites products of aragonite and masses of organic matter at various stages of decomposition Hooker and Binney analysed a sample of a coal ball They found a lack of coniferous wood and fronds of ferns They also found out that the discovered plant matter appeared to have been arranged just as they fell from the plants that produced them

In 1962 Sergius Mamay and Ellis Yochelson found signs of marine animal remains in North American coal balls Their findings reinforced Lomaxs proposal on coal ball formation Lomax believed that coal balls were formed not in situ but rather in a marine environment during a large storm

Coal balls can preserve dead things Some coal balls have been described as more or less perfectly well preserved and beautifully anatomically preserved plants not what used to be the plant it is the plant Others have been described as containing almost no preserved plant remains

The quality of the preservation of organic material depends on the speed of the burial process and the degree of compression before undergoing permineralisation Generally coal balls resulting from remains that have a quick burial with little decay and pressure have a higher preservation degree However plant remains in most coal balls show various signs of decay and collapse

Coal balls were first found in England Belgium Holland former Czechoslovakia Germany the former Soviet Union and China They were also found in North America where they are more widespread The American coal balls are in the Illinois Basin Ohio and the Appalachian region Their ages varying from the later Stephanian to the later end of the Westphalian European coal balls are generally from the early end of the Westphalian stage The oldest coal balls were Namurian age and were discovered in Germany and former Czechoslovakia

Fossilised material contained within coal balls can be analysed by cutting the coal ball and extracting thin peels This is the procedure which was carried out by Hooker and Binney Peels are obtained by grinding and cutting a coal ball etching the cut and the surface of the ball with hydrochloric acid and applying acetone and a piece of cellulose acetate This embeds the cells preserved in the coal ball to the cellulose acetate Upon drying the cellulose acetate can be removed from the coal ball and the obtained peel can be stained and observed under a microscope

X ray powder diffraction can also be used to analyse coal balls In X ray diffraction X rays of a predetermined wavelength are sent through a sample to examine its structure It reveals information about the crystallographic structure chemical composition and physical properties of the examined material The scattered intensity of the X ray pattern is observed and analysed with the result based on a function of incident and scattered angle polarisation and wavelength or energy

Thin sections of coal balls can also be used for analysis Thin sections are used to investigate the optical properties of the samples contents A coal ball can be cut with a diamond saw The thin section can be flattened and placed under a petrographic microscope for examination

Paul John Flory was an American chemist and Nobel laureate who worked in the field of polymers or macromolecules He was a leading pioneer in understanding how polymers dissolve in solutions He won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1974 for his fundamental achievements both theoretical and experimental in the physical chemistry of macromolecules

He graduated from Elgin High School in Elgin Illinois in 1927 Flory received a bachelors degree from Manchester College in 1931 and a PhD from the Ohio State University in 1934 His first position was at DuPont with Wallace Carothers

Florys earliest work in polymer science was in the area of polymerization kinetics at the DuPont Experimental station Most chemists studying condensation polymerization believed that the reactivity of the end group decreased as the macromolecule grew Flory argued that the reactivity was independent of the polymers size He showed that the number of polymer chains present decreased with size exponentially

Flory introduced the important concept of chain transfer to the study of addition polymerization This improved chemists understanding of the kinetic equations It also helped chemists to understand the distribution of the polymer sizes

In 1938 after Carothers death Flory moved to the Basic Science Research Laboratory at the University of Cincinnati There he developed a mathematical theory for the polymerization of compounds with more than two functional groups He also developed the theory of polymer networks or gels

In 1940 he joined the Linden NJ laboratory of the Standard Oil Development Company He developed a statistical mechanical theory for polymer mixtures there

In 1943 he left to join the research laboratories of Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company as head of a group on polymer fundamentals In the Spring of 1948 Peter Debye then chairman of the chemistry department at Cornell University invited Flory to give the annual Baker Lectures He then was offered a position with the faculty in the Fall of the same year At Cornell Flory expanded and refined his Baker Lectures into his best work Principles of Polymer Chemistry which was published in 1953 by Cornell University Press This quickly became a standard text for all workers in the field of polymers and is still widely used to this day

Flory introduced the concept of excluded volume to polymers Excluded volume refers to the idea that one part of a long chain molecule can not occupy space that is already occupied by another part of the same molecule Excluded volume causes the ends of a polymer chain in a solution to be further apart than they would be were there no excluded volume The recognition that excluded volume was an important factor in analyzing long chain molecules in solutions provided an important conceptual breakthrough Excluded volume explained several puzzling experimental results of that time It also led to the concept of the theta point the set of conditions at which an experiment can be conducted that causes the excluded volume effect to be neutralized At the theta point the chain reverts to ideal chain characteristics  the long range interactions coming from the excluded volume are eliminated This allows experimenters to more easily measure short range features such as structural geometry bond rotation potentials and steric interactions between near neighboring groups Flory taught another advantage of performing the experiment at the theta point the chain dimension in polymer melts would have the size computed for a chain in ideal solution This works because excluded volume interactions are neutralized at the theta point

He also invented an original method for computing the probable size of a polymer in good solution He invented the Flory Huggins Solution Theory He derived the Flory exponent which helps characterize the movement of polymers in solution

Flory won the Perkin Medal and the Priestley Medal

He became a professor at Stanford University in 1961 He became the Jackson Wood Professor there in 1966 He retired from Stanford in 1975 He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1974 for his fundamental achievements both theoretical and experimental in the physical chemistry of macromolecules He remained active after his retirement and consulted for IBM for some years He and his wife Emily Catherine Tabor had three children Susan Melinda and John Susan has two children Elizabeth and Mary Elizabeth has three children Katy Greer Margaret Greer and Sam Greer Paul J Flory died of a heart attack in Big Sur California in 1985

The informal economy is that part of economy which does not show up in official statistics The informal economy is not taxed and does not contribute to the gross domestic product of a country In developing countries over 70 of the people work in this form of economy They are self employed because it is difficult to find someone to hire them The people working in this form of economy have no social benefits or social security which are usually only given by the state to those who have made tax contributions 

Usually most people working in this form of economy are women they work in the most erratic and corrupt segments of the job market Sixty percent of female workers in developing countries are employed by the informal sector There are two main reasons why this is the case First the kind of employment that is available caters most to women Secondly most women either work from home because they also have to take care of children or they work as street vendors both of these kinds of work are classified in the informal sector 

What is more most people at the top positions of the sector are men and most people in the bottom positions are women For example very few women are employers who hire others and more women are likely to be involved in smaller scale operations Labor markets household decisions and states all propagate this gender inequality The gender gap in terms of wage is even higher in the informal sector than the formal sector

When two chemical substances come in contact with each other through what is called a phase they will interact with each other in that phase They may also have an interface If a substance accumulates within a phase this is called absorption if the same process happens on the interface it is called adsorption In the year 1909 James William McBain introduced the word Sorption to describe such a process in the case where it is not easy or meaningful to make a difference between absorption and absorption 

Examples of where the concept of sorption is important are measuring the pollution of the environment using sorpton it is possible ot bind pollutants to small particles in the air or in the soil Sorption makes these bindings possible In much the same way polluants can be transported over long distances 

Machines and proccesses that use sorption include the absorption refrigerator and solar air conditioning

Materials science researches the properties of matter to solve science and engineering problems It investigates the relationship between the structure of materials at the atomic or molecular scale and their macroscopic properties It uses applied physics and chemistry Significant media attention focused on nanoscience and nanotechnology in recent years brings materials science to a high priority at many universities Materials science is also an important part of forensic engineering and failure analysis Materials science also deals with the fundamental properties and characteristics of materials

The important material of a given era is often its defining point Phrases such as Stone Age Bronze Age and Steel Age are good examples

Materials science originally studied ceramics and metallurgy These ancient crafts make materials science is one of the oldest forms of engineering and applied science Modern materials science evolved directly from metallurgy which itself evolved from mining ceramics and the use of fire A major breakthrough in the understanding of materials occurred in the late 19th century when the American scientist Josiah Willard Gibbs demonstrated that the thermodynamic properties related to atomic structure in various phases are related to the physical properties of a material Important elements of modern materials science are a product of the space race the understanding and engineering of the metallic alloys and silica and carbon materials used in the construction of space exploration vehicles Materials science is linked to the development of plastics semiconductors and biomaterials

Before the 1960s many materials science departments were named metallurgy departments from a 19th and early 20th century emphasis on metals The field has since broadened to include every class of materials including ceramics polymers semiconductors magnetic materials medical implant materials and biological materials

The basis of materials science involves relating the wanted properties and relative performance of a material in a certain application to the structure of the atoms and phases in that material It also characterizes materials The major determinants of the structure of a material and thus of its properties are its constituent chemical elements and the way in which the material has been processed into its final form These characteristics taken together and related through the laws of thermodynamics govern a materials microstructure and thus its properties

The manufacture of a perfect crystal of a material is currently physically impossible Instead materials scientists manipulate the defects in crystalline materials such as precipitates grain boundaries interstitial atoms vacancies or substitutional atoms to create materials with the desired properties

Not all materials have a regular crystal structure Polymers display varying degrees of crystallinity and many are completely non crystalline Glasses some ceramics and many natural materials are amorphous not possessing any long range order in their atomic arrangements The study of polymers combines elements of chemical and statistical thermodynamics to give thermodynamic as well as mechanical descriptions of polymers physical properties

In addition to industrial interest materials science has gradually developed into a field which provides tests for condensed matter or solid state theories Trying to explain diverse new material properties produces new physics theories

Bigmaterials advances can help create new products or even new industries But stable industries also employ materials scientists to make incremental improvements and troubleshoot issues with currently used materials Industrial applications of materials science include materials design cost benefit tradeoffs in industrial production of materials processing techniques and analytical techniques characterization techniques such as electron microscopy X ray diffraction calorimetry nuclear microscopy Rutherford backscattering neutron diffraction small angle X ray scattering etc

Besides material characterization the material scientistengineer also deals with the extraction of materials and their conversion into useful forms So ingot casting foundry techniques blast furnace extraction and electrolytic extraction are all part of the required knowledge of a metallurgistengineer Often the presence absence or variation of minute quantities of secondary elements and compounds in a bulk material will have a great impact on the final properties of the materials produced for instance steels are classified based on 110 and 1100 weight percentages of the carbon and other alloying elements they contain Thus the extraction and purification techniques employed in the extraction of iron in the blast furnace will have an impact of the quality of steel that may be produced

The overlap between physics and materials science has led to the field of materials physics which is concerned with the physical properties of materials The approach is generally more macroscopic and applied than condensed matter physics

The study of metal alloys is a large part of materials science Of all the metallic alloys in use today the alloys of iron make up the largest proportion both by quantity and commercial value Iron alloyed with various proportions of carbon gives low mid and high carbon steels An iron carbon alloy is only considered steel if the carbon level is between 001 and 200 For the steels the hardness and tensile strength of the steel is related to the amount of carbon present Increasing carbon levels leads to lower ductility and toughness Heat treatment processes such as quenching and tempering can significantly change these properties however Cast Iron is defined as an Iron Carbon alloy with more than 200 but less than 667 carbon Stainless steel is defined as a regular steel alloy with greater than 10 by weight alloying content of chromium Nickel and molybdenum are also found in stainless steels

Other significant metallic alloys are those of aluminium titanium copper and magnesium Copper alloys have been known for a long time while the alloys of the other three metals have been relatively recently developed Due to the chemical reactivity of these metals the electrolytic extraction processes required were only developed relatively recently The alloys of aluminium titanium and magnesium are also known and valued for their high strength to weight ratios and in the case of magnesium their ability to provide electromagnetic shielding These materials are ideal for situations where high strength to weight ratios are more important than bulk cost such as in the aerospace industry and certain automotive engineering applications

Polymers are also an important part of materials science Polymers are the raw materials used to make what we commonly call plastics Plastics are really the final product created after one or more polymers or additives have been added to a resin during processing which is then shaped into a final form Common polymers are include polyethylene polypropylene PVC polystyrene nylons polyesters acrylics polyurethanes and polycarbonates Plastics are generally classified as commodity specialty and engineering plastics

PVC is widely used inexpensive and annual production quantities are large It lends itself to an incredible array of uses from artificial leather to electrical insulation and cabling packaging and containers Its fabrication and processing are simple and well established The versatility of PVC is due to the wide range of plasticisers and other additives that it accepts The term additives in polymer science refers to the chemicals and compounds added to the polymer base to modify its material properties

Polycarbonate would be normally considered an engineering plastic Engineering plastics are valued for their superior strengths and other special material properties They are usually not used for disposable applications unlike commodity plastics

Specialty plastics are materials with unique characteristics such as ultra high strength electrical conductivity electro fluorescence high thermal stability etc

The dividing lines between the various types of plastics is not based on material but rather on their properties and applications For instance polyethylene is a cheap low friction polymer commonly used to make disposable shopping bags and trash bags and is considered a commodity plastic whereas medium density polyethylene is used for underground gas and water pipes and another variety called Ultra high Molecular Weight Polyethylene UHMWPE is an engineering plastic which is used extensively as the glide rails for industrial equipment and the low friction socket in implanted hip joints

Another application of the material sciences is the structures of glass and ceramics typically associated with the most brittle materials Ceramics and glasses use covalent bonds and ionic covalent bonds with SiO2 silica or sand as a fundamental building block Ceramics are as soft as clay and as hard as stone and concrete Usually they are crystalline in form Most glasses contain a metal oxide fused with silica At high temperatures used to prepare glass the material is a viscous liquid Glass forms into an amorphous structure when it is cooled Windowpanes and eyeglasses are important examples Fibers of glass are also available Diamond and carbon in its graphite form are considered to be ceramics 

Engineering ceramics are known for their stiffness high temperature and stability under compression and electrical stress Alumina silica carbide and tungsten carbide are made from a fine powder of their constituents in a process of sintering with a binder Hot pressing provides higher density material Chemical vapor deposition can place a film of a ceramic on another material Cermets are ceramic particles containing some metals The wear resistance of tools is derived from cemented carbides with the metal phase of cobalt and nickel typically added to modify properties

Another application of material science in industry is the making of composite materials Composite materials are structured materials composed of two or more macroscopic phases Applications range from structural elements such as steel reinforced concrete to the thermally insulative tiles which play a key and integral role in National Aeronautics and Space Administrations Space Shuttle thermal protection system which is used to protect the surface of the shuttle from the heat of re entry into the Earths atmosphere One example is Reinforced Carbon Carbon The light gray material which withstands re entry temperatures up to 1510 C and protects the Space Shuttles wing leading edges and nose cap RCC is a laminated composite material made from graphite rayon cloth and impregnated with a phenolic resin After curing at high temperature in an autoclave the laminate is pyrolized to convert the resin to carbon impregnated with furfural alcohol in a vacuum chamber and curedpyrolized to convert the furfural alcohol to carbon In order to provide oxidation resistance for reuse capability the outer layers of the RCC are converted to silicon carbide

Other examples can be seen in the plastic casings of television sets cell phones and similar objects These plastic casings are usually a composite material It is a thermoplastic matrix such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene in which calcium carbonate chalk talc glass fibers or carbon fibers have been added for added strength bulk or electro static dispersion These additions may be referred to as reinforcing fibers or dispersants depending on their purpose

Materials science encompasses various classes of materials each of which may constitute a separate field Materials are sometimes classified by the type of bonding present between the atoms

Some practitioners consider rheology a sub field of materials science because it can cover any material that flows However modern rheology typically deals with non Newtonian fluid dynamics so it is often considered a sub field of continuum mechanics See also granular material

The Logan Medal of the Arts was an arts prize started in 1907 Art Institute of Chicago helped to award the prize From 1917 through 1940 270 awards were given 

The Medal was named for arts patron Frank Granger Logan Logan founded the brokerage house of Logan Bryan He served over 50 years on the board of the Institute He and his wife Josephine Hancock Logan administered the award consistent with their support of the Society for Sanity in Art They founded that Society in 1936 Josephine Logan also wrote a book in 1937 called Sanity in Art The Logans strongly opposed all forms of modern art including cubism surrealism and abstract expressionism

The Thames Barrier is the worlds second largest movable flood barrier after the Oosterscheldekering in the Netherlands It is downstream of central London Its purpose is to prevent London from being flooded by exceptionally high tides and storm surges moving up from the North Sea It is raised only during high tide at ebb tide it is lowered to release the water which backs up behind it

The barriers northern bank is in the London Borough of Newham and its southern bank is in the London Borough of Greenwich The report of Hermann Bondi into the North Sea flood of 1953 affecting parts of the Thames Estuary and parts of London was instrumental in the building of the barrier

London is vulnerable to flooding A storm surge generated by low pressure in the Atlantic Ocean sometimes tracks eastwards past the north of Scotland and may then be driven into the shallow waters of the North Sea The surge tide is funnelled down the North Sea which narrows towards the English Channel and the Thames Estuary If the storm surge coincides with a spring tide dangerously high water levels can occur in the Thames Estuary This situation combined with downstream flows in the Thames tells engineers when to operate the barriers

The threat has increased over time due to the slow but continuous rise in high water level over the centuries and the slow tilting of Britain caused by post glacial rebound

Fourteen people died in the 1928 Thames flood and after 307 people died in the UK in the North Sea Flood of 1953 the issue gained new prominence

Early proposals for a flood control system were stymied by the need for a large opening in the barrier to allow for vessels from London Docks to pass through When containerization replaced older forms of shipping and a new port was opened at Tilbury a smaller barrier became feasible with each of the four main navigation spans being the same width as the opening of Tower Bridge

A Thames Barrier flood defence closure is triggered when high tides are forecast in the North Sea and river flows at the tidal limit at Teddington weir are high If water levels might exceed convert487mft in central London that is a trigger

About 9 hours before a dangerous high tide reaches the barrier closure begins with messages to stop river traffic close subsidiary gates and alert other river users As well as the Thames Barrier the smaller gates along the Thames Tideway must also be closed Once river navigation has been stopped and all subsidiary gates closed then the Thames Barrier itself can be closed The smaller gates are closed first then the main navigable spans in succession The gates remain closed until the tide downstream of the barrier falls to the same level as the water level upstream

After periods of heavy rain west of London floodwater can also flow down the Thames upstream before London Because the river is tidal from Teddington weir all the way through London this is only a problem at high tide which prevents the floodwater from escaping out to sea From Teddington the river is opening out into its estuary and at low tide it can take much greater flow rates the further one goes downstream 

When the river is in flood upstream if the gates are closed shortly after low tide a huge empty volume holds behind the barrier which can act as a reservoir to hold the floodwater coming over Teddington weir Most river floods will not fill this volume in the few hours of the high tide cycle during which the barrier needs to be closed If the barrier was not there the high tide would fill up this volume instead and the floodwater could then spill over the river banks in London About a third of the closures up to 2009 were to alleviate fluvial flooding

In the 1980s there were four closures 35 closures in the 1990s and 75 closures in the first decade of this century The rate of closures is above that predicted and is increasing rapidly

An incident that was potentially catastrophic for London occurred on 27 October 1997 The dredger MV Sand Kite sailing in thick fog collided with one of the Thames Barriers piers As the ship started to sink she dumped her 3300 tonne load of aggregate finally sinking by the bow on top of one of the barriers gates where she lay for several days Initially the gate could not be closed as it was covered in a thick layer of gravel A longer term problem was the premature loss of paint on the flat side of the gate caused by abrasion One estimate of the cost of flooding damage had it occurred was around 13 billion The vessel was refloated in mid November 1997

The barrier was closed twice on 9 November 2007 after a storm surge in the North Sea which was compared to the one in 1953 The main danger of flooding from the surge was on the coast above the Thames Barrier where evacuations took place but the winds abated a little and at the Thames Barrier the 9 November 2007 storm surge did not completely coincide with high tide

The barrier was originally designed to protect London against a big flood level The defence level included long term changes in sea and land levels as understood at that time Despite global warming and a higher predicted rate of sea level rise recent analysis suggested the barrier could last until around 20602070

Released in 2005 a study by four respected academics contained a proposal to reolace the Thames Barrier by a more ambitious 16 km long barrier across the Thames Estuary from Sheerness in Kent to Southend in Essex

Environmental chemistry is the scientific study of the chemical and biochemical phenomena that occur in natural places Environmental chemistry can be defined as the study of the sources reactions transport effects and fates of chemical species in the air soil and water environments and the effect of human activity on these Environmental chemistry is an interdisciplinary science that includes atmospheric aquatic and soil chemistry as well as uses analytical chemistry It is related to environmental and other areas of science It is different from green chemistry which tries to reduce potential pollution at its source

Environmental chemistry starts by understanding how the uncontaminated environment works It identifies the chemicals that are present naturally It studies the concentration and effects of those chemicals Then it accurately study the effects humans have on the environment through the release of chemicals

Environmental chemists draw on a range of concepts from chemistry and various environmental sciences to assist in their study of what is happening to a chemical in the environment Important general concepts from chemistry include understanding chemical reactions and equations solutions units sampling and analytical techniques Chemists study compounds with biological activity such as pheromones

A contaminant is a substance present in nature at a level higher than typical levels or that would not otherwise be there  This may be due to human activity The term contaminant is often used interchangeably with pollutant which is a substance that hurts the surrounding environment While a contaminant is sometimes defined as a substance present in the environment as a result of human activity but without harmful effects it is sometimes the case that toxic or harmful effects from contamination only become apparent at a later date

The medium or organism affected by the pollutant or contaminant is called a receptor A sink is a chemical medium or species that retains and interacts with the pollutant

Chemical measures of water quality include dissolved oxygen chemical oxygen demand biochemical oxygen demand total dissolved solids pH nutrients nitrates and phosphorus heavy metals and pesticides

Environmental chemistry is used by the Environment Agency the Environmental Protection Agency the Association of Public Analysts and other environmental agencies and research bodies around the world to detect and identify the nature and source of pollutants These can include

Quantitative chemical analysis is a key part of environmental chemistry since it provides the data that frame most environmental studies

Common analytical techniques used for quantitative determinations in environmental chemistry include classical wet chemistry such as gravimetric titrimetric and electrochemical methods More sophisticated approaches are used in the determination of trace metals and organic compounds Metals are commonly measured by atomic spectroscopy and mass spectrometry Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry and Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission or Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometric techniques Organic compounds are commonly measured also using mass spectrometric methods such as gas chromatographymass spectrometry and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry Non MS methods using GCs and LCs having universal or specific detectors are still staples in the arsenal of available analytical tools

Other parameters often measured in environmental chemistry are radiochemicals These are pollutants which emit radioactive materials such as alpha and beta particles posing danger to human health and the environment Particle counters and Scintillation counters are most commonly used for these measurements Bioassays and immunoassays are utilized for toxicity evaluations of chemical effects on various organisms

Peer reviewed test methods have been published by government agencies and private research organizations Approved published methods must be used when testing to demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements

Joseph Louis Lagrange was a mathematician and astronomer According to one authority he was the greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century

He lived part of his life in Prussia and part in France He made significant contributions to mathematical analysis from number theory to classical and celestial mechanics 

On the recommendation of Euler and dAlembert in 1766 Lagrange succeeded Euler as the director of mathematics at the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin He stayed there for over twenty years producing a large body of work and winning several prizes of the French Academy of Sciences 

Lagranges treatise on analytical mechanics first published in 1788 was the best treatment of classical mechanics since Newton and helped the development of mathematical physics in the nineteenth century

Lagranges parents were Italian although he also had French ancestors on his fathers side In 1787 at age 51 he moved from Berlin to France and became a member of the French Academy and he remained in France until the end of his life Therefore Lagrange is alternatively considered a French and an Italian scientist 

Lagrange survived the French Revolution and became the first professor of analysis at the cole Polytechnique upon its opening in 1794 Napoleon appointed Lagrange to the Legion of Honour and made him a Count of the Empire in 1808 Lagrange is buried in the Panthon and his name appears as one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower

The Founding Fathers refers to men who lived during the American Revolutionary War era These men signed the Declaration of Independence helped write the Constitution of the United States or helped win the American Revolutionary War Many of these men were members of the Continental Congress at some point The term was first applied to these people in 1916

There were many people who were Founding Fathers The term often refers to people such as George Washington John Adams Thomas Jefferson Benjamin Franklin Alexander Hamilton and James Madison

Most of the Founding Fathers were large landowners or rich merchants Some of them owned slaves After the Constitution many of the Founding Fathers became leaders in the federal government

CNDO is the short cut for Complete Neglect of Differential Overlap It is both 1 a method for learning key facts about molecular orbitals as well as 2 the name of a particular set of computer programs CNDO is based on quantum chemistry It is one of the first semi empirical quantum chemistry methods It uses two approximations

CNDO builds a mathematical model of a molecule CNDO starts with the position of the positively charged nuclei of the atoms and the negatively charged electron clouds surrounding them Quantum chemistry tells the model the probability distribution of electron locations based on atomic orbitals From this information CNDO computes data about the resulting molecular orbitals

CNDO2 is the main version of CNDO John Pople and coworkers first wrote CNDO2

The Extended Huckel method was an earlier method for calculating molecular orbitals and the electronic energy It explicitly ignores the mathematical equations that show that electrons repel each other CNDO1 and CNDO2 were developed from the Extended Huckel method by explicitly including the electron electron repulsion terms But CNDO leaves out many of repulsion terms approximates some of others and fits others to experimental data from spectroscopy

Quantum mechanics provides equations based on the Hartree Fock method and the Roothaan equations that CNDO uses to model atoms and their locations These equations are solved over and over to the point where the results do not vary significantly between two repetitions CNDO does not involve knowledge about chemical bonds but instead uses knowledge about quantum wavefunctions

CNDO can be used for closed shell molecules where the electrons are fully paired in molecular orbitals CNDO can also be used for open shell molecules which are radicals with unpaired electrons

Chemists find that CNDO gives results that match experimental data about partial atomic charges and dipole moments CNDO calculates total energy and binding energy CNDO computer software reports the Eigenvalues for calculating the highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital

Selena is a biographical drama movie It was released on March 21 1997 by Warner Bros Gregory Nava was the director and the screenwriter The movie is about the singer Selena She was murdered at age 23 by her friend an ex employee of her clothing stores The movie also describes how Selena started in the music business and her familys problems Jennifer Lopez starred as Selena and many music critics believe this movie made her famous Selena was produced by Abraham Quintanilla Jr Moctesuma Esparza and Robert Katz 

Lopez was given 1 million for her role as Selena making her the highest paid Hispanic woman ever The movie soundtrack contained two unreleased songs two tribute songs and two melodies It debuted at number seven on the US Billboard 200 chart and was certified platinum for shipments of 1000000 copies in the United States

The movie makers had a budget of 20 million to make this movie They filmed the movie in Corpus Christi San Antonio and Houston Texas Over 35000 fans participated in the Houston Astrodome scene The movie made 15599598 on its first week the number one movie for that week In total it made 35281794 in 101 days Selena had mostly good reviews from critics though many thought the movie did not tell the true story of Selena The movie won several ALMA Awards and Imagen Foundation Awards It was nominated for a Golden Globe MTV Movie Awards and a Young Artist Award

The movie starts with Selena getting ready for her Houston Astrodome concert The date is February 26 1995 After her performance the movie goes back in time to 1961 where Abraham Quintanilla Jr and his band Los Dinos are at band practice They are then ask to see a promoter in the other side of town Los Dinos are then discriminated for being Americans of Mexican decent Abraham rips the check the club promoter gave them for showing up Los Dinos then performs at a Spanish nightclub and are booed off stage by their own kind for not knowing any Spanish language songs The police drive Los Dinos away The movie goes forward in time to 1981 Abraham had quit his dreams of becoming a music star and began supporting and helping his family After work Abraham sat down on his chair and began playing the guitar His youngest child Selena was playing a football game in the backyard She then notices her father and was curious to know what he was doing She then starts to sing in front of her father Abraham is amazed and starts a family band He named it Selena y Los Dinos He put AB Quintanilla III on base and Suzette Quintanilla on drums Selena became the lead singer of the group 

Abraham had to force his children to perform His kids only wanted to play outside and did not want to sing While Abraham is laying down on his bed he tells Marcella Samora about opening a Mexican restaurant The next day Abraham built the restaurant On opening night Selena y Los Dinos performed Somewhere Over The Rainbow Abraham had to quit his job in order to be there This made Marcella upset because she feared that her dream of raising her children in a house will not happen Abraham started to teach Selena how to sing in Spanish after a guest from the restaurant told Abraham that he could make a lot of money Selena did not like the idea of singing in Spanish Abraham told her that she should sing from her heart Selena then agreed to the lesson After this the family became bankrupt because of the 1982 recession They lost their home and moved to Corpus Christi Texas The children were sad that they had to leave their friends behind Abraham started calling people to book Selena y Los Dinos and found someone who would allowed them to perform at a festival The crowd booed Selena off stage which made her feel bad about herself and had wanted to quit music Abraham then sat down with his children and Marcella near the ocean and gave them a positive speech Marcella then taught Selena how to dance the Cumbia to make her feel better 

The movie is now set in 1989 where Selena is performing at a Houston Texas festival as an adult While performing she takes off her jacket and exposed her bra to the crowd This made Abraham very upset and told her that she will never do it again Selena then talks to her father and told him that it was a style Abraham then told her that she can only have her jacket open A year later Selena began talking to her cousin about her dreams of becoming a fashion designer Suzette then tells them that a Rock guitarist is in their kitchen Selena and her cousin races to the kitchen They stood behind the door to see Chris Perez audition in front of Abraham Abraham then tells AB that he does not like Chris However AB tries to tell Abraham that he will change his style and look Suzette and Selenas cousin were asked to cut his hair and his ankle bracelets The next day Selena asks Chris for some pizza After this Selenas song Como La Flor peaks at number one on the Hot Latin Tracks charts which makes the group come together and celebrate Selena is then asked to perform in Mexico where 50000 fans are waiting on her to sing Selena comes out to perform La Carcacha However the crowd becomes very excited and starts pushing people inside of the stage This made police to get involved Selena is then asked by her father to calm down the crowd She performs a slow version of Como La Flor and calms everyone down After her performance she and Chris walks on a pier Selena confess that she was scared for the first time while Chris confesses that he likes Selena

While on the bus Abraham found out that Chris likes Selena He stopped the bus and told everyone to get off except Selena Chris Suzette AB and Marcella Abraham tells Chris and Selena that their relationship is over They do not agree which made Abraham upset He then fires Chris and orders him to leave Selena tries to run after him however her father told her that if she did that he will disband the group Selena is then crying on her mothers lap After this Selena and Chris begin to meet secretly and eloped Radio stations in Texas told everyone that Selena had gotten married Selena went by her fathers house the next day to give him time to cool off Abraham burst into tears and told Selena that he was sorry He then accepted Chris into the family Later Selena wins a Grammy Award and opened her boutiques She then hires Yolanda Saldivar as the manager Yolanda begins to steal money from the fan club and boutiques After this Selena starts recording songs for her crossover album 

Abraham later finds out that Yolanda was stealing money and holds a meeting to hear Yolandas side Yolanda tells Abraham that she will prove her innocence Later that night Selena performs Si Una Vez at the Houston Astrodome on February 26 1995 After that night Selena asks her mother to scratch her scale and that she and Chris are thinking of having children and starting a family While Selena lays on her mothers lap she ask her mother if anyone would like her in the pop world Her mother says yes and tells her to go to sleep Selena then dreams of the crossover tour and sings Dreaming of You After Selena sings the opening of the song a rose is thrown at Selena Selena is then seen being rushed to the hospital while reporters tell everyone that Selena was shot In the next scene a doctor walks towards Selenas parents slowly He tells them that Selena has died Selenas family begin to cry and hold each other in disbelief Dreaming of You is played again while her fans are seen holding pictures of her during a candlelight vigil The movie ends with a picture of Selena waving goodbye reading April 16 1971 March 31 1995

The characters and their roles in Selena are as follows

Selenas family wanted to make a movie about Selenas life They searched Hollywood California for movie producers Abraham then contacted Moctesuma Esparza and Robert Katz They chose Gregory Nava as the movie director Abraham told Esparza and Katz that he did not like Nava because of his ego The two producers told Abraham that everyone in Hollywood had an ego problem They also told him that Nava was the right guy

Nava spent almost one month with the Quintanilla family He wrote down everything that the family said about Selena By the fifth week Nava had written the movie and showed Abraham the draft Abraham was not happy he did not want Selenas fans to think that eloping was a right thing to do He also did not like the conflict between his character and Chris Perez Nava responded that the information was life events and that even though he may seem a bad guy in the movie his actions after the marriage would make people see him differently Abraham agreed and allowed the two stories in the movie Salma Hayek was originally asked to play the role of Selena in the movie but she turned it down She felt that it was too early to base a movie on Selena and that it would be too emotional since Selenas death was still being covered on national television 

Filming took place in Corpus Christi San Antonio and Houston Texas from May to October 1996 Nava posted fliers in Texas asking Selena fans to attend the Houston Astrodome scene News of this event spread throughout the United States and Mexico Over 35000 people attended some coming from as far as Japan and South America It took over 3 hours to put makeup on everyone who attended Producing the Astrodome scene cost about 2 million The budget of the movie was 20 million

The movies trailer was released worldwide in December 1996 Nava spent 1 million on promotions for Selena 

The soundtrack of the movie was released on March 11 1997 by EMI Latin The soundtrack included two songs that Selena did not release when she was alive Is It the Beat and Where Did the Feeling Go It included two medleys Disco Medley and the Cumbia Medley which are live versions Selena sang during her Houston Astrodome concert Two tribute songs were also in the album Viviras Selena which includes Tejano musicians and a tribute to Selena by the Barrio Boyzz and One More Time which was composed by Olmos and performed by LilRay The Oldies Medley was performed by the Vidal Brothers The soundtrack peaked at number seven on the US Billboard 200 chart and number 36 on RPM It was later certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipments of 1000000 copies in the United States The album was produced by Selenas brother Quintanilla III

Chuck Eddy of Entertainment Weekly gave the soundtrack an A rating and stated that the soundtrack had everything a right posthumous album should have Eddy also stated that listening to the album reveals why Selenas death impacted many Americans Enrique Lopetegui of the Los Angeles Times wrote that One More Time was a corny but effective tribute to Selena Lopetegui commented that Viviras Selena was the weakest track of the album and that Is It the Beat was one of the best songs of Selena He believed that Where Did the Feeling Go was one of the strongest Lopetegui also stated that Where Did the Feeling Go was similar to Vision of Love which was recorded by Mariah Carey Lopetegui compared Is It the Beat to the song I Wanna Dance With Somebody by Whitney Houston which had similar beats and sounds An Miami Herald writer believed the soundtrack was uneven and stated that Selenas unreleased recordings outshine the rest of the songs on the album A score was released in the summer of 1997 and had music by Dave Grusin

Before the movie was released Selena fans were not happy that a Puerto Rican would play the part of a Mexican American singer Many fans changed their views on Lopez after the Houston Astrodome scene was done filming The movie opened in 1850 theaters worldwide Selena was released on March 21 1997 and grossed 11615722 making it the second highest debut for that week It grossed 15599598 during its first week and became the number one movie for that week The next week the movie grossed 24285142 In total Selena grossed 35281794 It became the first and only movie directed by Nava to reach the 30 millionth mark Selena was in theaters for 101 days and Lopezs portrayal of Selena became the breakthrough role for her career She became very popular after the movie was released

Selena was released on VHS and DVD in fall 1997 On September 18 2007 Warner Bros released a 10th anniversary of the movie It featured unreleased behind the scenes and extras

The movie had mostly positive feedback from critics Enrique Fernandez of the Sun Sentinel wrote that Nava did a great job in catching the audience with Selena Fernandez also stated that Lopez had a terrific characterization of Selena Ernesto Portillo Jr of The San Diego Union Tribune believed that the movie may have helped Selena fulfill her crossover dreams Portillo also believed that Selena might not make other Hollywood directors create more Latino themed movies Steve Persall of the St Petersburg Times believed that Nava did not do a good job in retelling Selenas murder Persall believed Nava was under pressure by Selenas family and fans to tell a more fairy tail movie then a real life event Daisann McLane of Sun Sentinel agreed that the movie was more of a fairy tail and that the movie is the familys version of the story McLane believed that Selena lied about Selenas real life Stuart Elliott of Austin American Statesmen wrote that Selena became a breakthrough success in Selenas career Elliott believed that Nava had perfected every scene and that female Hispanics in America can relate to the conflicts and the climax of the story

Selena VIVE was a tribute concert that was held on April 7 2005 It was held a week after the 10th anniversary of Selenas death Over 65000 fans attended the concert which featured high profile artists

Selena VIVE is the highest rated and most viewed Spanish language show in American television history The show which lasted over three hours scored a 359 Nielsen household rating

The Grignard reaction is an organometallic chemical reaction in which alkyl or aryl magnesium halides attack electrophilic carbon atoms that are present within polar bonds Grignard reagents act as nucleophiles The Grignard reaction produces a carboncarbon bond It alters hybridization about the reaction center The Grignard reaction is an important tool in the formation of carboncarbon bonds It also can form carbonphosphorus carbontin carbonsilicon carbonboron and other carbonheteroatom bonds

It is a nucleophilic organometallic addition reaction The high pKa value of the alkyl component makes the reaction irreversible Grignard reactions are not ionic The Grignard reagent exists as an organometallic cluster 

The disadvantage of Grignard reagents is that they readily react with protic solvents or with functional groups with acidic protons such as alcohols and amines Atmospheric humidity can alter the yield of making a Grignard reagent from magnesium turnings and an alkyl halide One of many methods used to exclude water from the reaction atmosphere is to flame dry the reaction vessel to evaporate all moisture which is then sealed to prevent moisture from returning Chemists then use ultrasound to activate the surface of the magnesium so that it consumes any water present This can allow Grignard reagents to form with less sensitivity to water being present

Another disadvantage of Grignard reagents is that they do not readily form carboncarbon bonds by reacting with alkyl halides by an SN2 mechanism

Franois Auguste Victor Grignard discovered Grignard reactions and reagents They are named after this French chemist who was awarded the 1912 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this work

The addition of the Grignard reagent to a carbonyl typically proceeds through a six membered ring transition state

However with steric hindered Grignard reagents the reaction may proceed by single electron transfer

Grignard reactions will not work if water is present water causes the reagent to rapidly decompose So most Grignard reactions occur in solvents such as anhydrous diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran because the oxygen in these solvents stabilizes the magnesium reagent The reagent may also react with oxygen present in the atmosphere This will insert an oxygen atom between the carbon base and the magnesium halide group Usually this side reaction may be limited by the volatile solvent vapors displacing air above the reaction mixture However chemists may perform the reactions in nitrogen or argon atmospheres In small scale reactions the solvent vapors do not have enough space to protect the magnesium from oxygen

Grignard reagents are formed by the action of an alkyl or aryl halide on magnesium metal The reaction is conducted by adding the organic halide to a suspension of magnesium in an ether which provides ligands required to stabilize the organomagnesium compound Typical solvents are diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran Oxygen and protic solvents such as water or alcohols are not compatible with Grignard reagents The reaction proceeds through single electron transfer  

Grignard reactions often start slowly First there is an induction period during which reactive magnesium becomes exposed to the organic reagents After this induction period the reactions can be highly exothermic Alkyl and aryl bromides and iodides are common substrates Chlorides are also used but fluorides are generally unreactive except with specially activated magnesium such as Rieke magnesium

Many Grignard reagents such as methylmagnesium chloride phenylmagnesium bromide and allylmagnesium bromide are available commercially in tetrahydrofuran or diethyl ether solutions

Using the Schlenk equilibrium Grignard reagents form varying amounts of diorganomagnesium compounds

Many methods have been developed to initiate Grignard reactions that are slow to start These methods weaken the layer of MgO that covers the magnesium They expose the magnesium to the organic halide to start the reaction that makes the Grignard reagent

Mechanical methods include crushing of the Mg pieces in situ rapid stirring or using ultrasound of the suspension Iodine methyl iodide and 12 dibromoethane are commonly employed activating agents Chemists use 12 dibromoethane because its action can be monitored by the observation of bubbles of ethylene Also the side products are innocuous

The amount of Mg consumed by these activating agents is usually insignificant

The addition of a small amount of mercuric chloride will amalgamate the surface of the metal allowing it to react

Grignard reagents are produced in industry for use in place or for sale As with at bench scale the main problem is that of initiation A portion of a previous batch of Grignard reagent is often used as the initiator Grignard reactions are exothermic this exothermicity must be considered when a reaction is scaled up from laboratory to production plant

Grignard reagents will react with a variety of carbonyl derivatives

The most common application is for alkylation of aldehydes and ketones as in this example

Note that the acetal function does not react 

Such reactions usually involve a water based acidic workup though this is rarely shown in reaction schemes In cases where the Grignard reagent is adding to a prochiral aldehyde or ketone the Felkin Anh model or Crams Rule can usually predict which stereoisomer will form

In addition Grignard reagents will react with electrophiles 

Another example is making salicylaldehyde First bromoethane reacts with Mg in ether Second phenol in THF converts the phenol into Ar OMgBr Third benzene is added in the presense of paraformaldehyde powder and triethylamine Fourth the mixture is distilled to remove the solvents Next 10 HCl is added Salicylaldehyde will be the major product as long as everything is very dry and under inert conditions The reaction works also with iodoethane instead of bromoethane

The Grignard reagent is very useful for forming carbonheteroatom bonds

A Grignard reagent can also be involved in coupling reactions For example nonylmagnesium bromide reacts with methyl p chlorobenzoate to give p nonylbenzoic acid in the presence of Trisiron often symbolized as Fe3 after workup with NaOH to hydrolyze the ester shown as follows Without the Fe3 the Grignard reagent would attack the ester group over the aryl halide

For the coupling of aryl halides with aryl Grignards nickel chloride in tetrahydrofuran is also a good catalyst Additionally an effective catalyst for the couplings of alkyl halides is dilithium tetrachlorocuprate prepared by mixing lithium chloride and copper chloride in THF The Kumada Corriu coupling gives access to substituted styrenes

The oxidation of a Grignard reagent with oxygen takes place through a radical intermediate to a magnesium hydroperoxide Hydrolysis of this complex yields hydroperoxides and reduction with an additional equivalent of Grignard reagent gives an alcohol

A reaction of Grignards with oxygen in presence of an alkene makes an ethylene extended alcohol These are useful in synthesizing larger compounds This modification requires aryl or vinyl Grignard reagents Adding just the Grignard and the alkene does not result in a reaction showing that the presence of oxygen is essential The only drawback is the requirement of at least two equivalents of Grignard reagent in the reaction This can addressed by using a dual Grignard system with a cheap reducing Grignard reagent such as n butylmagnesium bromide

Grignard reagents are nucleophiles in nucleophilic aliphatic substitutions for instance with alkyl halides in a key step in industrial Naproxen production

In the Boord olefin synthesis the addition of magnesium to certain haloethers results in an elimination reaction to the alkene This reaction can limit the utility of Grignard reactions

Grignard degradation at one time was a tool in structure identification in which a Grignard RMgBr formed from a heteroaryl bromide HetBr reacts with water to Het H and MgBrOH This hydrolysis method allows the determination of the number of halogen atoms in an organic compound In modern usage Grignard degradation is used in the chemical analysis of certain triacylglycerols

An example of the Grignard reaction is a key step in the industrial production of Tamoxifen

The Giant Magellan Telescope will be the worlds largest telescope when it is completed in 2018 Instead of one large mirror the GMT will have seven separate mirrors working together This will mean its collecting area is bigger than the actual mirror surfaces It will be made of seven convert84mft1abbron diameter mirror parts It will have a the resolving power of a convert245mft1abbron mirror Its collecting area will be the same as a convert214mft1abbron mirror The telescope will have over four times the ability to gather light than existing telescopes It will produce images up to ten times clearer than the Hubble Space Telescope It will cost 700 million

The location of the telescope is the Las Campanas Observatory which is also the site of the Magellan Telescopes some convert115kmmi0abbron northeast of La Serena Chile This area has clear weather for most of the year The night sky in most of the surrounding Atacama Desert region is free from atmospheric pollution With few cities nearby this is probably one of the places least affected by light pollution All of this makes the area one of the best spots on Earth for long term astronomical observation

The telescope is unique because it will use seven mirror segments each convert84mft1abbron in diameter These segments will then be arranged to form a single optical surface This is difficult as the surface of the outer six mirror segments is not radially symmetrical This requires a small change in the way mirrors are usually polished All seven mirrors will be arranged so that the reflecting surface of each of them is on a common axis One mirror will be in the center and the other six arranged symmetrically around the center A focal plane will be on axis with the entire assembly The plan is to build seven identical off axis mirrors The spare mirror has been made to replace a mirror when it needs recoating a 12 week process required every 12 years

The Steward Observatory at the University of Arizona is making the mirrors in a laboratory beneath the universitys football stadium It is using a rotating furnace to make the mirror The casting of the first mirror was completed on November 3 2005 But the time consuming shaping and polishing will be completed in the autumn of 2011

The telescope will make use of adaptive optics

The following is a list of the group which is developing the telescope

George P Mitchell founder of Mitchell Energy Development Corp and The Cynthia and George Mitchell Foundation are giving 25 million to help pay for the telescope

Only 349 Ferrari F50s were made This was because Ferrari thought that they could not sell very many The last F50 was produced in Maranello Italy in July 1997

The Ferrari F50 can travel at over 200 miles per hour

Note parent peak corresponding to molecular mass M 92 and highest peak at M 1 91 A mass spectrum is an intensity versus mz plot that represents a chemical analysis The mass spectrum of a sample is a pattern representing the distribution of ions by mass in a sample It is a histogram usually made using an instrument called a mass spectrometer Not all mass spectra of a given substance are the same It can depend on the operating conditions of the instrument For example some mass spectrometers break the analyte molecules into many pieces others observe the intact molecular masses with little fragmentation A mass spectrum can represent many different types of information based on the type of mass spectrometer and the specific experiment however all plots of intensity vs mass to charge are called mass spectra

Common fragmentation processes for organic molecules are the McLafferty rearrangement and alpha cleavage

In the past chemists with PhD degrees were needed to interpret mass spectra Today computer programs read the data and identify the compounds in a sample

The SN2 reaction is a substitution reaction in organic chemistry It is a type of nucleophilic substitution where a lone pair from a nucleophile attacks an electron deficient electrophilic center and bonds to it This expells another group called a leaving group So the incoming group replaces the leaving group in one step Since two reacting species are involved in the slow rate determining step of the reaction this leads to the name bimolecular nucleophilic substitution or SN2 Among inorganic chemists the SN2 reaction is often known as the interchange mechanism

The reaction most often occurs at an aliphatic sp3 carbon center with an electronegative stable leaving group attached to it  X  frequently a halide atom The breaking of the C X bond and the formation of the new C Nu bond occur simultaneously to form a transition state in which the carbon under nucleophilic attack is pentacoordinate and approximately sp2 hybridized The nucleophile attacks the carbon at 180 to the leaving group since this provides the best overlap between the nucleophiles lone pair and the C X antibonding orbital The leaving group is then pushed off the opposite side and the product is formed

If the substrate under nucleophilic attack is chiral this can lead although not necessarily to an inversion of stereochemistry called the Walden inversion

In an example of the SN2 reaction the attack of OH on a bromoethane results in ethanol with bromide ejected as the leaving group

A SN2 reaction occurs if the backside route of attack is not blocked by other atoms in the molecule So this mechanism usually occurs at an unhindered primary carbon center If there is steric crowding on the substrate near the leaving group such as at a tertiary carbon center the substitution will use an SN1 rather than an SN2 mechanism

In coordination chemistry associative substitution proceeds by a similar mechanism as SN2

Four factors affect the rate of the reaction

The rate of an SN2 reaction is second order as the rate determining step depends on the nucleophile concentration Nu as well as the concentration of substrate RX

This is a key difference between the SN1 and SN2 mechanisms In the SN1 reaction the nucleophile attacks after the rate limiting step is over But in a SN2 reaction the nucleophile forces off the leaving group in the limiting step In other words the rate of SN1 reactions depend only on the concentration of the substrate while the SN2 reaction rate depends on the concentration of both the substrate and nucleophile In cases where both mechanisms are possible the mechanism depends on solvent temperature concentration of the nucleophile or on the leaving group

SN2 reactions are generally favored in primary alkyl halides or secondary alkyl halides with an aprotic solvent They occur at a negligible rate in tertiary alkyl halides due to steric hindrance

SN2 and SN1 are two extremes of a sliding scale of reactions It is possible to find many reactions which exhibit both SN2 and SN1 character in their mechanisms For instance it is possible to get a contact ion pairs formed from an alkyl halide in which the ions are not fully separated When these undergo substitution the stereochemistry will be inverted for many of the reacting molecules but a few may show retention of configuration SN2 reactions are more common than SN1 reactions

A common side reaction taking place with SN2 reactions is E2 elimination the incoming anion can act as a base rather than as a nucleophile removing a proton and leading to formation of the alkene This effect can be demonstrated in the gas phase reaction between a sulfonate and a simple alkyl bromide taking place inside a mass spectrometer

With ethyl bromide the reaction product is predominantly the substitution product As steric hindrance around the electrophilic center increases as with isobutyl bromide substitution is disfavored and elimination is the predominant reaction Other factors favoring elimination are the strength of the base With the less basic benzoate substrate isopropyl bromide reacts with 55 substitution In general gas phase reactions and solution phase reactions of this type follow the same trends even though in the first solvent effects are dropped

A development attracting attention in 2008 concerns a SN2 roundabout mechanism observed in a gas phase reaction between chloride ions and methyl iodide with a special technique called crossed molecular beam imaging When the chloride ions have sufficient velocity the energy of the resulting iodide ions after the collision is much lower than expected and it is theorized that energy is lost as a result of a full roundabout of the methyl group around the iodine atom before the actual displacement takes place

The SN1 reaction is a substitution reaction in organic chemistry SN stands for nucleophilic substitution and the 1 represents the fact that the rate determining step involves only one molecule The reaction involves a carbocation intermediate Some common SN1 reactions are of secondary or tertiary alkyl halides under strongly basic conditions or under strongly acidic conditions with secondary or tertiary alcohols With primary alkyl halides the alternative SN2 reaction occurs Among inorganic chemists the SN1 reaction is often known as the dissociative mechanism Christopher Ingold et al first proposed the reaction mechanism in 1940

An example of a reaction taking place with an SN1 reaction mechanism is the hydrolysis of tert butyl bromide with water to form tert butyl alcohol

This SN1 reaction takes place in three steps

Because the first step is the bottleneck or rate determining step chemists classify the entire reaction mechanism as SN1 Only one molecule is needed for that step

Sometimes a molecule can react using either an SN1 or an SN2 mechanism The SN1 mechanism will win this competition when the central carbon atom is surrounded by bulky groups because such groups sterically hinder the SN2 reaction Additionally bulky substituents on the central carbon increase the rate of carbocation formation because of the relief of steric strain that occurs The resultant carbocation is also stabilized by both inductive stabilization and hyperconjugation from attached alkyl groups The Hammond Leffler postulate says that this too will increase the rate of carbocation formation The SN1 mechanism therefore dominates in reactions at tertiary alkyl centers and is further observed at secondary alkyl centers in the presence of weak nucleophiles

An example of a reaction proceeding in a SN1 way is the synthesis of 25 dichloro 25 dimethylhexane from the corresponding diol with concentrated hydrochloric acid

As the alpha and beta substitutions increase with respect to leaving groups the reaction is diverted from SN2 to SN1

The carbocation intermediate formed in the reactions rate limiting step is an sp2 hybridized carbon with trigonal planar molecular geometry This allows two different paths for the nucleophilic attack one on either side of the planar molecule If neither path is preferentially favored these two paths will be used equally yielding a racemic mix of enantiomers if the reaction takes place at a stereocenter This is illustrated below in the SN1 reaction of S 3 chloro 3 methylhexane with an iodide ion which yields a racemic mixture of 3 iodo 3 methylhexane

However an excess of one stereoisomer can be observed as the leaving group can remain close to the carbocation intermediate for a short time and block nucleophilic attack This is very different than the SN2 mechanism which does not mix the stereochemistry of the product The SN2 mechanism always inverts the molecules stereochemistry

Two common side reactions are elimination reactions and carbocation rearrangement  If the reaction is performed under warm or hot conditions E1 elimination is likely to predominate leading to formation of an alkene At lower temperatures SN1 and E1 reactions are competitive reactions So it becomes difficult to favor one over the other Even if the reaction is performed cold some alkene may be formed If an attempt is made to perform an SN1 reaction using a strongly basic nucleophile such as hydroxide or methoxide ion the alkene will again be formed this time via an E2 elimination This will be especially true if the reaction is heated Finally if the carbocation intermediate can rearrange to a more stable carbocation it will give a product derived from the more stable carbocation rather than the simple substitution product

Solvents will change the reaction rate Since the SN1 reaction involves formation of an unstable carbocation intermediate in the rate determining step anything that can help this will speed up the reaction The normal solvents of choice are both polar and protic Typical polar protic solvents include water and alcohols which will also act as nucleophiles

Maria Giuseppina was engaged to the French Prince Louis Stanislas of France He was known as the Count of Provence They were married on 16 April 1771 by proxy in the Turin They were married in person on 14 May 1771 at the Palace of Versailles A luxurious ball followed the wedding on 20 May She was considered to be ugly Louis Stanislas hated his wife We know today that these rumors were created by those who supported Marie Antoinette as a rivalry soon emerged after the youngest brother comte dArtois married the Comtesses sister thereby bringing yet another Savoyard princess to Versailles and creating an Italian party at court 

In France she was known as Marie Josphine de Savoie She had a high rank at court as her husband was a grandson of the reiging king She was a cousin of the ill fated Princess of Lamballe who was instrumental in the arrangement of the marriage At the death of her husbands grandfather Louis XV in 1774 her brother in law succeeded as Louis XVI She became pregnant in 1774 and 1781 but both pregnancies ended in miscarriage In 1791 Marie Josphine went to Germany During the period of exile the Count and Countess fought constantly Some historians have suggested Marie Josphines possible lesbian relationship with a lady in waiting as the primary cause for discord between the couple

Marie Josphine died of an edema at Hartwell House English residence of the exiled French royal family Marie Josphine was laid to rest in the Lady Chapel of Westminster Abbey Her body was removed a year later on Louiss orders and buried in the Kingdom of Sardinia today in Cagliari Cathedral

Islam is the religion of the majority of the Palestinian population residing in the Palestinian territories with Muslims comprising 75 of the population of the West Bank and 99 of the population of the Gaza Strip

Jerusalem is Islams third holiest city after Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia The Haram al Sharif of Jerusalem is believed by Muslims to be the location from which Muhammad ascended to Jannah there is no mention of Jerusalem in the Koran however

This widely accepted Islamic belief raises the religious and spiritual importance to them of the Dome of the Rock and the adjacent al Aqsa Mosque Muslims are sensitive to and mindful of the circumstance that two mosques along with the rest of East Jerusalem are claimed and illegally occupied by the state of Israel

Specific impulse is a way to describe how well a rocket performs It is also used to describe how well a jet engine performs It can be used to compare rockets of different sizes It is a way to know how much force a given engine makes for each bit of fuel To do this one needs to know how much fuel is in the engine A high specific impulse means that a rocket needs less fuel to perform as well If the specific impulse is lower it means that the rocket needs more fuel to perform as well 

Specific impulse is a useful value to compare rocket or jet engines It is used much like miles per gallon or litres per 100 kilometres is used to compare cars An engine with a higher specific impulse uses fuel better This means that the same amount of fuel lets the rocket go farther 

There are two ways people find the number for specific impulse To find the specific impulse one divides the impulse by the amount of fuel Impulse is a measurement of how much force a rocket motor makes and for how long A motor that makes a low force for a long time can sometimes have a higher impulse than a motor that makes a high force for a short time Impulse is measured in Newtons times seconds The amount of fuel used to find specific impulse can be measured in different ways It is sometimes measured in mass and sometimes in weight When the amount of fuel is measured in mass the specific impulse is expressed as a speed This is usually in meters per second When specific impulse is measured as a speed it has another name It is also called the effective exhaust velocity The other way to measure the amount of fuel is weight If weight is used the specific impulse is in units of time When it is time it is usually said in seconds These two ways are both common They both compare the performance of engines

When the specific impulse is higher less fuel is needed to make the rocket perform at a certain level So a fuel is more efficient if the specific impulse is higher

Be careful not to confuse thrust and specific impulse Thrust is only the force made by a rocket at one point in time Specific impulse is a measure of the force based on how much fuel there is

When people find specific impulse the only fuel counted is in the rocket motor before it gets fired This includes the fuel and the oxidizer 

Jet engines use fuel better than rocket engines This is because the gases do not escape as fast Because they do not escape as fast the exhaust does not carry away as much energy This means that the jet engine uses a lot less energy to push the jet It is also because the air that goes through the engine as the jet flies through the air helps the fuel to burn faster

Specific impulse is also used to describe how well model rocket motors work In the table below are some of Estes claimed values for specific impulses for several of their rocket motors Estes Industries is a large well known American seller of model rockets and rocket parts The specific impulse for model rocket motors is much lower than for many other rocket motors because the black powder is used as a fuel Black powder is used in model rocket motors because it costs less 

Here are some example numbers for larger rocket engines

The most common way to measure specific impulse today uses seconds This is used both in the SI world as well as where English units are used This way the units are identical everywhere This means specific impulse can be used to compare engine performance in any country Most companies that make rocket motors or jet engines use seconds to advertise their products performance

The other common way to measure specific impulse is in meters per second which is also called effective exhaust velocity For many engines the effective exhaust velocity is different from the speed that the gases actually come out of the nozzle

The Turing Award is kind of like a Nobel Prize but it is given only to people in computer science It is named after a famous man named Alan Turing who made computer science better by inventing the Turing machine and the Turing test 

The first Turing Award was given in 1966 to Alan Perlis a teacher at Carnegie Mellon University It has been given every year since In 2006 it was given to a woman for the first time Her name was Frances Allen

In organic chemistry the structures of some rings of atoms are unexpectedly stable Aromaticity is special chemical stability found in a conjugated ring of unsaturated bonds lone pairs or empty orbitals This stability is stronger than would be expected for the stability from alternating single and double bond alone It can also be considered a result of cyclic delocalization and of resonance Aromatic compounds play key roles in the biochemistry of all living things

Benzene is the most simple molecule with aromaticity All six carbon atoms in the ring are on the same flat plane To account for all the bonds on a six carbon ring there must be alternating double carbon bonds

If benzene had three double bonds three sides of its ring would be shorter than the other three sides But X ray diffraction shows that all of six carbon carbon bonds in benzene are of the same length of 140 picometres The CC bond lengths are greater than a double bond but shorter than a single bond This intermediate distance is consistent with electron delocalization the electrons for CC bonding are distributed equally between each of the six carbon atoms The molecule is planar One representation is that the structure exists as a superposition of so called resonance structures rather than either form individually The delocalization of electrons is one explanation for the thermodynamic stability of benzene and related aromatic compounds To indicate the delocalized nature of the bonding benzene is often depicted with a circle inside a hexagonal arrangement of carbon atoms

As is common in organic chemistry the carbon atoms in the diagram above have been left unlabeled Realizing each carbon has 2p electrons each carbon donates an electron into the delocalized ring above and below the benzene ring It is the overlap of p orbitals both above and below the ring that produces the pi clouds

In 1986 some chemists disputed the delocalized view of benzene in an article published in the journal Nature They showed that the electrons in benzene are almost certainly localized to particular carbon atoms They showed the aromatic properties of benzene come from spin coupling rather than electron delocalization Other scientists wrote articles to support this view in Nature in 1987 But chemists are slow to switch from the delocalized electrons view

As is standard for resonance diagrams a double headed arrow is used to indicate that the two structures are not distinct entities but merely hypothetical possibilities Neither is an accurate representation of the actual compound which is best represented by a hybrid of these structures which can be seen at right A CC bond is shorter than a CC bond but benzene is perfectly hexagonalall six carbon carbon bonds have the same length intermediate between that of a single and that of a double bond

A better representation is that of the circular bond in which the electron density is evenly distributed through a bond above and below the ring This model more correctly represents the location of electron density within the aromatic ring

The single bonds are formed with electrons in line between the carbon nucleithese are called bonds Double bonds consist of both a bond and a bond The bonds are formed from overlap of atomic p orbitals above and below the plane of the ring The following diagram shows the positions of these p orbitals

Since they are out of the plane of the atoms these orbitals can interact with each other freely Some chemists call this delocalized while other chemists say that the spin of the electrons in the neighboring p orbitals become coupled The resulting molecular orbital has symmetry

The spin of the electron orbitals in a ring can only be completely coupled if the number of pi electrons are an even number that is not a multiple of four If the number of electrons are a multiple of four the ring molecule is antiaromatic and the electrons cannot spin couple with their neighbors This is known as Hckels Rule 

As a result of this theory chemists have the following criteria for a molecule being aromatic

In contrast molecules with 4n pi electrons are antiaromatic

The first known use of the word aromatic as a chemical termnamely to apply to compounds that contain the phenyl radicaloccurs in an article by August Wilhelm Hofmann in 1855 If this is indeed the earliest introduction of the term it is curious that Hofmann says nothing about why he introduced an adjective indicating olfactory character to apply to a group of chemical substances only some of which have notable aromas It is the case however that many of the most odoriferous organic substances known are terpenes which are not aromatic in the chemical sense But terpenes and benzenoid substances do have a chemical characteristic in common namely higher unsaturation indices than many aliphatic compounds and Hofmann may not have been making a distinction between the two categories The cyclohexatriene structure for benzene was first proposed by August Kekul in 1865 Over the next few decades most chemists readily accepted this structure since it accounted for most of the known isomeric relationships of aromatic chemistry However it was always puzzling that this purportedly highly unsaturated molecule was so unreactive toward addition reactions

The discoverer of the electron J J Thomson between 1897 and 1906 placed three equivalent electrons between each carbon atom in benzene  

An explanation for the exceptional stability of benzene is conventionally attributed to Sir Robert Robinson who was apparently the first to use the term aromatic sextet as a group of six electrons that resists disruption

In fact this concept can be traced further back through Ernest Crocker in 1922 to Henry Edward Armstrong who in 1890 in an article entitled The structure of cycloid hydrocarbons wrote the centric affinities act within a cyclebenzene may be represented by a double ring and when an additive compound is formed the inner cycle of affinity suffers disruption the contiguous carbon atoms to which nothing has been attached of necessity acquire the ethylenic condition 

Here Armstrong is describing at least four modern concepts First his affinity is better known today as the electron It was only to be discovered seven years later by J J Thomson Second he is describing electrophilic aromatic substitution proceeding through a Wheland intermediate in which the conjugation of the ring is broken He introduced the symbol C centered on the ring as a shorthand for the inner cycle thus anticipating Eric Clars notation It is argued that he also anticipated the nature of wave mechanics since he recognized that his affinities had direction not merely being point particles and collectively having a distribution that could be altered by introducing substituents onto the benzene ring 

The quantum mechanical origins of this stability or aromaticity were first modelled by Hckel in 1931 He was the first to separate the bonding electrons into sigma and pi electrons

An aromatic compound contains a set of covalently bound atoms with specific characteristics

Benzene is aromatic cyclobutadiene is not since the number of delocalized electrons is 4 which of course is a multiple of 4 The cyclobutadienide ion however is aromatic An atom in an aromatic system can have other electrons that are not part of the system and are therefore ignored for the 4n 2 rule In furan the oxygen atom is sp hybridized One lone pair is in the system and the other in the plane of the ring There are 6 electrons so furan is aromatic

Aromatic molecules typically display enhanced chemical stability compared to similar non aromatic molecules A molecule that can be aromatic will tend to alter its electronic or conformational structure to gain aromaticity This extra stability changes the chemistry of the molecule Aromatic compounds undergo electrophilic aromatic substitution and nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions They will not undergo electrophilic addition reactions like other compounds with carbon carbon double bonds

Many of the earliest known examples of aromatic compounds such as benzene and toluene have distinctive pleasant smells This property led to the term aromatic for this class of compounds and hence the term aromaticity for the eventually discovered electronic property

The circulating electrons in an aromatic molecule produce ring currents that oppose the applied magnetic field in NMR spectroscopy The NMR signal of protons in the plane of an aromatic ring are shifted substantially further down field than those on non aromatic sp carbons This is an important way of detecting aromaticity By the same mechanism the NMR signals of protons located near the ring axis are shifted up field

Aromatic molecules are able to interact with each other in so called  stacking the systems form two parallel rings overlap in a face to face orientation Aromatic molecules are also able to interact with each other in an edge to face orientation the slight positive charge of the substituents on the ring atoms of one molecule are attracted to the slight negative charge of the aromatic system on another molecule

Planar monocyclic molecules containing 4n electrons are called antiaromatic and are in general destabilized Molecules that could be antiaromatic will tend to shift their electronic or conformational structure to avoid this situation thereby becoming non aromatic For example cyclooctatetraene distorts itself out of a plane and breaks the overlap between adjacent double bonds Relatively recently cyclobutadiene was discovered to adopt an asymmetric rectangular configuration in which single and double bonds indeed alternate there is no resonance and the single bonds are markedly longer than the double bonds reducing unfavorable p orbital overlap Hence cyclobutadiene is non aromatic the strain of the asymmetric configuration outweighs the anti aromatic destabilization that would afflict the symmetric square configuration

Aromatic compounds play key roles in the biochemistry of all living things The four aromatic amino acids histidine phenylalanine tryptophan and tyrosine each serve as one of the 20 basic building blocks of proteins Further all 5 nucleotides that make up the sequence of the genetic code in DNA and RNA are aromatic purines or pyrimidines As well as that the molecule heme contains an aromatic system with 22 electrons Chlorophyll also has a similar aromatic system

Aromatic compounds are important in industry Key aromatic hydrocarbons of commercial interest are benzene toluene ortho xylene and para xylene About 35 million tonnes are produced worldwide every year They are extracted from complex mixtures obtained by the refining of oil or by distillation of coal tar They are used to produce a range of important chemicals and polymers including styrene phenol aniline polyester and nylon

The overwhelming majority of aromatic compounds are compounds of carbon but they need not be hydrocarbons

In heterocyclic aromatics one or more of the atoms in the aromatic ring is of an element other than carbon This can lessen the rings aromaticity and thus increase its reactivity Other examples include pyridine pyrazine imidazole pyrazole oxazole thiophene and their benzannulated analogs

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are molecules containing two or more simple aromatic rings fused together by sharing two neighboring carbon atoms Examples are naphthalene anthracene and phenanthrene

Many chemical compounds are aromatic rings with other things attached Examples include trinitrotoluene acetylsalicylic acid paracetamol and the nucleotides of DNA

Aromaticity is found in ions as well the cyclopropenyl cation the cyclopentadienyl anion the tropylium ion and the cyclooctatetraene dianion Aromatic properties have been attributed to non benzenoid compounds such as tropone Aromatic properties are tested to the limit in a class of compounds called cyclophanes

A special case of aromaticity is found in homoaromaticity where conjugation is interrupted by a single sp hybridized carbon atom

When carbon in benzene is replaced by other elements in borabenzene silabenzene germanabenzene stannabenzene phosphorine or pyrylium salts the aromaticity is still retained Aromaticity also occurs in compounds that are not carbon based at all Inorganic 6 membered ring compounds analogous to benzene have been synthesized Hexasilabenzene and borazine are structurally analogous to benzene with the carbon atoms replaced by another element or elements In borazine the boron and nitrogen atoms alternate around the ring

Metal aromaticity is believed to exist in certain metal clusters of aluminium Mbius aromaticity occurs when a cyclic system of molecular orbitals is given a single half twist to correspond to a Mbius strip Because the ring is half twisted the spins can couple completely around the ring with two less electrons Because the twist can be left handed or right handed the resulting Mbius aromatics are dissymmetric or chiral 

Up to now chemists question whether a Mbius aromatic molecule was ever successfully synthesized Rzepa proposed aromatic compounds with two half twists in 2005 These correspond to the paradromic topologies first suggested by Johann Listing In carbo benzene the ring bonds are extended with alkyne and allene groups

Erich Probst was an Austrian footballerHe played as striker for different teams in Vienna and also abroad

He started with Admira Wien being only 17 years old After a year with Vienna he signed with SK Rapid Wien In this time he won the Austrian Championship four times In his first season with Rapid he scored 28 goals in 23 matches Although he was always a top scorer he never shot the highest number of goals in the league 

After his time with Rapid he went to Wuppertaler SV in Germany After the relegation of Wuppertal he went on to Switzerland playing for FC Zrich In winter 1959 he came back to Austria to SV Austria Salzburg The club paid 90 000 Austrian schillings which was the highest till this time He shot 15 goals and the team could stay in the top league During his time with Salzburg he played his last match in the national football team He was the first player of SV Austria Salzburg who ever played for the team

In the 196061 season he was coach of SV Austria but not successful So he went on to play as striker again His last clubs were the SAK 1914 in Salzburg and First Vienna FC in Vienna At all he scored 150 goals in Austrias top league

He played 19 times for the Austrian national football team and scored 17 goals His first match was on 27 May 1951 In the qualification match for the FIFA World Cup 1954 versus Portugal he scored 5 goals for the 91 win He was member of the 1954 FIFA World Cup squad which reached the third place During the tournament he scored six goals and was together with Max Morlock of Germany and Josef Hgi of Switzerland second in the scorer list During his time abroad he was not player of the team But in 1960 he played his last match versus France where he also scored his last goal for the team So he was the first national football team player coming from SV Austria Salzburg

The isolobal principle is way to predict bonding properties of organometallic compounds In organometallic chemistry it relates the structure of organic ligands that can bind to inorganic molecular fragments Roald Hoffmann described molecular fragments as isolobal if the number symmetry properties approximate energy and shape of the frontier orbitals and the number of electrons in them are similar not identical but similar One can predict the bonding and reactivity of a lesser known pieces from that of a better known pieces if the two molecular fragments have similar frontier orbitals the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital Isolobal compounds are analogs to isoelectronic compounds that share the same number of valence electrons and structure A graphic representation of isolobal structures with the isolobal pairs connected through a double headed arrow with half an orbital below is found in Figure 1 

For his work on the isolobal analogy Hoffmann was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1981 which he shared with Kenichi Fukui In his Nobel Prize lecture Hoffmann stressed that the isolobal analogy is a useful yet simple model It does fail in certain instances

To be the starting point of an isolobal fragment the molecule must meet certain criteria Molecules based around main group elements should satisfy the octet rule when all bonding and nonbonding molecular orbitals are filled and all antibonding MOs are empty For example methane is a simple molecule from which to form a main group fragment The removal of a hydrogen atom from methane makes a methyl radical The molecule retains its molecular geometry as the frontier orbital points in the direction of the missing hydrogen atom Further removal of a hydrogen from the methyl radical results in the formation of a second frontier orbital This process can be repeated until only one bond remains to the molecules central atom Figure 2 demonstrates this example of step by step generation of isolobal fragments 

The isolobal fragments of octahedral complexes such as ML6 can be created in a similar way Transition metal complexes should initially satisfy the eighteen electron rule have no net charge and their ligands should be two electron donors Consequently the metal center for the ML6 starting point must be d6 Removal of a ligand is analogous to the removal of hydrogen of methane in the previous example resulting in a frontier orbital which points toward the removed ligand Breaking the bond between the metal center and one ligand results in a ML5 radical complex In order to satisfy the zero charge criteria the metal center must be changed For example a MoL6 complex is d6 and neutral However removing a ligand to form the first frontier orbital would result in a MoL5 complex because Mo has obtained an additional electron making it d7 To remedy this Mo can be exchanged for Mn which would from a neutral d7 complex in this case This trend can continue until only one ligand is left coordinated to the metal center as shown in Figure 3 

Isolobal fragments of tetrahedral and octahedral molecules can be related Structures with the same number of frontier orbitals are isolobal to one another For example the methane with two hydrogen atoms removed CH2 is isolobal to a d8 ML4 complex formed from an octahedral starting complex Similar analogies can be made between either CH3 and d7ML5 or CH and d9ML3

Any sort of saturated molecule can be the starting point for generating isolobal fragments The molecules bonding and nonbonding MOs should be filled and the antibonding MOs empty With each consecutive generation of a isolobal fragment electrons are removed from the bonding orbitals and a frontier orbital is created The frontier orbitals are at a higher energy level than the bonding and nonbonding MOs Each frontier orbital contains one electron For example consider Figure 5 which shows the production of frontier orbitals in tetrahedral and octahedral molecules 

As seen above when a fragment is formed from CH4 one of the sp3 hybrid orbitals involved in bonding becomes a nonbonding singly occupied frontier orbital The frontier orbitals increased energy level is also shown in the figure Similarly when starting with a metal complex such as d6ML6 the d2sp3 hybrid orbitals are affected Furthermore the t2g nonbonding metal orbitals are unaltered

The isolobal analogy has applications beyond simple octahedral complexes It can be used with a variety of ligands charged species and non octahedral complexes

Typical ligands used in the isolobal analogy are two electron donors such as phosphines halogens or carbonyls However other types of ligands can be used If ligands donate multiple pairs of electrons they will occupy multiple coordination sites For example the cyclopentadienyl anion is a six electron donor so it occupies three coordination sites Polydentate ligands can also be used in the analogy such as ethylenediamine a bidentate ligand or triethylenetetramine a tetradentate ligand

The isolobal analogy can also be used with isoelectronic fragments having the same coordination number This allows charged groups to be considered For example Re5 is isolobal with CH3 and therefore Ru5 and Mo5 are also isolobal with CH3 Any 17 electron metal complex would be isolobal in this example 

In a similar sense the addition or removal of electrons from two isolobal fragments results in two new isolobal fragments Since Re5 is isolobal with CH3 Re5 is isolobal with CH3

The analogy applies to other shapes besides tetrahedral and octahedral geometries The derivations used in octahedral geometry are valid for most other geometries The exception is square planar because square planar complexes typically abide by the 16 electron rule Assuming ligands act as two electron donors the metal center in square planar molecules is d8 To relate an octahedral fragment MLn where M has a dx electron configuration to a square planar analogous fragment the formula MLn2 where M has a dx2 electron configuration should be followed

Further examples of the isolobal analogy in various shapes and forms are shown in Figure 8

Alcibiades son of Clinias c 450404 BC was a prominent Athenian statesman orator and general He was the last famous member of his mothers aristocratic family which fell from power after the Peloponnesian War He played a major role later in that conflict as a strategic advisor military commander and politician 

During the course of the Peloponnesian War Alcibiades changed sides on several occasions In his native Athens in the early 410s BC he advocated an aggressive foreign policy and was a prominent proponent of the Sicilian Expedition He fled to Sparta after his political enemies brought charges of sacrilege against him 

In Sparta he served as a strategic adviser proposing or supervising several major campaigns against Athens In Sparta too however Alcibiades soon made powerful enemies and was forced to defect to Persia There he served as an adviser to the satrap Tissaphernes until his Athenian political allies brought about his recall He then served as an Athenian general for several years but his enemies eventually succeeded in exiling him a second time

The Sicilian Expedition was Alcibiades idea and had that expedition been under Alcibiades command instead of Nicias the expedition might not have met its disastrous fate In the years that he served Sparta Alcibiades played a role in Athens undoing the capture of Decelea and the revolts of several critical Athenian subjects occurred either at his suggestion or under his supervision 

Once restored to his native city however he played a crucial role in a string of Athenian victories that eventually brought Sparta to seek a peace with Athens He favored unconventional tactics frequently winning cities over by treachery or negotiation rather than by siegep151 Alcibiades military and political talents frequently proved valuable to whichever state he worked for His talent for making powerful enemies ensured that he never remained in one place for long By the end of the war his days of political power were a bygone memory

In his youth Alcibiades had been a pupil of Socrates This was something which told against Socrates at his trial

The Maginot Line was a long line of walls forts and armed defences that the French built after the First World War to keep any German army out of France The plan was that the French army would have time to get ready and go north to Belgium and win any battle with the German army there In the Second World War the German army and French army met in Belgium but the French army lost

Alpha cleavage in organic chemistry refers to the act of breaking the carbon carbon bond next to the carbon bearing a specified functional group

In mass spectrometry an cleavage occurs when molecules break apart within a mass spectrometer A mass spectrum tells the size and elements found in each molecule fragment Chemists use their understanding of how molecules break apart to guess the structure of the original molecule Many different molecules break apart with cleavage inside the mass spectrometer Many times cleavage explains the resulting mass spectra

As an example of a mechanism of alpha cleavage an electron is knocked off an atom to form a radical cation Electrons are most likely to be removed in the following order 1 lone pair electrons 2 pi bond electrons 3 sigma bond electrons

One of the lone pair electrons moves down to form a pi bond with an electron from an adjacent bond The other electron from the bond moves to an adjacent atom creating a radical This creates a double bond adjacent to the lone pair atom and breaks the bond that lost the two electrons that were removed

In molecules containing carbonyl groups alpha cleavage often competes with a McLafferty rearrangement

In photochemistry it is the homolytic cleavage of a bond adjacent to a specified group

Diabetic ketoacidosis is a serious condition that is associated with diabetes mellitus DKA happens mostly in those that have Type 1 diabetes although it may occur in some people that have Type 2 Diabetic ketoacidosis results due to a shortage of insulin It may be the symptom of undiagnosed diabetes mellitus Symptoms of DKA include vomiting dehydration nausea confusion and sometimes coma This condition is diagnosed through blood and urine testing DKA without proper treatment can cause death It was first discovered around 1886 and was almost universally fatal before the introduction of insulin in the 1920s

The Thornicrofts giraffe also known as Thornicroft giraffe or Rhodesian giraffe is a subspecies of giraffe Thornicroft giraffes do not have any captive populations Fewer than 1500 remain in the wild Rhodesian giraffes have star or leafy shaped spots that extend to their leg These girrafes are restricted to eastern Zambia and the Luangwa Valley Rhodesian giraffes live in northern Zambia Like all giraffes Rhodesian giraffes share the same ancestors with deer and bovids

Simple aromatic rings also known as simple arenes or simple aromatics are aromatic organic compounds They consist only of a conjugated planar ring system with delocalized pi electron clouds Many simple aromatic rings have trivial names They are usually found as substructures of more complex molecules Typical simple aromatic compounds are benzene indole and cyclotetradecaheptaene

Simple aromatic rings with non carbon ring atoms are called heterocyclic For example rings can include oxygen nitrogen or sulfur Molecules with one ring are called monocyclic as in benzene Molecules with two rings are called bicyclic as in naphthalene Molecules with more than two rings are called polycyclic as in anthracene Simple monocyclic aromatic rings are usually five membered rings like pyrrole or six membered rings like pyridine Fused aromatic rings consist of monocyclic rings that share their connecting bonds

The nitrogen containing aromatic rings can be separated into basic aromatic rings that are easily protonated and form aromatic cations and salts and non basic aromatic rings

In the oxygen and sulfur containing aromatic rings one of the electron pairs of the heteroatoms contributes to the aromatic system The second lone pair extends in the plane of the ring

All of these molecules meet the following criteria

In contrast molecules with 4n pi electrons are antiaromatic

An antiknock agent is a gasoline additive used to reduce engine knocking and increase the fuels octane rating

Gasoline is a fuel mixture High compression internal combustion engines place gasoline under great pressure The pressure can cause the gasoline to ignite early causing a damaging engine knocking noise AH Gibson and Harry Ricardo in England and Thomas Midgley Jr and Thomas Boyd in the United States led early research into this effect They discovery that lead additives ended or reduced knocking So most gasoline brands started adding lead in the 1920s The lead antiknocking agents allowed the sale of even more powerful higher compression car engines The most popular additive was tetra ethyl lead However lead causes environmental and health damage The lead in gasoline leaves the car through the engine exhaust pipes The wind and rain then spread the lead around the environment Also lead harms the catalytic converters found on virtually all US automobiles since 1975 So the sale of gasoline with lead additives was greatly reduced in the 1980s Most countries are stopping leaded fuel use different additives have replaced the lead compounds The most popular antiknock additives include aromatic hydrocarbons ethers and alcohol But some people believe that using aromatic hydrocarbons poses a cancer risk if they do not burn completely

The typical antiknock agents in use are

In some parts of South America Asia and the Middle East leaded gasoline is still in use Sub Saharan Africa stopped using leaded gasoline on 1 January 2006 A growing number of countries have drawn up plans to ban leaded gasoline in the near future

To avoid deposits of lead inside the engine lead scavengers were added to the gasoline together with tetra ethyl lead The most common ones are

The course develops Alseseca river of the south east finally entered the lagoon or emblase Valsequillo

Today the river flows through more than 27 colonies and 2 together assistants 

Between 1960 and 1980 several companies were placed in Puebla including several textile chose places near the center and were placed in new settlements as Santa Barbara La Gloria El Chamizal and the Christ colonies Alseseca river bank

With no protection of the river and the exponential urban growth many companies and people threw waste into the river which gradually became a stream of sewage

Today the river has decreased considerably on track and is used as a garbage dump is not legal 

Due to illegal logging in the area Mainche in rainy season the river overflows and causes increases significantly affecting the population

Since 2000 about 100 families have been affected by the overflowing of the river in colonies like Aleseca Lopez Portillo and Agricultural Resurgence

In addition to the floods the existing pollution along the river with diseases affecting the population living on the margins of it Fortunately there are no records of epidemics in the area but there are cases of cholera and salmonellosis in some children of the houses closest to river

Since 1995 the city government has taken action to mitigate the flooding of the river creating security strips dikes and cleaning of some areas but aid has not been enough to clean the entire river

There is so far a project to remedy the problem of river Alseseca both the city government and the different auxiliary boards

This river is also engaged in whitewater

A fishmonger is someone who sells fish and seafood Fishmongers can be wholesalers or retailers In many places there are fewer fishmongers than there used to be Supermarkets have often replaced independent seafood sellers Female fishmongers used to have a separate name fishwife

The fishmongers guild was started in the City of London by a Royal Charter from Edward I soon after he became king in 1272 Guild members could not have foreign partners Selling fish was tightly controlled to make sure it was fresh and to keep profits low However the guild grew rich After Edwards victory over the Scots they put on a great show including one thousand mounted knights

While Edward II was king the fishmongers lost political power Parliament made a rule that a fishmonger could not become mayor of the city This rule was soon canceled though The fishmongers guild became richer so that while Edward III was king the guild could give 40 to the war against the French This was a large amount of money at that time

The guild was then reformed as the Mystery of the Fishmongers of London They were the only ones allowed to advertise or sell fish They also regulated catching fish in the Thames The river had many fish such as salmon at that time The guild still continues today as one of the Great Twelve City Livery Companies

Some believe that the word fishmonger in Shakespeares Hamlet was a euphemism for a fleshmonger or pimp  

In the English translation of the Asterix series the village fishmonger is called Unhygienix In the film The Beach the islands chef has only fish for meat and is named Unhygienix after to the Asterix character

Charles Fort included the story of the Mad Fishmonger or St Fishmonger in his book Lo According to the story St Fishmonger made crabs and periwinkles fall from the sky The story later appears in the Schrdingers Cat Trilogy by Robert Anton Wilson 

Dr Ahmed Fishmonger is a writer and artist active in the Church of the Subgenius

In many countries the fishwife had a reputation for speaking boldly In Medieval France fishwives in Paris were allowed to speak honestly and directly to the King himself when he went into the marketplace They could be critical without fear of punishment

Deep frying is a way of cooking food by putting it in hot oil or fat Deep frying cooks food very quickly

If done well deep frying does not make food too greasy because the moisture in the food repels the oil The hot oil heats the water in the food steaming it from the inside out The water vapor pushes the bubbles toward the surface of the oil As long as the oil is hot enough and the food is not in the oil for too long oil will only enter the surface of the food However if the food is cooked in the oil for too long much of the water will be lost and the oil will begin to penetrate the food The correct frying temperature depends on the thickness and type of food but is usually between 175 and 190 C 

Some fried foods are given a coating of batter or breading prior to frying This makes the outside of the food crispy and browned while the inside becomes tender moist and steamed Some foods such as potatoes or whole skin on poultry have a natural coating and do not require breading or battering

Deep frying makes large amounts of waste oil Getting rid of the oil properly may be a problem Waste oil is increasingly being recycled into biodiesel

Some deep fry shortenings contain trans fat

Cooking oil can burn well and may catch fire if it is used at too high a temperature Trying to put out an oil fire with water makes the fire worse Instead oil fires must be put out with a fire extinguisher or by smothering

George Andrew Olah is an American chemist His research involves the generation and reactivity of carbocations using superacids For this research Olah was awarded a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1994 The American Chemical Society gave him its highest honor the Priestley Medal

Olah was born in Budapest Hungary on May 22 1927 He studied high school at Budapesti Piarista Gimnazium He studied then taught at what is now Budapest University of Technology and Economics Following the 1956 Hungarian Revolution he and his family moved briefly to England They then moved to Canada He joined Dow Chemical in Sarnia Ontario with another Hungarian chemist Stephen J Kuhn During Olahs eight years with Dow he started to study carbocations In 1965 he left Dow for Case Western Reserve University He joined the University of Southern California faculty in 1977 In 1971 Olah became a naturalized citizen of the United States

Olah is currently a distinguished professor at the University of Southern California and the director of the Loker Hydrocarbon Research Institute In 2005 Olah wrote an essay promoting the methanol economy

The Olah family formed an endowment fund It grants annual awards to outstanding chemists The American Chemical Society selects and administers the awards

The search for stable carbocations led to the discovery of protonated methane Protonated methane was stabilized by superacids like FSO3H SbF5 

Olah also studied how hydrocarbons are used as fuel

Olah also disagreed for many years with Herbert C Brown of Purdue University over the existence of so called nonclassical carbocations such as the norbornyl cation They can be shown as cationic character shared over several bonds

In recent years his research has shifted from hydrocarbons to the methanol economy He has joined with Robert Zubrin Anne Korin and James Woolsey in calling for a Flexible fuel vehicle mandate initiative

The eigenvectors of a square matrix are the non zero vectors that after being multiplied by the matrix either remain proportional to the original vector or become zero For each eigenvector the corresponding eigenvalue is the factor by which the eigenvector changes when multiplied by the matrix The prefix eigen is adopted from the German word eigen for own in the sense of a characteristic description The eigenvectors are sometimes also called characteristic vectors Similarly the eigenvalues are also known as characteristic values

An eigenspace of A is the set of all eigenvectors with the same eigenvalue together with the zero vector However the zero vector is not an eigenvector

These ideas often are extended to more general situations where scalars are elements of any field vectors are elements of any vector space and linear transformations may or may not be represented by matrix multiplication For example instead of real numbers scalars may be complex numbers instead of arrows vectors may be functions or frequencies instead of matrix multiplication linear transformations may be operators such as the derivative from calculus These are only a few of countless examples where eigenvectors and eigenvalues are important

In such cases the concept of direction loses its ordinary meaning and is given an abstract definition Even so if that abstract direction is unchanged by a given linear transformation the prefix eigen is used as in eigenfunction eigenmode eigenface eigenstate and eigenfrequency

Eigenvalues and eigenvectors have many applications in both pure and applied mathematics They are used in matrix factorization in quantum mechanics facial recognition systems and in many other areas

A superacid is an acid with an acidity greater than that of 100 pure sulfuric acid So a superacid has a Hammett acidity function of 12 According to the modern definition a superacid is a medium that has chemical potential of the proton higher than that of pure sulfuric acid 

Chemists use strong acids to break down other molecules Some molecules are so strong that they resist attack by common acids Supercids can break down molecules that stand up to most other acids

Commercially available superacids include trifluoromethanesulfonic acid also known as triflic acid and fluorosulfonic acid Both acids are about a thousand times stronger than sulfuric acid The strongest superacids are prepared by the combination of two components a strong Lewis acid and a strong Brnsted acid The strongest known superacid is fluoroantimonic acid

The term superacid was originally used by James Bryant Conant in 1927 to describe acids that were stronger than conventional mineral acids George Andrew Olah prepared the so called magic acid It has that name because it is able to attack hydrocarbons The name came after a candle was placed in a sample of magic acid The candle dissolved showing the ability of the acid to protonate hydrocarbons Mixing antimony pentafluoride and fluorosulfonic acid makes magic acid

At 140 C FSO3HSbF5 will convert methane into the tertiary butyl carbocation a reaction that begins with the protonation of methane

The strongest super acid system fluoroantimonic acid is a combination of hydrofluoric acid and SbF5 In this system HF releases its proton at the same time that the antimony pentafluoride binds F The resulting anion is both a weak nucleophile and a weak base Fluoroantimonic acid is 21016 times stronger than 100 sulfuric acid and can produce solutions with a H0 down to 28

Superacids are mostly used to help create and maintain organic cations The organic cations are useful as intermediate molecules in many chemical reactions Chemists use superacids to make plastics and high octane gasoline

Sick building syndrome is a combination of illnesses associated with a humans place of work or dwelling A 1984 World Health Organization report into suggested up to 30 of new and remodeled buildings around the world may be linked to symptoms of SBS Most of the sick building syndrome is related to poor indoor air quality

SBS can be caused by flaws in the heating ventilation and air conditioning systems Other causes have been contaminants produced by outgassing of some types of building materials volatile organic compounds molds improper exhaust ventilation of ozone using light industrial chemicals in the building or lack of adequate fresh air intakeair filtration

People try to fix SBS symptoms by increasing the overall turn over rate of fresh air exchange between the buildings air and the outside air But the new green building design goals should be able to avoid most of the SBS sources in the first place Janitors should minimize the ongoing use of VOC cleaning compounds and eliminate conditions that encourage allergenic potentially deadly mold growth

Building occupants complain of symptoms such as irritation of the eyes nose throat neurotoxic or general health problems skin irritation nonspecific hypersensitivity reactions and odor and taste sensations

Several sick occupants may report individual symptoms which do not appear to be connected The key to discovery SBS is if a number of people first experience their illnesses within a period of weeks In most cases SBS symptoms will be relieved soon after the occupants leave the particular room or zone However there can be lasting effects of various neurotoxins which may not clear up when the occupant leaves the building Sensitive individuals can have long term health effects

The following steps can avoid SBS

There might be a gender difference in reporting rates of sick building syndrome because women tend to report more symptoms than men Along with this some studies found that women have a more responsive immune system and are more prone to mucosal dryness and facial erythema Also women are alleged by some to be more exposed to indoor environmental factors because they have a tendency to have more clerical work where they are exposed to unique office equipment and materials while men may more often have jobs based outside of offices

A fully automatic firearm is a type of gun which automatically loads another round into the guns chamber after the first one has been fired It will keep firing until the trigger is released the ammunition runs out or the gun jams One of the most famous examples of a fully automatic firearm is the machine gun

A fully automatic weapon works by ejecting the bullet casing that has just been fired and then loading a new one automatically It will keep doing this until the trigger is released It usually does this by using the recoil of the bullet that has just been fired to force another bullet into the chamber

Fully automatic weapons are usually only used by the police or military because in most modern countries you can get a permit to use semi automatic firearms In countries where you can use fully automatic firearms without being in the police or military there are usually very harsh rules on their use

A player coach in sports is a member of a sports team who simultaneously holds both playing and coaching duties The term can be used to refer to both players who serve as head coaches or as assistant coaches

Playermanager is a sports term used to described a manager of a team who is also registered to play for the team In association football this situation usually arises when a manager leaves a team suddenly and the chairman has to make a quick decision to appoint someone new as a caretaker manager The chairman will usually either ask a coach to take temporary charge or turn to the clubs most senior player If this particular player gains good results for the team during his time in charge he may be appointed full time manager which leaves him a playermanager

However there are instances when a free agent is signed by a new team as a manager and offers his playing abilities

In the United States playermanagers and player coaches were once common especially in the early days of baseball The last player manager in Major League Baseball was Pete Rose who began managing the Cincinnati Reds in 1985 the second to last season of his playing career Fred Clarke spent the longest time as a player manager

Batting average is a statistic that is used in cricket and baseball measuring the batting of cricket batsmen or baseball hitters

Members of the New World rats and mice have occupied different ecological niches Because of this they have developed different forms Most of them resemble rats or mice in appearance but some look like voles moles gerbils or shrews The biggest of them are Kunsia with about 16 30cm body length and about 8 16cm tail Among the smallest are Baiomys with about 5 8cm body length and about 5cm tail 

Most of the New World rats and mice live on the ground but are good climbers Some live in trees Others dig holes in the ground or live part of their life in the water New world rats and mice do not hibernate but on cold days in winter they sometimes fall into a torpor 

The New World rats and mice have many predators and usually live only a short time In the wild these animals usually live for less than a year but they have reached ages of up to five years old when kept indoors and protected by people Some species have adapted to humans and are hemerophile This has also shown in some common names such as the Cotton rat Marsh rice rat Brown Cane Mouse or Short tailed Cane Mouse

INDO stands for Intermediate Neglect of Differential Overlap It is a semi empirical quantum chemistry method that is a development of the complete neglect of differential overlap method developed by John Pople Like CNDO2 it uses zero differential overlap for the two electron integrals Integrals for over orbitals centered on the same atom are included in the INDO method

The method is now rarely used in its original form But it is the basis for several other methods such as MINDO ZINDO and SINDO

Wiswesser Line Notation also referred to as WLN was the first line notation that precisely describes complex molecules This was useful because computers did not work well with the subscripts used in chemical formulas It was invented by William J Wiswesser in 1949 It was the basis of ICI Ltds CROSSBOW database system developed in the late 1960s It was also used to develop the CAOCI database That datafile in turn resulted in MDLs ACD file WLN is still being extensively used by BARK Information Services

The notation is simple so that trained chemists as well as computers can translate it WLN is still used today in a number of databases such as chemindustrycom Other line notations also describe molecules including SMILES and InChI

At the time that WLN was invited the keypunch was the main data entry device It could only type capital letters numbers and a few special characters As a result the symbols used in WLN were limited so that they could be stored on punched cards

Hemerophile is a term used for animals and plants that profit from the changes humans have made to their environment For this reason they can often be found in the cultural landscape of humans they are said to follow humans Some species that live closely together with humans and that have followed them to their immediate surroundings are called synanthropes 

The Winters Tale is a play by William Shakespeare published in the Furfolia in 1623 It was grouped among the comedies but some modern editors have relabelled the play as one of Shakespeares late romances Some critics among them W W Lawrence consider it to be one of Shakespeares problem plays because the first three acts are filled with intense psychological drama while the last two acts are comedic and supply a happy ending 

Despite this the play has been popular and there are different adaptations of it to the stage The first was done by David Garrick in his adaptation called Florizel and Perdita first performed in 1754 and published in 1756 The Winters Tale was revived again in the 19th century when the third pastoral act was widely popular In the second half of the 20th century The Winters Tale was often performed as a whole The text was usually taken from the First Folio

Remipedia is a class of blind crustaceans found in coastal aquifers which contain saline groundwater with populations identified in almost every ocean basin so far explored including in Australia the Caribbean Sea the Atlantic Ocean 

The first described remipede was the fossil Tesnusocaris goldichi but since 1979 at least 17 living species have been identified They have global distribution throughout the neo tropical zone

Remipedes are convert10 40mmin1 long They have a head and a long trunk of up to forty two similar body segments The swimming appendages are on the sides of each segment and the animals swim on their backs They are generally slow moving 

They have fangs connected to secretory glands it is still unknown whether these glands secrete digestive juices or poisonous venom or whether remipedes feed primarily on detritus or on living organisms They have a primitive body plan in crustacean terms and may be a basal ancestral crustacean group 

However Fanenbruck et al showed that at least one species Godzilliognomus frondosus has a highly organised and well differentiated brain with a particularly large olfactory area which is a common feature for species that live in dark environments The size and complexity of the brain suggested that Remipedia might be the sister taxon to Malacostraca regarded as the most advanced of the crustaceans

Maxillopoda is a diverse class of crustaceans which includes the barnacles copepods and a number of related animals 

It does not appear to be a monophyletic group and no single character unites all the members

With the exception of some barnacles maxillopodans are mostly small including the smallest known arthropod Stygotantulus stocki They often have short bodies with the abdomen reduced in size and generally lacking any appendages This may have arisen through paedomorphosis

Apart from barnacles which use their legs for filter feeding most maxillopodans feed with their maxillae Their bodyplan has 5 head segments 6 thoracic segments and 4 abdominal segments followed by a telson

The fossil record of the group extends back into the Cambrian with fossils of barnacles and tongue worms known from that period 

Six subclasses are generally recognised although many works have included the ostracods among the Maxillopoda Of the six groups only Mystacocarida are entirely free living all the members of the Tantulocarida Pentastomida and Branchiura are parasitic and many of the Copepoda and Thecostraca are parasites

Line notation is a text based notation system using ASCII characters It is most often used for chemical nomenclature An entire chemical structure is written on a single straight line

Line notation can also be a word and symbol description of an electrochemical cell used in chemistry 

Cephalocarida is a class inside the subphylum Crustacea that has only twelve shrimp like benthic species They were discovered in 1955 and are commonly referred to as horseshoe shrimps All cephalocaridans belong in just one family Hutchinsoniellidae Even though there is no fossil record of cephalocaridans most specialists believe them to be basal among crustaceans

These crustaceans are from convert2to4mm in length with an long body They have no eyes and live in a muddy natural habitat

The structural and functional similarity between the maxillae and the legs may be a sign of primitive organization the maxillae are not specialized as they are in other crustaceans

The thorax consists of 10 segments and the abdomen bears a telson but no other appendages

Cephalocaridans are found from the intertidal zone down to a depth of 1500 metres in all kinds of sediments They feed on marine detritus To bring in food particles they make water currents with the thoracic appendages like the branchiopods and the malacostracans Food particles are passed forward along a ventral groove leading to the mouthparts

The Dulce Amor Tour was the seventh small concert tour by American singer Selena The tour was to promote her seventh independent LP record Dulce Amor The tour began on November 26 1988 in Corpus Christi Texas The concert ended on July 26 1989 in Houston Texas Selena had sung a lot of covers during this tour She also had begun designing her own clothing 

Selena was inspired by Janet Jackson Madonna and Paula Abdul for designing her own clothing Selena was inspired by Michael Jackson for dance moves that she could perform In some concerts Selena was underpaid by venues across Texas She was not paid fairly because she was a female lead singer in a male dominated genre Selena had food thrown at her by Tejano fans at one of her concerts 

The concert tour had grossed only 4500 The concert ended because of angry fans and because Selena was being promoted to EMI Latin

The Dulce Amor Tour started on November 26 1988 in Corpus Christi Texas Selenas hometown The tour was also her last independent tour before signing a contract with EMI Latin Selena had asked her father Abraham Quintanilla Jr if she could design the bands clothing Her father did not want her to choose the bands clothing However he did give her permission to design her own clothing 

Selena had inspiration from Madonna Paula Abdul and Janet Jackson She also had inspiration for dance moves from Micheal Jackson and other popular 1980s singers When the tour had begun Selena had performed more cover versions then her own songs Selena felt that she should sing popular music to help the band become more popular The concerts had usually lasted for an hour and a half 

Selena was paid only 150 for each concert However some venues underpaid Selena because she was a female lead singer in a male dominated genre Venues who booked Selena felt that she would never become a huge successful singer Some even laughed at Selenas father for even promoting her During several concerts food was thrown at Selena by Tejano fans 

Selena was discriminated against and was not allowed to perform at some venues However the Dulce Amor Tour became the most successful tour in Selenas early career This was because more venues had booked Selena to perform and attendance to her concerts were growing The Dulce Amor Tour had grossed 4500 

In some concerts such as the December 10 1988 Dallas Texas concert Selena had performed T Solamente T Qu Soy Amiga Dame Tu Amor Dame Un Beso and A Million To One In this concert she only had done two covers that night 

On February 20 1989 Selena performed in Odessa Texas Her concert had ended early because Tejano fans were throwing food at Selena Selena only got to perform Costumbres Quisiera Darte I Like It No More Lies and Dulce Amor Selena and her band were taken back to their tour bus The club owner did not pay Selena He felt that he now needed the money to clean up the mess He also banned Selena to ever perform again at his venue until 1994 after she had won a Grammy Award

The PPSh 41 was a Soviet Submachine gun that was designed by Georgi Shpagin as a cheap simpler gun to use instead of the PPD 40 The weapon was designed to be used by soldiers that had very little training and had been conscripted which means they had been forced to fight by their government The PPSh 41 was a very popular weapon and was still in service with the Viet Cong in 1970

The demand for the PPSh 41 was made after the Soviet Red Army had fought against Finland in a Winter War in which the Soviets realised that the Submachine Gun was an effective weapon to use in close fighting in forests and city like areas after the Soviets had suffered terrible losses from the Finnish submachine guns and the same kind of thing happened in 1941 when the Wehrmacht invaded the USSR

The weapon was designed in 1941 and was not produced in high amounts until after November 1941

AB Quintanilla III Selenas brother was short on songs to be recorded for Selenas next studio album AB had wanted to record an exotic progressive album that would help Selena to expand her fan base even bigger He then decided to finish writing Little Bidi Bubbles and turn it into a Caribbean reggae song mixed with Colombian cumbia to attract fans from the Caribbean Pete Astudillo a former back up dancer for the band also helped with writing the song Chris Perez the widower of Selena had brought Rock fusion and guitar solos into the song The song was written in Spanish and was produced by AB Selenas father Abraham Quintanilla Jr and Bebu Silvetti Brian Red Moore a family friend had mixed the song Roger Emerson became the music arranger for the song Bidi Bidi Bom Bom was recorded in Q Productions in Corpus Christi Texas

Around the early months of 1994 the lyrics of the song was finished Selena had recorded the song a few weeks afterwards AB told interviewers that he was afraid and nervous about releasing the song because of its mixed music genres He also said that the use of mixed genres had never been done before for a Tejano singer After Amor Prohibido was released EMI Latin had a hard time choosing a lead single Selena and the record company had wanted Amor Prohibido as the lead single whereas AB had wanted Bidi Bidi Bom Bom AB had tried to convince his sister and EMI but was unsuccessful Bidi Bidi Bom Bom had then became a promotional single for the album

Biophysical chemistry studies biological systems It is a relatively new branch of chemistry It looks for explanations of the various phenomena in biological systems in terms of either the molecules that make up the system or the supra molecular structure of these systems 

Biophysical chemists employ various tools used in physical chemistry to probe the structure of biological systems These tools include spectroscopic methods like nuclear magnetic resonance and X ray diffraction For example the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2009 was based on x ray diffraction studies of ribosomes

Biophysical chemists study protein structure and the functional structure of cell membranes For example enzyme action can be explained in terms of the shape of a pocket in the protein molecule that matches the shape of the substrate molecule or its modification due to binding of a metal ion Similarly biophysical chemists study the structure and function of the biomembranes using model supramolecular structures These include liposomes or phospholipid vesicles of different compositions and sizes

The oldest well known institute for biophysical chemistry is Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Gttingen

Bioinorganic chemistry studies the role of metals in biology Bioinorganic chemistry also studies natural phenomena such as the behavior of metalloproteins as well artificially introduced metals including those that are non essential in medicine and toxicology Many biological processes such as respiration depend upon molecules that fall within the realm of inorganic chemistry  Bioinorganic chemistry also includes the study of inorganic models or mimics that imitate the behavior of metalloproteins

It is a mix of biochemistry and inorganic chemistry Bioinorganic chemistry studies the implications for biology of electron transfer proteins substrate bindings and activation atom and group transfer chemistry as well as metal properties

Paul Ehrlich used organoarsenic for the treatment of syphilis This demonstrated the relevance of metals or at least metalloids to medicine that grew with Rosenbergs discovery of the anti cancer activity of cisplatin The first protein ever crystallized was urease This was later shown to contain nickel at its active site Vitamin B12 the cure for pernicious anemia was shown crystallographically by Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin to consist of a cobalt atom in a corrin macrocycle The Watson Crick structure for DNA demonstrated the key structural role played by phosphate containing polymers

Several distinct systems are of interest in bioinorganic chemistry Major areas include

Habituation is a basic activity whereby an animal responds less to repeated stimuli It is a primitive kind of learning

The learning that underlies habituation is a basic process of biological systems Animals do not need conscious motivation or awareness for it to occur Habituation enables organisms to distinguish meaningful information from background stimuli

Habituation occurs in all animals as well as in the large protozoan Stentor coeruleus The decrease in responding is specific to the habituated stimulus For example if one was habituated to the taste of lemon their responding would increase significantly when presented with the taste of lime 

Two factors that can influence habituation include the time between each stimulus and the length of time the stimulus is presented Shorter intervals and longer durations increase habituation and vice versa

Habituation need not be conscious For example a short time after a person dresses the stimulus clothing creates disappears from our nervous systems and we become unaware of it In this way habituation is used to ignore any continual stimulus This sort of habituation can occur through changes in sensory nerves themselves and through negative feedback from the brain to peripheral sensory organs

A nasal consonant is a type of consonant produced with a lowered velum in the mouth allowing air to come out through the nose while the air is not allowed to pass through the mouth because something is stopping it Examples of nasal consonants in English are n and m in words such as nose and mouth

Nearly all nasal consonants are nasal stops where air comes out through the nose but not through the mouth as it is blocked by the lips or tongue 

Most nasals are voiced and in fact the nasal sounds n and m are among the most common sounds used in languages of the world Voiceless nasals are used in a few languages such as Burmese and Welsh 

In terms of acoustics nasal stops are sonorants meaning that they do not significantly stop the flow of air However nasals are also stops in their articulation because the flow of air through the mouth is blocked completely So nasal consonants sound both like sonorants and like obstruents

Acoustically nasal stops have bands of energy at around 200 and 2000 Hz

Examples of languages containing nasal consonants

The voiced retroflex nasal is is a common sound in Indic languages

The voiced palatal nasal is a common sound in European languages such as Spanish or French and Italian gn or Catalan Hungarian and Luganda ny or Czech and Slovak or Polish or Occitan and Portuguese nh or Serbian Croatian Bosnian and Montenegrin nj

English German and Cantonese have m n and Tamil possesses distinct letters to represent m n n  and 

Catalan Occitan Spanish and Italian have m n as phonemes and and as allophones

The term nasal stop will often be abbreviated to just nasal However there are also nasal fricatives nasal flaps nasal glides and nasal vowels as in French Portuguese Catalan Yoruba Gbe Polish and Ljubljana Slovene In the IPA nasal vowels are indicated by placing a tilde over the vowel French sang s

A select few languages use voiceless nasal consonants Among them are Icelandic Burmese Jalapa Mazatec Kildin Sami Welsh and Central Alaskan Yupik

A term is a mathematical expression which may form a separable part of an equation a series or another expression

In elementary mathematics a term is either a single number or variable or the product of several numbers or variables Terms are separated by a or  sign in an overall expression For example in

3 4x and 5yzw are three separate terms

In the context of polynomials term can mean a monomial with a coefficient To collect like terms in a polynomial is the basic operation of making it a linear combination of distinct monomials For example

A series is often represented as the sum of a sequence of terms 

In general mathematical use however term is not limited to additive expressions Individual factors in an expression representing a product are multiplicative terms Indeed individual elements of any mathematical expression may be referred to as terms

Terms also appear in logic

Francisco Hernndez de Crdoba is usually reputed as the founder of Nicaragua and in fact he founded two important Nicaraguan cities Granada and Len

International Direct Dialing is an international telephone call dialed by the caller rather than going via an operator Since late in the twentieth century most international calls are direct dialed

International calls are made by dialing the international call prefix for the country one is in followed by the country calling code for the country one wishes to call then the phone number within that country When phone numbers are published for use abroad they include the country calling code but replace the international call prefix with to signify that the caller should use the prefix appropriate for their country

Direct broadcast satellite is a term used to refer to satellite television signals intended for home use

The Fallschirmjgergewehr 42 was a battle rifle used by Nazi Germany in World War II It was designed for use only with the German airborne infantry in 1942 and was used in very small numbers until the end of the war 

The FG 42 had the firepower of a Light machine gun and was no bigger than the Kar 98k the standard German rifle in World War Two The FG 42 was thought to be the most advanced weapon designs of WWII It is also thought that the FG 42 shaped the modern Small arms idea

The FG 42 was also found during the Vietnam War

When the Battle of Crete was happening the German Fallschirmjger only had a pistol and hand grenades when they jumped out of a plane and their SMGs and Rifles were dropped in a box from the aircraft carrying the paratroopers

The German parachute harness had only one strap attached to the body making the paratrooper land in on his hands and knees in a forward roll meant that heavy weapons could not be safely carried when jumping from an aircraft In the early stages of the Battle of Crete the Fallschirmjger had many casualties when they tried to collect their main weapons from the crates dropped by their plane mainly from New Zealand Army soldiers This proved that the weapons the paratroopers had were not good enough

In 1941 the German Air Force asked for a Selective Fire hand help weapon for the Fallschirmjger A senior Luftwaffe official was asked to develop this special new weapon The Reich Air Ministry wanted to develop a shoulder fired weapon that could replace the Bolt action rifle Submachine gun and Light machine gun for air attacks This weapon would also be easier to deliver and give better firepower to one paratrooper

The Reich Air Ministry tried to launch a formal weapon development program through the department of the Wehrmacht responsible for small arms but because there were many priorities and a bit of dislike between the Army the program was not started and meant that the Luftwaffe had to develop the weapon on their own

The BD 42I is a Semi automatic version of the early WW2 FG 42 and the BD 42II is a Semi automatic copy of the late WW2 FG 42 Both were made by HZA Kulmbach GmbH

The FG 42 got its ammunition from a 10 or 20 bullet magazine on the left side of the weapon It was shaped like a box and was removable

Comment I havent really looked at the subject list but as long as its referenced well written with decent prose illustrated nicely sortable and accessible then I dont really have a problem with it being at PGA But it does raise a question of precedence and its probably worth a quick discussion and maybe a glance at enwikis featured list process for some guidance on whether we should crowbar lists into GA or develop a separate concept The Rambling Man 0652 19 October 2011

Bioorganic chemistry is a science that combines organic chemistry and biochemistry Bioorganic chemistry expands organic chemical knowledge toward biology This differs from biochemistry which studies biological processes using chemistry When investigating metalloenzymes and cofactors bioorganic chemistry overlaps bioinorganic chemistry

Biophysical organic chemistry is a term used when attempting to describe intimate details of molecular recognition by bioorganic chemistry 

Bioorganic chemistry is that branch of life science which deals with the study of biological processes using chemical methods

A carbocation is an ion with a positively charged carbon atom The charged carbon atom in a carbocation is a sextet Carbon atoms with eight valence elections have the maximum stability Therefore carbocations are often reactive seeking to fill the octet of valence electrons as well as regain a neutral charge Logic would say that carbocation have sp3 hybridization with an empty sp3 orbital giving positive charge However the reactivity of a carbocation more closely resembles sp2 hybridization with a trigonal planar molecular geometry

A carbocation was previously often called a carbonium ion but chemists questions the exact meaning In present day chemistry a carbocation is any positively charged carbon atom Two special types have been suggested carbenium ions are trivalent and carbonium ions are pentavalent or hexavalent University level textbooks only discuss carbocations as if they are carbenium ions or discuss carbocations with a fleeting reference to the older phrase of carbonium ion or carbenium and carbonium ions One textbook to this day stays with the older name of carbonium ion for carbenium ion and reserves the phrase hypervalent carbenium ion for CH5

In 1891 G Merling reported that he added bromine to tropylidene and then heated the product to obtain a crystalline water soluble material chemC7H7Br He did not suggest a structure for it however Doering and Knox convincingly showed that it was tropylium bromide This ion is predicted to be aromatic by the Hckel Rule 

In 1902 Norris and Kehrman independently discovered that colorless triphenylmethanol gave deep yellow solutions in concentrated sulfuric acid Triphenylmethyl chloride similarly formed orange complexes with aluminium and tin chlorides In 1902 Adolf von Baeyer recognized the salt like character of the compounds formed

He called the relationship between color and salt formation halochromy of which malachite green is a prime example

Carbocations are reactive intermediates in many organic reactions This idea first proposed by Julius Stieglitz in 1899 was further developed by Hans Meerwein in his 1922 study of the Wagner Meerwein rearrangement Carbocations were also found to be involved in the SN1 reaction the E1 reaction and in rearrangement reactions such as the Whitmore 12 shift The chemical establishment was reluctant to accept the notion of a carbocation and for a long time the Journal of the American Chemical Society refused articles that mentioned them

The first NMR spectrum of a stable carbocation in solution was published by Doering et al in 1958 It was the heptamethylbenzenonium ion made by treating hexamethylbenzene with methyl chloride and aluminium chloride The stable 7 norbornadienyl cation was prepared by Story et al in 1960 by reacting norbornadienyl chloride with silver tetrafluoroborate in sulfur dioxide at 80 C The NMR spectrum established that it was non classically bridged

In 1962 Olah directly observed the tert butyl carbocation by nuclear magnetic resonance as a stable species on dissolving tert butyl fluoride in magic acid The NMR of the norbornyl cation was first reported by Schleyer et al and it was shown to undergo proton scrambling over a barrier by Saunders et al

In organic chemistry a carbocation is often the target of nucleophilic attack by nucleophiles like hydroxyl ions or halogen ions

Carbocations are classified as primary secondary or tertiary depending on the number of carbon atoms bonded to the ionized carbon Primary carbocations have one or zero carbons attached to the ionized carbon secondary carbocations have two carbons attached to the ionized carbon and tertiary carbocations have three carbons attached to the ionized carbon

Stability of the carbocation increases with the number of alkyl groups bonded to the charge bearing carbon Tertiary carbocations are more stable than secondary carbocations primary carbocations are highly unstable because while ionized higher order carbons are stabilized by hyperconjugation unsubstituted carbons are not Therefore reactions such as the SN1 reaction and the E1 elimination reaction normally do not occur if a primary carbocation would be formed An exception to this occurs when there is a carbon carbon double bond next to the ionized carbon Such cations as allyl cation CH2CHCH2 and benzyl cation C6H5CH2 are more stable than most other carbocations Molecules which can form allyl or benzyl carbocations are especially reactive

Carbocations undergo rearrangement reactions from less stable structures to equally stable or more stable ones with rate constants in excess of 109sec This fact complicates synthetic pathways to many compounds For example when 3 pentanol is heated with aqueous HCl the initially formed 3 pentyl carbocation rearranges to a statistical mixture of the 3 pentyl and 2 pentyl These cations react with chloride ion to produce about 13 3 chloropentane and 23 2 chloropentane   

Some carbocations such as the norbornyl cation exhibit more or less symmetrical three centre bonding Cations of this sort have been referred to as non classical ions The energy difference between classical carbocations and non classical isomers is often very small and there is generally little if any activation energy involved in the transition between classical and non classical structures The non classical form of the 2 butyl carbocation is essentially 2 butene with a proton directly above the centre of what would be the carbon carbon double bond Non classical carbocations were once the subject of great controversy One of George Olahs greatest contributions to chemistry was resolving this controversy

Cyclopropylcarbinyl cations can be studied by NMR

In the NMR spectrum of a dimethyl derivative two nonequivalent signals are found for the two methyl groups indicating that the molecular conformation of this cation not perpendicular but is bisected with the empty p orbital and the cyclopropyl ring system in the same plane

In terms of bent bond theory this preference is explained by assuming favorable orbital overlap between the filled cyclopropane bent bonds and the empty p orbital

An isodesmic reaction is a chemical reaction where the type of chemical bonds broken in the reactant are the same as the type of bonds formed in the reaction product This type of reaction is often used as a hypothetical reaction in thermochemistry

An example of an isodesmic reaction is 

Equation 1 describes the deprotonation of a methyl halide by a methyl anion The energy change associated with this exothermic reaction can be calculated using a computer The energy change increases going from fluorine to chlorine to bromine and iodine This shows that the CH2I anion is the most stable and least basic of all the halides Each of these reactions are isodesmic The energy change in each example also depends on the difference in bond energy of the CX bond in the base and conjugate acid In other cases the difference may be due to steric strain The steric strain is small in fluorine but large in iodine So the energy change grows between each example halide despite the fact that CF bonds are stronger than CI bonds

The related term homodesmotic reaction also takes into account orbital hybridization Homodesmotic reactions also have the same number of carbon to hydrogen bonds An example of a homodesmotic reaction is

A Spit is a depositional landform found off coasts At one end spits connect to the beach and extend into the sea A spit forms because the sand on the beach is moved by the waves along the shore and the sand collects at the end to form a spit The process of the waves moving the sand along the shore is known as longshore drift

Sawfish have a mouth nostrils and gill slits under their body just like a ray Also their pectoral fins are enlarged like those of a ray Also like rays when they settle on the bottom they take in water through two spiracles just behing the eyes This gets water for the gills without sand

Several species can grow to about convert7mdispor

The sawfishs most distinctive feature is the saw like rostrum The rostrum is covered with motion and electro sensitive pores These allow sawfish to detect movement and even heartbeats of prey hiding under the ocean floor The rostrum serves as a digging tool to unearth buried crustaceans 

If a suitable prey swims by the normally lethargic sawfish springs from the bottom and slashes at it with its saw This generally stuns or injures the prey sufficiently for the sawfish to devour it Sawfish also defend themselves with their rostrum against predators such as sharks and intruding divers The teeth protruding from the rostrum are not real teeth but modified tooth like structures called denticles

The eagle rays are a group of cartilaginous fish in the ray family Myliobatidae They are mostly large species living in the open ocean rather than on the sea bottom

Eagle rays feed on molluscs and crustaceans crushing their shells with their flattened teeth while devil rays and manta rays filter plankton from the surface waters 

They are excellent swimmers and are able to breach the water up to several metres above the surface Compared with other rays they have long tails and well defined diamond shaped bodies They are ovoviviparous giving birth to up to six young at a time They range from convert48cmin to convert91mft in length

The tail looks like a whip and may be as long as the body It is armed with a sting Eagle rays live close to the coast in depths of 1 to 30 m and in exceptional cases they are found as deep as 300 m The eagle ray is most commonly seen cruising along sandy beaches in very shallow waters

In this family there are seven genera in three subfamilies

The Prestwick Airport is an airport in South Ayrshire Scotland It is now officially known as the Glasgow Prestwick International Airport 

The airport is close to the town of Prestwick on the western coast of the Firth of Clyde It serves as the secondary airport for Glasgow which is 32 miles to the northeast The airport is Scotlands largest commercial airfield It is Scotlands fourth busiest airport

The airfield was originally owned by Douglas Fowler McIntyre and the Duke of Hamilton two men who were the first to fly a plane to the top of Mount Everest in 1933 During and after World War II it was a RAF base then a USAF base

The airport was made bigger in the early 1960s when the runway was made longer and a new terminal building constructed to cope with the growth of commercial aviation The expanded airport opened in 1964 and is today mostly used by Ryanair

Part of the airfield is occupied by Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm with 3 Sea King helicopters on a search and rescue role They cover Ben Nevis the Lakes Northern Ireland and 200 NM past the Irish coast The force know popularly as HMS Gannet provides a medical evacuation service to the Scottish island communities Personnel at the base numbers 15 officers 11 ratings 28 civil servants and 50 civilian staff

Iodine is an essential trace element The thyroid hormones thyroxine and triiodotyronine has iodine In areas where marine food is not eaten there is low iodine in the diet This causes iodine deficiency which gives rise to goiter as well as cretinism which results in developmental delays and other health problems The Lancet has said According to WHO in 2007 nearly 2 billion individuals had insufficient iodine intake a third being of school age Thus iodine deficiency as the single greatest preventable cause of mental retardation is an important public health problem Iodine deficiency causes diseases of the oral and salivary glands

In these areassmall amounts of iodine to table salt in form of sodium iodide potassium iodide andor potassium iodate is added This helps preventing Iodine deficiency This product is known as iodized salt Iodine compounds have also been added to other foodstuffs This includes flour water and milk in areas of deficiency Seafood is also a well known source of iodine Thus iodine deficiency is more common in mountainous regions of the world where food is grown in soil poor in iodine

Congenital defects are defects which are present at birth or develop in the first month of life They fall into two main groups genetic abnormalities which are hereditary and conditions passed on by the mother such as infectious diseases Some disorders can be detected before birth through prenatal diagnosis screening such as amniocentesis

Conditions such as dwarfism are nearly always genetic in origin One type achondroplasia is a defect in bone growth and another type is due to pituitary malfunction There are many other genetic diseases due to mutant gene alleles which exist in the population Sometimes if the cause is a simple biochemical deficiency providing the lacking chemical or adjusting the food can fix the problem as in phenylketonuria

Another type of genetic defect is caused by errors in chromosome copying during the cell division which produces the gametes Down syndrome is the most frequent of these It results from the child having three copies of chromosome 21 instead of two

The other main type of congenital disorder is caused by an infectious disease being passed from mother to child Congenital syphilis was common a century ago and congenital AIDS occurs today and is common in some parts of Africa Sometimes mothers have taken chemicals which cause the embryo damage Any substance that causes birth defects is known as a teratogen

As time passes screening and antibiotics has caused the number of infections transmitted by the mother to drop It is much smaller proportion than a century ago despite AIDS Also maternal nutritional defects are much rarer except in countries where food supply is limited Therefore genetic disorders have grown as a proportion of the total congenital defects

Pregnancies which do not come to term have similar causes to birth defects Many will be due to failures in the genetics controlling development of the embryo 

Most clinically apparent miscarriages occur during the first trimester Chromosomal abnormalities are found in more than half of embryos miscarried in the first 13 weeks 

A pregnancy with a genetic problem has a 95 probability of ending in miscarriage Genetic problems are more likely to occur with older parents this may account for the higher miscarriage rates observed in older women 

Many women give up cigarettes and alcohol when pregnant because this gives the embryo a better chance of developing normally

The electric rays are a group of rays flattened cartilaginous fish with enlarged pectoral fins They are the order Torpediniformes 

They can produce an electric discharge ranging from as little as 8 volts up to 220 volts depending on species There are 69 species in four subfamilies

These rays have battery like electric organs on both sides of their heads which can make a powerful electric shock They use this shock to stun their prey and for their own self defense

Electric rays are found from shallow coastal waters down to at least convert1000mft depth They are sluggish and slow moving propelling themselves along with their tails rather than using their disc shaped bodies as other rays do They feed on invertebrates and small fish They lie in wait for prey below the sand or other substrate using their electricity to stun and capture it

The electric rays are regarded as monophyletic though in detail the group has been classified in several ways This is one way the order can be classified

The word torpedo comes from a genus of electric rays in the sub family Torpedininae namely Torpedo which in turn comes from the Latin torpere

The United States civil rights movement was a United States political movement for equality before the law Most events were between 1865 and 1980 Many times it used civil resistance and nonviolent forms of resistance In some situations it was accompanied or followed by civil unrest and armed rebellion The process was long and uneven The groups targeted for discrimination included African Americans immigrants Jews Catholics women and other minorities

The movement reached national prominence between 1954 and 1968 particularly in the South The aims of the civil rights movement expanded beyond legal rights to include human dignity economic and political self sufficiency and freedom from oppression by prejudiced people

During the period 19551968 acts of nonviolent protest and civil disobedience produced tense relationships between activists and government authorities Forms of protest andor civil disobedience included boycotts sit ins marches occupations such as Alcatraz Island and a wide range of other nonviolent activities The results was actions by the federal government to outlaw discrimination and a change in public attitude toward discrimination

The movement united people from many different backgrounds to help a wide variety of groups gain civil rights

Immediately after the Civil War federal troops sought to enforce the civil rights of freed slaves in the South The goal was to bring blacks and whites together into a single American society After 1890 the system of Jim Crow disenfranchisement and second class citizenship hurt the citizenship rights of African Americans especially in the South There were three main points 

The combination of law public and private acts of discrimination marginal economic opportunity and violence directed toward blacks in the southern states became known as Jim Crow At this time discrimination was widely accepted throughout the US against immigrants and religious minorities as well as blacks Women could not vote and had limited educational and job opportunities

Prior to 1955 people sought to change these by challenging the Jim Crow laws in court and by lobbying for small changes in laws However by 1955 blacks became frustrated by gradual approaches to implement desegregation by federal and state governments and by the massive resistance by whites Civil rights leaders adopted a combined strategy of civil disobedience Civil disobedience produced crisis situations for segregationists Some of the different forms of protests andor civil disobedience employed included boycotts as successfully practiced by the Montgomery Bus Boycott in Alabama which gave the movement one of its more famous icons in Rosa Parks sit ins as demonstrated by the Greensboro sit in in North Carolina and marches as exhibited by the Selma to Montgomery marches in Alabama Attitudes changed around the country particularly in public opinion polls

The 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom was the best known demonstration Martin Luther King Jr gave his I have a dream speech Many compromises were made in order to unite the followers of so many different causes into one protest The leaders of the march informally named the Big Six were A Philip Randolph Roy Wilkins Martin Luther King Jr Whitney Young James Farmer and John Lewis Although they came from different political horizons these leaders were intent on the peacefulness of the march which even had its own marshal to ensure that the event would be peaceful and respectful of the law Later the march was criticized for not featuring women and their issues in a prominent role

Noted achievements of the civil rights movement in this area include

By 1965 the growth of the Black Power movement began to overpower the original integrated power aims of the civil rights movement that had been pushed by Martin Luther King Jr Advocates of Black Power wanted black self determination and asserted that the assimilation inherent in integration robs Africans of their common heritage and dignity

At the 1968 Olympics two black athletes stood on the podium doing a Black Power salute

The Chicano Movement also known as the Chicano Civil Rights Movement Mexican American Civil Rights Movement and El Movimiento sought political empowerment and social inclusion for Mexican Americans The Chicano movement blossomed in the 1960s and was active through the late 1970s in various regions of the US The movement had roots in the civil rights struggles that had preceded it adding to it the cultural and generational politics of the era

When the movement dealt with practical problems in the 1960s most activists focused on the most immediate issues confronting Mexican Americans unequal educational and employment opportunities political disfranchisement and police brutality In the late 1960s the Chicano movement brought about more or less spontaneous actions such as the mass walkouts by high school students in Denver and East Los Angeles in 1968 and the Chicano Moratorium in Los Angeles in 1970

The movement was particularly strong at the college level where activists formed MEChA Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztln which promoted Chicano Studies programs and a generalized ethno nationalist agenda

At a time when peaceful sit ins were a common protest tactic the American Indian Movement takeovers in their early days were noticeably violent Some appeared to be spontaneous outcomes of protest gatherings but others included armed seizure of public facilities such as in the Wounded Knee incident

The Alcatraz Island occupation of 1969 although commonly associated with AIM pre dated the organization but was a catalyst for its formation

In 1970 AIM occupied abandoned property at the Naval Air Station near Minneapolis Minnesota When activists took over the Bureau of Indian Affairs Headquarters in Washington DC in November 1972 they sacked the building and 24 people were arrested Activists occupied the Custer County South Dakota Courthouse in 1973 Police ended the occupation after a riot took place

In 1973 activists and military forces confronted each other in the Wounded Knee incident The standoff lasted 71 days and two men died in the violence

Later AIM led the Longest Walk 2 which arrived in Washington in July 2008 This 8200 mile walk had started from the San Francisco Bay area More than 100 American Indian nations and other indigenous participants such as Mori participated It also had non indigenous supporters The walk highlighted the need for protection of American Indian sacred sites tribal sovereignty environmental protection and action to stop global warming

If the period associated with first wave feminism focused upon absolute rights such as suffrage the period of the second wave feminism was concerned with the issues such as changing social attitudes and economic reproductive and educational equality with men This included the ability to have careers in addition to motherhood or the right to choose not to have children It also addressed the rights of female minorities The new feminist movement which spanned from 1963 to 1982 explored economic equality political power at all levels professional equality reproductive freedoms sexuality issues with the family educational equality sexuality and many other issues

The Equal Rights Amendment was a proposed amendment to the United States Constitution to guarantee equal rights to women Alice Paul first wrote the ERA In 1923 it was introduced in the Congress for the first time In 1972 it passed both houses of Congress on the condition that a number of states also agree by a June 30 1982 deadline Political campaigns worked for its passage in most states But the ERA died when less than 38 states agreed Twenty one states have a version of the ERA in their state constitutions

Since the mid 19th century in Germany social reformers have used the language of civil rights to argue against the oppression of same sex sexuality same sex emotional intimacy and gender variance Largely but not exclusively these LGBT movements have characterized gender variant and homosexually oriented people as a minority group In the United States the homophile movement of the 1940s 50s and early 60s also took this approach With the rise of secularism in the West an increasing sexual openness womens liberation the 1960s counterculture and a range of new social movements the homophile movement underwent a rapid growth and transformation It focused on building community and activism which came to be known as the Gay Liberation

The words Gay Liberation took its name from Womens Liberation the Gay Liberation Front took its name from the National Liberation Fronts of Vietnam and Algeria The slogan Gay Power was inspired by Black Power and Chicano Power 

Gay Liberationists try to change fundamental concepts and institutions of society such as gender and the family They used consciousness raising and direct action Specifically the word gay was preferred to previous designations such as homosexual or homophile Lesbians and gays were urged to come out and publicly reveal their sexuality to family friends and colleagues as a form of activism and to counter shame with gay pride The lesbian group Lavender Menace was also formed in the US in response to both the male domination of other Gay Lib groups and the anti lesbian sentiment in the Womens Movement Lesbianism was advocated as a feminist choice for women and the first currents of lesbian separatism began to emerge

By the late 1970s Gay Liberation shifted to a more formal movement that became known as the Gay and Lesbian Rights Movement By the start of the 21st Century the movement focused on equal rights including same sex marriage

At the beginning of the twentieth century policy makers adopted psychiatric interpretations of social deviance By 1926 67 prisons employed psychiatrists and 45 had psychologists The language of medicine was used A goal of prisons became to cure offenders of their criminality In fact little was known about the causes of their behaviour and prescriptions were not much different from the earlier reform methods A system of probation began but often used simply as an alternative to suspended sentences and the probation officers appointed had little training Each officer had to watch several hundred people making assistance or surveillance practically impossible Yet a probation officer could revoke a clients probation status without going through another trial or other fair process

In 1913 Thomas Mott Osborne became chairman of a commission for the reform of the New York prison system and introduced a Mutual Welfare League at Auburn Prison with a committee of 49 prisoners appointed by secret ballot from the 1400 inmates He also removed the striped dress uniform at Sing Sing Prison and introduced recreation and movies Progressive reform resulted in the Big House by the late twenties  prisons averaging 2500 men with professional management designed to eliminate the abusive forms of corporal punishment and prison labor used at the time

The American prison system was shaken by a series of riots in the early 1950s triggered by deficiencies of prison facilities lack of hygiene or medical care poor food quality and guard brutality In the next decade courts recognized that prisions had rights in all these areas In 1954 the American Prison Association changed its name to the American Correctional Association and the rehabilitative emphasis was formalized in the 1955 United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners

In segregated prisons in southern states black prisoners had very bad living conditions Some states contracted with farms or companies to provide prisoners as laborers In integrated correctional facilities in northern and western states blacks represented a disproportionate number of the prisoners in excess of their proportion of the general population Blacks were often mistreated by white correctional officers Blacks also represented a disproportionately high number of death row inmates Eldridge Cleavers book Soul on Ice was written from his experiences in the California correctional system it contributed to black militancy

The struggle for civil rights and for the end of discrimination in the United States started before the nation began and continues today The American Civil War grew out of concerns for voting rights economic exploitation by Great Britain and religious freedom During the first half of the 19th century the abolistionists sought an end to slavery Following the end of the American Civil War the Federal government sought to incorporate freed slaves and whites into a single society under a Reconstruction policy Several amendments were added to the Constitution to protect the rights of all citizens including former slaves Following the end of Reconstruction in 1876 Southern states adopted Jim Crow laws which imposed racial segregation on blacks and took away their right to vote or to hold office The Klu Klux Klan used violence against blacks Jews Catholics and immigrants

Women demonstrated and marched demanding the right to vote and to hold office In 1920 the 19th Amendment to the Constitution gave women the right to vote 

In the 1940s and 1950s civil rights leaders used lawsuits to challenge Jim Crow laws as being contrary to the Constitutional Amendments that were adopted after the Civil War In response local governments claimed that they were providing separate but equal facilities that met the Constitutional test In 1954 the Supreme Court in Brown vs Board of Education of Topeka Kansas ruled that separate but equal could not be used to justify segregation of public schools

In the 1960s civil rights leaders lead boycotts sit in protests marches and other non violent demonstrations This resulted in the adoption of Federal Civil Rights legislation prohibiting discrimination in public accomodations employment voting rights and housing It outlawed discrimination based on an individuals race color religion sex or national origin Also Congress passed the Equal Pay Act of 1963 which prohibited wage differentials based on sex This was followed by the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 to provide financial remedies for past wage differences

American Jews were one of the most actively involved non black groups in the civil rights movement Many Jewish students worked in concert with blacks for the Congress on Racial Equality Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee as full time organizers and summer volunteers during the Civil Rights era Jews made up roughly half of the white northern volunteers involved in the 1964 Mississippi Freedom Summer project and approximately half of the civil rights attorneys active in the South during the 1960s

Jewish leaders were arrested while heeding a call from Rev Dr Martin Luther King Jr in St Augustine Florida in June 1964 that was the largest mass arrest of rabbis in American history Abraham Joshua Heschel a writer rabbi and professor of theology at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York was outspoken on the subject of civil rights He marched arm in arm with Dr King in the 1965 March on Selma In the Mississippi Burning murders of 1964 the two white activists killed Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner were both Jewish

Brandeis University the only nonsectarian Jewish sponsored college university in the world created the Transitional Year Program in 1968 in part response to Rev Dr Martin Luther Kings assassination The program increased minority enrollment at Brandeis

The American Jewish Committee American Jewish Congress and Anti Defamation League actively promoted civil rights

While Jews were very active in the civil rights movement in the South in the North many had experienced a more strained relationship with blacks In communities experiencing white flight to the suburbs Jewish Americans were more often the last remaining whites in the inner city neighborhoods With black militancy and the Black Power movements on the rise Black Anti Semitism increased leading to strained relations between blacks and Jews in Northern communities In New York City most notably there was a major socio economic class difference in the perception of blacks by Jews Jews from better educated upper middle class backgrounds were often very supportive of black civil rights activities while the Jews in poorer urban communities that became increasingly minority were often less supportive largely in part due to more negative and violent interactions between the two groupscitation neededdateJanuary 2012

Demersal animals live on or near the bottom of the sea or lakes The term is usually applied to fish 

They occupy the sea floors and lake beds which usually consist of mud sand gravel or rocks In coastal waters they are found on or near the continental shelf and in deep waters they are found on or near the continental slope or along the continental rise They are not generally found in the deepest waters such as abyssal depths or on the abyssal plain but they can be found around seamounts and islands The word demersal comes from the Latin demergere which means to sink

Demersal fish are bottom feeders They can be contrasted with pelagic fish which live and feed away from the bottom in the open water column Demersal fish fillets contain little fish oil whereas pelagic fish can contain up to 30 percent

A feathered dinosaur is a dinosaur with feathers It is now thought that all coelurosaur and perhaps all theropod dinosaurs had feathers 

The realization that dinosaurs are closely related to birds raised the possibility of feathered dinosaurs Fossils of Archaeopteryx include well preserved feathers but it was not until the early 1990s that clearly non bird dinosaur fossils were discovered with preserved feathers Since then more than twenty genera of theropods have been discovered to be feathered 

Most of these fossils come from the Yixian formation in China The fossil feathers of one specimen Shuvuuia deserti have tested positive for beta keratin the main protein in bird feathers in immunological tests

After a century without clear evidence well preserved fossils of feathered dinosaurs were discovered during the 1990s and more continue to be found The fossils were preserved in a Lagersttte a sedimentary deposit exhibiting remarkable richness and completeness in its fossils in Liaoning China The area had repeatedly been smothered in volcanic ash produced by eruptions in Inner Mongolia 124 million years ago during the Lower Cretaceous The fine grained ash preserved the living organisms that it buried in fine detail The area was teeming with life with millions of leaves angiosperms insects fish frogs salamanders mammals turtles lizards and crocodilians discovered to date

The most important discoveries at Liaoning have been a host of feathered dinosaur fossils with a steady stream of new finds filling in the picture of the dinosaur bird connection and adding more to theories of the evolutionary development of feathers and flight Norell et al reported quill knobs from an ulna of Velociraptor mongoliensis and these are strongly correlated with large and well developed secondary feathers

Behavioural evidence in the form of an oviraptorosaur on its nest showed another link with birds Its forearms were folded like those of a bird Although no feathers were preserved it is likely that these would have been present to insulate eggs and juveniles

In 2011 samples of amber were discovered to contain preserved feathers from the Cretaceous period with evidence that they were from both dinosaurs and birds Initial analysis suggests that some of the feathers were used for insulation and not flight Definitely had working flight feathers with off centre rachis Otherwise apart from the front limbs a typical small carnivorous dinosaur

A monoculture is when a single crop is grown in a large area This is very common in modern agriculture as it allows to harvest large amounts with relatively little labour Monocultures have problems however It is easier for pests and diseases to spread in a monocultrure than when Crop rotation is used Growing the same crop also puts a strain on the soil which may need to be be fertilized to support a monoculture Without special knowledge monoculture will perform worse than Crop rotation

Rahonavis is a genus of bird like feathered dinosaur from the Upper Cretaceous 7065 million years ago of what is now northwestern Madagascar 

It is known from a partial skeleton found in a quarry Rahonavis was a small predator at about convert70cmft long with the typical Velociraptor like raised sickle claw on the second toe

Rahonavis has quill knobs on its ulna which led at first to its inclusion among the birds However the rest of the skeleton is rather typically dromaeosaurid 

Makovicky and colleagues consider Rahonavis to be closely related to the South American dromaeosaurids Unenlagia and Buitreraptor and thus a member of the subfamily Unenlagiinae Norell and colleagues also found Rahonavis to lie within the Unenlagiinae as the sister taxon to Unenlagia itself A 2007 study by Turner and colleagues again found it to be closely related to Unenlagia

Rahonavis was one fifth larger than the closely related Archaeopteryx about the size of a modern raven

Although numerous artists reconstructions of Rahonavis show it in flight it is not clear that it could fly There is even been some doubt that the forearm material which includes the quill knobs belongs with the rest of the skeleton Some researchers have suggested that Rahonavis represents a chimera consisting of the forelimb of a bird mixed with the skeleton of a dromaeosaurid 

The nearby discovery of the primitive bird Vorona berivotrensis shows that the possibility of a mix up cannot be entirely excluded However many other scientists including the original describers of Rahonavis maintain that its remains belong to a single animal citing the close proximity of the wing bones to the rest of the skeleton All the bones attributed to Rahonavis were buried in an area smaller than a letter sized page according to co describer Luis M Chiappe in his 2007 book Glorified Dinosaurs Chiappe maintained that Rahonavis could probably fly noting that its ulna was large and robust compared to Archaeopteryx and that this fact coupled with the prominent quill knobs suggest that Rahonavis had larger and more powerful wings than that earlier bird In addition Rahonavis shoulder bones show evidence of ligament attachments allowing the independent mobility needed for flapping flight Chiappe concluded that Rahonavis was capable of flight though it would have been more clumsy in the air than modern birds

The central limit theorems are theorems from probability theory They say that given a large number of independent random variables their sum will follow a stable distribution If the variance of the random variables is finite a Gaussian distribution will result This is one of the reasons why this distribution is also known as normal distribution 

The best known and most important of these is known as the central limit theorem It is about large numbers of random variables with the same distribution and with a finite variance and expected value 

There are different generalisations of this theorem Some of these generalisations no longer require an identical distribution of all random variables In these generalisations another precondition makes sure that no single random variable has a bigger influence on the outcome than the others Examples are the Lindeberg and Lyapunov conditions 

The name of the theorem is based on a paper George Plya wrote in 1920 About the Central Limit Theorem in Probability Theory and the Moment problem

Waziristan Pashto and Urdu is a mountainous region of northwest Pakistan bordering Afghanistan and covering about convert11585km2abbron It is part of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas which is not part of any of the countrys four provinces

Though declared by the rebels as a state or emirate there are questions whether the region being should be called such Those who support that the region is a state point to the facts that the federal government has little to no power in the region and that the area is ruled mostly by tribal elders The Taliban are reported to control most of the region with its own style of Sharia rule which the Pakistan government has been unable to stop Such bold show of autonomy has led one writer in the Wall Street Journal to remark that Waziristan was a state within a state

Chemical biology is a science that combines the fields of chemistry and biology It involves the application of chemical techniques and tools often compounds produced through synthetic chemistry to the study and manipulation of biological systems

This is a slightly different than biochemistry which is defined as the study of the chemistry of biomolecules For example a biochemist studies the three dimensional structure of a protein and how that structure relates to the chemistry of the protein Also biochemistry studies the inhibition and activation of enzymes and receptors with small organic molecules These small molecules are called inhibitors or activators Chemical biologists use chemical principles to modulate systems They do this to either investigate biology relationships or create new functions In this way the research done by chemical biologists is often closer to that of cell biology than biochemistry In short biochemists deal with the chemistry of biology chemical biologists deal with chemistry applied to biology

Solid state chemistry is the study of the synthesis structure and properties of solid phase materials It focuses on non molecular solids It has much in common with solid state physics mineralogy crystallography ceramics metallurgy thermodynamics materials science and electronics It focuses on the synthesis of new materials and their characterization

Technology helps solid state inorganic chemistry Solid state chemistry works to make materials used in commerce Researchers serve industry as well as answering academic questions There were many important discoveries in the 20th century zeolite and platinum based catalysts for petroleum processing in the 1950s high purity silicon as a core component of microelectronic devices in the 1960s and high temperature superconductivity in the 1980s William Lawrence Bragg invented X ray crystallography in the early 1900s which brought further discoveries

Carl Wagners worked on oxidation rate theory counter diffusion of ions and defect chemistry This work showed how reactions proceed at the atomic level in the solid state Because of this he has sometimes been referred to as the father of solid state chemistry

A diverse variety of syntheic methods are used to make solid state compounds For organic materials such as charge transfer salts the methods operate near room temperature and are often similar to the methods of organic synthesis Redox reactions are sometimes conducted by electrocrystallisation For example Bechgaard salts can be made from tetrathiafulvalene

For materials that can withstand heat chemists often use high temperature methods For example chemists use tube furnaces to prepare bulk solids This allows reactions to be conducted up to around convert1100CF For higher temperatures up to convert2000CF chemists use special equipment such as ovens made with a tantalum tube through which an electric current is passed Such high temperatures are at times required to induce diffusion of the reactants But this depends strongly on the system studied Some solid state reactions already proceed at temperatures as low as convert100CF

Chemists often melt the reactants together and then later anneal the solidified melt If volatile reactants are involved the reactants are often put in an ampoule and then all air is removed Often the chemists keep the reactant mixture cold and then seal the ampoule The sealed ampoule is then put in an oven and given a specified heat treatment

Solvents can be used to prepare solids by precipitation or by evaporation At times the solvent is used under pressure at temperatures higher than the normal boiling point Flux methods add a salt of relatively low melting point to the mixture to act as a high temperature solvent in which the desired reaction can take place

Many solids react readily with reactive gases such as chlorine iodine oxygen or others Others solids form adducts with other gases Such reactions are often carried out in a tube with open ended on both sides and through which the gas flows A variation of this is to let the reaction take place inside a measuring device such as a thermogravimetric analysis In that case stoichiometric information can be obtained during the reaction That information helps identify the products

A special case of a gas reaction is a chemical transport reaction These are often carried out by adding a small amount of a transport agent to a sealed ampoule The ampoule is then placed in a zone oven This method can be used to obtain the product in the form of single crystals suitable for structure determination by X ray diffraction

Chemical vapor deposition is also a widely used high temperature method for the preparation of coatings and semiconductors from molecular precursors

Many solids attract water andor sensitive to oxygen For example many halides absorb water and can only be studied in their anhydrous form if they are handled in a glove box filled with dry gas usually nitrogen

Because a new synthetic method produces a mixture of products it is important to be able to identify and characterize specific solid state materials Chemists try changing the stoichiometry to find which stoichiometries will lead to new solid compounds or to solid solutions between known ones A prime method to characterize the reaction products is powder diffraction because many solid state reactions will produce polycristalline ingots or powders Powder diffraction will help the identification of known phases in the mixture If a pattern is found that is not known in the diffraction data libraries an attempt can be made to index the pattern that is to identify the symmetry and the size of the unit cell

Once the unit cell of a new phase is known the next step is to establish the ratio of the elements of the phase This can be done in a number of ways Sometimes the composition of the original mixture will give a clue if one finds only one product or if one was trying to make a phase of a certain composition by analogy to known materials But this is rare

Often chemist work hard to improve the synthetic methodology to get a pure sample of the new material If chemists can separate the product from the rest of the reaction mixture then chemists can use elemental analysis on the isolated product Other ways involve Scanning electron microscopy and the generation of characteristic X rays in the electron beam The easiest way is to solve the structure is by using single crystal X ray diffraction

Improving the preparative procedures requires chemists to study which phases are stable at what composition and what stoichiometry In other words the chemists draw the phase diagram of the substance An important tools in finding the phase diagram data are thermal analysis such as DSC or DTA and increasingly also thanks to the advent of synchrotrons temperature dependent power diffraction Increased knowledge of the phase relations often leads to further refinement in synthetic procedures which repeats the cycle New phases are thus characterized by their melting points and their stoichiometric domains Identifying stichiometric domains is important for the many solids that are non stoichiometric compounds The cell parameters obtained from XRD are particularly helpful to characterize the homogeneity ranges of non stoichiometric compounds

In many cases new solid compounds are further characterized by a variety of techniques from solid state physics

For non metallic materials chemists try to get ultra violetvisible spectra In the case of semiconductors that will give an idea of the band gap

Four point probe methods are often applied either to ingots crystals or pressed pellets to measure resistivity and the size of the Hall effect This gives information on whether the compound is an insulator semiconductor semimetal or metal and upon the type of doping and the mobility in the delocalized bands So important information is obtained on the chemical bonding in the material

Magnetic susceptibility can be measured as function of temperature to establish whether the material is a para ferro or antiferro magnet This tells the bonding in the material This is particularly important for transition metal compounds In the case of magnetic order neutron diffraction can be used to find the magnetic structure

Odontochelys is the oldest known turtle to have been discovered It was first described from three 220 million year old specimens excavated in Upper Triassic rocks in Guizhou China

As a primitive turtle Odontochelys differed from modern turtles in several ways Modern turtles possess a horny beak without any teeth in their mouth In contrast Odontochelys fossils had teeth in their upper and lower jaws 

One of the most striking features of turtles both modern and prehistoric alike are their dorsal shells forming an armored carapace over the body of the animal Odontochelys only had the bottom portion of a turtles armor the plastron It did not yet have a solid carapace as most other turtles do Instead of a solid carapace Odontochelys had broadened ribs like those of modern turtle embryos that still have not started developing the ossified plates of a carapace

In a comparison of skull proportions the skull of Odontochelys is far more elongated in front of the eyes compared to other turtles The tail of the prehistoric turtle was longer in proportion to its body than other turtles In addition the transverse processes found in the tail are not fused such as in later turtles 

Taken together these anatomical differences mean that Odontochelys has some of the most primitive features ever seen in a turtle and is somewhat of a transitional fossil Some scientists however are skeptical of this idea Reisz and Head suggest that Odontochelys does not represent a turtle with a partly evolved shell but that it is a descendant of an older landliving turtle and that the shell became reversed Such shells can be seen on modern turtles like the leatherback turtles

It is likely that Odontochelys was aquatic as the fossil specimens were found in marine deposits full of conodonts and ammonites The primitive turtle swam in shallow marine waters close to shore

The species name Odontochelys semitestacea literally means toothed turtle with a half shell  an apt description of its most striking physical characteristics

In solid state physics and chemistry a band gap also called an energy gap or bandgap is an energy range in a solid where no electron states can exist Band gaps can be found in insulators and semiconductors In graphs of the electronic band structure of solids the band gap generally refers to the energy difference between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band This is equivalent to the energy required to free an outer shell electron from its orbit about the nucleus to become a mobile charge carrier The freed electron is able to move freely within the solid material So the band gap is a major factor determining the electrical conductivity of a solid Substances with large band gaps are generally insulators those with smaller band gaps are semiconductors Conductors either have very small band gaps or no band gap if the energy levels of valence and conduction bands overlap

Scientist use the band gap to predict whether a solid will conduct electricity Most electrons are attracted to the nucleus of just one atom But if an electron has enough energy to fly away from its nearest nucleus it can participate in the flow of electric current across the many atoms that make up the solid The electrons that are not tightly attached to just one nucleus are called the conduction band

In semiconductors and insulators quantum mechanics show that electrons are confined to a number of bands of energy Electrons are forbidden from other energy levels The term band gap refers to the energy difference between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band Electrons are able to jump from one band to another However an electron needs a specific minimum amount of energy to jump from a valence band to a conduction band The required energy differs with different materials Electrons can gain enough energy to jump to the conduction band by absorbing either a phonon or a photon

A semiconductor is a material with a small but nonzero band gap which behaves as an insulator at absolute zero temperature but allows heat to excite electrons enough to jump into its conduction band at temperatures which are below its melting point  In contrast a material with a large band gap is an insulator In conductors the valence and conduction bands may overlap so they may not have a band gap

The conductivity of intrinsic semiconductors is strongly dependent on the band gap The only available carriers for conduction are the electrons which have enough thermal energy to be excited across the band gap

Band gap engineering is the process of controlling or altering the band gap of a material by controlling the composition of certain semiconductor alloys such as GaAlAs InGaAs and InAlAs It is also possible to construct layered materials with alternating compositions by techniques like molecular beam epitaxy These methods are used in the design of heterojunction bipolar transistors laser diodes and solar cells

It is hard to draw a line between semiconductors and insulators One way is to think of semiconductors as a type of insulator with a narrow band gap Insulators with a larger band gap usually greater than 3 eVCitation neededreasonthis value can be disputeddateMay 2010 are not put into the semiconductor group and generally do not exhibit semiconductive behavior under practical conditions Electron mobility also plays a role in determining a materials informal grouping as a semiconductor

In a regular semiconductor crystal the band gap is fixed owing to continuous energy states In a quantum dot crystal the band gap is size dependent and can be altered to produce a range of energies between the valence band and conduction band It is also known as quantum confinement effect

Band gaps also depend on pressure Band gaps can be either direct or indirect depending on the electronic band structure

where

At the Fermi level the probability of a state being occupied is If the Fermi level is in the middle of a band gap of 1 eV this probability is e20 or about 20109 at the room temperature thermal energy of 259 meV

Electrons can be excited by light as well as by heat The band gap determines what portion of the solar spectrum a photovoltaic cell absorbs A luminescent solar converter uses a luminescent medium to downconvert photons with energies above the band gap to photon energies closer to the band gap of the semiconductor comprising the solar cell

In photonics band gaps or stop bands are ranges of photon frequencies where if tunneling effects are neglected no photons can be transmitted through a material A material exhibiting this behaviour is called a photonic crystal

Similar physics applies to phonons in a phononic crystal

In chemistry a superbase is an extremely strong base It is a compound that has a high affinity for protons

Hydroxide ion is the strongest base possible in water solutions but superbases are much stronger than water based bases Such bases are useful in organic synthesis and are fundamental to physical organic chemistry Superbases have been described and used since the 1850s Reactions involving superbases often require special techniques since they are destroyed by water carbon dioxide and oxygen in the air Inert atmosphere techniques and low temperatures minimize these side reactions

IUPAC defines superbases simply as a compound having a very high basicity such as lithium diisopropylamide Caubre defines superbases qualitatively but more precisely The term superbases should only be applied to bases resulting from a mixing of two bases leading to new basic species possessing inherent new properties The term superbase does not mean a base is thermodynamically andor kinetically stronger than another instead it means that a basic reagent is created by combining the characteristics of several different bases

Superbases have also been defined in terms of numbers as any species with a higher absolute proton affinity and intrinsic gas phase basicity than Alders canonical proton sponge

The strength of bases is measured by pKb the dissociation constant of each base Historically the equilibrium constant Kb for a base has been defined as the association constant for protonation of the base B to form the conjugate acid HB

There are three main classes of superbases organic organometallic and inorganic 

Organic superbases are almost always neutral nitrogen containing species Despite enormous proton affinity chemists like organosuperbases for their high reactivity tempered by low nucleophilicity and relatively mild conditions of use Increasingly important in organic synthesis these include the phosphazenes amidines and guanidines Other organic compounds also meet the physicochemical or structural definitions of superbase Proton chelators like the aromatic proton sponges and the bispidines are also superbases Multicyclic polyamines like DABCO might also be loosely included in this category

Organometallic compounds of reactive metals are often superbases including organolithium and organomagnesium compounds Another type of organic superbase has a reactive metal exchanged for a hydrogen on a heteroatom such as oxygen or nitrogen A desirable property in many cases is low nucleophilicity ie a non nucleophilic base Unhindered alkyllithiums for example cannot be used with electrophiles such as carbonyl groups because they attack the electrophiles as nucleophiles 

In organic synthesis the Schlosser base the combination of n butyllithium and potassium tert butoxide is a commonly used superbase n Butyllithium and potassium tert butoxide form a mixed aggregate of greater reactivity than either reagent alone and with distinctly different properties in comparison to tert butylpotassium

Inorganic superbases are typically salt like compounds with small highly charged anions eg lithium nitride Alkali lanthanides and alkali metal hydrides potassium hydride and sodium hydride are superbases Such species are insoluble in all solvents owing to the strong cation anion interactions But the surfaces of these materials are highly reactive and slurries are useful in synthesis

Chemical species are atoms molecules molecular fragments ions etc being subjected to a chemical process or to a measurement Generally a chemical species can be defined as an ensemble of chemically identical molecular entities that can explore the same set of molecular energy levels on a defined time scale Chemists also use chemical species to mean a set of chemically identical atomic or molecular structural units in a solid array

In supramolecular chemistry chemical species are those supramolecular structures whose interactions and associations are brought about by forming or breaking intermolecular bonds Studying these actions is the main topic of supramolecular chemistry 

A task manager is a computer program that is used to show information about the processes and programs running on a computer Task managers also show the general status of the computer They can be used to terminate processes and programs as well as change the processes priority An example of a task manager is Windows Task Manager

A blind spot is a part of the visual field our brains get no information from It is the place in the visual field that corresponds to the lack of light detecting photoreceptor cells where the optic nerve passes through the optic disc of the retina Since there are no cells to detect light on the optic disc a part of the field of vision is not perceived The brain fills in with surrounding detail and with information from the other eye so the blind spot is not normally perceived

Although all vertebrates have this blind spot cephalopod eyes which are superficially similar do not In them the optic nerve approaches the receptors from behind so it does not create a break in the retina

The first documented observation of the phenomenon was in the 1660s by Edme Mariotte in France At the time it was generally thought that the point at which the optic nerve entered the eye should actually be the most sensitive portion of the retina however Mariottes discovery disproved this theory

As to why the blind spot is normally not seen there are two theories One less favoured is that it is simply ignored by the brain The other is that they are filled in by the brain with information from surrounding areas Perception theorists have generally favoured this second hypothesis The filling in works with quite complex and unusual visual patterns suggesting an active brain process works to mimic patterns surrounding the blind spot

These natural blind spots are present only in the eyes of vertebrates Cephalopods have their optic nerves attached to the back of the retina so they are not a problem The vertebrate eye is illogical because light must go through and past the nerve fibres before getting to the retina

This comes about because vertebrate eyes are outgrowths from the brain they grow outward from the embryological tissue which forms the brain

Supramolecular chemistry is area of chemistry that studies the relationship and linking molecules into bigger systems It focuses on the chemical systems made up of a discrete number of assembled molecular subunits or components The forces responsible for the organization in space may vary from weak to strong The degree of electronic coupling between the molecular component remains small with respect to relevant energy parameters of the component While traditional chemistry focuses on the covalent bond supramolecular chemistry examines the weaker and reversible noncovalent interactions between molecules These forces include hydrogen bonding metal coordination hydrophobic forces van der Waals forces pi pi interactions and electrostatic effects Important concepts that have been demonstrated by supramolecular chemistry include molecular self assembly folding molecular recognition host guest chemistry mechanically interlocked molecular architectures and dynamic covalent chemistry The study of non covalent interactions is crucial to understanding many biological processes from cell structure to vision that rely on these forces for structure and function Biological systems are often the inspiration for supramolecular research

Johannes Diderik van der Waals first proposed the existence of intermolecular forces in 1873 However Nobel laureate Hermann Emil Fischer gave supramolecular chemistry its philosophical roots In 1890 Fischer suggested that enzyme substrate interactions take the form of a lock and key pre empting the concepts of molecular recognition and host guest chemistry In the early twentieth century noncovalent bonds were understood in gradually more detail with the hydrogen bond being described by Latimer and Rodebush in 1920

The use of these principles led to an increasing understanding of protein structure and other biological processes For instance the important breakthrough that allowed the elucidation of the double helical structure of DNA was the discovery that there are two separate strands of nucleotides connected through hydrogen bonds The use of noncovalent bonds is essential to replication because they allow the strands to be separated and used to template new double stranded DNA Also chemists began to study synthetic structures based on noncovalent interactions such as micelles and microemulsions

Eventually chemists were able to take these concepts and apply them to synthetic systems The breakthrough came in the 1960s with the synthesis of the crown ethers by Charles J Pedersen Following this work other researchers such as Donald J Cram Jean Marie Lehn and Fritz Vogtle made shape and ion selective receptors In the 1980s this research grew fast For example researched focused on mechanically interlocked molecular architectures

The 1987 Nobel Prize in Chemistry recognized importance of supramolecular chemistry It honored Donald J Cram Jean Marie Lehn and Charles J Pedersen for their work in this area The development of selective host guest complexes in particular in which a host molecule recognizes and selectively binds a certain guest was cited as an important contribution

In the 1990s supramolecular chemistry improved James Fraser Stoddart developed molecular machinery and highly complex self assembled structures Itamar Willner developed sensors and methods of electronic and biological interfacing During this period electrochemical and photochemical features were added supramolecular systems Research began into synthetic self replicating systems Work began on molecular information processing devices The emerging science of nanotechnology also had a strong influence on the subject Building blocks such as fullerenes nanoparticles and dendrimers became involved in synthetic systems

Supramolecular chemistry deals with subtle interactions and consequently control over the processes involved can require great precision In particular noncovalent bonds have low energies and often no activation energy for formation As demonstrated by the Arrhenius equation this means that unlike in covalent bond forming chemistry the rate of bond formation is not increased at higher temperatures In fact chemical equilibrium equations show that the low bond energy results in a shift towards the breaking of supramolecular complexes at higher temperatures

However low temperatures can also be problematic to supramolecular processes Supramolecular chemistry can require molecules to distort into thermodynamically disfavored conformations Supramolecular chemistry may include some covalent chemistry In addition the dynamic nature of supramolecular chemistry is utilized in many systems and cooling the system would slow these processes

Thus thermodynamics is an important tool to design control and study supramolecular chemistry Perhaps the most striking example is that of warm blooded biological systems which can only operate within a very narrow temperature range

The molecular environment around a supramolecular system is also of prime importance to its operation and stability Many solvents have strong hydrogen bonding electrostatic and charge transfer capabilities and are therefore able to become involved in complex equilibria with the system even breaking complexes completely For this reason the choice of solvent can be critical

Molecular self assembly is the construction of systems without guidance or management from an outside source The molecules are directed to assemble through noncovalent interactions Self assembly may be subdivided into intermolecular self assembly and intramolecular self assembly Molecular self assembly also allows the construction of larger structures such as micelles membranes vesicles liquid crystals and is important to crystal engineering

Molecular recognition is the specific binding of a guest molecule to a complementary host molecule to form a host guest complex Often the definition of which species is the host and which is the guest is arbitrary The molecules are able to identify each other using noncovalent interactions Key applications of this field are the construction of molecular sensors and catalysis

Molecular recognition and self assembly may be used with reactive species in order to pre organize a system for a chemical reaction This is a special case of supramolecular catalysis Noncovalent bonds between the reactants and a template hold the reactive sites of the reactants close together facilitating the desired chemistry This can be useful where the desired reaction conformation is thermodynamically or kinetically unlikely such as in the preparation of large macrocycles This pre organization also serves purposes such as minimizing side reactions lowering the activation energy of the reaction and producing desired stereochemistry After the reaction has taken place the template may remain in place be forcibly removed or may be automatically decomplexed on account of the different recognition properties of the reaction product The template may be as simple as a single metal ion or may be extremely complex

Mechanically interlocked molecular architectures consist of molecules that are linked only as a result of their shape Some noncovalent interactions may exist between the different components But covalent bonds do not Supramolecular chemistry and template directed synthesis in particular is key to the efficient synthesis of the compounds Examples of mechanically interlocked molecular architectures include catenanes rotaxanes molecular knots and molecular Borromean rings

In dynamic covalent chemistry covalent bonds are broken and formed in a reversible reaction under thermodynamic control While covalent bonds are key to the process the system is directed by noncovalent forces to form the lowest energy structures

Many synthetic supramolecular systems are designed to copy functions of biological systems These biomimetic architectures can be used to learn about both the biological model and the synthetic implementation Examples include photoelectrochemical systems catalytic systems protein design and self replication

Molecular imprinting describes a process by which a host is constructed from small molecules using a suitable molecular species as a template After construction the template is removed leaving only the host The template for host construction may be subtly different from the guest that the finished host binds In its simplest form imprinting utilizes only steric interactions but more complex systems also incorporate hydrogen bonding and other interactions to improve binding strength and specificity

Molecular machines are molecules or molecular assemblies that can perform functions such as linear or rotational movement switching and entrapment These devices are studied by both supramolecular chemistry and nanotechnology Prototypes have been demonstrated using supramolecular concepts

Supramolecular systems are rarely designed from first principles Rather chemists have a range of well studied structural and functional building blocks that they are able to use to build up larger functional architectures Many of these exist as whole families of similar units from which the analog with the exact desired properties can be chosen

Macrocycles are very useful in supramolecular chemistry as they provide whole cavities that can completely surround guest molecules and may be chemically modified to fine tune their properties

Many supramolecular systems require their components to have suitable spacing and conformations relative to each other and therefore easily employed structural units are required 

Supramolecular chemistry and molecular self assembly processes in particular have been applied to the development of new materials Large structures can be readily accessed using bottom up synthesis as they are composed of small molecules requiring fewer steps to synthesize So most of the bottom up approaches to nanotechnology are based on supramolecular chemistry

A major application of supramolecular chemistry is the design and understanding of catalysts and catalysis Noncovalent interactions are extremely important in catalysis binding reactants into conformations suitable for reaction and lowering the transition state energy of reaction Template directed synthesis is a special case of supramolecular catalysis Encapsulation systems such as micelles and dendrimers are also used in catalysis to create microenvironments suitable for reactions to progress that is not possible to use on a macroscopic scale

Supramolecular chemistry is also important to the development of new drug therapies Supramolecular chemists study the interactions at a drug binding site The area of drug delivery has also made critical advances as a result of supramolecular chemistry providing encapsulation and targeted release mechanisms In addition supramolecular systems have been designed to disrupt protein protein interactions that are important to cellular function

Supramolecular chemistry has been used to demonstrate computation functions on a molecular scale In many cases photonic or chemical signals have been used in these components but electrical interfacing of these units has also been shown by supramolecular signal transduction devices Data storage has been accomplished by the use of molecular switches with photochromic and photoisomerizable units by electrochromic and redox switchable units and even by molecular motion Synthetic molecular logic gates have been demonstrated on a conceptual level Even full scale computations have been achieved by semi synthetic DNA computers

Research in supramolecular chemistry also has application in green chemistry where reactions have been developed which proceed in the solid state directed by non covalent bonding Such procedures are highly desirable since they reduce the need for solvents during the production of chemicals

Supramolecular chemistry is often pursued to develop new functions that cannot appear from a single molecule These functions also include magnetic properties light responsiveness self healing polymers synthetic ion channels molecular sensors etc Supramolecular research has been applied to develop high tech sensors processes to treat radioactive waste and contrast agents for CAT scans
