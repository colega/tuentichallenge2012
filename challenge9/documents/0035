Sonic Rivals is a video game for the PlayStation Portable that came out on November 24 2006 The game is made by Backbone Entertainment and Sega People can play as Sonic the Hedgehog Shadow the Hedgehog Knuckles the Echidna or Silver the Hedgehog

The Mega Doraibu called the Sega Genesis in North America is a 16 bit video game console made by Sega

When it was time to make another video game machine after the Sega Saturn was released Shoichiro Irimajiri asked Tatsuo Yamamoto from IBM Austin and his group to create it However Hideki Satos old group that made video game machines did not like this Because of this the two groups were in a competition to make the best machine

Hideki Satos group used Hitachi SH4 and PowerVR to make a video game machine called White Belt The name was later changed to Guppy and then Katana

Tatsuo Yamamotos IBMMotorola PowerPC 603e and 3dfx Voodoo 2 to make a video game machine called Blackbelt and then renamed to Shark in United States In Japan the machine was first called Dural and then renamed to Katana 

On April 1997 3dfx told people that Sega was using their 3dfx Voodoo 2 for a video game machine Sega however wanted this to be a secret and became very angry Because of this Sega used Hideki Satos Katana machine instead of Tatsuo Yamamotos

Later on 3dfx sued Sega because they thought Sega broke their promise to them However the two companies then settled out of court

After Sega released their Dreamcast many other video game companies also released their video game consoles This includes Sony who released the PlayStation 2 Nintendo who released the GameCube and Microsoft who released the Xbox

The Dreamcast was released in Japan in November 27 1998 and then released September 9 1999 in North America Originally many people liked the Dreamcast and it sold a lot In the United States 300000 machines were sold on the first week and Sega earned 984 million dollars

To help the Dreamcast sell even more Sega told many stores to show some of their best games to customers like Soul Calibur Sonic Adventure Power Stone and Hydro Thunder

Electronic Arts a video games company said that they did not want to make games for the Dreamcast until it sold one million machines This is because Electronic Arts video games on the Sega Saturn did not make a lot of money However in three months when the Dreamcast did sell one million machines Electronic Arts still did not want to make games for the Dreamcast and made games for the PlayStation 2 instead 

In places like Europe Sega decided to let other companies make ads for the Dreamcast However Sega did not give the companies enough money so the companies could not make as much ads as the PlayStation 2 another video game machine that was competing with the Dreamcast

Many of these companies also forced people to pay a lot of extra money for the Dreamcast than in the USA and Japan 

Some games were not even sold in Europe because Sega was spending most of their time on selling the Dreamcast in the USA Because of this a lot of people who used to like Sega now liked Sony

Segas prestige among gamers was at the time heavily damaged because of the lack of good managementmarketing back from the Sega Saturn this also affected certain game developers such as Electronic Arts refusing to develop for the system because of the risk of the Dreamcast becoming just like the Sega Saturn not selling well This was a factor is why this Incredible ground breaking console did not reach its full potential  

In the end Sega told people on January 31 2001 that they would be discontinuing the console production Segas last video game sold for Dreamcast was Puyo Pop Fever which was released on February 24 2004 From then onwards other people are still making Dreamcast games

These accessories were sold by Sega to be used on the Dreamcast

Counting is something people do to find out how many things there are of any kind 

The person counting usually starts with the number one and gives this number to the first thing The next thing is given the number two Then the next thing is given the number three If there is another thing it gets the number four If after this there is another thing it gets the number five More things get more numbers Each thing gets its own number in this way The last number given to the last thing counted shows how many things there are

Counting is starting at a number and changing it up or down a certain number of times In the examples above counting started at one and then it changed by one each time something was counted So at first the count was one Then the count was changed by one and one plus one is two so the count was two Then the count of two was changed by one again and two plus one is three so the count was three 

Counting can go up or down Counting can be done on fingers

It has been shown that some birds are good at counting Crows are birds that are good at counting

The launch pad is where rockets and spacecraft are placed until they is ready to blast off NASA has its own launch pads for its spacecraft Launch pads are often made out of steel reinforced concrete Launch pads for larger spacecraft will often have towers to support it during its launch

The Space Shuttle was a spacecraft which was used by the American National Aeronautics and Space Administration or NASA Space Shuttles were used to carry astronauts and cargo into space Cargo such as satellites parts of the International Space Station or scientific instruments were taken up into space by the space shuttle It was a unique spacecraft because it could be used again and again

The Space Shuttle was made up of 3 parts These were the orbiter the external fuel tank and solid rocket boosters 

The orbiter was shaped like a large airplane with wings and a tail This allowed the Space Shuttle to glide and land on a runway This allowed the reusable part of the Shuttle to be very large Many spacecraft which came before the Space Shuttle like the Apollo used parachutes when landing and landed on the ocean People have said that the Shuttle was very much like a pickup truck because of its usefulness 

The shuttle was launched out of Earths gravity and into space by 3 rocket engines on the back of the orbiter along with help from 2 long white Solid Rocket Boosters Fuel for the shuttle was stored in the large usually orange External Fuel Tank Before the shuttle reached orbit the SRBs were released and fell into the Atlantic Ocean where they were towed back to shore for reuse The ET was also released but broke up and fell into the Indian Ocean and was not reused

The US space shuttles were

A next to a name means that the Shuttle was destroyed

There was a Russian Shuttle called Buran It flew one unmanned flight before being retired The Buran was destroyed in a hangar collapse in 2002

The shuttle was created in 1973 It replaced the Apollo capsules The first flight was a test of the landing and maneuvering abilities of the shuttle This flight was done by the Space Shuttle Enterprise The first shuttle flight in space was on April 12 1981 It was done by the Space Shuttle Columbia

On January 28 1986 the Space Shuttle Challenger disintegrated 73 seconds into the flight of STS 51L It caused a year long stall in space flight

In the 1990s the Shuttle began working on the International Space Station This was its main job of the shuttle since then

Also in the 1990s the Space Shuttle launched the Hubble telescope into space Shuttle missions returned 5 times to repair and improve cameras and scientific instruments on the telescope

On February 1 2003 the Space Shuttle Columbia broke up while returning STS 107 to Earth over Texas The accident was caused by damage to the heat shield which protects it from the heat of reentry into the Earths atmosphere It again caused a long delay until the next shuttle flight

Now all the shuttles have retired they may be replaced by the Orion But the government has not yet funded this spacecraft

The three remaining shuttles will go on display at museums Enterprise currently at the Steven F Udvar Hazy Center in Chantilly Virginia will move to the Intrepid Sea Air Space Museum in New York City and the Steven F Udvar Hazy Center will receive the Discovery Endeavour will go to the California Science Center in Los Angeles and Atlantis will stay in Florida at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex

Windsurfing is a water sport invented in the UK by Peter Chilvers in 1958 on Hayling Island Hampshire It is performed on a large board with a sail The sail both empowers the board and helps the board change directions The sport is a combination of surfing and sailing Windsurfers can travel on either flat or rough water as long as there is wind Windsurfing is done mostly in the summer and spring

Windsurfing competitions can be freestyle or racing around buoys and it features in the Olympics

Windsurfing sails come in many different sizes The larger the sails are the more human strength is needed to control them but the more power is given to go faster The different sizes of board affect the speed Again the thinner the board the faster you will go The range of thickness depends on the materials used 

Another sport similar to windsurfing is kite surfing All these sports have boards that range in size and price but all need much practice to be done well There are many sporting places around the world that people travel to just to go surfing Some of the best places are in the west coast of the United States Hawaii Australia and Indonesia

Thoroughbred is a type of horse They are mainly used for racing Horses have been used for many years for farm racing to harness work Horses were the fastest way for people to travel on land before cars were invented and the only way to travel long distances in a reasonable amount of time Most horse breeds have been bred for a specific reason the thoroughbred race horse was bred to run Thoroughbreds originate from the Arabian breed and all thoroughbreds can be traced back to three original sires The Byerley Turk The Darley Arabian and The Godolphin Arabian

Thoroughbreds are known around the world for their speed but also for their jumping ability which make them good for show jumping and other horse activities Although thoroughbreds generally are slightly temperamental they are very trainable and loyal 

Thoroughbreds are generally tall and sleek with long legs to help carry them along the race track Thoroughbreds can be many colours such as bay chestnut black and gray

The appearance of the Thoroughbred reveals its Arabian ancestry It has a refined head with widely spaced intelligent eyes a long arched neck and prominent withers The shoulder is extremely sloped The heart girth is deep and relatively narrow The croup is high and the quarters are substantial The legs are clean and long with pronounced tendons It has a long low stride giving it incomparable speed as a race horse The Thoroughbred is predominately bay in color but gray black brown and chestnut are also found It stands between 15 and 17 hands The Thoroughbreds best suited for sprinting have shorter backs more substantial quarters and less height 

The Thoroughbreds genetic origin is Arabian The Arabian foundation stallions which were brought to Britain in the late 1600s and early 1700s were bred to domestic mares very probably Scottish Galloways although they may have been bred to Arabian mares too A substantial number of early Thoroughbreds were bred in the vale of Bedale in the County of Yorkshire in Northern England 

The foundation stallions of the Thoroughbred breed and years in which they arrived in England were the Byerly Turk the Darley Arabian and the Godolphin Arabian Their progeny were the first Thoroughbreds per se and although the foundation stallions had many off spring three of their descendants stand out as supreme Herod Eclipse and Matchem In the lines of these horses were some outstanding Thoroughbreds for instance Princequillo and Round Table descend from Herod Citation and Sir Ivor descend from Eclipse and Man O War from Matchem 

The first Thoroughbred to arrive in America was a stallion named Bulle Rock by the Darley Arabian He was imported to Virginia in 1730 by Samuel Gist In 1757 Janus a grandson of Godolphin Arabian was imported and became the founder of the Quarter Horse breed Diomed who was imported in 1800 was the most important Thoroughbred imported to America in its early years Lexington by Boston was foaled in 1850 and was the greatest sire of the 1800s 

A sound card is the part of the Computer hardware that controls the input and output of the sound signals A sound card is what is known as an expansion card This means that the card can be added to the motherboard

Nowadays most of the audio cards are integrated with the motherboard That means they are build in onto a mainboard and can not be removed In other words it is not an expansion card anymore They offer only line in speaker and microphone connections For most users this is enough When thinking of computer architecture the integrated circuit sound cards occupy less space and thus became very popular and practical especially for laptop computers For more features like MIDI ports for connection of musical instruments and low latency requirements sound cards as expansion cards can be used Modern expansion sound cards use the PCI computer bus standard Earlier sound cards used the ISA computer bus which was half duplex so the sound cards could not record and play simultaneously

What we hear in speakers is an analog output of the signal For example stored on a hard disk digital code is transferred under a control of some application to the sound card Up in there a special chip called digital to analog converter changes the binary code into the analog sound Afterwards signal is sent to jack where the speakers are connected The result is a nice waveform of our favorite digital medium eg an mp3

A typical sound input device is a microphone connected to the redpink jack socket The sound wave is digitized and then it may be stored as a file using data compression algorithms which make the file smaller Of course all of this is done under the control of some software

The motherboard or mainboard is the main circuit board in a complex electronic system like a computer It is the most central part of a computer All of the different parts of the computer are connected to the motherboard This lets them work together In most computers the motherboard is a big green board but many come in different colors like black red and yellow 

Normal electrical parts must be kept on the motherboard These on board parts include transistors and resistors Many of the major parts that are attached to the board are able to be removed in the future so that they can be upgraded The CPU and memory are examples of parts that are usually removable

Parts that are not on board can be bought as a card In fact many of the on board parts on todays computers were at one time an expansion card that became very popular These were put on the board to free up the card slots for other things Computers today usually have a memory port 2 or more USB ports a parallel port audio microphone jacks a network port and ports for the keyboard and mouse There are also rare motherboards that have plugs only for very specific parts

Plutonium is the chemical element with the atomic number 94 and chemical symbol Pu It is a highly radioactive metal It is the metal used in most nuclear weapons The chemical element plutonium has some different isotopes The most important isotope of plutonium is 239Pu It takes 24110 years for half of a sample of plutonium 239 to decay which is called its half life It can be made from natural uranium and is fissile The isotope that has the longest half life is 244Pu Plutonium 244 has a half life of about 80 million years The half life of 244Pu is long enough that some of this isotope of plutonium is found in very small amounts in nature

Plutonium can react with water oxygen carbon halogens nitrogen and silicon It forms oxides and hydrides in moist air causing the plutonium sample to expand by up to 70 Plutonium from the expanding sample can flake off and catch fire at room temperature Plutonium is also toxic although it is less toxic than many people think The reactivity and toxicity of plutonium make it difficult to handle

In April 1996 the BBC World channel which operated in Arabic was shut down This channel was partly owned by Saudi Arabia Many of the journalists from this station started working with Al Jazeera The channel started broadcasting at the End of 1996 Because Al Jazeera was available in the whole region via satellite it changed the television landscape of the region Before that people could only watch channels that were censored by the different states Al Jazeera brought a new level of freedom of speech in television to the Middle East Al Jazeera has always broadcasted controversial on many governments in the Middle East for example Saudi Arabia Kuwait Bahrain and Qatar It also was critical about Syrias relationship with the Lebanon and of the judiciary in Egypt For example on January 27 1999 Al Jazeera had critics of the government of Algeria on their live program El Itidjah el Mouakass To stop people from watching this program in Algeria over satellite the government of Algeria cut the electricity in large parts of the country At that time many people outside the Middle East did not know about Al Jazeera Those people who knew it said generally good things about Al Jazeera Because of good reporting from the Lebanese Civil War in 20002001 Al Jazeera got even more viewers However it only became know worldwide after it broadcast statements from al Quaeda leaders in 2001

Most people think that people that live in the Middle East are given little information and that what they get is biased toward the government Many people in the Arab world see Al Jazeera as a good and true source of information Some scholars use the word of contextual objectivity which means that Al Jazeera shows both sides of a story but still manages to be popular with the audience Because of this it is probably the most watched news channel in the Middle East More and more channels for example BBC and CNN are using material from Al Jazeera

The first Al Jazeera can be watched all over the world with several different satellite and cable systems In the US Al Jazeera can be watched on DVB S on the Galaxy 25 and 23 satellites In Europe Northern Africa and the Middle East it can be received via DVB S on the Astra and Hot Bird satellites In Australia Al Jazeera can be watched via the Optus C1 satellite and in the United Kingdom it can be watched via Sky and Freesat

Two types of boron are found Amorphous boron is a brown powder and metallic boron is black and hard and a weak conductor at room temperature

Pure boron is used as a dopant in the semiconductor industry Chemical compounds of boron are important as to make strong materials not weigh very much as nontoxic insecticides and preservatives and for chemical synthesis

Plants need boron in them to live Very small amounts of boron are needed in animals bodies so that they are very healthy How it keeps animals healthy is not known in a lot of detail 

Boron was discovered by Sir Humphry Davy an English chemist in 1808

A fireplace is a brick or metal structure used to hold a fire Fireplaces are most often used for heating but they can also be used for cooking The part of the fireplace that holds the fire is called a firebox or a firepit There is a chimney or flue above the firebox that lets the smoke from the fire go outside

Until the early 1900s most homes had one or more fireplaces as a source of heat for the residents of the house In the mid 1900s gas oil and electric heaters became more common and fireplaces were used less often as a source of heat In the late 1900s fireplaces were less commonly built in new houses

The Legion of Net Heroes also called LNH is a shared universe setting in which many writers use the same characters ideas and places in their stories often working together It is also the name of the most important group in the setting

On April 27 1992 a member of the USENET newsgroup recartscomics said that his name was Spelling Boy Two days later another member named Danl Danehy Oakes took the name California Kid and said he was a member of the Legion of NetHeroes Soon others were choosing colourful names for themselves such as Cheesecake Eater Lad and CAPTAIN CAPITALIZE 

On May 5 Steven Librande got fed up with the silly nethero names and chose the name Doctor Killfile a netvillain 

Benjamin Pierce or MarvelZombie Lad sent out a call for all netheroes to fight back Forty four different writers worked together on the first LNH story later called The Cosmic Plot Device Caper  The story was never finished and that summer most people forgot about the LNH

In the fall Todd Scavenger Kogutt brought the LNH back  Many new writers and stories appeared Some writers published their stories in multiple parts or serials much like American comic books

The LNH moved to its own newsgroup altcomicslnh before finding their permanent home on recartscomicscreative or RACC RACC is home to other shared universes like ASH OMEGA and 8FOLD Russ Eagle Allbery is RACCs moderator  a person who makes sure ads and pornography do not appear on the group  and archivist  which means he keeps copies of all stories 

The world of the LNH is called the Looniverse In many ways it is like our own universe and Earth But there are some differences For example netheroes netvillains and super powers exist

Many of the cities in the Looniverse have silly names The real city of Chicago is called Sigago in the Looniverse  The LNH itself is based in Netropolis and many stories take place there

Many people in the Looniverse know that they are fictional characters  something which is called breaking the fourth wall For example in one story The Case of the Clueless Mystery by Gary St Lawrence the heroes read the script for the story they are in to find out how to beat the villain

The Looniverse contains many mutually exclusive ideas  things that can not exist at the same time Sometimes characters falling off a cliff are in real danger Other times they pop back into shape like cartoon characters Some characters age in real time Other characters never seem to age at all Yet all these characters exist side by side 

Many of the cities in the Looniverse have net based names Netropolis and Sigago for example

The headquarters of the LNH is based in Netropolis The team has hundreds of members Some of them form sub groups For example one sub group the TSK Force deals with small things like bad manners

Legionnaires can stay at LNHQ for free The building is very strange The size of a room changes to fit the number of people in the room 

It has been hinted in some stories that LNHQ is alive

Because the LNH is so large we can not list all its members in this article Here are a few

The LNH began in 1992 in our world However in the Looniverse the LNH has been around a lot longer than that

In the 19th Century Netropolis was called Babbagetown After the name of the city changed there was a building called the Netropolis Hotel Grand It later became the Legion of NetHeroes Headquarters or LNHHQ 

The first LNH was formed in the 1920s by Boy Lad He was the only member His sidekick Boy Lad Jr was not allowed to join Boy Lad disappeared

Other heroes protected Netropolis

1940s and 1950s

Some members of the Classic Squad later became members of the LNH Old Comics Man Golden Man and Kid Yesterdaze

1960s and 1970s

SigLad a member of the Netastic Nine later joined the LNH Some members of the Legion of NetHippies also joined the Legion of NetHeroes  Nudist Man Super Apathy Lad and Procrastination Boy

1980s

Some stories say that todays LNH started in April of 1992 others say it started in the 1980s 

After the Cosmic Plot Device Caper Rebel Yell became leader of the LNH The entire LNH disappeared In 501 Blues The Long Road to Nowhere Rebel Yell tried to find them all 

The Crysig on Infinite NetEarths was a parody of the DC Comics story Crisis on Infinite Earths Like that story it allowed LNH writers to change things about their characters For example before Crysig Cheesecake Eater Lad was married and farted a lot After Crysig he was single and made cheesecakes It was like the earlier Cheesecake Eater Lad never existed In American comic books this is called a retcon

After Crysig the Ultimate Ninja joined the LNH Rebel Yell shared the leadership with Ultimate Ninja and Continuity Champ Later Rebel Yell left the LNH  Ultimate Ninja became leader of the LNH

The Ultimate Ninja thought an LNH member named Myk El was a traitor and killed him In the story Retcon Hour Myk El came back to life and it was proved that he was not a traitor Retcon Hour was one of the biggest LNH stories and was written by fourteen people 

In Looniverse Adrift the first netvillain Dr Killfile was destroyed Another villain Tsar Chasm also died  Both later returned from the dead httpgroupsgooglecomgrouprecartscomicscreativemsgb9498507038dee7bdmodesourcehlen

Pocket Man married Organic Lass in the first LNH wedding 

In 1999 one of the most popular characters Panta was retconned out of existence 

In 2000 Hexadecimal Luthor  a parody of Superman villain Lex Luthor  became President of the United States He won a second term in 2004

In March of 2001 the city of Sigago was destroyed It was later rebuilt 

In July of 2001 many characters were married 

Here are some of the best liked LNH stories As you can see not all the stories are silly There are many different types of stories and characters

Other groups took ideas from the LNH and made their own groups or imprints

There have been thousands of LNH stories by many writers Writers work together on stories from all over the world the LNH has writers from the United States the United Kingdom Germany Canada the Philippines Brazil Australia and New Zealand It is an open universe which means that anyone can join This is probably why it is still active

Continuity is a word used when talking about art especially serial art Serial art is when an artist paints several pictures which all have something to do with each other 

The six Star Wars films tell one long story which continues from part to part This is where the word continuity comes from Continuity refers to consistency from part to part  that is everything should fit together like one whole piece

At the end of the Star Wars film The Empire Strikes Back Luke Skywalker loses one of his hands In the next film Return of the Jedi he has a fake hand to replace the one he lost If he had his real hand again it wouldnt make sense The audience would say did not he lose his hand in the last one Continuity is making sure things make sense

Sometimes the word is used to refer to any work of art like just one film For example a woman has a full glass of wine in one shot In the next shot the wine is gone In a third shot she has a full glass of wine again That scene would have very poor continuity it does not make sense and it reminds the audience that they are watching a movie Poor continuity is continuity that does not make sense and usually has mistakes

In American comic books many different characters live in the same world For example Superman and Aquaman live in the same world But if Superman goes to Atlantis and its different than Aquamans Atlantis it does not make sense If they are in the same world Atlantis should be the same no matter who visits it

Making sure that all the different stories and characters fit together is working with continuity Sometimes the word is used to talk about the stories themselves

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a chronic progressive almost always fatal neurological disease ALS is marked by slow but steady death of the nerve cells in the central nervous system that control voluntary muscle movement That is people with ALS can no longer move but their heart still beats The disorder causes muscle weakness and muscle shrinking throughout the body In ALS both the upper motor neurons and the lower motor neurons die making them stop sending messages to the muscles Unable to function the muscles gradually weaken and waste away Eventually the ability of the brain to start and control voluntary movement is lost However even patients in later stages of the disease may still have the same intelligence memory and personality they had before it started

ALS does not show many symptoms making it very hard to diagnose It usually affects people ages 40 60 The earliest symptoms may include twitching cramping or stiffness of muscles muscle weakness affecting an arm or a leg slurred and strange sounding nasal speech or having a difficult time chewing or swallowing These general symptoms then develop into clear weakness or atrophy that may cause a physician to believe that a person has ALS

The parts of the body affected by early symptoms of ALS depend on which muscles in the body are affected first About 75 of people have limb onset ALS In some of these cases symptoms first affect one of the legs and patients have awkwardness when walking or running or they notice that they are tripping or stumbling more often Other limb onset patients first see the effects of the disease on a hand or arm as they have a difficult time with simple tasks requiring hand dexterity or ability to move small things such as buttoning a shirt writing or turning a key in a lock

About 25 of cases are bulbar onset ALS These patients first have difficulty speaking clearly Speech becomes hard to understand and slurred Speaking through the nose and softer talking are often the first symptoms Difficulty swallowing and loss of tongue movement follow Eventually total loss of speech and ability to keep the airway clear when swallowing are experienced

No cure has been found for ALS However the Food and Drug Administration has approved the first drug treatment for the disease Riluzole Riluzole is believed to make damage smaller to motor neurons by decreasing the release of glutamate a substance that is found in most ALS patients Clinical trials with ALS patients showed that riluzole gives a better chance of survival by several months mainly in those with a hard time swallowing The drug also allows more time before a patient needs breathing help Riluzole does not heal the damage already done to motor neurons and patients taking the drug must be watched for liver damage and other side effects However this first ALS therapy offers hope that the assault of ALS may one day be slowed by new medications or combinations of drugs

Other treatments for ALS are designed to make symptoms less painful and improve the quality of life for patients This care is best given by teams of health care professionals such as physicians pharmacists physical occupational and speech therapists nutritionists social workers and home care and hospice nurses Working with patients and people who take care of the patient these teams can make a personalized plan of medical and physical therapy and give special equipment that can be used to keep patients as mobile and comfortable as possible

The Fields Medal is a prize given to two three or four people who study math who are not over 40 years of age at each International Congress of the International Mathematical Union a meeting that takes place every four years 

The Canadian mathematician John Charles Fields was the first to propose this medal and it was first awarded in 1936 It has been regularly awarded since 1950 Its purpose is to give recognition and support to younger mathematical researchers who have made major contributions 

The Fields Medal is viewed at least in the media as the top honor a mathematician can receive It comes with a monetary award which in 2006 was C15000

Because of its prestige the Fields Medal is often described as the Nobel Prize of mathematics but the comparison is not so good First it is awarded not only to recognize the valuable contributions of a mathematician but also to encourage him or her to continue his work The Fields Medals have generally been awarded for a mathematicians whole work rather than for a particular result 

Another difference is that the Fields Medal is awarded every four years and its recipients cannot be over the age of 40 Also the money awarded with the medal is much lower than the US13 million given with each Nobel prize

A beaver is a kind of rodent It is semi aquatic meaning some of the time it lives in water some of the time it lives on land Beavers can only be found in North America and Europe In Europe they almost became extinct but they are returning There are beavers living in the Elbe and Rhone rivers as well as in Bavaria Poland and Scandinavia Beavers are known for building and keeping dams in rivers

Currently there are two different species of beaver the American beaver and the European beaver

This beaver can be found in North America in Canada the United States and in Northern Mexico It is the second largest rodent in the world and the largest found in North America The largest rodent of the world is the capybara from South America 

The European beaver is currently an endangered species It was hunted almost to extinction This was done because of its fur and because of castoreum Castoreum is made by a certain gland which is also responsible for the smell of the animal People are currently reintroducing the beaver because the important role of the beaver for the ecology of rivers was discovered Beaver dams provide a habitat for many species

Early visitors that met Indians saw them wearing animal skin blankets The fur on these blankets were good for felting The Europeans wanted felt hats and the Indians wanted metal so fur trading began

Beaver was the most popular fur for hats At that time in North America there were about sixty million beavers Only the soft inside fur was used for felting The best time for collecting the beavers fur was winter when the fur was thickest It was also a good time to hunt since the beaver stayed close to its home in the winter and was easy to catch The fur trade gave more money to the European traders more than the Indians The traders made lots of money on the furs they collected the Indians got the metal tools and pots and beads they wanted but it cost them their way of life and their land

The bladder is an organ in the human body All the liquids that are drunk go through the bladder The bladder takes in the liquid in order for the body to work The bladder works with the kidneys The kidneys clean the liquid we drink This goes on till the bladder is too full to hold any more At this point it is roughly the size of a softball The bladder then tells the brain that it needs to be emptied Once this message is received to the brain the muscles around the bladder start to squeeze and the bladder starts to contract At the same time the bladder sends a message to the sphincters to relax and let the liquid pass

Time travel is the idea of going back in time to the past or forward to the future Time travel can not be done with the technology we have now Still scientists like physicists say that theres a chance that time travel will be possible in the future

Light moves very fast faster than anything else in the universe The speed of light is very high 670616629 miles in one hour Most cars can only travel about 100 miles in one hour and most people can only run 12 miles in one hour As you can see the speed of light is much faster than cars or people 

Scientists say that the closer you get to the speed of light the slower time moves for you To give an example if you went into a rocket ship and flew through space at the speed of light for one day by the time you came back its possible that a whole year could have passed Albert Einstein was famous for his ideas on time

Science fiction and fantasy movies and TV shows have been based on stories of people who travel through time For example the US movie Back to the Future tells a made up story about a professor who builds a machine that can take people into the future or back in the past The popular British TV show Doctor Who is about an alien who has adventures by time traveling

Another example of a made up story about time travel is in Charmed but instead of using machines and science they use magic to go to specific times and places

Psalms is a book of 150 Hebrew poems in the Bible The Book of Psalms is part of the Hebrew Bible or Tanakh and it is also in the Old Testament of the Christian translations People traditionally believe that many of the Psalms in the Bible were written by King David to God Perhaps the most famous one is Psalm 23 which starts The LORD is my shepherd Psalm 23 is often used for funerals

There are 150 Psalms in the Biblical canon of Jews Protestants and Catholics but there are also more poems that these religions do not think are holy Psalm 151 is part of canon of the Eastern Orthodox Church

The names Psalms and Psalter come from the Septuagint There they were about stringed instruments then to songs sung with them The traditional Hebrew title is tehillim Tehillim means praises though many of the psalms are tephillot One of the first collections in the book was titled the prayers of David son of Jesse

The Psalter is poetry though it has many prayers and not all Old Testament prayers were poetic In fact not all praise was poetic either The Psalms are full of images comparisons and metaphor The Hebrew text often plays with words and repeats the same words adding synonyms to fill out the description Important words show the main themes in the prayer or song

Graphite like diamond is an allotrope of carbon They are very similar to each other but the structure of the atom affects the chemical and physical properties Graphite is made of layers of carbon atoms These layers can slide over each other very easily This means that it is very soft It is a dull gray in appearance Due to the delocalized electrons between the layers it can conduct electricity very well

Graphite can be formed from coal put under high heat and pressure Also graphite can be turned into diamond with enough heat and pressure This is how synthetic diamonds are made

Graphite is naturally found in Sri LankaCanada and the United States It is also called Lead Black It was named by Abraham Gottlob Werner in 1789 originating from the Greek language

It can be used as a lubricant to make mechanical devices run smoother The most common use of graphite is the lead in a pencil which also has clay

An allotrope is another form of a substance the substance is very similar but the structure of the substance affects the chemical and physical properties One can consider the many physical aspects in which a allotrope can be perceived For example to one person an article can be referred to as a nib while another is a nub The difference is very limited but can have large effects

Covalent bonds are chemical bonds between two non metal atoms An example is water where hydrogen and oxygen bond together to make As they are both non metalswhich need to gain electronsthey have to share so their outer shells cross over in order to have a full outer shell A full outer shell has eight electrons The electrons in this outer shell are called valence electrons 

The number of valence electrons is decided by the size of the atom Electrons orbit an atomic nucleus in the same kind of way that planets orbit stars There are layers of paths around an atomic nucleus The first layer always contains only two electrons while the layers after that usually contain up to eight 

For example if an atom contained eight total electrons the first two would orbit very close to the nucleus the next 6 would orbit a little farther away Every atom wants a full outer shell That is to say it wants the number of electrons in the outer most layer to be as high as they can be Since most atoms outer shells can support up to eight electrons this is the number of electrons most atoms want in their outer shell In this example the atom had eight total electrons and six in the outer shell Since there are fewer than eight electrons in the outer shell the atom will want to fill the places for two electrons with electrons borrowed from another atom When an atom borrows electrons with another atom a covalent bond is formed

With water the oxygen atom shares one electron with each hydrogen atom and the hydrogens also share one this means that the hydrogen atoms have two each and the oxygen atom has eight

Covalent bonds are weaker than ionic bonds and have a lower melting point They are also thought to be poor conductors of electricity 

Uses of bond bonds bonded and bonding

An ionic bond is the bonding between a non metal and a metal that occurs when charged atoms attract after one loses one or more of its electrons for example sodium and chlorine This makes the bond stronger and harder to break

In other words it is the attraction between 2 oppositely charged ions The positive ion is called cation and the negative ion is the anion It is like the north and south poles of magnet

Chloride is an ion of chlorine It occurs when chlorine gets reduced gaining an electrons and becoming an ion Chloride is necessary for life It is normally found in the salt sodium chloride which is very common in diets

Bauhaus is the common term for the Staatliches Bauhaus an art and architecture school in Germany that operated from 1919 to 1933 in Germany and in the United States from 1937 1938 The most natural meaning for its name is Architecture House It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site

Intelligence is a property of the mind People do not agree on what intelligence is exactly The idea comes from Latin intelligo A part of intelligence allows people to solve problems These problems may be easy to solve They may also be hard to solve and involve abstract thought 

If a solution is found to a problem it can be remembered That way the problem is solved more quickly when it comes up again That is what is called learning

There is disagreement about what has more impact on intelligence genetics or environment

Some people say that intelligence can be tested An intelligence test for them would be solving many problems in a very short time Most of the problems have to do with seeing things or telling what a rotated shape will look like Some are also related to mathematics for example to tell what number is next Other tests have to do with words After doing such a test they will then calculate a number they call Intelligence Quotient Since most of the words on these tests have to do with Latin some people say that an Intelligence Quotient only measures how much a person has learned Latin People in other parts of the world have very different ideas about the mind

Some people try to build machines that try to act as if they were intelligent That is related to Computer science and is called Artificial intelligence

Some say that intelligent behaviour is when an organism reacts enough to a stimulus 

Nuevo Leon is a state in the northeast of Mexico and south of Texas It is known as the financial center of the country It has a wide range of tourist attractions such as museums thematic parks natural parks grottos as well as archaeological sites gastronomy and folklore Its capital Monterrey the city of the mountains is host venue of important international events congresses fairs conventions and exhibitions

Go Fish is a game with playing cards 2 to 10 people can play

Every player gets five cards The rest of the cards are put face down where all the players can get them Cards that are the same color and the same number are called pairs If a player has a pair they put it face up in front of them so everybody can see it The player to the left of the player who gave everybody their cards goes first When it is a players turn they ask another player for a card that is the same color and number as one they already have They can ask any player If the other player has the card they give it to the one that asked and the one that asked puts the pair in front of them and gets to go again If the other player does not have the card then they say Go Fish and the player that asked takes a card from the deck and the next player goes If a player has no cards when it is time for him to go then he just takes a card from the deck and the next player goes If there are no cards in the deck and the player has no cards then that player does not get to go The game ends when all the cards are face up in pairs The winner is the player with the most pairs

Pollination is part of sexual reproduction in plants It describes the pollen grains getting to the female parts of a plant Pollen grains which contain the male gametes need to get to where the female gamete are 

What happens is basically the same as sexual reproduction in animals Each pollen grain is haploid it has half of the DNA that is needed to make a new plant During fertilization this combines with the DNA that is in the egg of the female part and a zygote is formed In seed plants a seed is started

In flowering plants pollen has to get from one flower to another There are two main ways that this can happen by non living things like wind or water or by living things such as insects or birds

Maize is pollinated by wind The male anthers let go of their pollen and it blows over to a nearby female flower on another corn plant Most of the flowers are either male or female on a corn plant rather than both sexes in one flower

Maize flowers have evolved to use wind for pollination They do not need pretty petals The pollen is light so it can blow around and the ends of the female parts are fluffy to catch all the tiny pollen grains

Tomato plants need bees to move the pollen from the male parts of one flower to the female parts of another flower The bee moves between flowers not because it is feeling helpful but because it needs to collect the sweet nectar that the flowers have on offer The bees take the nectar home to their hive to make honey and the tomato plants get to reproduce

Because the tomato flowers have evolved to attract bees they have spread out petals and are white to human eyes The pollen is often stuck together in clumps called pollinia which in turn get stuck to the bee Bees are extremely hairy and carry tiny electric charges which attract the pollen onto their bodies Honey bees have special pollen baskets usually on their rear legs they groom the pollen off their bodies into these pockets 

Much of the pollen gets taken back to the nest or hive where it is used as a source of protein most needed by the larvae Some gets rubbed off on the next flower where the female stigma is sticky A pollen tube grows down to permit the male gamete to fertilize an egg and make a seed

80 of plants are pollinated by living things and only 20 use abiotic pollination Of these abiotic pollinations 98 is done by wind and just 2 by water

Gulls also called seagulls are birds They form the family Laridae in the order Charadriiformes

There are many different types of gull but most of them are white with grey or black wings a yellow beak and are about the size of a chicken Gulls can eat most types of food but like meat more than anything else They look around for discarded food and dead animals to eat as well as hunting and have learned how to live and breed in the same places as people Most types of seagull are awake during the day and sleep at night They like to sleep on water like lakes or the sea when the water is calm

Gulls used to be found only near the sea as they are water birds with webbed feet for swimming They are more common inland these days because they can find food wherever people live often on garbage dumps or in the streets of towns and cities Seagulls are intelligent compared to other birds and have a very complicated system of noises and body movements that they use to talk to other seagulls

Most types of seagull breed once a year and have two or three chicks Mother gulls are very protective of their eggs and chicks and will sometimes fight to the death to defend them

Gulls are not usually eaten by people

The Warriors is a 1979 movie directed by Walter Hill It is about a gang called The Warriors who are from Coney Island and must return to their home and clear their name after they are accused of killing the leader of another gang at a rally for all the gangs in New York City The movie has become a cult classic and inspired a video game which came out in 2005

Coney Island is a famous area in Brooklyn New York It is a peninsula It is famous for its beaches amusements boardwalk and hot dogs

We do not know how it got its name for sure Some people think it is because of its cone shaped like islands Other say that when the Dutch people arrived there was a large population of rabbits so they named it Coney Island which meant Rabbit Island in English at that time Other people think that it was named after the Irish pirate who named it after one of the islands in Ireland But who knows There might be a totally different reason why it was named the Coney Island

World music is a term which is used in Western countries to describe traditional music or folk music from many different parts of the world This music is sung or played by people who live in the area World music can be anything from a short song to a long Indian raga

Not everybody likes the term world music People in some parts of the world think that when people talk about world music they are thinking that it is simple or primitive However this is certainly not the case because world music may often have very complicated rhythms or use pitches which are far mor complex than those in traditional western composed music

This genre of music is increasingly emerging in popular culture as heard in the Sony PlayStation 2 video game FIFA 07 which is a soccer game that features many modes of difficulty from amateur to legendary status Soccer fans are most likely to be world beat listeners while NASCAR fans are most likely to listen to either country music andor rock and roll music

Caprinae is a subfamily of the even toed ungulate family Bovidae Animals of the Caprinae subfamily are called caprid or goat antelope

The domestic sheep and domestic goat are part of this group

The domestic goat is a domesticated mammal It comes from the Wild Goat

A male goat is called a buck and a castrated goat is called a whether a female is called a doe Young goats are called kids

People eat their meat drink their milk and use their fur and skin With goat milk cheese can be made along with other dairy products Some farmers use goats to eat plants the farmers do not want called weeds Other times the goats are used to keep grasses and other plants from getting too tall 

The domestic goat has cloven hooves a long beard on its chin a short tail that turns up and horns that grow up from the head in an arc The hair is straight with a woolly coat under it during winter

The domestic goat is about 70 120 cm They weigh from 45 54 kg

The diet of the domestic goat includes eating grass trees shrubs bushes and many other kinds of plants If domestic goats are allowed to eat in one place they would eat off almost all the plants on the land Some ranchers use Goats to clear brush and unwanted plants from their pastures Goats living in the desert where plants are quite hard to find have been seen climbing trees to get food

Domestic goats are smart and active They enjoy playing and climbing They are social animals that live in a herd

They are kept for their wool and their meat The wool of sheep after cleaning and treating is used to make woollen clothes The meat of young sheep is called lamb and the meat from adult sheep is called mutton Both are economically important products which have been used since prehistoric times

Sheep are domesticated animals which have been bred by man There are breeds which specialise in wool or meat

The plural of Sheep is just Sheep It is not Sheeps

A group of sheep is called a flock Sheep follow each other in basically the same way all the time so there are special names for the different roles sheep play in a flock The sheep that is farthest away from the others is called the outlier a word that is also used in statistics This sheep is willing to go out farther away from the safety of the flock to graze but takes a chance that a predator like a wolf will attack it first because it is alone Another sheep the bellwether which never goes first but always follows an outlier is the one that signals to the others that it is safe to go that way When it moves the others will also move Tendency to be outliers or to be bellwethers or stick in the middle of the flock seems to stay with a sheep its whole life There might be genes that make them repeat this role behaviour

Probably the most famous sheep was Dolly the Sheep She was named after Dolly Parton and was the first large mammal clone She did not live as long as a regular sheep because clones have health problems This is only known because of Dolly 

These sheep are so named because they can store large amounts of fat in the tail and the region of the rump They are kept mainly because they make more milk than other types of sheep but their wool is rough and long and is mostly used for making carpets Fat tailed sheep are found mainly in the very dry parts of Africa the Middle East and Asia and they represent about 25 percent of the sheep in the world The major breeds are the Awassi Bakhtiari Karakul Ghashghai and Kermani

People may be called sheep if they follow a leader without thinking This is what is called a figurative meaning its a figure of speech 

Capra is a genus of the subfamily Caprinae and the family Bovidae The domestic goat and other animals like it belong to this genus

Ballroom dance is the name for a number of dances done in ballrooms It usually means pairs dancing separately from other pairs The most important difference in style is between the modern or standard dances and the latin dances The modern dances are the waltz quickstep foxtrot tango and Viennese waltz The latin dances are the cha cha cha samba rumba paso doble and jive However there are also sequence dances where dancers move together in a pre set pattern 

All these dances can be danced socially more or less any way people want to As competition dances they are organised under the rule of the World Dance Council These competitions are danced in the International style the techniques were developed by English dancers in the 20th century All major international competitions are conducted within detailed regulations There are other systems of dance regulated by national bodies American style is one Scottish dancing is another Greek classical dance is another 

Although the most famous dancers were Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers they did not dance in ballrooms Their career together was entirely on film Astair danced also on the stage and on television The most famous American pair of ballroom dancers was Vernon and Irene Castle who were national figures until Vernons death in 1918 Later Arthur Murrays chain of dance schools taught many Americans to dance The most famous English ballroom dancer was probably Victor Silvester who was a professional dancer and a very successful bandleader

There are ten international style ballroom dances five standard and five Latin

Most of these are dances that started in other places but were developed in their modern form by English dancers and dance teachers

Most people do these dances for fun When people compete against each other the women wear formal dresses for standard competition and short skirts for Latin Men wear formal evening wear for standard and informal shirts for Latin

Some people earn medals to show how they are improving They dance in front of a judge to earn a medal at the Bronze Silver or Gold levels Ballroom dance teaching and medal awards is done by Dance Teacher organisations such as the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing or the International Dance Teachers Association These organisations also do ballet stage dancing and several other types of dance Their qualifications and exams are held world wide even though they are English in origin Street dance as the name suggests does not need a ballroom Nevertheless it is being taught in ballrooms as are some other kinds of non traditional dance

There are also some line dances in which people dance as a group instead of with a partner Some line dances are done to Mambo Waltz Paso Doble and Samba

Some people dance in couples but also as a group with everyone doing the same steps This is called formation dancing

People compete at many levels but the basic division is between amateurs and professionals Then amongst amateurs there are ages grades

The Nasal cavity is the inside of your nose

The nasal cavity is divided into a right and left passageway The tissue that covers the wall of your nasal cavity contains many blood vessels Heat from the blood in the vessels helps warm the air as you breath Moisture is added to the air you breath by special cells in the walls of the nasal cavity The air is warmed and moistened before it reaches your lungs Cilia and mucus along the inside wall of the nasal cavity trap and remove dust and germs from the air as it flows through the nasal cavity The cilia move the mucus down the nasal cavity to the pharynx where it can be swallowed

The nasal cavity is covered by the nasal bone above and by the maxilla and ethmoid bone on the sides The top of the inside of the mouth separates the nasal cavity from the mouth The nasal cavity is divided in two by a vertical fin called the nasal septum On the sides of the nasal cavity are three horizontal outgrowths called turbinates These turbinates guide the air through the nasal cavity The vomeronasal organ is found at the back of the septum and has a role in finding pheromones

Diseases of the nasal cavity include viral infections and nasal cavity cancer Picking your nose can lead to bloody noses as well

A subtropical cyclone is a cyclonic weather storm Subtropical cyclones have wide wind patterns with the winds getting stronger as they get farther away from the centre of the storm

A subtropical cyclone is more likely to be a tropical cyclone than an extratropical cyclone Subtropical cyclones are only found in the northern Atlantic Ocean and in the eastern Pacific Ocean Like normal tropical cyclones most subtropical cyclones have maximum wind speeds of at least 39 mph to 74 mph Subtropical cyclones that have wind speeds less than 39 mph are known as subtropical depressions

During the 1950s and 60s subtropical cyclones were simply called semi tropical There was much discussion between meteorologists in the late 1960s as of what a subtropical cyclone was So in 1972 the National Hurricane Center officially classified the word under a new category different from actual tropical cyclones During the 1970s the NHC began making a new list of names separate for subtropical cyclones although that process was soon canceled because it was rejected by many scientists After that subtropical storms were just numbered such as Hurricane Karen from 2001 which was originally named Subtropical Storm One But on 2002 a policy change had tropical and subtropical storms share the same list of names for the whole season which started with Subtropical Storm Nicole in 2004

In the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season the NHC monitored the first named subtropical cyclone its name was Subtropical Storm Nicole Later another unnamed subtropical cyclone was discovered in the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season after someone re read the records Although it could have been named the subtropical storm remained without a name because the time of the discovery happened a long time after the official season had finished A third subtropical cyclone was named Subtropical Storm Andrea which formed on May 9 just before the start of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season

A subtropical cyclone can form in many ways

The most common type of a subtropical cycle is an upper level cold low with circulation expanding to the surface layer and strongest winds usually happening at a radius of about 100 miles160 kilometers or more from the center

Another type of a subtropical cyclone is a mesoscale low forming in or near an area of horizontal wind shear also known as a dying frontal zone with radius of strongest winds normally less than 30 miles The entire circulation may originally have a diameter of less than 100 miles160 kilometres These cyclones usually last for a short time They may be either cold core or warm core and for some time in 1972 this type of subtropical cyclone was called as a neutercane As of 2006 the warm core type was moved under the definition of the term tropical cyclone and removed from the subtropical cyclone definition

Morning is the time of day from 1200 AM to 12 PM Morning is usually cooler than afternoon Many people say it is not morning until they wake up This is wrong because morning starts at 1200 AM

Okinawa is the name for the islands in the far south of Japan There are hundreds of small islands in Okinawa These islands make up Okinawa Prefecture The capital of Okinawa is Naha Naha is on the island with the most people Okinawa island Okinawa used to be called the Ryukyu islands 

Many of Okinawas islands are scenic and there are many beaches there 

The temperature in Okinawa is often warm or hot Many animals make their home around the Okinawa islands For example sea turtles jellyfish and many kinds of birds all live around Okinawa

An average person in Okinawa lives to be older than 90 Some people think that is because Okinawan food is healthy Fish is very popular but people also eat sea vegetables and pork

Okinawas music is popular all over Japan A musical instrument called a sanshin is often used

Okinawa was the site of the last big battles World War II the Battle of Okinawa A lot of Okinawan people died during the battle Now the United States has some military bases for soldiers on the different islands of Okinawa

Okinawa is currently a part of Japan However it has its own history and culture distinguished from Japan The history of Okinawa is usually divided into five eras as follows

In prehistoric era hunting animals and collecting plants were mainly prevailing among the people A shift to farming economy advanced during from 10th to 12th century Many communities were formed and integrated into three small countries In 1372 one of these countries had belonged to Min dynasty which is one of the dynasties in China This small country had become strong because of profits from the trade with Min dynasty then it unified the countries It is Ryukyu kingdom Ryukyu kingdom flourished by trade in Asian whole area not only with China during 15th and 16th century

In 1609 Shimazu invaded Ryukyu kingdom and made it subordinate Shimazu was the feudal lord who ruled over one region of Japan Satsuma han han means the unit that a feudal lord ruled over This invasion meant that Ryukyu kingdom had been incorporated in Japanese shogunate regime This domination continued until the end of the 19th century

In 1867 Japanese shogunate gave back government to Tenno who is the Japanese Emperor Japanese shogunate regime had ended then The Japanese new government had a policy to incorporate Ryukyu kingdom in the Japanese regime So Ryukyu kingdom was reorganized soon At first in 1871 Ryukyu kingdom was renamed Ryukyu han it meant that Ryukyu was directly controlled by Japan without Satsuma han In 1879 It was reorganized as Okinawa ken Ken means prefecture Ryukyu kingdom was perfectly ruined at that time Okinawa became a Japanese colony

At first of colonization Japan emphasized difference between Okinawan and Japanese culture because it justified a discriminatory policy in the colony However to justify colonization against the Western countries policies were changed into ones which emphasized similarity of them and assimilated Okinawa into Japan Thus Okinawan society had been influenced from Japan more and more The biggest influence was that Okinawa was rolled up in Japanese war mainly against USA and China Okinawa was incorporated into the part of the war system In the end of the wartime Okinawa in itself became the battlefield and the social infrastructure was completely destroyed and many people died 

After the war Okinawa was put under the US military administration The people expected freedom and democracy but did not come true to give priority to the US military policy Therefore movement in search of administrative authority return to Japan was strengthened it was carried out in 1972 However the problem continues up to the present in order that Japanese government gives priority to US military policy afterwards Many US military bases are still left and crimes by the US soldiers continue to become the social problem

Subtropical Storm Nicole was the fourteenth named storm and first subtropical cyclone to form during the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season Additionally it was the first subtropical storm to be given a name from the standard hurricane naming list and be considered a subtropical cyclone in real time The storm never made landfall as a subtropical cyclone though its remnants affected Anticosti Island just off of the provinces of Prince Edward Island and Quebec

Nicoles genesis appeared to be associated with an upper tropospheric trough and a decaying frontal system located over the southwestern North Atlantic in early October By October 8 a broad area of surface low pressure became evident about 400 miles southeast of Bermuda Shortly thereafter the system began to produce gale force winds affecting Bermuda on October 9 Early the next day analysis from the National Hurricane Center determined that the low pressure system had acquired sufficient tropical characteristics to be classified as a subtropical storm whereupon it was assigned the name Nicole

Steadily tracking over cooler waters toward the northwest Nicole lost all of its tropical characteristics and was declared fully extratropical on October 11 345 miles south southeast of Halifax Nova Scotia The Canadian Hurricane Centre continued to issue advisories on what was referred to as Post tropical Storm Nicole which had subsequently merged with a stronger mid latitude cyclone The resultant weather system producing heavy rainfall across the Maritimes in the vicinity of Anticosti Island on October 14

No damage or fatalities were reported for that Nicole never made landfall or directly affected any land areas It brought light rain to Bermuda and briefly threatened it before heading northeast Its remnants combined with a stronger cyclone affecting Anticosti Island in Canada however no significant damage was caused in the area

Since 2002 subtropical storms have been assigned names from the same naming sequence as tropical storms As such Nicole was the first named subtropical storm to receive a name under this rule Many subtropical cyclones between 1975 and 2001 with a sufficiently tropical nature were either considered fully tropical storms or numbered Initially however the phonetic alphabet was used to name subtropical cyclones

For official forecasts see the NHCs public advisory archive on Subtropical Storm Nicole 

Cyanides are chemicals that contain the cyano group In that group a carbon atom has three bindings to a nitrogen atom This group is present in many substances Many of them are gases but some are solids or liquids Those substances that can release the compound CN are highly poisonous

Certain bacteria fungi and algae are able to produce cyanides Cyanides are also found in certain foods or plants In plants the cyanides are usually bound to sugar molecules The cyanides serve as a defense against being eaten by herbivores 

In popular culture cyanides are said to be highly toxic As stated above there are many cyanides that really are but many others that are not Prussian blue is given as a treatment to poisoning with Thallium and Caesium for example

The poisons referred to are usually hydrogen cyanide and the chemicals which are similar to it like potassium cyanide and sodium cyanide Organic compounds that contain the CN group are called nitriles Many of them are not as toxic as the ones cited before Some of them are even used to produce drugs

Some people think that glucose may be an antidote against cyanide poisoning They think that sugar can bind the free cyano group That way the some of the poison could be neutralized

The 2006 Atlantic hurricane season was a annual event in the yearly cycle of tropical cyclones It officially started on June 1 2006 and lasted until November 30 2006 Ten tropical storms formed during the season Five became hurricanes and one tropical storm did not have a name

This season was unusual in that no hurricanes made landfall in the United States of America One tropical storm Tropical Storm Zeta from the 2005 season continued into January which was the second time on record that a tropical cyclone existed in two calendar years

Because of the super active 2005 season forecasts and meteorologist thought that the 2006 season would also be very active but not as active as 2005 However an El Nio event combined with the presence of the Saharan Air Layer over the tropical Atlantic Ocean contributed to a slow season and forcing all tropical cyclones to dissipate after October 2

On June 10 an area of thunderstorms became the years first tropical depression This storm moved closer to Florida and the depression became a tropical storm on the morning of June 11 In the Gulf of Mexico warm waters helped the storm to grow in strength but it weakened slightly over the cooler waters near the coast of the United States

Alberto crossed the coast about 50 miles southeast of Tallahassee Florida on June 13 Parts of Cedar Key and Crystal River were flooded from the high sea waves associated with Alberto Because Alberto was big in size it took a long time to weaken over Georgia South Carolina and North Carolina Alberto moved to the northeast as it changed from a tropical cyclone to an extratropical cyclone As an extratropical storm Alberto quickly became stronger while off the New England coast Damage in the United States was about 565000

One tropical storm formed in July off the United States coast It was not identified as a storm at the time therefore the storm did not have a name It was identified as a tropical storm when a close review was taken at the end of 2006 If it was identified at the time it would have been named Beryl 

In the middle of July a series of low pressure areas formed off the United States The southern most low slowly moved to the south as it became more organized a few hundred miles east of the North Carolina coast On the morning of July 18 the low pressure area became the second tropical depression of the season more than a month after Tropical Storm Alberto existed That afternoon the depression became Tropical Storm Beryl

Beryl continued moving to the north until it turned to the northeast on July 20 Beryl moved parallel to the East Coast of the United States and crossed over Nantucket Island before becoming extratropical southwest of Nova Scotia on July 21

On about July 26 a large and well organized tropical wave formed off the coast of Africa and slowly moved westward It slowly developed due to poor environmental conditions and it became a tropical depression late on 31 July about convert160mikm0 east of Antigua The depression soon strengthened further and was named Tropical Storm Chris six hours later National Hurricane Center forecasters dismissed some computer models which dissipated Chris quickly as they did not have a handle on the strength of the storm Tropical Storm Chris moved to the northwest and slowly strengthened before reaching its peak strength on August 2 with winds of convert65mphkmh0 when it was to the northeast of the United States Virgin Islands The storm was forecast to strengthen further and become a hurricane as it moved into the Bahamas and thus into the Gulf of Mexico However Chris began to be affected by strong wind shear and became disorganized The storm weakened to a tropical depression on August 4 and dissipated as it approached the Cuban coast

In response and some fear to the storms projected path into the Gulf of Mexico prices for crude oil rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange at branch offices in London Natural gas prices rose considerably in New York Mercantile Exchange electronic trading on August 2 Anticipation of a threat to supply by a potential Hurricane Chris coupled with high demand during an ongoing heat wave are cited as reasons for the price move Also numerous oil rigs were closed and ditched in response to the storm for the fear of Hurricane Katrina a year earlier On August 2 approximately 600 tourists evacuated the Puerto Rican islands of Vieques and Culebra as tropical storm warnings had been issued Cruise lines such as Royal Caribbean re routed their ships to avoid the storm In Puerto Rico rainfall from the storm caused the Fajardo River to overflow its banks The overflown waters temporarily closed a highway in the northeastern portion of the island Rainfall reached up to 2 inches across portions of Hispaniola the Turks and Caicos the Bahamas and eastern Cuba and reached 4 inches in some mountainous areas 

A tropical system off the coast of Africa which the NHC was monitoring for several days was upgraded to tropical depression status on August 21 and designated as Tropical Depression Four Consequently a tropical storm warning was immediately issued for the Cape Verde islands as the system threatened to pass over or near the southern part of the archipelago However the system failed to strengthen into a tropical storm before passing the chain of islands and the warning was discontinued the following morning

The depression was upgraded to a tropical storm and was named Debby late on August 22 While it had been expected to strengthen into a hurricane Debby weakened into a tropical depression on August 26 It continued to the north and lost tropical characteristics on August 27 

At 315 pm EDT on 24 August a reconnaissance flight determined that a tropical wave passing through the Windward Islands had developed a closed tropical circulation and advisories were commenced on Tropical Depression Five By 5 pm EDT on 25 August a second flight had found sustained tropical storm force winds and the system was named Ernesto Ernesto became a hurricane on the morning of 27 August just south of Haiti before it was downgraded back to a tropical storm in the afternoon The storm caused 2 deaths in Haiti due to rainfall

Ernesto made landfall near Guantanamo Bay Cuba early in the morning on 28 August At one point the storm was predicted to become a major hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico and threaten parts of the Gulf Coast a grim possibility in light of the one year anniversary of Hurricane Katrinas landfall However Ernesto moved much farther east than anticipated and made landfall as a tropical storm on the southern tip of Florida on 29 August Two people died in Florida in road traffic accidents attributed to the weather conditions as the cyclone slowly moved northward across the southern half of the peninsula Ernesto restrengthened into a tropical storm as it emerged from land near Cape Canaveral and was just below hurricane strength when it made landfall again in North Carolina on 31 August

Damage in Virginia totaled to 104 million

Tropical Depression Six formed from an area of low pressure midway between Africa and the Lesser Antilles on 3 September Initial strengthening of the depression was slow due to shearing wind conditions Despite the moderate to high wind shear it strengthened enough to become Tropical Storm Florence on the morning of 5 September After becoming a tropical storm Florences wind field began to expand greatly at one point tropical storm force winds extended outward up to 405 miles from the center With a disorganized structure and multiple circulation centers Florence remained a weak tropical storm for several days even after external conditions became favorable for strengthening Around the evening of 8 September it resolved to a single center and steady strengthening resumed  science had prevailed as one forecaster remarked On the morning of 10 September Florence reached hurricane strength Large swells rip tide and undertow were reported on Bermuda the Leeward Islands the Virgin Islands and Hispaniola Florence soon reached its peak as a Category 1 hurricane very near Bermuda and became extratropical on 12 September while still a hurricane

As Hurricane Florence moved norhtwestward an area of low pressure with scattered thunderstorm activity slowly became more organized while northeast of the Lesser Antilles On the evening of September 10 it developed a closed circulation and was called Tropical Depression Seven It continued to strengthen and was then named Tropical Storm Gordon on September 11 and Hurricane Gordon late on September 12 Gordon attained Category 2 status on the evening of September 13 and was further upgraded to Category 3 status that same night making it the first major hurricane of the season

Around September 16 it was nearly froze for some time in the mid Atlantic about 1000 miles east of Bermuda and became a weak hurricane However it subsequently accelerated eastwards and strengthened to become category 2 On 19 September hurricane warnings were issued for the Azores as the predicted path passed through the center of that archipelago It became extratropical on September 20 after passing through Azorean waters but the remnants side swiped north western Spain and then moved rapidly north towards Ireland and the west of Britain on September 21 By the morning of September 22 it had become absorbed into a large Atlantic low to the west of Ireland

On September 10 an area of clustered thunderstorms began to move off the western African coast It quickly became stronger and organized itself to become Tropical Depression Eight Continuing to organize it reached tropical storm strength on September 13 becoming a hurricane on September 16 and a major hurricane on September 17 Helene moved generally west northwestward before commencing a northeasterly turn Large currents from Helene lashed Bermuda The hurricane then became an extratropical storm on September 24 and died shortly after

An area of low pressure in mid Atlantic generated active thunderstorms for several days and eventually organized into Tropical Depression Nine on 27 September and a tropical storm by 28 September By that time it was about convert810mikm0 east southeast of Bermuda It became a hurricane on 30 September and passed about convert280mikm0 east of Bermuda before swinging northwards towards Newfoundland As it was still a strong tropical storm near the Avalon Peninsula tropical storm warnings were issued on 2 October due to the potential for high winds Isaac passed convert45kmmi0 to the southeast of Cape Race late that afternoon The Canadian Hurricane Centre reports that if Isaac had tracked just 50 to 100 km further north than it did the St Johns area would have experienced much higher winds than the peak gust of convert54kmhmph0 it received

At its closest approach to the Avalon Peninsula Isaac was still tropical and had maximum sustained winds of convert50knmph0 and a minimum central pressure of 993 mbar Strongest winds on land in Newfoundland were reported at Cape Race where a maximum gust to convert96kmhmph0 with a sustained wind of convert74kmhmph0 was recorded At Cape Pine a peak wind was reported at convert76kmhmph0 However due to Isaacs small size and fast forward speed winds were lighter over most of the Avalon Peninsula

Rainfall from Isaac was not reported to be higher than convert25mmin0 in most areas due to Isaacs speed and decreasing amount of moisture The highest measured amount was convert26mmin0 at Cape Race while Cape Pine reported convert19mmin0 and St Johns reported less than convert10mmin0

The table on the right shows the ACE for each storm in the season ACE is broadly speaking a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed so storms that last a long time as well as particularly strong hurricanes have high ACEs ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 35 knots or tropical storm strength 

The cumulative ACE for this season was toward the lower end of the official Near Normal grading The number of tropical storms and hurricanes was near the long term average

These names will be used for storms that form in the North Atlantic in 2006 The names not retired from this list will be used again in the 2012 season The list is the same as the 2000 seasons list except for Kirk which replaced Keith 

While it had been previously reported that a new backup list would be chosen the National Hurricane Center reported in its first tropical weather outlook for the season that it would again use names from the Greek alphabet should the main list run out It would again start with Alpha

No names were retired and this was announced by the World Meteorological Organization in the spring of 2007 The names will be used again for 2012 Atlantic hurricane season

The 500 Series Shinkansen are currently the third fastest high speed train on the Shinkansen network They run on the Tokaido and Sanyo Shinkansen railway lines The 500 Series Shinkansen runs only the Nozomi service This means it stops at the fewest amount of stations Because of this it is the fastest Shinkansen service All 500 Series services are run with 16 cars Seats on 13 cars of the 16 cars train are reserved

The 500 Series is going to be replaced by the N700 Series Shinkansen in 2009 When this happens the 500 series will run with fewer cars and will stop at more stations It will be running a slower Hikari service instead of a Nozomi service

Logical volume management is a method of allocating computer storage It is about allocating space on mass storage devices like hard drives It is more flexible than the partitioning of the drive into static volumes With a logical volume manager it is possible to grow partitions even beyond the size of one physical disk It is also possible to use striping or to put partitions together and combine them while they are being used 

Logical volume management is a form of virtualisation It makes it easier to adapt to the changing storage needs of computer users

 Design 

Volume managers differ but some basic concepts exist across most versions The volume manager starts with physical volumes or PVs which can be hard disk partitions RAID devices or SAN LUNs PVs are split into small chunks of even size called physical extents or PEs The PEs are then pooled into a volume group or VG

The pooled PEs can then be concatenated together into virtual disk partitions called logical volumes or LVs These LVs behave just like hard disk partitions mountable file systems can be created on them or they can be used as raw block devices for swap

The LVs can be grown by concatenating more PEs from the pool Some volume managers allow LV shrinking some allow online resizing in either direction Changing the size of the LV does not necessarily change the size of a filesystem on it it merely changes the size of its containing space A file system that can be resized online is recommended because it allows the system to adjust its storage on the fly without interrupting applications

PVs may also be organized into physical volume groups or PVGs This allows LVs to be mirrored by pairing together its PEs with redundant ones on a different PVG so that the failure of one PVG will still leave at least one complete copy of the LV online In practice PVGs are usually chosen so that their PVs reside on different sets of disks andor data buses for maximum redundancy

Some volume managers also implement snapshotting by applying copy on write to each PE In this scheme the volume manager will copy a PE to a COW table just before it is written to This preserves an old version of the LEthe snapshotwhich can later be reconstructed by overlaying the copy on write table on the current LE Snapshots which are read write are branching snapshots because they implicitly allow diverging versions of an LE

Snapshots can be useful for backing up self consistent versions of volatile data like table files from a busy database or for rolling back large changes in one swoop such as an operating system upgrade Some Linux based LiveCD systems also use snapshots to simulate read write access on a read only compact disc

The levels of indirection that volume managers introduce can complicate disaster recovery especially when the base operating system and other essential tools are themselves on an LE

Many operating systems ship with LVMs

Jam is a condiment It is made from fruit usually by adding sugar and sometimes pectin Most jams are cooked

Usually a jam contains as much sugar as it contains fruit The two parts are then cooked together

In the European Union there is the jam directive It sets minimum standards for the amount of fruit in jam but the definition of fruit was expanded This was done to take several unusual kinds of jam made in the EU into account For this purpose fruit is considered to include fruits that are not usually treated as fruits such as tomatoes fruits that are not normally made into jams such as melons and watermelons and vegetables that are sometimes made into jams such as rhubarb carrots sweet potatoes cucumbers and pumpkins This definition continues to apply in the new directive Council Directive 2001113EC

Marmalade is jam made from oranges

Joan Mir used blackberry jam as an art medium

Old is the opposite of new When something is not considered new anymore it may be considered old It is also the opposite of young

Old can refer to someone or somethings age

Old can mean that something is out of date or past its sell by date

Different things go out of date or grow old at different rates For example technology has a short life span and can be considered old after only one year Human beings can by considered young at 20 years old yet a cat would be considered old at 20 years old because humans live much longer than cats

Robert Schumann was a famous German composer He lived in the time called the Romantic period He had to give up his plans for being a concert pianist because he injured his hand He published a music magazine and wrote a lot of articles about music that had just been composed His music is full of things that are typical of Romantic music it is full of emotion the pieces often have titles that describe things and they are often inspired by literature He wrote a great deal of piano music Some of this music is hard to play but other pieces are quite easy Many children learn to play some of the pieces in his Album for the Young His songs are among the best ever written He also wrote larger works like symphonies and concertos and chamber music Sometimes he felt very happy but at other times he was very depressed These changes of mood can be heard in a lot of his music

Robert Schumann was the fifth and youngest child of a bookseller and publisher As a boy he liked reading the books in his fathers shop He began to compose when he was seven At school he was extremely good at music and literature He passed his school leaving examination with very high marks His family wanted him to be a lawyer so he went to Leipzig to study law but he hardly ever went to any lectures He was much more interested in music and literature but also in women and drinking He took piano lessons from a teacher called Friedrich Wieck Wieck had a 9 year old daughter Clara Many years later she was to become his wife Clara was a brilliant pianist Her father took her on concert tours because she was a prodigy

Schumann started to compose short piano pieces and songs He loved the music of Schubert and when he heard that Schubert had died he cried all night He often practised the piano for seven hours a day However he started to have problems with his fingers It has often been said that he hurt his hands because he made something to stretch his fingers but people now think it was more likely due to mercury poisoning because doctors had used mercury to try to cure his syphilis Whatever the reason he could not continue to be a pianist and he spent the rest of his life composing and writing about music Many of his articles appeared in a journal called Neue Zeitschrift fr Musik which he started

In 1834 he became engaged to a girl of sixteen called Ernestine but then Schumann broke off the engagement because he loved Clara Wieck Claras parents did not want her to marry him Her father did everything he could to stop the marriage Maybe he guessed that Schumann had syphilis maybe he knew that he was often drunk In the end after many arguments court cases and secret meetings between Robert and Clara they were married in 1840

Schumann suffered from manic depression When he was depressed he hardly wrote anything but 1840 was a happy year for him and he wrote lots of songs as well as orchestral music In 1841 he wrote four symphonies In 1842 they went on a concert tour together but Schumann found it difficult because Clara was more famous than he was He returned alone to Leipzig to work at his publishing He felt depressed again at this time and drank a lot of beer and champagne He was happy again when Clara returned and composed some chamber music In 1844 they toured Russia and played to the Tsar By August he had a complete nervous breakdown and could not bear to listen to his own music It took him some time to recover

By now he was good at writing all kinds of music He wrote music for the famous play Faust by Goethe He wrote one opera Genoveva in 1849 His fame spread slowly For many years Dresden and Leipzig were the only towns where he was famous In 1850 he became musical director at Dsseldorf In 1853 he met Brahms Brahms became a great friend of the Schumann family Schumann published an article in the Neue Zeitschrift fr Musik with the heading Neue Bahnen in which he said that Brahms was going to be a very great composer He was right

Schumann had often thought of trying to kill himself On 27 February 1854 he threw himself into the river Rhine He was rescued by some boatmen but when they brought him to land he seemed to have gone quite mad He was taken to an asylum where he spent the last two years of his life He died on 29 July 1856

Schumanns piano music is very well known Although he had to give up his career as a pianist his wife Clara played his pieces and helped them to become famous Many of his piano works are collections of short pieces each with a title eg Papillons Davidsbndlertnze Carnaval Schumann was thinking of carnival celebrations when he wrote these pieces The Davidsbndler was a group of people Schumann belonged to who did not like the Philistines In Carnaval the two sides of Schumanns personality are represented by Florestan and Eusebius Schumanns manic depression are heard side by side in his music Other piano works include Scenes from Childhood Kreisleriana and the popular Album for the Young which has some quite easy pieces like Soldiers March and the famous Trumerei There are also longer works for piano 3 sonatas a Toccata and a Phantasie

His chamber music includes string quartets and a famous piano quintet 

Schumann was one of the great composers of Lieder He chose poetry by famous German poets and set them to music in very imaginative ways The piano has very interesting accompaniments which help to bring out the meaning of the words He wrote a song cycle called Dichterliebe which is a setting of some poems by Heinrich Heine Another song cycle is called Frauenliebe und leben to words by Adalbert von Chamisso 

Although the young Schumann seemed to prefer writing short pieces he became more interested in long works after meeting Mendelssohn He was also inspired to write symphonies after he discovered Schuberts Symphony no 9 which no one knew that Schubert had written He found it in a box in Vienna at the house of Schuberts brother Schumann wrote four symphonies One of his best is the Third which is often called the Rhenish Symphony The Fourth in d minor is also a great work Using only a few musical ideas he develops them in many ways and writes a long four movement work His piano concerto is a great favourite Clara Schumann played it with the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra at its first performance on New Years Day 1846

After Schumanns death Clara devoted herself to playing her husbands music and helping it to become well known She visited England regularly where she played at concerts She also edited a lot of Schumanns works for the publisher Breitkopf und Hrtel

A lecture is when someone talks to a group of people about something interesting It is like a lesson At college or university students go to lectures to learn things The person who is teaching is called the lecturer

Sometimes we say that someone was given a lecture This means that he was told off for doing something wrong

Clara Schumann was the wife of composer Robert Schumann She was a famous pianist and composer 

Clara was born Clara Wieck Her father taught her the piano She was a prodigy and by the time she was thirteen her father was taking her on concert tours

She was only nine years old when Robert Schumann came to Leipzig to study law at the university Robert Schumanns family had told him that he had to study law but he wanted to be a musician He took piano lessons from Claras father Friedrich Wieck

Clara not only learned the piano she also studied singing the violin instrumentation score reading counterpoint and composition By 1835 she was famous in the whole of Europe and was admired by Goethe Mendelssohn Chopin Paganini and of course Robert Schumann

Claras father did not want them to marry He did everything he could to stop the marriage For several years life was very difficult for them but in the end by 1840 they were marriedthey married by court permission

They had a happy marriage and had eight children Clara played her husbands piano works She ran the household and earned money by teaching and performing Life was not always easy When they went on tours together Clara was more famous than her husband and this was difficult for him Robert often had depression They both taught at the Leipzig Conservatorium and Clara also taught privately in Dresden and Dsseldorf

Robert Schumann died in 1856 after two years in a mental asylum Clara was left with seven small children to bring up Nevertheless she continued her career as a pianist and often travelled to other countries especially England where she played Roberts piano works She was great friends with Brahms and often performed his works too

Claras own compositions are all from her early years She was a very gifted composer In those days people thought that women should not be composers Playing the piano was one thing but a woman was not expected to be a professional composer Clara knew this and devoted more time to her playing and to editing her husbands music

Claras compositions include more than 20 piano works a piano concerto some chamber music and several songs

Composition means literally putting together

The word composition is used in literature drama and poetry means the way that words are put together 

Musical composition means putting notes together to make a piece of music

The word composition is used in art to mean the way that colors or shapes are put together

It is also used in mathematics and science in a number of ways all meaning putting things together

In music the word composition can be used in two ways

The theory of relativity was developed by Albert Einstein in the early 1900s There are two theories of relativity The first is special relativity and the second is general relativity Both are based on the principle of relativity which was created by Galileo Galilei in the 1600s

Special relativity says that every person has their own time One persons clock says something different from another persons clock The reason a persons time can be different from anothers is because of time dilation which can be thought of more easily by the twin paradox 

The twin paradox shows how time changes because of speed and mass The faster someone or something moves or the more mass they have then the slower time passes for them This is shown by a pair of twins Imagine that the first twin moves at a fast speed near the speed of light for example while the other twin stays in one general location When the first twin returns from his trip he will be younger than the second twin Thus time and speed are related

General relativity adds gravity to special relativity It says that space and time are joined together Space is like a grid Balls on the grid bend it because of their mass or speed As one ball moves towards another it falls towards the other ball due to the dent in the grid It can be shown by putting heavy balls on a trampoline The dent in the grid is like gravity shown by the planets

If space and time are one thing represented by a grid and heavy objects stretch out the grid that means that time passes more slowly near heavy objects This has been shown in experiments by comparing very accurate clocks on Earth with very accurate clocks on satellites or rockets in space

G O Mueller wrote a whole encyclopedia arguing against Einsteins relativity Mueller and many other philosophers say that space and time are categories of perception not distortable things and so ideas of relativity that treat them as things cannot be correct Paul Dirac and others have said that constants may change over time including the speed of light Mueller lists about 4000 Einstein critical works since 1905 suggesting rethinking relativity

BIOS in computing stands for Basic InputOutput System The BIOS is a computer program embedded on a chip on a computers motherboard that recognizes and controls various devices that make up the computer The purpose of the BIOS is to make sure all the things plugged into the computer can work properly

Booting up is the process that a computer completes to get it ready to use when it is first turned on When the computer turns on the BIOS starts up and performs a Power On Self Test During the POST the BIOS will check various devices in the computer like the computer processor memory the video card and others to make sure they are present and functioning Once the POST has completed successfully the BIOS looks for an operating system to load which is usually located on the computers hard drive When it finds one it starts to load it At this point the operating system takes over control of the system 

Some people try to configure their computer to run faster than it was designed to do This is called overclocking Since the BIOS controls the computer processor entering the BIOS setup screen while it is booting up gives people access to advanced computer settings For most computers pressing the delete or F12 buttons while the computer is booting up will bring up the BIOS setup screen There are many ways a computer can be overclocked to run faster but most involve simply turning up the speed of the computer processor Doing this will usually make your computer run much hotter though and can sometimes break your computer which is why overclocking will usually void your computers warranty Only people who are computer hardware experts should attempt to overclock their computers

Printing is putting words and images on paper most of the time using ink Books and newspapers are made by printing

Printing is one of the technologies which has changed the world It is an efficient way to multiply writing so that copies may be made available to all people Printing is therefore the continuation of writing by mechanical means

Writing originated after people had settled in permanent dwellings It dates from 3300BC which is over 5000 years ago A variety of writing systems were invented long before paper was invented Clay papyrus wood slate and parchment have all been used The invention of paper by the Chinese was a step forward

The earlist printing known was in 8th century China and Korea Whole pages carved on flat wooden blocks were used Covered with a carbon based ink they were pressed onto sheets of paper

The second stage was to use separate characters by carving or casting This was done in 11th century China and Korea It failed to be really successful because of the structure of the Chinese written language shared at the time by Korea which had thousands of characters Because of this the method was not significantly better that copying by scribes

Printing was reinvented in 15th century Europe Though slow to develop at first print became the main means of communication between people who wished to record knowledge It was hugely successful largely because with an alphabetic system of writing print was much more economical than copying and permitted many times as many copies to be available for readers It was a revolution which helped all aspects of life in Europe at a time when Europe was becoming the dominant region of the world

Along with a technology for printing words there were various means for printing graphics Carving on blocks of wood engraving on copper were used up until about 1800 After that a bewildering array of inventions arrived including ways to print photographs

Machines to speed printing cheaper paper automatic stitching and binding all arrived in the 19th century during the industrial revolution What had once been done by a few men by hand was now done by limited companies on huge machines The result was much lower prices and a much wider readership

The Travelling Salesman Problem is a classic algorithmic problem in the field of computer science It is focused on optimisation In this context better solution often means a solution that is cheaper TSP is a mathematical problem It is most easily expressed as a graph describing the locations of a set of nodes

The Travelling Salesman Problem describes a salesman who must travel between N cities The order in which he does so is unimportant provided he visits each one during his trip and finishes in his starting location Each city is connected to other close by cities or nodes by airplanes or by road or railway Each of those links between the cities has one or more weights attached The cost describes how difficult it is to traverse this edge on the graph and may be given for example by the cost of an airplane ticket or train ticket or perhaps by the length of the edge or time required to complete the traversal The salesman wants to keep both the travel costs as well as the distance he travels as low as possible 

The Traveling Salesman Problem is typical of a large class of hard optimization problems that have intrigued mathematicians and computer scientists for years Most important it has applications in science and engineering For example in the manufacture of a circuit board it is important to determine the best order in which a laser will drill thousands of holes An efficient solution to this problem reduces production costs for the manufacturer 

The travelling salesman problem is regarded as difficult to solve If there is a way to break this problem into smaller component problems the components will be at least as complex as the original one This is what computer scientists call NP hard problems

Many people have studied this problem The easiest is to simply try all possibilities The problem with this is that for N cities you have factorial possibilities This means that for only 10 cities there are over 36 million combinations to try

Anno Domini shortened as AD or AD is used to refer to the years after the birth of Jesus AD is also a shortening for Christian Era Similarly Before Christ shortened as BC or BC is used in the English language to refer to all years before the start of the time period Anno Domini 

The system for working out the years was invented by Dionysius Exiguus in about AD 525 He fixed the point Anno Domini which is used to number the years of both the Gregorian calendar and the Julian calendar He used it to identify the several Easters in his Easter table He did not use it to date any historical event When he devised his table Julian calendar years were identified by naming the consuls who held office that year he himself stated that the present year was the consulship of Probus Junior Flavius Probus which he also stated was 525 years since the incarnation conception of our Lord Jesus Christ How he arrived at that number is unknown He invented a new system of numbering years to replace the Diocletian years that had been used in an old Easter table because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians The Anno Domini era became dominant in Western Europe only after it was used by the Venerable Bede to date the events in his Ecclesiastical History of the English People completed in 731

An extrasolar planet is a natural planet that exists outside of our solar system As of 22 June 2011 astronomers have discovered 563 of them using various methods

Data from the Kepler mission suggests there are at least 50 billion planets in our own galaxy There also exist planets that orbit brown dwarfs and free floating planets that orbit the galaxy directly just as the stars do It is unclear if either type should be called a planet

In the sixteenth century the Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno an early supporter of the Copernican theory that the Earth and other planets orbit the Sun put forward the view that the fixed stars are similar to the Sun and are likewise accompanied by planets Bruno was burnt at the stake by the Holy Inquisition 

In the eighteenth century the same possibility was mentioned by Isaac Newton in his Principia Making a comparison to the Suns planets he wrote And if the fixed stars are the centers of similar systems they will all be constructed according to a similar design and subject to the dominion of One 

The first published and confirmed discovery was made in 1988 It was finally confirmed in 1992

In early 1992 radio astronomers announced the discovery of planets around another pulsar These pulsar planets are believed to have formed from the unusual remnants of the supernova that produced the pulsar in a second round of planet formation or else to be the remaining rocky cores of gas giants that survived the supernova and then decayed into their current orbits

On October 6 1995 Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz of the University of Geneva announced the first definitive detection of an exoplanet orbiting an ordinary main sequence star This discovery made at the Observatoire de Haute Provence ushered in the modern era of exoplanetary discovery Technological advances most notably in high resolution spectroscopy led to the detection of many new exoplanets at a rapid rate These advances allowed astronomers to detect exoplanets indirectly by measuring their gravitational influence on the motion of their parent stars Additional extrasolar planets were eventually detected by observing the variation in a stars apparent luminosity as an orbiting planet passed in front of it

Extrasolar planets can have many different forms compared to our solar system

An extratropical cyclone is a type of cyclone It is a large low pressure weather area with rain and wind and clouds that is not similar to tropical cyclones or low pressure weather areas from cold polar places They are really many masses of cold and warm fronts producing rain heavy wind and sometimes tornadoes and even hail Some Extratropical cyclones are made from tropical cyclones that become weak but do not die when they move over cold water Sometimes these weather areas can become even stronger than before as they turn into Extratropical cyclones When made from tropical cyclones they can still have an eye European windstorms are sometimes made when wind from the northwestern part of the Atlantic carry them more east and north towards Europe Noreasters often hit northeastern North America and are made when it is cold most often in late fall Wind from the west part of the Atlantic moves them north They become stronger and drop snow on the areas it moves into When a noreaster drops in pressure and become stronger by more than one millibar every hour it is called a weather bomb Hurricane Hazel was extratropical but still hurricane level when it hit Toronto for example

A small solar system body is a term defined in 2006 by the International Astronomical Union to describe solar system objects which are neither planets nor dwarf planets

Therefore it refers to these objects that can be further grouped based on their orbit or what they are made of

Some of the larger small solar system bodies may be reclassified in future as dwarf planets pending further examination to determine whether or not they are in hydrostatic equilibrium

Advance Australia Fair is the official national anthem of Australia 

Peter Dodds McCormick wrote the music and the words for the song It was first performed in 1878 but it only became Australias official anthem in 1984 

Between 1878 and 1984 the song was used inside of Australia as a patriotic song For a time the song announced the news from the Australian Broadcasting Commission When Australia became a Federation in 1901 the song was sung by a choir of 10000 people

In 1977 there was a vote for the national anthem between four songs The other three songs were

The total number of bronze medals is greater than the total of gold or silver because in boxing and judo two bronze medals were awarded in each weight class

Countries are ranked firstly by the number of gold medals they have then by the number of silver and then by the number of bronze Where countries have the same number of each type of medal they are listed alphabetically and given the same ranking

Medal numbers shown in bold are the highest in their section Greece the host nation is highlighted in lavender

The 1964 Summer Olympics officially known as the Games of the XVIII Olympiad were celebrated in Tokyo Japan from October 10 1964 through October 24 1964

The 1896 Summer Olympics officially known as the Games of the I Olympiad were celebrated in Athens Greece from April 6 through April 15 1896 It was the first international Olympic Games held in the Modern era Because Ancient Greece was the birthplace of the Olympic Games Athens was an appropriate choice to stage the inaugural modern Games The International Olympic Committee was also instituted during this congress

The 1896 Olympics were regarded as a great success even though there were many obstacles and setbacks The Games had the largest international participation of any sporting event to that date The Panathinaiko Stadium the only Olympic stadium used in the 19th Century overflowed with the largest crowd ever to watch a sporting event The highlight for the Greeks was the marathon victory by Spyridon Louis The most successful competitor was German wrestler and gymnast Carl Schuhmann who won four events

After the Games Rhys Coubertin and the IOC were petitioned by several prominent figures including Greeces King George and some of the American competitors in Athens to hold all the following Games in Athens But the 1900 Summer Olympics were already planned for Paris and except for the Intercalated Games of 1906 the Olympics did not return to Greece until the 2004 Summer Olympics some 108 years later

The stories about the events and people of these Games were in the 1984 NBC miniseries The First Olympics Athens 1896 starring David Ogden Stiers as William Milligan Sloane and Louis Jourdan as Pierre de Coubertin

In the 18th century several small scale sports festivals in Europe were named after the Ancient Olympic Games The 1870 Olympics at the Panathenaic stadium had 30000 people Coubertin took Dr William Penny Brookes idea to have a multi national and multi sport eventthe ancient games were in a sense international because various Greek city states and colonies were represented but only free male athletes of Greek origin were allowed to participate In 1890 Coubertin wrote an article in La Revue Athletique which talked about the importance of Much Wenlocka rural market town in the English county of Shropshire It was here that in October 1850 the local physician William Penny Brookes started the Wenlock Olympian Games a festival of sports and recreations that included athletics and team sports such as cricket football and quoits Coubertin also took inspiration from the earlier Greek games organized under the name of Olympics by businessman and philanthropist Evangelis Zappas in 1859 1870 and 1875 The 1896 Athens Games was funded by the legacies of Evangelis Zappas and his cousin Konstantinos Zappas and by George Averoff who had been specifically requested by the Greek government through crown prince Constantine to sponsor the second refurbishment of the Panathinaiko Stadium The Greek government did fix the stadium even though the cost of refurbishing the stadium in marble had already been funded in full by Evangelis Zappas forty years earlier

On June 18 1894 Coubertin put together a group at the Sorbonne in Paris to present his plans to representatives of sports societies from 11 countries After his proposals acceptance by the congress a date for the first modern Olympic Games needed to be chosen Coubertin suggested that the Games be held at the same time as the 1900 Universal Exposition of Paris Concerned that a six year wait might lessen public interest congress members instead chose 1896 With a date established members of the congress turned to the choice of a host city Since Greece was the original home of the Olympics all the congress approved the decision of Athens Vikelas was then elected the first president of the newly established International Olympic Committee

On April 6 the games of the First Olympiad were officially opened it was Easter Monday for both the Western and Eastern Christian Churches and the anniversary of Greeces independence The Panathinaiko Stadium was filled with an estimated 80000 spectators including King George I of Greece his wife Olga and their sons Most of the competing athletes were aligned on the infield grouped by nation After a speech by the president of the organizing committee Crown Prince Constantine his father officially opened the Games

I declare the opening of the first international Olympic Games in Athens Long live the Nation Long live the Greek people

Afterwards nine bands and 150 choir singers performed an Olympic Hymn composed by Spyridon Samaras with words by poet Kostis Palamas Thereafter a variety of musical offerings provided the backgrounds to the Opening Ceremonies until 1960 since which time the SamarasPalamas composition has become the official Olympic Anthem Other elements of current Olympic opening ceremonies were started later the Olympic flame was first lit in 1928 the first athletes oath was sworn at the 1920 Summer Olympics and the first officials oath was taken at the 1972 Olympic Games

At the 1894 Sorbonne congress a large roster of sports were suggested for the program in Athens The first official announcements regarding the sporting events to be held featured sports such as football and cricket but these plans were never finalized and these sports did not make the final list for the Games Rowing and yachting were scheduled but had to be canceled due to poor weather on the planned day of competition

The athletics events had the most international field of any of the sports The major highlight was the marathon held for the first time in international competition Spyridon Louis won the event and was the only Greek athletics champion and a national hero Although Greece had been favored to win the discus and the shot put the best Greek athletes finished just behind the American Robert Garrett in both events

No world records were set as few top international competitors had elected to compete In addition the curves of the track were very tight making fast times in the running events hard Despite this Thomas Burke of the United States won the 100 meter race in 120 seconds and the 400 meter race in 542 seconds Burke was the only one who used the crouch start confusing the jury Eventually he was allowed to start from his uncomfortable position

The rules of the International Cycling Association were used for the cycling competitions The track cycling events were held at the newly built Neo Phaliron Velodrome Only one road event was held a race from Athens to Marathon and back

In the track events the best cyclist was Frenchman Paul Masson who won the one lap time trial the sprint event and the 10000 meters In the 100 kilometers event Masson entered as a pacemaker for his compatriot Lon Flameng Flameng won the event after a fall and after stopping to wait for his Greek opponent Georgios Kolettis to fix a mechanical problem The Austrian fencer Adolf Schmal won the 12 hour race which was completed by only two cyclists while the road race event was won by Aristidis Konstantinidis

The fencing events were held in the Zappeion which built with money Evangelis Zappas had given to revive the ancient Olympic Games was not used before Unlike other sports professionals were allowed to compete in fencing though in a separate event These professionals were considered gentlemen athletes just as the amateurs

Four events were scheduled but the pe event was cancelled for unknown reasons The foil event was won by a Frenchman Eugne Henri Gravelotte who beat his countryman Henri Callot in the final The other two events the sabre and the masters foil were won by Greek fencers Leonidas Pyrgos who won the latter event became the first Greek Olympic champion in the modern era

Gymnastics was at the infield of the Panathinaiko Stadium Germany sent an 11 man team which won five of the eight events including both team events In the team event on the horizontal bar the German team was unopposed Three Germans added individual titles Hermann Weingrtner won the horizontal bar Alfred Flatow won the parallel bars and Carl Schuhmann who also competed successfully in wrestling won the vault Louis Zutter a Swiss gymnast won the pommel horse while Greeks Ioannis Mitropoulos and Nikolaos Andriakopoulos were victorious in the rings and rope climbing events respectively

Held at a range at Kallithea the shooting competition was five eventstwo using a rifle and three with the pistol The first event the military rifle was won by Pantelis Karasevdas the only competitor to hit the target with all of his shots The second event for military pistols was dominated by two American brothers John and Sumner Paine became the first siblings to finish first and second in the same event In order to avoid embarrassing their hosts the brothers decided that only one of them would compete in the next pistol event the free pistol Sumner Paine won that event

The Paine brothers did not compete in the 25 meter pistol event as the event judges determined that their weapons were not of the required caliber In their absence Ioannis Phrangoudis won The final event the free rifle began on the same day However the event was not completed due to darkness and was finalized the next morning when Georgios Orphanidis was crowned the champion

The swimming competition was held in the open sea Nearly 20000 spectators lined the Bay of Zea off the Piraeus coast to watch the events The water in the bay was cold and the competitors suffered during their races There were three open events in addition to a special event open only to Greek sailors all of which were held on the same day

For Alfrd Hajs of Hungary being on the same day meant he could only compete in two of the events He won the two events in which he swam the 100 and 1200 meter freestyle Hajs later became one of only two Olympians to win a medal in both the athletic and artistic competitions when he won a silver medal for architecture in 1924 The 500 meter freestyle was won by Austrian swimmer Paul Neumann who defeated his opponents by more than a minute and a half

Although tennis was already a major sport by the end of the 19th century none of the top players turned up for the tournament in Athens The competition was at the courts of the Athens Lawn Tennis Club and the infield of the velodrome used for the cycling events John Pius Boland who won the event was entered in the competition by a fellow student of his at Oxford In the first round Boland defeated Friedrich Traun a promising tennis player from Hamburg who had been eliminated in the 100 meter sprint competition Boland and Traun decided to team up for the doubles event in which they reached the final and defeated their Greek and Egyptian opponents after losing the first set

The sport of weightlifting was still young in 1896 and the rules differed from those in use today Competitions were held outdoors in the infield of the main stadium and there were no weight limits The first event was held in a style now known as the clean and jerk Two competitors stood out Scotsman Launceston Elliot and Viggo Jensen of Denmark Both of them lifted the same weight but the jury with Prince George as the chairman ruled that Jensen had done so in a better style The British delegation unfamiliar with this tie breaking rule lodged a protest The lifters were eventually allowed to make further attempts but neither lifter improved and Jensen was declared the champion

Elliot won in the one hand lift event which was held immediately after the two handed one Jensen had been slightly injured during his last two handed attempt and was no match for Elliot who won the competition easily The Greek audience was charmed by the Scottish victor whom they considered very attractive A curious incident occurred during the weightlifting event a servant was ordered to remove the weights which appeared to be a difficult task for him Prince George came to his assistance he picked up the weight and threw it a considerable distance with ease to the delight of the crowd

No weight classes existed for the wrestling competition held in the Panathinaiko Stadium which meant that there would only be one winner among competitors of all sizes The rules used were similar to modern Greco Roman wrestling although there was no time limit and not all leg holds were forbidden

Apart from the two Greek contestants all the competitors had previously been active in other sports Weightlifting champion Launceston Elliot faced gymnastics champion Carl Schuhmann The latter won and advanced into the final where he met Georgios Tsitas who had previously defeated Stephanos Christopoulos Darkness forced the final match to be suspended after 40 minutes it was continued the following day when Schuhmann needed only a quarter of an hour to finish the bout

On the morning of Sunday April 12 King George organized a banquet for officials and athletes During his speech he made clear that as far as he was concerned the Olympics should be held in Athens permanently The official closing ceremony was held the following Wednesday after being postponed from Tuesday due to rain Again the royal family attended the ceremony which was opened by the national anthem of Greece and an ode composed in ancient Greek by George S Robertson a British athlete and scholar

Afterwards the king awarded prizes to the winners Unlike today the first place winners received silver medals an olive branch and a diploma Athletes who placed second received copper medals a branch of laurel and a diploma Third place winners did not receive a medal Some winners also received additional prizes such as Spyridon Louis who received a cup from Michel Bral a friend of Coubertin who had conceived the marathon event Louis then led the medalists on a lap of honor around the stadium while the Olympic Hymn was played again The King then formally announced that the first Olympiad was at an end and left the Stadium while the band played the Greek national hymn and the crowd cheered

Like the Greek king many others supported the idea of holding the next Games in Athens most of the American competitors signed a letter to the Crown Prince expressing this wish Coubertin however was heavily opposed to this idea as he envisioned international rotation as one of the cornerstones of the modern Olympics According to his wish the next Games were held in Paris although they would be somewhat over shadowed by the concurrently held Universal Exposition

Makalani is the name given to a certain palm tree growing in northern Namibia The local Owambo people call a full grown palm tree Omulunga and a sapling Oshivale These palm trees grow very high and it takes many years for a Makalani sapling to grow into a full grown tree

The seeds look like small coconuts and the local people the Owambos and Himbas peel the outer ginger looking skin and carve the inner hard core to certain objects of art The inner core is white with a dark brown skin the size of a golf ball and it is hollow inside The Makalani fruitis very useful to the local people It can be eaten and can also be used to brew OmbikeOwalende the Oshiwambo brew that looks and taste similar to Whiskey  There are now also some hotels restaurants and guesthouses which have adopted the name Makalani

In music a bow is a stick which is strung with hair It is used to pull across the strings of a string instrument such as a violin viola cello or double bass 

The wood used for good quality bows is usually pernambuco wood from Brazil Some bows nowadays are made from fibreglass They are often cheaper and still of very good quality The bow has to be slightly curved so that it straightens out a bit as the hairs are tightened 

Horsehair is used for the hairs of the bow These hairs gradually fall out when the bow is used a lot When a lot of the hairs have fallen out the player can have the bow re haired When the bow is new or when it has just been re haired it will not make any sound until the hairs have been well rubbed with rosin The rosin makes the hair grip the string as it is drawn across Every violinist needs to keep a piece of rosin in his or her violin case They may need to rosin the bow for a short while each time they play There is a screw at the end of the bow for tightening the hairs After playing the bow hairs should be slackened again before the bow is put away This is to stop the wood from warping

The black bit near the heel of the bow is called the frog This holds the hair in place The frog may be made of ebony but sometimes it is made of ivory or tortoiseshell Near the frog is the grip which is made of leather or sometimes snakeskin Expensive bows sometimes have a tip made of silver

There are other instruments which use bows In the Renaissance the viols were played with a bow which was held with the palm upwards Some double bass players still hold the bow in this way

The kind of bow in use today was developed by the bow maker Franois Tourte in 19th century France

There are other cultures which have bows with only one thick hair

People who learn to play the violin viola violoncello and double bass spend a very long time learning the technique of bowing They have to learn to control the bow so that it makes a lovely sound on the string They learn to control the bow with strong fingers but never to hold the bow tightly Sometimes they are asked to pluck the string instead of bowing it This is called pizzicato

The bow is held in the right hand The left hand makes the different notes by putting the fingers firmly down on the fingerboard

When string players talk about putting in the bowing they mean writing in the music for each note whether it is played with an upbow or downbow  A downbow is when the player starts at the heel and finishes at the tip An upbow is when the bow travels in the direction tip to heel A player does not always have to use whole bows In fast music he may only use a small part of the bow A downbow feels stronger than an upbow so it is usually used for the first beat of the bar Downbows and upbows may be used for alternate notes but often two or more notes are taken in one bow stroke This is shown in the music by a slur

The bow generally should touch the part of the string mid way between the end of the fingerboard and the bridge To play quietly the bow should be nearer the fingerboard To play loudly it should be nearer the bridge

When the players have been plucking and they need to start bowing again the word arco is put in the music This is the Italian word for bow

Special effects can be made with the bow These include 

The Chinese yazheng and yaqin and Korean ajaeng zithers are generally played by bowing with a rosined stick which rubs against the strings without any horsehair The hurdy gurdy an instrument known in medieval Europe has strings which are bowed by a rosin wheel which is turned by a handle

Bowing means taking a bow A bow is when a person bends their body forward from the waist in order to greet someone or show respect for them A bow is sometimes not much more than a quick nod of the head but it can be a very deep bow from the waist The exact way to bow and the situations in which people bow vary enormously between different cultures 

Bowing was originally a gesture which showed deep respect for someone In European cultures bowing to someone is now only done in very formal situations eg when meeting the Queen or someone very high and important

In European history bowing was common at royal courts Men were expected to bow and scrape This meant bowing and at the same time drawing back the right leg so that it scraped the floor The man would hold his left hand over his waist while doing this This is why we still talk about bowing and scraping meaning that someone is trying very hard and hypocritically to be unnecessarily polite This kind of deep bow which is never used nowadays is sometimes called a reverence

Bowing was only done by men Women would always curtsey to show respect

Nowadays bowing in European cultures is mostly seen at performances When people applaud after a performance such as a concert on in the theatre the performer will take a bow This is like saying thank you to the audience for saying thank you by clapping Both men and women performers bow

In Christian worship people in churches will bow to the altar to show respect to Jesus

There are other special occasions in which people bow In judo and some other martial arts the two contestants will bow to one another to show that they respect one another and will obey the rules of the game

In some Asian cultures bowing is far more common than in the West It is especially important in Japan Japanese people both men and women  spend a lot of their time bowing They bow to greet one another to say goodbye to say they are sorry to say thank you or to show that they are not as important as the person they are bowing to There are different degrees of bowing and it is very important in Japanese culture to know the right way to bow on different occasions A bow of 15 degrees is very informal a bow of 45 degrees is very formal They keep their back straight while doing this The men have their hands by their sides women have one hand over the other in front of their body Typically a bow should last a count of eight three to go down one for a pause and four for returning to an upright position If someone bows a little longer than the other person that other person may bow again and the other person then also bows again and this can go on several times  Japanese mothers carry their babies on their backs so that children learn to bow even before they can speak Pupils and teachers at school bow to one another The more important someone is the deeper the other person has to bow

Billie Jean King is a retired tennis player She is considered one of the greatest female tennis players She won many championships during her career which started in 1959 and ended in 1983 She was known for speaking out against sexism in sports and society Her most famous match was in 1973 called The Battle of the Sexes between Bobby Riggs who had been a champion in the 1930s and 1940s She loved playing tennis but had to stop due to an injury

Cannavaro had originally played several famous football club in Italy such as Napoli Parma Internazionale Milano and Juventus He won several champions of Italian Serie A in the past and a UEFA Cup in 1999 In 2006 he turned to Spain to join the Spanish giant Real Madrid as a defender of the team

Cannavaro is a famous defender who represent Italy national team for over 100 times joining three times of FIFA World Cup In 2006 he led the national team to win the champion of World Cup and then won the World Footballer of 2006 As few defenders can be very popular some people comment that Cannavaro has excellent talent just like German legend Franz Beckenbauer

Exaggeration means the describing of something and making it more than it really is The verb is to exaggerate

An example of exaggeration would be I was walking along when suddenly this enormous dog walked along It was as big as an elephant The dog may have been big but it was certainly not as big as that Another example of exaggeration would be I caught a fish as big as my house

Overstatement is another word that means almost the same thing The opposite of overstatement is understatement 

A hyperbole is a type of exaggeration that is used in literature It is a figure of speech The opposite of hyperbole is hypobole which is an understatement

People exaggerate things because they have strong feelings about something People may exaggerate to make people listen to what they say They may do it to emphasize something They may also exaggerate just to sound funny

People may understate because they are being modest

In modern slang the word hype is sometimes used about something that is getting more publicity than it really deserves The word hype comes from the word hyperbole

Meiosis is a special type of cell division Unlike mitosis the way normal body cells divide meiosis results in cells that only have half the usual number of chromosomes one from each pair For that reason meiosis is often called reduction division In the long run meiosis increases genetic variation in a way which will be explained later 

Sexual reproduction takes place when a sperm fertilizes an egg The eggs and sperm are special cells called gametes or sex cells Gametes are haploid they have only half the number of chromosomes as a normal body cell Fertilization restores the chromosomes in body cells to the diploid number

The basic number of chromosomes in the body cells of a species is called the somatic number and is designated 2n Thus in humans 2n 46 We have 46 chromosomes In the sex cells the chromosome number is n So in normal diploid organisms chromosomes are present in two copies one from each parent The only exception are the sex chomosomes In mammals the female has two X chromosomes and the male one X and one Y chromosome

A karyotype is the characteristic chromosome number of a eukaryote species The preparation and study of karyotypes is part of cytogenetics the genetics of cells

All eukaryotes that reproduce sexually use meiosis This also includes single celled organisms Meiosis does not occur in archaea or bacteria which reproduce via asexual processes such as binary fission

The offspring gets a set of chromosomes from each parent so that overall half of its heredity comes from each parent But the two sets of chromosomes are not identical with the parental chromosomes This is because they are changed during the reduction division by a process called crossing over

This is two fold

1 First to reduce the chromosomes in each egg or sperm to one set only

2 To allow crossing over to take place between each pair of parental chromosomes Crossing over changes which alleles sit on a particular chromosome

Although the gametes have only one set of chromosomes that set is a shuffled mixture of genetic material from both parents Every single egg or sperm may have a different selection of alleles from the parental chromosomes 

As with shuffling a deck of cards many different combinations of genes can be produced without a change in any individual gene However mutations do occur and they may add alleles which were not in the population before At any rate the shuffling increases the variety of the offspring and the variety gives at least some of the offspring a better chance of surviving in difficult times The shuffling of alleles which takes place in meiosis may be the reason why sexual reproduction exists at all

Several quite large taxa use cyclical parthenogenesis This is when several generations are born by virgin birth and then a generation occurs with normal sexual reproduction Examples include aphids and cladocerans Aphids usually operate as follows when the weather is good and their plant hosts are at their best they use parthenogenesis At the end of the season when the weather gets worse they use sexual reproduction This system of reproduction is called apogamy

In parthenogenesis the eggs contain only the mothers genetic material and they are not fertilized The egg cells may be produced either by meiosis or mitosis When meiosis occurs crossing over produces a genetic fingerprint which differs somewhat from the mothers So the parthenogenetic greenfly offspring are not identical and do show some genetic variation some chromosome segments differ because of meiosis Mitosis would produce identical offspring

Amongst these parthenogenetic taxa are a number of species which have entirely abandoned sex

A few eukaryote organisms have completely lost the ability for sexual reproduction and so do not have meiosis These include the Bdelloid rotifers which only reproduce by parthenogenesis

Meiosis can be divided into Meiosis I and Meiosis II

The function of the first division is to permit crossing over Just like Mitosis meiosis includes Prophase Metaphase Anaphase and Telophase

Prophase I The chromosomes become visible the nuclear envelope disappears and the centrioles begin forming spindle fibres that envelope the chromosomes

At this stage each chromosome is split into two sister chromatids held together by the centromeres The paired chromosomes now have four chromatids pressed together Crossing over takes place between two of the non sister chromatids the other two remain uncrossed The crossover results in the exchange of segments of each of the participating chromatids DNA and associated chromatin protein Genetically the process is called recombination 

Metaphase I The chromosomes line up along the equatorial of the spindle fibres in homologous pairs

Anaphase I The chromosomes are divided so that there are equal amounts on either side of the cell As there are 46 chromosomes in a human cell 23 end up on either side

Telophase I The two daughter cells are completely divided a nucleic envelope forms and the chromosomes become less visible There are 23 chromosomes in each of these cells

The two cells prepare to divide again in a stage known as Interkinesis or Interphase II Both of these cells will go through meiosis II

Prophase II The chromosomes become visible the nuclear envelope disappears and the centrioles form the spindle fibres

Metaphase II The chromosomes line up along the middle line on the spindle fibres

Anaphase II The chromosomes get split into its two chromatids Chromatids are the two strands of DNA that make up the chromosome They are joined by a mid way connection called a centromere

Telophase II The cells are completely divided The nucleic envelope reforms and four new cells with different DNA are created

In males all four cells become sperm In females only one becomes a mature egg while the remaining three become re absorbed into the body

In humans there are certain conditions that are caused by a meiosis gone wrong Examples are

Gainsharing is a system of management used by a business to get higher levels of performance through the broken wikt linkinvolvementinvolvement and participation of its people As performance improves employees share financially in the gain Gainsharing is about people working smarter together and not just working harder 

Gainsharing should not be confused with profit sharing There are many differences between Gainsharing and profit sharing Gainsharing is also called Gain sharing Gainshare and Gain share It could also be called savings sharing In other words a company shares with employees the savings from improved performance

There are two important parts of a Gainsharing system One is a bonus calculation The second is a structured system for employee involvement Because of these two parts Gainsharing is best seen as an organizational development tool It is not just a bonus or incentive plan In order to get a better understanding of this concept one needs to look back at Gainsharings history 

One of the first Gainsharing plans dates back to the 1930s In the 1930s a labor leader and MIT Lecturer Joe Scanlon preached that the worker had much more to offer than just a pair of hands Scanlon believed that the person closest to the problem often has the best and simplest solution Also if the worker is involved in the solution he will make the solution work 

In an effort to help a troubled company Scanlon and the company owner asked employees for their ideas and suggestions to help reduce waste and lower cost Many improvements were made The company became more successful Joe was asked to save other companies who had barely survived the depression He eventually became the Acting Director of the Steelworkers Research Department and used his skills in creating joint labormanagement improvement committees to help the war effort for WWII

After the war Joe became a lecturer at MIT and went on to develop a system for organizational development and gainsharing that became known as the Scanlon Plan

As the Scanlon Plan developed a method to measure gains was created The monetary gains were then shared with all employees This calculation represents the bonus element of Gainsharing This concept addresses the principle of equity It is fair to share Everyone in a company makes a contribution to the organizations success Why limit bonuses to the select few People typically take pride in their work and have a strong desire to be respected for what they do By sharing the company is communicating an important message to the work force We all contribute That contribution is respected Lets share in the financial benefits 

Articles in Time Fortune and Life Magazines and the work of Joe

Today companies with a Gainsharing plan measure performance Companies use a pre determined calculation to share the savings with all employees Information regarding the measures formula and gains is regularly and openly shared with all employees Since the monetary gains are shared with employees people develop more of a sense of ownership for their work and the company People have a better understanding of how they influence the companys success

It should be noted that in a Gainsharing plan that the companys current performance is compared to its historic performance The savings above the baseline period determine the gain or loss  This is a very important point Since gains are measured in relationship to a historical period employees and the company must improve in order to make a gain Otherwise the current level of performance would be equal to the baseline period If this happened the result would be no gain and no employee share

When people do their work differently they must change However as everyone one knows it is difficult for people to change On the other hand do people like money Most people would say Yes Therefore Gainsharing can be a very powerful tool Gainsharing promotes a culture of positive change  

A very important part of a successful Gainsharing plan is the employee involvement element of Gainsharing In order to foster a culture of positive change a successful Gainsharing plan needs to incorporate a structure system of employee involvement It is common for Gainsharing plans to have a team based suggestion system in place 

How does a team based suggestion system work First teams are formed in order to gather suggestions from employees on ways to improve The teams are permanent groups The teams meet on a regular basis to discuss the ideas and suggestions They make decisions on approving or declining the ideas Also the teams are given limited spending authority to approve and implement the suggestions  Suggestions that are approved by a team but are beyond their spending authority are advanced to a higher level in the organization for final approval Unlike a traditional suggestion system a team based system does not provide individual monetary rewards This is because everyone works together and shares in the gain together Gainsharing is not an individual incentive plan 

In terms of the calculation a Gainsharing plan may have from one to six key performance measures  Examples of measures include productivity quality waste spending and customer service The gains from each measure are calculated separately Then gains and losses from each measure are added to determine the total gain A portion of the total gain goes to the company and a portion is shared with all employees Generally from 10 to 50 of the gain is shared with employees  The percent of the gain shared with employees depends on employee controllability and importance of the measure to the organization The pool is distributed to all participants typically on a monthly or quarterly frequency 

It is also very important to note that the development and implementation of a Gainsharing plan often involves employees An employee committee called the Design Team helps to make policy decisions on issues such as the plans measures employee eligibility frequency of payout and method of communication Next the design team gets upper management approval before implementation After approval the Design Team is responsible for conducting meetings with all employees to communicate the details of the plan Follow up training should also take place

The following summarizes many of the elements of a Gainsharing plan which have been discussed 

In summary companies with successful Gainsharing plans view Gainsharing as much more than a bonus or incentive system Instead they see the system as an important part of their business strategy and a method to drive organization change Gainsharing can be a powerful tool if installed and managed by a company that truly believes in its people

The Book of Mormon is a book that Latter Day Saints believe is the word of God along with the Bible

The original English version of the Book of Mormon was published in March 1830 by a man named Joseph Smith Jr who claimed to be a prophet like the ones in the Old Testament

Joseph Smith said that he translated the book into English from gold plates given to him by an angel The book claims that the language it was first written in was made from the learning of the Jews and the language of the Egyptians

The story contained in the Book of Mormon is a shortened version written by a man named Mormon of the record of two groups of people called the Nephites and the Lamanites Their ancestors left Jerusalem with their father Lehi about 600 years before the birth of Christ sailed across a very big ocean and settled in the New World It gives an account of their families cities wars systems of government spiritual experiences and religious beliefs among other things The main purpose of the Book of Mormon is to teach about Jesus Christ

It also contains the Book of Ether which told the story of another people who had lived in some of the same areas shortly after the time of the Tower of Babel but died out because of wars

Usually Book of Mormon stories show the Nephites as the more righteous industrious and peaceful people and the Lamanites as wicked lazy and warlike Wars happen all the time between the two groups But near the end of the book the Nephites become more wicked than the Lamanites and all the Nephites die in their last war except for one named Moroni who was directed by God to bury the Book of Mormon in a hill so that Joseph Smith Jr could find it

The central theme of the book revolves around Jesus Christ visiting the people described performing miracles and showing them the right way to live

Ccuta or San Jose de Ccuta is the capital of the Norte de Santander Department in Colombia Ccuta is an important city in northeastern Colombia because of where it is on the border with Venezuela People from Ccuta are called cucuteos

The area has grown fast since the 1960s especially the suburbs of Villa del Rosario and Los Patios

Adding also to the citys progress and development that had not been seen in 20 years with the building of six overpasses a convention center a new bus terminal a new Integrated Massive Transportation System called Metrobus the modernization of state owned schools the recovery of Cucutas downtown and the duplication of the capacity for the General Santander Stadium And the expectation over new industries that will come from Venezuela and will place their factories in Cucuta aimming at exporting through the Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement between Colombia and the United States

Simn Bolvar captured Ccuta in 1813 and set out from there on his march to Caracas At Ccuta the constituent congress of 1821 met to draft the constitution of Greater Colombia

The city was largely destroyed by an earthquake on 18 May 1875 but was soon rebuilt

In 1939 Ccuta had a population of 59323 people in 1990 it had 532564 and in 2005 the metropolitan area had a population of 950000

The battle of Ccuta was not important as military day but by the moral importance that took Bolivar advantage to release to Venezuela

Batalla began at 900 AM of the 28 of February of 1813 and finished noon The combatants 400 men to the control of Simn Bolivar and 800 to orders of Spanish General Ramon Correa

Two dead and 14 hurt of liberating troops and 20 dead and 40 hurts of the Spanish troops 

Also known as the Earthquake of the Andes It happened the May 18 of 1875 at 1115 AM It completely destroyed Ccuta Villa del Rosario San Antonio del Tachira and Capacho also causing serious damages in the Venezuelan populations of San Cristbal La Mulata Rubio Michelena La Grita Coln among others and was felt in Bogota and Caracas

Ccuta is located on a plateau in the Cordillera Oriental of the Colombian Andes The official metropolitan area includes the municipalities of Villa del Rosario Los Patios El Zulia and Puerto Santander All four neighboring municipalities contain extensive rural areas despite recent urbanizationcitation

The city of Ccuta is plain toward the north and mountainous in its edges and in its central part especially toward the south where presents for the east the following mountains removed of the eastern mountain range of the Colombian Andes

Ccuta and Norte de Santander have many rivers none of them with pollution problems being the Pamplonita River the Guaramito River the San Miguel River and the Zulia River de most important

Ccuta is a city with a big demographic growth because it had 387481 inhabitants at 1951 and now has a population of 1196775

Ccuta has an agroindustry that mainly produces milk products and liquors construction has boomed in recent years but its a net commercial city due to its condition of border city with Venezuela Thanks to it the major Colombian commercial centers banks and warehouses have offices in the city

US  Colombia Free Trade Agreement implications for Ccuta

Colombia signed a Free Trade Agreement with the United States to the opposition of Venezuela Despite its opposition industries from that country are constructing their infrastructure in Ccuta to export their products to the United States registering their products as if they were Colombian an strategy that would allow them to export without paying certain tariffs For that reason Ccuta is thought to become an industrial city  

This process in individual appears by the legal norm of Colombia that allows exemptions in taxes to make but competitive to the region in addition that the own geographic characteristics of the area at issue you appear greater possibilities of exporting products through position of Maracaibo

Ccuta has a municipal area of 1176 km and is located at 302 above sea level The average temperature of 28C with an average humidity of 65 Its medium annual precipitation is of 1041mm There are two rain seasons between March May and September November The dry months of the year are December and January with a medium precipitation of 58mm 

Ccuta is also known as the Ciudad sin fronteras La ciudad de los arboles La hermosa villa y Ciudad verde

The city is served by one transportation terminal and the Camilo Daza Airport which is located north of the city In general the more prosperous areas are along and above west and to the eastcitationneeded 

The state owned university the Francisco de Paula Santander University is in the northeastern part of the city there are several private universities of varying quality

Many important personalities from Colombia are from Ccuta such as the first President of Colombia Francisco de Paula Santander known as the man of the laws and Fabiola Zuluaga the best Colombian tennis player Virgilio Barco a former president of Colombia some actors like Lincoln Palomeque Endry Carreo Manolo Suiga and the musician Elias M Soto

The generation of cucuteos and the legion of foreigners who reconstructed the city after the 1875 earthquake planted trees which grew fruits called clemones that had acid and bitter fruits with which the boys played

Soon they were replaced by acacias peracos and almonds tree In the historical course of the arborization of the city different stages as far as the spices have been marked that have been used in the ornamentacin

In Ccuta the love for the trees is preached and applied and cucuteo respect someone who has planted one in front of his house For this reason Ccuta is well known like the city forest of Colombia

Some people or organisations like companies have many addresses of different people They use these addresses to send the same mail to these addresses they have In the postal system using regular mail such mailing lists are used to distribute these mails which may be wanted or unwanted 

In the electronic form these differences also exist Bulk mailings is distributed using mailing lists On the other hand there are mailing lists people subscribe to Every time someone sends a mail to the mailing list this mail is distributed to all people who are on the list The Software which manages such a mailing list sometimes offers options to the people who subscribe Instead of getting each mail directly they might want only one mail This mail then contains all the mails of that day This is called a digest

Also mails that come from people on the list might be handled differently from mails from people who are not subscribed to the mailing list

  

Mailing lists are a way to reach selected groups of people  by specific parameters  through the United States Post Office The population may be broken into sections organized buy their unique qualities such as catalog purchasers or business owners or by geographic area such as businesses or residents in a particular city or zip code or buy select statistical parameters such as businesses with over 20 employees or heads of household with income of over 80000 Direct Mail Lists are then sold to direct marketing companies wishing to make an offer to this specific segment of the population By tightly specifying the parameters of the mailing list direct mail is a very effective way to market to a precisely selected group with little wasted advertising expense

Electrochemistry is a kind of chemistry that studies chemical reactions that use or make electricity Reactions like this happen at electrodes which are made from something that conducts electricity and put in an electrolyte An electrolyte is a solution that has ions in it

Electrochemistry was invented at the same time as the voltaic pile the first kind of electric battery

Sulfuric acid also known as sulphuric acid is a strong acid It is also a chemical compound Its chemical formula is H2SO4 It was known as Oil of Vitriol in ancient times 

It is a thick clear liquid that can dissolve in water 

It was once known as oil of vitriol This name was created by Jabir ibn Hayyan the person who discovered it It used to be prepared by the reaction of potassium nitrate with sulfur This reaction would produce sulfur trioxide which would dissolve in steam to produce sulfuric acid Then this reaction was done in lead containers The contact process the most common process was invented in 1831 and is still used today

It is made by reacting sulfur trioxide with sulfuric acid to produce oleum Then oleum is dissolved in water to produce more sulfuric acid The sulfur trioxide is produced by burning sulfur to produce sulfur dioxide which was then oxidized to sulfur trioxide with a catalyst This process is called the contact process

Sulfuric acid has many uses and is made more than any other chemical besides water World production in 2001 was 165 million tons worth about 8 billion US dollars Uses include ore processing fertilizer manufacturing oil refining wastewater processing lead acid batteries and combining chemicals for scientific reasons For example phosphate rocks are reacted with sulfuric acid to produce soluble phosphates useful in fertilizers This reaction is also used to make phosphoric acid useful in soda Potassium compounds are dissolved in sulfuric acid to produce potassium sulfate useful in fertilizers Ammonia is also reacted with sulfuric acid to produce ammonium sulfate These three chemicals are solids and provide the three main minerals needed in plants Lead acid batteries use sulfuric acid as their electrolyte 

Sulfuric acid is very poisonous because of its acidity and corrosiveness When it is mixed with sugar it turns it into carbon When it is dissolved in water it becomes less harmful but is still corrosive like normal acids It reacts with metals to produce hydrogen and the metal sulfate Some metals such as tin make sulfur dioxide and tin sulfate It reacts with sodium chloride to make hydrogen chloride

A Jew is a person who is of Jewish heritage Jews typically consider themselves as a separate nation rather than just adherents of a religion therefore a Jew is not only one that practices the religion of Judaism but it is also one who is of Jewish heritage According to the Jewish Halakha someone is Jewish if their mother was a Jew

Dame Jane Goodall DBE born in London on 3 April 1934 is a zoologist 

Goodall is a British primatologist ethologist anthropologist and UN Messenger of Peace She is the worlds foremost expert on chimpanzees Goodall is best known for her 45 year study of social and family interactions of wild chimpanzees in Gombe Stream National Park Tanzania She is the founder of the Jane Goodall Institute and has worked extensively on conservation and animal welfare issues

She has been interested in animals since childhood As a child she was given a lifelike chimpanzee toy named Jubilee by her father her fondness for the toy started her early love of animals

She went to Kenya and met Dr Louis Leakey there In 1958 Leakey sent Goodall to London to study primate behavior with two experts 

Leakey raised funds and in 1960 Goodall went to Gombe Stream National Park becoming the first of Leakeys Angels She was accompanied by her mother whose presence was necessary to satisfy the requirements of David Anstey chief warden He was concerned for their safety Tanzania was Tanganyika at that time and a British protectorate

Leakey arranged funding and in 1962 sent Goodall who had no degree to Cambridge University where she obtained a PhD degree in Ethology She became only the eighth person to be allowed study for a PhD without first obtaining a BA or BSc Her thesis was completed in 1965 titled Behavior of the free ranging Chimpanzee It told of her first five years of study at the Gombe Reserve

Goodall has been married twice On 28 March 1964 she married a Dutch nobleman wildlife photographer Baron Hugo van Lawick The couple had a son Hugo Eric Louis affectionately known as Grub who was born in 1967 They divorced in 1974 

In 1975 she married Derek Bryceson He was a member of Tanzanias parliament and director of national parks he died of cancer in October 1980 With his position in the Tanzanian government as head of the countrys national park system Bryceson was able to protect Goodalls research project He put an embargo on tourism at Gombe while he was alive

In addition to the DBE Jane received many honours from other countries

Goodall is best known for her study of chimpanzee social and family life She began studying the Kasakela chimpanzee community in Gombe Stream National Park Tanzania in 1960 

Instead of numbering the chimpanzees she observed she gave them names such as Fifi and David Greybeard and observed them to have unique and individual personalities an unconventional idea at the time She found that It isnt only human beings who have personality who are capable of rational thought and emotions like joy and sorrow 

She also observed behaviors such as hugs kisses pats on the back and even tickling what we consider human actions Goodall insists that these gestures are evidence of the close supportive affectionate bonds that develop between family members and other individuals within a community which can persist throughout a life span of more than 50 years These findings suggest similarities between humans and chimpanzees can be seen in emotion intelligence and family and social relationships

Goodalls research at Gombe Stream challenged two long standing beliefs of the day that only humans could build and use tools and that chimpanzees were vegetarians While observing one chimpanzee feeding at a termite mound she watched him repeatedly place stalks of grass into termite holes then remove them from the hole covered with clinging termites effectively fishing for termites The chimps would also take twigs from trees and strip off the leaves to make the twig more effective a form of object modification which is the rudimentary beginnings of toolmaking 

Man the Toolmaker is a famous phrase in anthropology In response to Janes research Louis Leakey wrote We must now redefine man redefine tool or accept chimpanzees as human Over the course of her study Goodall found evidence of mental traits in chimpanzees such as reasoned thought abstraction generalization symbolic representation and even the concept of self All these were thought to be uniquely human abilities

In contrast to the peaceful and affectionate behaviors she observed Goodall also found an aggressive side of chimp nature at Gombe Stream 

She discovered that chimps will systematically hunt and eat smaller primates such as Colobus monkeys Goodall watched a hunting group isolate a colobus high in a tree block all possible exits then one chimpanzee climbed up and captured and killed the colobus The others then each took parts of the carcass sharing with other members of the troop in response to begging behaviours The chimps at Gombe kill and eat as much as one third of the colobus population in the park each year This alone was a major scientific find which challenged previous conceptions of chimp diet and behavior

Also startling and disturbing was the tendency for aggression and violence within chimpanzee troops Goodall observed dominant females deliberately killing the young of other females in the troop in order to maintain their dominance sometimes going as far as cannibalism 

She says of this revelation During the first ten years of the study I had believed that the Gombe chimpanzees were for the most part rather nicer than human beings Then suddenly we found that chimpanzees could be brutalthat they like us had a darker side to their nature These findings revolutionized our knowledge of chimpanzee behaviour They were further evidence of the social similarities between humans and chimpanzees albeit in a much darker manner

Decidability theory is a branch of mathematics Suppose there is a set and there is an element There is also an algorithm The algorithm will simply check if the element belongs to the set or not If the algorithm stops and has reached a decision if the element is in the set or not this is called decidable

In simple terms if there is a shopping bag decidability is that one is able to check whether or not there is some salad in the bag

Some logical problems cannot be decided that way They are called undecidable

There is a weaker property too called semidecidable A set is called semidecidable if the algorithm described above can only decide if an element is in the set or is not in the set in finite time but not both

A Las Vegas algorithm is an algorithm that uses randomness If the algorithm gives a result this result will be the correct one The algorithm gambles with the resources used It may take a very long times to give back a result or it may not give back a result at all 

A simple example would be a version of the QuickSort algorithm Quicksort is used to quickly sort things For this each element is compared to a central element Depending on how this element is selected the sorting can take more time or less

Most often a Las Vegas algorithm is used to pick the pivot randomly

N factorial is the number we get when we multiply every number from 1 to N If N is 0 N factorial is 1 N is not defined for negative numbers However the related Gamma function is defined over the real and complex numbers

It is used to find out how many possibilities there are to arrange objects

For example if there are 3 letters they can be arranged as ABC ACB BAC BCA CAB and CBA Thats 6 choices because A can be put in 3 different places B has 2 choices left after A is placed and C has only one choice left after A and B have been placed That is 321 6 choices

More generally if there are three objects and we want to find out how many different ways there are to arrange than for the first object there are 3 choices For the second object there are only two choices left as the first object has already been chosen And finally for the third object there is only one object left

Therefore 3 is equivalent to 321 or 6

This function is a good example of recursion as 3 can be written as 3 which can be written as 32 and finally 321 N can therefore also be defined as N with 0 1

The factorial function grows very fast There are 3628800 ways to arrange 10 items

A database is a system for organizing data It is a collection of raw data that can be manipulated sorted and questioned to produce information The data can be stored in many ways Before computers card files printed books and other methods were used Now most data is kept on computer files

The data in a database is organized in some way Before there were computers employee data was often kept in file cabinets There was usually one card for each employee On the card information such as the date of birth or the name of the employee could be found A database also has such cards To the user the card will look the same as it did in old times only this time it will be on the screen To the computer the information on the card can be stored in different ways Each of these ways is known as a database model The most commonly used database model is called relational database model it uses relations and sets to store the data Normal users talking about the database model will not talk about relations they will talk about database tables

In databases some data changes occasionally There may be problems when data is changed an error might have occurred The error might make the data useless The database system looks at the data it must fulfill certain requirements It does this by using a transaction There are two points in time in the database the time before the data was changed and the time after the data was changed If something goes wrong when changing the data the database system simply puts the database back into the state before the change happened This is called rollback After all the changes are done successfully they are committed This means that the data makes sense again committed changes can no longer be undone

In order to be able to do this databases follow the ACID principle

There are different ways how to represent the data 

Like in real life the same data can be looked at from different perspectives and it can be organized in different ways There are different things to consider when organizing the data

Mily Alexanyevich Balakirev was a Russian composer His music sounds very Russian and he was a very important influence on other Russian composers such as Modest Mussorgsky Nikolai Rimsky Korsakov Alexander Borodin and Csar Cui These five composers were known as the Mighty Handful Balakirev mainly wrote music for orchestra choir and piano and solo songs

Hector Berlioz was a French composer He was one of the greatest composers of the 19th century His music is typical of the Romantic period full of passion and often based on ideas outside music He was not particularly good at playing any instrument but he was brilliant at writing for the orchestra Some of his most famous works include several orchestral overtures the Symphonie Fantastique the opera Les Troyens the requiem Grande messe des morts and the song cycle Les nuits dt He was very original as a composer and his music was not fully appreciated until many years after his death

Berlioz was the eldest of six children One brother and one sister lived to be adults and Berlioz was always very fond of them both His father was a doctor The family lived in the country north west of Grenoble

Berlioz only went to school for a short time when he was ten years old The rest of his education he had from his father He liked French and Latin literature and travel books about faraway countries He learned to play the flute the flageolet and the guitar He read a book by Rameau about harmony He never had a piano He just imagined the sounds of chords in his head He was only 12 when he fell in love with a girl called Estelle who was 18 He was teased about it a lot He started to compose some music

When he was 17 his father said that he wanted him to be a doctor Berlioz wanted to study music but his father made him go to Paris to study medicine Berlioz was to stay in Paris for the rest of his life He studied medicine for two years but he hated it One day in an anatomy lesson he had had enough and jumped out of the window He started to study music His father was furious and stopped sending him money Berlioz was very poor and started writing musical criticism for newspapers This is how he earned most of his money for the rest of his life He was also borrowing money from friends

Berlioz started going to the Opra He particularly liked the music of Gluck and went to the library to study Glucks scores At the end of 1822 he found a good teacher His name was Le Sueur He made Berlioz stop publishing his music until he had learned to compose properly In 1826 he was officially a student at the Conservatoire He continued to study with Le Sueur and with Reicha He tried four times to win the important music prize called Prix de Rome The first time he wrote a piece called La Mort dOrphe The judges said it was unplayable but Berlioz got an orchestra to play it The second time he wrote a piece called Herminie which had a tune he used later as the main tune for his Symphonie fantastique The third time he wrote a cantata La mort de Cloptre which is a wonderful work but he still did not win the prize The fourth time he wrote a cantata La mort de Sardanapale and he won the prize Nearly all the music for this work is now lost

Berlioz did not understand any English but he went to a performance of Shakespeares Hamlet given by an English theatre company The actress taking the part of Ophelia was called Harriet Smithson Berlioz fell passionately in love with her although he did not know her and started following her about everywhere In the end he married her The marriage was not a success Berlioz was really in love with Ophelia the character from Shakespeares play He found it hard to love Harriet in real life

Shakespeares plays however were to be a great inspiration for Berlioz He wrote many works which are inspired by Shakespeare including Romo et Juliette Batrice et Bndict Roi Lear and several others He was also inspired at this time by Goethes Faust as well as by many other writers including ETA Hoffmann Scott and Byron He also discovered the music of Beethoven which helped him to learn how to give shape to large compositions

Berlioz started to be very busy putting on concerts of his music in Paris He was quickly becoming known as a very original young composer Winning the Prix de Rome gave him a steady income for a time but he was supposed to go to Rome Berlioz did not want to go to Rome He said that he had plenty of work in Paris The real reason why did not want to go was probably because he was in love with a 19 year old girl called Camille Moke 

Berlioz spent 15 months in Rome On his way there he visited his parents who seemed to have forgiven him for not studying medicine They could now be proud because their son was so successful In Italy Berlioz did not write much music He did not like Italian music or Italian art but he was inspired by the countryside the sun the sea the people he met sailors peasants sculptors travellers He did not like the city of Rome although he did like Florence He hated the Villa Medici the house where he had to stay When he travelled about he wrote some music When he heard the news that Camille now loved another man he became so furious that he left Rome in order to return to Paris to kill them both However when he got as far as Nice he calmed down and changed his mind He returned to Rome

At the end of his time in Italy he returned to Paris visiting his parents on the way He started organizing concerts of his music This is when he got to know Harriet Smithson They had a strange courtship and he married her in 1833 The next year they had a son The marriage was never easy Their personalities were different they were poor and they did not speak one anothers language In 1842 they separated and Harriet died in great poverty in 1854

Although a few people thought that Berlioz was an original composer many others thought his music was very strange He hardly earned any money from composing Most of the money he earned came from musical journalism which is something he hated When his works were performed he usually conducted them himself He wrote a work for viola and orchestra called Harold en Italie Paganini had asked him to write it for him to play but when Paganini saw the music he did not like it because it was not showy enough for the viola Some years later Paganini heard the work and decided he liked it so he paid Berlioz 20000 Francs This was a lot of money and it made it possible for Berlioz to spend time writing a big new work Romo et Juliette When this was first performed some critics thought that Berlioz did not understand Shakespeare probably However Richard Wagner who was in the audience at the first performance was very impressed Berlioz tried to be successful as an opera composer but people did not understand his original music He wrote a Grand symphonie funbre et triomphale originally written for a military band Les nuits dt is a very moving song cycle

During the 1840s and 1850s Berlioz spent much of his time travelling abroad He went to Germany Austria Russia and England He was becoming more famous abroad than at home in France although he still continued to go back to Paris The Germans loved his music and were impressed by his conducting He rarely conducted anything except his own music In 1846 he composed one of his finest works La Damnation de Faust which was performed in the Opra Comique The opera house was half empty It was a great disappointment to him Berlioz continued to tour to other countries where people appreciated him He had great success in St Petersburg in Berlin where he performed to the King of Prussia and in London where he never got paid for the concerts that Jullien conducted because Jullien had no money left However he had other successes in London and the English liked him very much

In 1854 Harriet Smithson died and seven months later Berlioz married Marie Recio a singer he had known for 12 years Her Spanish mother came to live with them and she looked after Berlioz very kindly in his last years when he was ill Berlioz son Louis had become a captain in the navy and travelled all over the world This was something Berlioz had always dreamt of doing since his childhood when he used to read travel books Berlioz was terribly sad in 1867 when he heard that Louis had died in Havana of yellow fever

Berlioz had always had a passion for the Latin poet Virgil In 1856 he spent a long time writing a long opera in five acts called Les Troyens He knew it would be almost impossible to find anyone who would put on a performance It only became possible in 1863 after he had divided the work into two parts After that it was 30 years before the opera was performed again It contains some of his best music The storm scene is especially famous and often performed separately as an orchestral piece

As he got older he became obsessed with death He had lost two wives and his two sisters had also died He started to walk in cemeteries He wrote his Memoires It has been translated into many languages including English

In 1863 he wrote to Estelle the girl he had loved when he was a child She was now a widow of 67 and he was 60 He visited her in Lyons and loved her again He wrote regularly to her for the rest of his life and stayed with her three times in Grenoble where she lived with her son She gradually understood him better and she gave him much happiness during his last years

A final journey to St Petersburg was too much for Berlioz He became ill He went to Nice on the way home where he twice collapsed while walking by the sea He went back to Paris where he was cared for by his mother in law He died on 11 March 1869 and was buried in the Cimitire Montmartre

Berlioz is a clear example of a prophet who is without honour in his own country not many people in France realized he was a great composer but in other countries he was welcomed as one of the great composers and conductors of his day Many of his works are difficult to describe His Symphonie fantastique is not quite a symphony his Harold en Italie is not quite a concerto His Requiem is not a normal religious requiem Romo et Juliette is a mixture of all sorts of things He wrote five operas which are all very different in style His songs are tender and lovely influenced by the French romance His overtures are very popular at orchestral concerts His music is very original and although he wrote a book on orchestration the sounds he composed were so personal that no one could imitate him He was not good at playing any instrument but could imagine all the sounds in his head Many of his melodies stretch themselves over an unusual number of bars A lot of his orchestral music is programme music it is often inspired by books or wild stories in his imagination

Vincenzo Bellini was an Italian composer and one of the most important opera composers of the early 19th century 

Bellinis genius was mostly musical rather than dramatic He was admired for his melodies notable for their elegiac beauty and long arching phrases His first success was Il pirata in 1827 followed by I Capuleti e Montecchi in 1830 Then came his most famous operas La sonnambula Norma and his last I puritani which proved a sensational triumph

His second to last work Beatrice di Tenda was less successful

Although his operas never left the repertoire they regained prominence in the 1950s due largely to soprano Maria Callas followed by Joan Sutherland in the 1960s 

Charles Valentin Alkan was a French Jewish composer and pianist His real name was Morhange He was a virtuoso pianist who wrote a lot of piano music Most of the pieces he wrote are extremely difficult to play Franz Liszt Busoni and other people of his day thought he was a great composer Despite this most people have only discovered in recent years how good his music is His piano music is mostly tonal but it changes key in unusual ways The story was told by many people that he died when a bookcase collapsed on top of him but that story is proved not to be true

From the 1860s to 1873 he did not show in public very much and composed some of his works 

Alkan was a close friend of Frdric Chopin and Franz Liszt

Thomas Arne born London baptized 28 May 1710 died London 5 March 1778 was an English composer and violinist He was the most famous musician in the theatre in England in the 18th century He wrote music for lots of plays He did not have the genius of Handel but he had a great gift for writing beautiful tunes Songs such as Where the Bee Sucks are still very popular His best known tune is Rule Britannia which is sung every year at the Last Night of the Proms

Johann Nepomuk Hummel was an Austrian composer and pianist He was a child prodigy His family moved to Vienna when he was eight Mozart thought he was so talented that he taught him free of charge Hummel became one of the greatest pianists and composers in Europe He always wrote in a Classical style he never became an early Romantic like Beethoven

Alphabetical order is a way to sort a list It makes it easier to find a name or a title in the list It is done by following the standard order of letters in an alphabet Sorting things in English is done using the Roman alphabet Different languages have different rules for sorting

A list of items like Eric Lydia Andrea and Bob is organized by their first letter A comes before B and B comes before E and E comes before L in the alphabet When alphabetical order is used

If many words have the same first letter they are sorted by their second letters

After that the third and fourth letters are used until the whole list is sorted

The words a an and the are ignored Sometimes they are written at the end after a comma Spaces and hyphens are ignored too

That can also be listed like this

Names are usually ordered by Family name not given name

Names are often written with the last names first

Numbers can be sorted in two ways Sometimes they are listed in order from smallest to largest This is the normal way to sort numbers

Other times they can be sorted as if they were normal spelled out words This way is often used for numbers in titles

Merging and moving are two important ways articles can be changed on Wikipedia 

There are several good reasons to merge pages

Merging should always leave a redirect or a disambiguation page in place of the merged place This is often needed to see the edit history for the page the merged text came from Even if it seems rather pointless leave it in place Extra redirects do not hurt anything and are sometimes helpful Also other websites may have made links to the old page title so we will want to redirect new visitors to the merged page We do not want people accidentally making a new page at the old title not knowing that the merged page is already there Redirects also show up in search results helping people who might be looking under the wrong title to find the page that they are looking for

You may find that some or all of the information to be merged is already in the other page That is fine feel free to get rid of the repeated parts and only add new stuff If there is no information to be added to the other page you can say in your edit summary on the merged page that there was nothing to be merged

Merging is something any editor can do and if you are sure that something should be merged you can go ahead and do so But if the merge is argued you may find your merge reverted and as with all other edits edit wars should be avoided

If you are not sure if merging is right you should propose it on the pages in question After enough time has gone by to talk about it you may do the merger or ask someone else to

To propose a merger of two or more pages place the tag merge at the top of each page It should look like this

 It has been suggested that this ifNAMESPACEpagearticle or section be merged with

The Discuss link normally leads to the top of the articles Talk page 

If you know which page should stay under the same name you can use the tag mergefrom on that page and mergeto on the page or pages that should be merged and redirected to the first page Using these templates saves other editors time deciding how to merge and causes all Discuss links to lead to the same talk page of the first page These templates will appear as 

It has been suggested that the text on be merged into this namespaces or sectionCategoryPages to merge

and

It has been suggested that the text below be merged into the pageCategoryPages to merge

After proposing the merge put your reasons on the talk page and check back in a few days for answers from other editors If there is no disagreement after five days that the articles should be merged then go ahead and merge them

If you cant fix up the new article please tag the article with cleanup for attention of other editors

On Wikipedia usually anyone logged in can change the name of a page from its current name to a new one This is called moving because the effect is as if the page has been moved A redirect is created at its old name so that links still work 

After a move to fix a spelling error or typo you may want to list the first redirect for deletion at WikipediaRedirects for deletion This usually only needs to be done in special cases

Sometimes you may think that a page is wrongly named for another reason For example Napoleon is more well known as Napoleon I of France However this is where a redirect would be better Most people would not search for Marie de Rabutin Chantal marquise de Svign but for Mme de Sevigne

The move feature is able to move pages in any namespace and even able to move pages from one namespace to another Cross namespace moving is needed when a page is accidentally created in the wrong namespace for example moving TalkAbraham Lincoln to TalkAbraham Lincoln or moving Articles for deletionSome article to WikipediaArticles for deletionSome article In some cases new users may create articles on themselves that they mean to be their user page

Often other types of cross namespace moves will be opposed by other people and should be discussed with other editors WikipediaRequested moves is the best place for this

Note you must be logged in to do this to an account that is at least 4 days old

If you cannot rename a page or you think that the renaming may be opposed please go to WikipediaRequested moves and list it there

If the move does not work it is often because there is already an article at the title where youre trying to move the article This is likely to happen if there is a history of moves from one name to another This can be fixed by an administrator after discussion at WPRFD

If there is only a redirect with no history at the other name the move will still work the designers of the MediaWiki software saw this as a special case where nothing will be lost if a move is performed

In music the word key has two meanings

The key system is explained in the article circle of fifths

Otaku is a Japanese slang word which means someone who has a hobby that they spend more time money and effort on than normal people do They know a lot about their hobby and things related to it for example an anime otaku might spend a lot of time watching anime buy a lot of DVDs and other merchandise learn about the people who create anime or create something about anime Originally otaku was a word to speak to someone from another family with respect 

In Japan otaku is generally considered a rude word Calling someone an otaku in Japan would be a very bad insult However in America otaku is often used to refer to fans of anime and manga In America calling someone an otaku is not necessarily rude In Australia the term otaku is seen not only as not rude but in a lot of anime fans cases as a thing to be very proud of being called The term otaku is used to mean a very knowledgeable geek obsessed with anime an extreme fan of anime and manga

In music theory the Circle of fifths shows how the different keys are related to one another It is usually shown as a circle with the names of keys around it If you take any key in the circle its fifth is the one to its right It can be easily understood together with a piano keyboard

On a piano there are white and black notes The white notes are named by the letters A to G of the alphabet After G comes another A and so on The black notes go in threes and twos This makes it easy to see the pattern of white notes Where there are two black notes together for example the white note between them is D The black notes do not have names of their own They are named after the white notes next to them The black note just above of a G is a G sharp The black note just below of the G is G flat This means that each black note has two possible names

Playing each note in turn whether a white or a black note will give a chromatic scale Each step is called a semitone or half tone A tone or whole tone therefore is a jump of two semitones

By playing on white notes from C to the next C we get a major scale Some of the steps are tones and some are semitones The semitones come between E and F and between B and C ie between the 3rd and 4th and between the 7th and 8th note of the scale All major scales have this pattern

Each time we went to a sharper key we took the note which was the 5th note of the previous scale

In a diagram this can be shown as a circle which is called the Circle of Fifths As we get sharper and sharper we go clockwise round the circle

The flats work in exactly the opposite way Instead of going up to the fifth note we can go down a fifth F is the scale which has one flat As we get flatter and flatter we go counter clockwise round the circle until all seven notes are flattened

It can be seen that three of the scales each have two possible names B major can also be thought of as C flat major F sharp major can also be thought of as G flat major and C sharp major can also be thought of as D flat major

Relative minors can also be worked out by going round three steps of the circle On a keyboard the relative minor can be worked out by going down three semitones

Haddock is a fish that lives in the Atlantic ocean It only lives in the sea Haddocks are important fish for the fishing industry The fish can be easily recognised by a black line on the white side of the fish Pollock is a fish with reversed coloring white line on a black background

The Kristallnacht was a two day pogrom that happened against Jews in Nazi Germany and parts of Austria It was between November 9 and November 10 1938 About 30000 Jews were moved to concentration camps and over 1500 synagogues were pillaged and partly destroyed Also almost all Jewish cemeteries in Germany and Austria were destroyed This marked the change from discriminating against Jews to actively persecuting and deporting them 

Herschel Grynszpan a 17 year old Jew living in Paris learned that his whole family had been made to go back to Zsbaszyn in Poland even though the younger children had been born in Germany He got a gun With this he fired shots at Ernst Eduard vom Rath who was a secretary of the German embassy in Paris This was on November 7 Vom Rath died of his wounds on November 9 

The motive of Grynszpan is unclear In a judicial hearing in 1942 he said it was revenge He meant to shoot the ambassador but hit the secretary instead 

The NSDAP used this event as an excuse to seize Jewish property There had been a similar event in February 1936 but there were almost no consequences Then a Jewish student David Frankfurter had fired shots at the NSDAP secretary Wilhelm Gustloff At that time the NSDAP could not act because of the Summer Olympics of 1936 in Berlin

A Sertoli cell is a cell found in the testes Its main function is to help the developing sperm cells through the stages of spermatogenesis  the process of turning stem cells into sperm It was also called the mother cell The cell also helps in the creation of stem cells

Sertoli cells get their name from Enrico Sertoli an Italian physiologist He discovered them while studying medicine in the University of Pavia Italy He published a description of this cell in 1865 As of 2006 two textbooks have been published that are almost entirely about the Sertoli cell 

University President is the highest title in some universities It is the same as the Chancellor or rector in other Universities

The Public Broadcasting Service is a non profit public broadcasting television service with 349 member TV stations in the United States with some member stations available by cable in Canada While the term broadcast covers radio PBS only covers TV for radio the United States has National Public Radio American Public Radio and Public Radio International 

UPN was a television network in over 200 places in the United States UPN was owned by CBS Corporation which also owns the larger CBS network UPN shut down on September 15 2006 and was replaced with The CW Television Network

A television network is a network to provide television programming to many television stations It is almost always a large company Until the mid 1980s television programming in most countries of the world was mainly done by a small number of broadcast networks Many early television networks began as radio networks 

A television network may broadcast many television channels For example BBC is a television network It broadcasts its programmes on many different channels including BBC One BBC Two BBC Parliament and CBBC Each channel will often have a group of programmes that are similar in some way For example CBBC broadcasts childrens programmes

The Vuelta Ciclista a Espaa is a long distance bicycle race The first race was in 1935 The Tour de France and Giro dItalia were both very successful and both run by newspaper companies A newspaper called Informaciones in Spain decided to start a similar race in Spain It is now one of the three Grand Tours of Europe and after the Tour de France and the Giro dItalia is the third most important road cycling stage race in the world

The leader of the race wears the Jersey de Oro the golden jersey This is the same as the yellow jersey in the Tour de France The leader of the mountain climbers competition wears a green jersey The leader of the sprinters competition wears a blue jersey with gold fish

The race was run in the Spring until 1995 Since 1995 it has been run in September

Seminiferous tubules are long thread like tubes found in each of the testicles where sperm is produced The inner lining of the tubule contains Sertoli cells

The seminal vesicles are a pair of tube like glands They are found behind the bladder of males They make most of the content of semen About 70 of the seminal fluid in humans comes from the seminal vesicles

Both vesicles are about 5 cm in length but it is curled up Each gland makes a ball shape on the wall of each vas deferens There is a tube linking the seminal glands which opens into the vas deferens and prostate gland

From inside to out the layers making the vesicles are

The seminal vesicles make most of semen but during ejaculation most of the ejaculate has sperm rather than semen in it The use of seminal fluid is not known since sperm do not move or survive well in semen Some think that it acts as a fluid to stop sperm from another male impregnating the female so that the children of only one male can survive

Seminal fluid has proteins enzymes fructose mucus vitamin C and flavins The fructose gives sperm energy and food

The glans penis is the sensitive tip of the penis It is also called the head of the penis Slang names include helmet and bell end When the penis is not erect it is covered by the foreskin except in men who have been circumcised

The opening of the urethra is at the tip of the glans In children who have been circumcised and wear diapers the opening of the penis has no protection This can cause the urethra to get very narrow which can need surgery to reopen later

The epithelium of the glans penis is moist and washing it too much can dry the mucous membrane that covers the glans penis and cause dermatitis 

The glans penis is a cap around the corpus spongiosum It is attached to the Corpus cavernosum penis and at the tip of the glans is the urethra opening The foreskin helps keeps the glans moist In males who have been circumcised the glans is dry

In grammar the second person is the person whom someone is speaking to or writing to It is the person talked to Generally this is called grammatical person

Very few nouns are second person nouns because people do not usually talk directly to things like tables In fact in English just about the only kind of nouns that are second person is a small group of pronouns that can be seen in the table below

Sometimes a persons name is used in the second person but thats usually just with a baby For example instead of saying you sit here one could say Charlie sits here

In English grammar people do not usually have to do anything special to the verb if they use a second person noun as a subject In fact the verb be is the only verb that has a special form for the second person are In other languages such as French though verbs change in different ways to match the subject In this table tu and vous are the second person pronouns We can see how the verb parler changes when people use them

An optical fiber is a thin fiber of glass or plastic that can carry light from one end to the other The study of optical fibers is called fiber optics which is part of applied science and engineering 

Optical fibers are mainly used in telecommunications but they are also used for lighting sensors toys and special cameras for seeing inside small spaces It is sometimes used in medicine to see inside people like down their throat

An optical fiber is a long thin strand of clear material Its shape is usually similar to a cylinder In the center it has a core Around the core is a layer called the cladding The core and cladding are made of different kinds of glass or plastic so that light travels slower in the core than it does in the cladding If the light in the core hits the edge of the cladding at a shallow angle it bounces off Light can travel inside the core and bounce off of the cladding No light escapes until it comes to the end of the fiber unless the fiber is bent sharply or stretched 

If the cladding of the fiber is scratched it may break A plastic coating called the buffer covers the cladding to protect it Often the buffered fiber is put inside an even tougher layer called the jacket This makes it easy to use the fiber without breaking it

Fiber optic communication is a method of transmitting information from one place to another by sending pulses of light through an optical fiber The light forms an electromagnetic carrier wave that is modulated to carry information First developed in the 1970s fiber optic communication systems have revolutionized the telecommunications industry and have played a major role in the advent of the Information Age Because of its advantages over electrical transmission optical fibers have largely replaced copper wire communications in core networks in the developed world

The process of communicating using fiber optics involves the following basic steps Creating the optical signal involving the use of a transmitter relaying the signal along the fiber ensuring that the signal does not become too distorted or weak receiving the optical signal and converting it into an electrical signal

The main use of optical fiber is in long distance communication Since the light does not leak out of the fiber much as it travels the light can go a long distance before the signal gets too weak This is used to send telephone and internet signals between cities

Fiber is sometimes used for shorter links too such as to carry the sound signals between a compact disc player and a stereo receiver The fibers used for these short links are often made of plastic TOSLINK is the most common type of optical plug for stereos

Optical fibers can be used as sensors Special fibers are used for this that change how they pass light through when there is a change around the fiber Sensors like this can be used to detect changes in temperature pressure and other things These sensors are useful because they are small and do not need any electricity at the place where the sensing happens 

These fibers are also used to carry light for humans to see This is sometimes used for decoration like fiber optic Christmas trees Sometimes it is used for lighting when it is convenient to have the light bulb someplace other than where the light needs to be This is sometimes used in signs and art for special effects

A bundle of fibers can be used to make a device called an endoscope or a fiberscope This is a long thin probe that can be put into a small hole that will send an image of what is inside through the fiber to a camera Endoscopes are used by doctors to see inside the human body and are sometimes used by engineers to see inside tight spaces in machines

Optical fibers can be used as optical amplifiers This allows an optical signal to travel further between endpoints and without converting the optical signal to electrical and back reducing the overall cost of the components These optical amplifiers can also be used to create Lasers These are called fiber lasers They can be very powerful because the long thin fiber is easy to keep cool and makes a good quality light beam

A population pyramid is a graph It has two back to back bars These bars show the population in groups of ages with woman in one side and man in the other side

Dreams are the things that happen in a persons mind while they are sleeping They are often similar to real life in some ways but can also be very strange Dreams can seem so real while they happen that the person might think that they are awake when actually they are asleep 

Sometimes a person realizes during a dream that they are dreaming but keeps having the dream This is called a lucid dream This happens very little for most people but for some people it happens often During lucid dreaming the person will feel like they are controlling the dream and will usually dream that they are doing fun things that they cant do in the real world

Most people remember their dreams in some way or another even if its only a small part but children are very likely to remember most of their dream clearly Its often easier for people to remember dreams if they write down what happened in the dream just after they wake up Because of this many people have dream diaries where they describe each dream they have

Nightmares are dreams which scare or shock people Nightmares are usually based around that persons everyday fears like spiders or dark places but even a dream thats not about those things can feel unpleasant Nightmares are caused by many different things being uncomfortable or in pain while sleeping sickness stress or even eating right before sleeping

There are many different theories about why people dream and what their dreams mean Every person has different dreams Some psychologists believe that dreams reflect what is happening in the unconscious mind Others think that people places and objects in dreams are symbols for other things in the dreamers real life Throughout history people have tried to make sense of dreams to learn things from them and have often used them for divination or fortune telling Today there are still many books and websites devoted to making sense of dreams 

Base can mean 

A frenulum is a small fold of tissue that prevents an organ in the body from moving too far

There are several frenula in the body including several in the mouth some in the digestive tract and some connected to the external genitalia 

Frenula of the mouth are found under the tongue and inside the upper and lower lip These can easily be torn by blows to the face or mouth A torn frenulum is sometimes a warning sign of physical abuse

In the female genital frenula can be found in the clitoris and where the labia minora meet at the back

The word frenulum on its own is often used for the frenulum preputii penis This is an elastic band of tissue under the glans penis that connects to the prepuce or foreskin to the vernal mucosa It help contract the prepuce over the glans It may be removed during circumcision

It is possible for the frenulum of the penis to tear during sexual activity This does not cause a great deal of pain but can cause an alarming amount of blood loss This is not a medical emergency The frenulum will heal by itself after the bleeding has stopped

Ejaculatory ducts are part of the human male anatomy They cause the reflex action of ejaculation Each male has two of them During ejaculation semen moves through the ducts and leaves the body through the penis

The corpus cavernosum penis is one of two sponge like sections of tissue in the male penis They contain most of the blood during an erection The term literally means cave like body 

The corpus cavernosum are placed along the length of the penis They are found along the penis shaft from the pubic bones to the head of the penis The spongy tissue fills with blood The blood comes from arteries down the length of the penis The blood fills the corpora cavernosa This causes it to swell When swollen it holds 90 of the blood involved in an erection This increases both the length and circumference of the penis

Blood can leave only through a system of veins around the outside wall of the corpus cavernosum The expanding tissue constricts these veins This preventing blood from leaving The penis becomes rigid as a result 

It stars John Barrowman as Captain Jack Harkness He played the same character in series one series three and series 4 of the current Doctor Who It also stars Eve Myles as Gwen Cooper a policewoman who becomes involved with the group and Gareth David Lloyd as Ianto Jones a person who helps out in other ways

The series is set in Cardiff Glamorgan Wales Series 1 takes place after Doctor Who series two This means it started in 2007 and takes place in early 2008 ahead of when it is actually shown Series 2 took place in between Doctor Who series 3 and series 4 It follows the Wales section of a secret group called the Torchwood Institute The Torchwood Institute examines things that aliens cause to happen on Earth They also collect alien equipment to use 

Because the show is set in and around Cardiff many of the local attractions for example the Millennium Center and Cardiff Bay are shown in the series Country settings around Glamorgan are also used many times in the series

The programme is aimed at adults and older teenagers

The third series is a five part long story named Children of Earth

A bulbourethral gland is one of two small glands found in the reproductive system of human males They are like Bartholins glands 

Bulbourethral glands are found near the urethra at the base of the penis between the two layers of the fascia The bulbourethral glands are about the size of a pea They appear to slowly get smaller as a person gets older

They are made of several lobules held together by a fibres

During sexual arousal each gland makes a clear liquid known as pre ejaculate or pre cum This fluid helps to lubricate the urethra for sperm to pass through It also helps clean out any urine or dirt

A fermion is one of the things that everything is made of Fermions are really small and do not weigh much Fermions can be thought of as the building blocks of matter because atoms are made up of fermions 

An electron is a fermion but a photon is not Fermions are particles with spin numbers that are 12 32 52 etc They are named after a man called Enrico Fermi who was a famous physicist

Fermions are special because you cannot put two of them in the same place at the same time This is because the Pauli exclusion principle says that no two fermions can have the same quantum numbers such as spin numbers at the same time Fermions obey Fermi Dirac statistics This is different to photons where you can have many in the same place at the same time

Most well known fermions have spin of 12 An example of a type of fermion with a spin of 12 is the electron The electron belongs to a group of fermions called Leptons

Fundamental fermions are either quarks or leptons There are 6 different types of quarks and 6 different types of leptons These are their names

Each of these fermions also has an anti particle associated with it so there are a total of 24 different fundamental fermions The anti particle is similar to the original particle but with opposite electrical charge The up charm and top quarks have electrical charge of 23 Their anti particles have charge 23 The other three quarks have charge 13 and their anti particles have charge 13 The electron muon and tau leptons all have charge of 1 and their anti particles have charge 1 All the neutrinos and anti neutrinos have charge 0 The main difference between quarks or leptons with the same charge is in how much they weigh

The supersymmetric counterpart of any fermion is called a sfermion

A boson is a particle which has a whole number spin 

A photon is an example of a boson as it has a spin of 1 

Bosons are different from Fermions which are particles that make up matter because they obey Bose Einstein statistics 

Gauge bosons carry forces There are three known gauge bosons which are fundamental particles For example the photon carries the electromagnetic force The three gauge bosons are as follows photons for electromagnetism gluons for strong force and W and Z bosons for weak force Other theoretical gauge bosons are predicted such as gravitons for gravity

Bosons are named after a man called Satyendra Nath Bose

The George Washington Bridge is a suspension bridge over the Hudson River that connects part of New York City New York to Fort Lee New Jersey It is 4750 feet long and was designed by Othmar H Ammann Building began on October 21 1927 and it was opened on October 25 1931 at a cost of 59 million A second level was added below the main level and opened to traffic on August 29 1962

The main span of the bridge is convert3500ftm0lkonabbron and it is convert119ftm0lkonabbron wide It is suspended by four cables each cable weighing 28450 tons and each is made from 26474 individual wires The total length of all the wire in the four cables is convert107000mikm0lkonabbron

Ammann chose the site for the bridge because the river was narrower at this point The banks on either side were high which meant the bridge could be tall enough for ships to pass underneath without having to build long rising bridge approaches

Freddy Krueger is a character from the Nightmare on Elm Street movies He is the bad guy of the movies In the first movie a mom told her kid that a long time ago Freddy killed a bunch of peoples kids and the parents got mad and they burnt Freddy Right before Freddy died some ghosts told Freddy that he can come back to life if takes over dreams and Freddy said yes 

Freddy went after the kids of the parents that killed him During their nightmares Freddy would be there and he would kill them in their dreams and whatever Freddy did in the dream would happen in real life Then there was this girl named Nancy she had nightmares about Freddy and wanted to kill him to stop him from killing anymore So on purpose one night she fell asleep to fight Freddy 

There have been 8 movies involving Freddy Krueger and there is a new one coming up in 2010 The first 8 starred Robert Englund as Freddy but in the new one a man named Jackie Earl Haley is going to play him he played a character named Rorschach in the new Watchmen movie

In the movie Freddy has this claw he wears it has fingernails built into it made out of knives This is a very dangerous weapon he kills people with it He has had the same glove through out all of the 7 movies But there was another movie his claw was remodeled to look scarier 

Freddy wears a dirty torn old red and green sweater and pants He also wears a dirty brown hat Freddys classic outfit was changed in the movie called New Nightmare

The Golani Brigade  is an Israeli infantry brigade that was formed February 28 1948 when the Levanoni Brigade was divided in two smaller brigades It is one of the most highly decorated infantry units in the Israel Defense Forces

The symbol of the brigade is a green olive tree with its roots on a yellow background The tree symbolizes strength and the colors symbolize areas where Golani had fought Early Golani soldiers were farmers and new immigrants so they chose to make their beret brown like the land

During the 1950s the Golani Brigade participated in many operations most notably the 1951 operation against Syria and the October 1955 operation against Egypt In the 1956 Sinai Campaign Golanis task was to capture the area around the city Rafah in the Sinai desert

At Golani Junction in the north of Israel stands the Golani Brigade Museum commemorating the brigade and its heroes The Golani brigade has earned a reputation for its tough soldiers They are known as being very brave and friendly but also as being very reckless when things do not go their way That is why they are so feared by Israels enemies Also the Golani Brigade is the only brigade with the heavy IDF Achzarit armored personnel carriers The Achzarit is a very heavily armored vehicle designed for the requirements of urban fighting

Golanis recon company is one of the most respected special forces units in the IDF This unit together with Sayeret Matkal re took the Mount Hermon position in the 1973 Yom Kippur War This units soldiers are so dedicated that in 1994 one it commanders rescued himself from an enemy minefield after half his right leg was blown off He applied the bandages to his leg himself and he is now a senior commander in the IDF In 1976 elements of the Golani Brigade were sent to Uganda to rescue 246 Jewish hostages on Air France flight 139 hijacked by PLO terrorists Despite winning the battlethe mission commander was killed

As of 2004 Golani operates within the northern border of Israel and in the West Bank During 2004 a Golani battalion reinforced the Givati Brigade in the Gaza Strip In July 2006 Golani took part in the 2006 Israel Lebanon conflict and the fierce battle of Bint Jbeil where it lost 9 troops

A salt mine is a mine where salt is taken from the earth Very often this is done in the mountains It is different from a salt evaporation pond where salt is taken from salt water Getting salt from different layers of rock in a mountain used to be a very dangerous job The Romans used to sentence prisoners to this kind of labour

Usually the salt is mixed with rock that has chlorides and sulfates 

Empty salt mines are used very often as a storage area for example for unused radioactive elements Salt mines are empty if there is no salt left to take or if taking the salt that is left would be too expensive 

A key signature is a group of sharps or flats which are printed at the beginning of a line of music It shows which notes have to be changed into sharps or flats For example if there is one sharp in the key signature it will be an F sharp It means that every time the note F is written one plays an F sharp instead

There are twelve major and twelve minor keys This is because a scale can start on any note and there are twelve notes within an octave seven white notes and five black notes on a keyboard Each major key has its own key signature the relationship between the keys is explained in the article circle of fifths Each minor key shares a key signature with one of the major keys

There are fifteen possible key signatures up to seven sharps up to seven flats or no sharps or flats The reason why there are fifteen and not twelve is because three of them have two possible names F sharp major can also be called G flat C sharp is D flat and B is C flat We call these enharmonic ie the same note but with a different name

There are two reasons for writing a key signature Firstly it saves writing out lots of sharps or flats during the piece Secondly it helps the player to think in the key of the piece This helps to understand the music better

If the composer wants any extra sharps or flats during the piece or he wants to cancel the ones in the key signature these can be written in the music These are called accidentals An accidental is always written before the note it belongs to  As an example in a piece in G major all Fs are F sharps If the composer wants a C sharp he writes a sharp sign in front of the C that needs to be sharpened This will last for the rest of the bar If he wants a B flat he has to write it in If he wants an F instead of the usual F sharp he writes a natural sign There are also double sharps and double flats An F double sharp is an F sharp that has been sharpened It is the same note as G

Key signatures are written at the beginning of each line of music This helps the player to remember what the key signature is The time signature however is only written at the beginning of the piece Sometimes music changes key during a piece If the music is going to stay in the new key for some time the composer may decide to change the key signature Another reason for changing the key signature might be that the music has modulated to a key like G sharp major with eight sharps It is easier to read the music if it is written in A flat major 

One can tell from the key signature what key a piece is in so long as one knows whether it is major or minor For example a key signature of one sharp is either G major or E minor The best way to find out which it is would be to see whether the end of the piece is based on G major or E minor Also if the piece is in the minor key it is very likely that there will be several accidentals in the piece which sharpen the 7th note of the scale

Some modern composers do not use key signatures This is often the case when the music is atonal or not very firmly in one key If there are lots of sharps and flats and the bars are very long they may write accidentals in front of every note that needs one instead of just once in a bar This should be explained at the top of the music It may also be because the piece is modal

A virtuoso is someone who plays a musical instrument brilliantly Musicians who have exceptional talent and can play extremely fast and difficult music are virtuosi In the 19th century Niccol Paganini was a virtuoso violinist as well as a composer Franz Liszt was a virtuoso pianist and composer

Musicians may sometimes talk about virtuoso music meaning music which is so difficult that only a virtuoso could play it

Another name for this river is the South River It is named for Thomas West 3rd Lord De La Warr a colonial Governor of Virginia

Malcolm Mal Evans was a broken wikt linkroad managerroad manager and assistant to The Beatles the most popular rock and roll band of the 1960s

Evans was hired to help Neil Aspinall who was the bands original road manager Tall and strong Evans was sometimes called The Gentle Giant His wife was called Lil

Aspinalls and Evanss jobs changed through the years At first they were in charge of driving the Beatless musical equipment to places where they were to perform setting it up ahead of time and taking it down later to prepare for their next show As the band became popular they had other people to help

Evans sometimes served as a broken wikt linkbodyguardbodyguard to the Beatles protecting them from fans who got out of control or might want to hurt members of the band He also sometimes forged their broken wikt linkautographautographs on photographs when the band themselves did not have the chance to sign them and helped choose girls from concert audiences to meet later with the band After the Beatles stopped performing live in 1966 he worked for them in other ways

Along with playing musical instruments on a few of their songs and singing on Yellow Submarine and You Know My Name Evans also helped with lyrics from time to time Paul McCartney paid him in cash for help with Fixing A Hole instead of giving him co credit

Evans appeared on camera in both Magical Mystery Tour and Let it Be He is seen during the rooftop concert in Let it Be stalling the police who had come to stop the Beatles from performing The sound of their music had caused a broken wikt linktraffic jamtraffic jam on the street below

He was also responsible for Badfinger being signed to the Beatless record label Apple Records

Evans was fired in 1970 by Allen Klein who had taken over many of the jobs once held by the late Beatles manager Brian Epstein Later Evans separated from his wife and moved to the United States During 1974 he was a companion and helper to John Lennon who was staying in Los Angeles while separated from his wife Yoko Ono

Mara Eva Duarte de Pern was the second wife of Argentine President Juan Pern She was first lady from 1946 until she died and she served with her husband as a co ruler of Argentina during those years Before she died the Congress made her Spiritual Leader of the Nation She was an actress before she married Peron

By the time of her death she was one of the most powerful women or maybe even the most powerful woman in the world She is known for her work in many charitable and feminist causes and became an icon to many people in Argentina Evita was President of the Peronist Womens Party a big and powerful political party made up of women who supported the Perons party She ran the Ministry of Labor and the Ministry of Health The Eva Peron Foundation gave a lot of money and other things to the poor The poor liked Evita Peron a lot Her life inspired both a musical and a movie called Evita The movie starred Madonna 

When she died her corpse was embalmed After her husband was overthrown her body was lost for almost 20 years until it was found in Italy It was brought back to Argentina and buried with her husband after he died in 1974 It was brought back by the President a woman named Isabel Pern who was married to Juan Pern years after Evas death

Embalming is the act of preserving a dead body so it will not decompose Most bodies are embalmed if they have to be on display or lie in state for a funeral Embalming is similar to mummification which is what ancient people in Peru and Egypt did to their dead Embalming is different from taxidermy where you only preserve the skin

Taxidermy is act of taking the skin of an animal and preserving it by putting it on a fake body Taxidermed animals can be mounted and put on display sometimes in a museum or a home Many hunters and fishermen taxidermine the animals they catch and kill for trophies Ones that are on display in museums are used to make dioramas and for educational purposes Some people taxiderm their pets after they die

Guantanamo Bay is a bay located in the south of the island of Cuba Part of it is controlled by the United States They took control of it in 1903 under a treaty between the United States and Cuba The current government of Cuba does not see this treaty as legal They say it violates International law

The southern part of the bay is surrounded by a navy station of the United States The name of the station is sometimes shortened to GTMO called Gitmo The mission of this station is to act to prevent terrorism help people who are fleeing Cuba and stop drug crime 

This base is also now used as a place to keep people captured by American forces from Afghanistan and Iraq Also some prisoners were taken from other countries like Britain and France Some people say that these people do not get the rights that they should get as prisoners of war under the Geneva Conventions One reason that they are there may be that the laws of the United States do not apply to them According to some well known human rights groups some prisoners have been tortured and others may have been badly treated according the FBI Inquiry This has also been reported by some Europeans who were taken by CIA torture flights and have now been released 

There is a lot of argument about Guantanamo Bay This camp is a navy base and would sometimes hold people who had escaped from the Cuban government by sea Now it also has a prison for people who oppose the United States including some soldiers Some people have called it a concentration camp George W Bush has said that it is sometimes used for prisoners of war but many human rights groups accuse America of keeping people from countries they are not at war with This was shown to be sometimes true when British prisoners were returned home in 2003 

This camp may be used for prisoners who are seen as terrorists by the United States These people are detained because there is not enough evidence to give them a trial in a court About 300 to 400 men are in this prison They are almost all Muslims who are said to have attacked American troops Some of these people were captured during the war in Afghanistan Some were taken by force from other countries There has been some evidence of torture taking place at the camp Some prisoners have tried to kill themselves Others have been on hunger strike where they refuse to eat These prisoners are not forced to work but they have not been given fair trials

There is now some work starting to bring Guantanamo prisoners to some justice Some people have been sent back to their home countries some have been sent to other countries Some people who were shown to not be terrorists have then been released by their governments some people are now in prison in their home countries Some Uighur people from China have been sent to Albania possibly because China did not want them back

Richard Strauss was a German composer He soon became very famous when he was a young man His tone poems were played by orchestras all over Europe After 1900 he spent most of his time writing operas His opera Der Rosenkavalier written in 1910 is extremely popular Strauss was the last great composer who wrote in a Romantic style He liked the music of Wagner who was a great influence on his music but he also liked Mozart and his works also shows the elegance and grace of Mozarts music Strauss was a very good conductor and often conducted his own music 

He is not related to the Austrian Johann Strauss family famous for their waltzes

Gustav Mahler was a Czech Austrian composer and conductor He was one of the last great composers of the Romantic period He wrote nine symphonies and several collections of songs with orchestral accompaniment He was very interested in German folk song and he found new ways to use folk song in large orchestral symphonies His work Das Lied von der Erde is one his greatest works combining song with the form of a symphony He was also a great conductor and helped to make the Vienna Opera world famous

Gustav Mahler was born on 7 July 1860 into a Jewish family He was the second of 14 children and the first one of the six who were to survive childhood and grow up to adults His father worked hard to build up his business He owned a distillery and seven taverns in Iglau to where the family moved in the autumn of 1860 There he heard a lot of music military music folk music and different kinds of art music He learned the piano and performed in public in 1870 and started to compose

In 1875 he went to study at the Vienna Conservatory After a while he gave up studying the piano and concentrated on composition and conducting He was very interested in Wagners ideas about philosophy and politics and he studied philosophy at the University of Vienna He started to earn some money by teaching His first important composition was a cantata called Das klagende Lied

Mahlers first job as a conductor was at Bad Hall in Upper Austria The small opera company there was not very good and the music they sang was just light operetta Mahler soon found another job at Laibach They sang better music there but he only stayed one year His next job was in Olmtz The standard of singing was not very good but Mahler was very strict Although the singers did not like him at first he helped them to become better Then he got a job in Kassel but he had to conduct a lot of operettas He had an unhappy love affair with one of the singers This inspired him to write a collection of orchestral songs Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen and he started his first symphony

In 1885 he got a conducting job in Prague For the first time he was able to conduct works for which he was to become famous operas by Mozart Wagner and music by Beethoven However Mahler had arguments with the people he worked with and so he left Prague

Mahlers next job was in Leipzig The orchestra of the Neues Stadttheater was larger and much better than any he had worked for until then One of the conductors who worked there was Arthur Nikisch He was very famous and the young Mahler was often critized because he was very different to Nikisch and the way he conducted When Nikisch was ill Mahler conducted Die Walkre and Siegfried This helped him to show that he was a great conductor He met the grandson of the composer Carl Maria von Weber who gave him sketches for an opera Die Drei Pintos which Weber had left unfinished The sketches were very difficult to read but Mahler completed the opera and performed it He also worked at his own compositions and he met Richard Strauss who was to remain a close friend until his death

In 1888 Mahler got a job at the Royal Opera in Budapest Although it was a good theatre they were in financial problems The Hungarians wanted Mahler to make it a Hungarian national opera using Hungarian singers as much as possible However there were not many good Hungarian singers The opera company did not like German operas preferring light opera and ballet He did not have much time to compose because he was too busy with administrative jobs So he left Budapest By this time both his parents had died

From 1891 1897 Mahler had a conducting post at Hamburg Here there was an opera company of international standard Mahler soon became world famous He conducted many operas as well as orchestral concerts He conducted in London in 1892 and was invited back again but he did not accept because he wanted time to compose He spent the summer months composing writing his music down in short score and during the theatre season he would revise and orchestrate them The performance of his Second Symphony in Berlin in 1895 was a huge success

Since the death of his parents Mahler had supported his two sisters He had encouraged his brother Otto to become a musician but Otto committed suicide Mahler continued to support his two sisters until they married two famous brothers Eduard and Arnold Ros in 1898 and 1902 

Mahler was becoming very famous In 1897 he went on tour to Moscow Munich and Budapest However he really wanted a job in Vienna but because he was Jewish it was going to be very hard for him to find work there so he became a Roman Catholic Soon afterwards he became Kapellmeister in Vienna

In Vienna Mahler soon became famous for his conducting of Wagner and Mozart His friend Guido Adler paid for the publication of his First and Third Symphonies Mahler replaced Hans Richter as conductor of the Philharmonic Concerts Mahler attracted bigger audiences but he had disagreements with the players They did not like some of his unusual ideas and he was very strict After an illness in 1901 he resigned He bought a house in Maiernigg in Carinthia where he spent his summers composing In 1901 he fell in love with Alma Schindler whose father Anton Schindler was a famous landscape painter She was nearly twenty years younger than Mahler She was studying composition but Mahler made her give up composing so that she could devote herself to being a good wife This made the relationship between them rather difficult In 1910 Mahler went to see the psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud He helped him to understand not only his marriage problems but also his creative nature He now felt a deeper love for Alma than he ever had done

At the Hofoper Mahler conducted many of the great operas but not many new ones He wanted to conduct Richard Strausss new opera Salom but the censors did not allow it to be performed Nevertheless Mahlers years conducting in Vienna were very important because he had many new ideas Through his wife he met many artists especially those connected with the Sezession movement One of them Alfred Roller designed the sets for a new production of Tristan und Isolde He became Mahlers chief stage designer At last Mahler could work closely with someone who shared his views They staged many operas together Fideleo Don Giovanni Die Entfhrung aus dem Serail Le Nozze di Figaro Die Zauberflte and Iphignie en Aulide

Mahler felt much more secure now that he was married This made him more creative He composed his Eighth Symphony very quickly It needs a huge orchestra and choir which is why it is often called Symphony of a Thousand Mahler thought it was his best work

Mahler never became a teacher but he gave a lot of encouragement to young composers such as Arnold Schoenberg Alban Berg Anton Webern and Alexander Zemlinsky However there were music critics in Vienna who were anti Jewish and made things difficult for him In 1907 his elder daughter Maria died from scarlet fever More bad news followed when Mahler was found to have a bad heart The doctor said he must give up his favourite pastimes going for walks cycling and swimming Mahler had done a tremendous amount for the cultural life of Vienna but he decided it was time to leave The last thing he conducted in Vienna was his Second Symphony

Mahler was invited to go to America to conduct the Metropolitan Opera in New York City It was very different from what he had been used to in Europe Instead of working with a group of singers who worked together as a team the operas at the Metropolitan Opera were sung by great operatic stars Mahler did not try to change this He even agreed to make cuts to Wagner operas Then he was invited to be the conductor of the New York Philharmonic so he resigned from the Metropolitan The last time he conducted there was as a guest artist

In 1909 he finished his Ninth Symphony He was very busy conducting in Europe In January 1911 he conducted his Fourth Symphony in New York Then he became ill and decided to go to Vienna He arrived there on 12 May but he died a few weeks later at the age of 50

Mahler was one of the last composers who belonged to the great musical tradition of Germany and Austria Although many German composers had written great symphonies Mahler found something new to say in his music His symphonies often have long melodies and he uses folk song as well as new sounds in the orchestra Mahler worked most of his life in the theatre and this influences his musical language A good example is Symphony No4 which starts in the happy key of G major where the music describes the early life but finishes in E major where the soprano soloist sings about the heavenly pleasures

Mahler became very interested in German folksong and he composed several sets of orchestral songs He took poems from the collection called Des Knaben Wunderhorn These songs were originally medieval but Mahler made them feel very different by interpreting them through his own personality The language of his songs is heard in his symphonies four of which use singing He wrote nine symphonies and started a tenth but died before it was finished

Mahler was a great orchestrator Some of his later works need a very large orchestra He often used unusual effects eg in his First Symphony there is a double bass solo playing very high notes accompanied by timpani

His set of orchestral songs Das Lied von der Erde are like a symphony but he did not call it a symphony This was for superstitious reasons several great composers including Beethoven had written nine symphonies and then died

As a conductor Mahler had a tremendous influence on musical life in Europe He often conducted his own works When he conducted works by other composers he played it according to his own ideas He even made changes to the orchestration of some works by Beethoven He was not the sort of conductor who tried to make the music as close as possible to what the composer had wanted He always wanted the music to sound very clear

Slave auctions were places where people were sold as slaves to other people In slave auctions families were split up and sold to different owners for different amounts of money Slave auctions were extremely traumatising to all the slaves Millions of families were split up never to be seen againTypically the largest slaves were the first to go because they were believed to be able to do more work However many women were sold away from little ones and husbands due to a masters need for a good cook and housekeeper Many auctions were also meeting places to discuss the war and other important issues at the time

When the slave ship arrives at the port the slaves would be taken to a pen There they would be washed their skins covered in grease animal fat or sometimes tar This would make their skin look healthier so they would be worth more money They would also be branded so that they were known as slaves Then they would be sold at the Auction 

Sometimes other things were sold at the Slave Auctions including Tea Coffee Ribbons and more

There were two types of auctions Grab and go and May the highest bidder win 

Grab and go was where a slave buyer would give the slave trader a certain amount of money and receive a ticket At the sound of a drum roll the slave pen would open and the American would rush in and grab the slave or slaves that they wanted They would then show the ticket to the slave trader before they left 

May the highest bidder win is a lot like online sites like Ebay You bid the highest amount of money possible and whoever does manage to bid the highest gets to keep the slave

When Slaves leave the ship they were taken away and put in a pen Women men and families were separated Any sores or wounds were covered with tar and oil Men were referred to as bucks and women as does

Slaves were referred to as cargo women referred to as wenches They showed no respect forcing open their mouths checking their hair and physique

They would be given brandy to bring them up and lardonaum to bring them down This would make them more desirable to buyers

Harmonics in music are notes which are produced in a special way They are notes which are produced as part of the harmonic series

In physics a harmonic is a wave which is added to the basic fundamental wave In this article we are talking about sound waves and we can understand it clearly by looking at the strings of a musical instrument

When a violinist plays a note on a violin string the string starts to vibrate very fast This vibration makes the air vibrate and the sound waves travel to our ear so that we can hear it If the note was absolutely pure the string would move like a sine wave Sine waves can only be made electronically and they sound very boring to us The note played on the violin string makes the string vibrate in a very complicated way There is the basic note but added to that are lots of other little notes that all add up to a sound in a special way that tells us that it is a violin playing and not a clarinet or a human voice

The higher the note the faster the string vibrates An A above middle C vibrates at 440Hz This is the fundamental or first harmonic The second harmonic is vibrating twice as fast 880Hz This gives an A an octave higher The third harmonic will give a ratio 32 This will be an E The higher the harmonic the quieter it is but the ratio is always a whole number

Every note that we hear on an instrument is really a combination of several notes or harmonics even although we may not realize that we are hearing more than one note at a time Play the lowest C on the piano Now find the next C which is an octave higher Press this key very slowly so that it does not sound and hold it down While holding it down play the bottom C again making it loud and very short The C that is being held silently will now sound This is because the strings of that C are vibrating a little because it is a harmonic of the low C The same can be done holding the next G down then the next C then the E The higher the note the fainter the harmonics become The musical example below shows the notes of a harmonic series in musical notation 

To hear the notes of a harmonic series click here clicking here

Musicians sometimes need to play harmonics on their instruments In musical notation this is shown by placing a little circle above the note

A violinist can place his finger very lightly on a string so that it divides the string into half He will hear a harmonic By placing his fingers in other places he can get more harmonics eg by touching the string a quarter of the way down he gets the next harmonic Artificial harmonics can be played by stopping a string with the finger in the usual way and placing the little finger farther up the string to get a harmonic of the stopped note Artificial harmonics are written with diamond shaped note heads They are very hard to play well

Harpists can play harmonics with their left hand by stopping the string with the side of the hand and plucking with the thumb or finger Up to 3 notes can be played by the left hand They can play harmonics with the right hand by stopping the string with the upper knuckle of the second finger and plucking with the thumb Only one harmonic note can be played by the right hand Harmonics on the harp sound very beautiful 

Players of woodwind and brass instruments play many of their notes by blowing slightly stronger to get a higher series of notes Instruments such as the recorder can play chords by making several harmonics sound together but this is extremely difficult to do well and only found in modern music for virtuoso players

A hamburger is a kind of sandwich It consists of one or more slices of ground meat such as beef or pork This slice is put between two slices of bread or in a bun After that toppings and dips are added

Hamburgers are named for a city in Germany called Hamburg They were probably invented in Germany though what we now know as a hamburger was created in the United States in the 19th century Hamburgers appeared on menus in England and the United States in the 19th century and became a popular food after the 1904 Worlds Fair What is called a hamburger throughout the world today was different than the first German hamburgers German dishes often involved a steak or sausage between pieces of bread instead of ground meat

Experience is knowledge a person gets by doing something or watching someone else do it Experience is learning through actions 

Some religious groups and teaching methods value learning by experiencing For example if someone want to learn about the game Chess they would go and play several games of Chess By making mistakes and learn from them they learn more rather just reading about playing Chess

Experience is often divided into four types 

Someone who experienced by watching or doing something himself is said to have had first hand experience

When the first person tells another person the other person has had second hand experience

When an experience is felt or enjoyed through imagined participation the person has had a vicarious experience

Norse mythology is a set of beliefs and stories shared by Northern Germanic tribes It was not handed down from the gods to the mortal It had no scripture The mythology was passed on from one generation to the next in the form of poetry It continued to be passed down this way through the time of the Vikings The original beliefs were long lost Our knowledge about it is mainly based on the Eddas and other medieval texts These were written down during and after they turned to Christianity

In Norse mythology the earth was thought to be a flat disc This disk is in the branches of the world tree or Yggdrasil Asgard was located at the centre of the disc Asgard is where the gods lived Asgard could only be reached by walking across the rainbow The Giants lived in an place called Jtunheimr Jtunheimr means giant realm

A cold dark place called Niflheim was ruled by Hel She was the daughter of Loki This was the eventual home of most of the dead Located somewhere in the south was the fiery realm of Muspelheim home of the fire giants

There are many other supernatural beings These include 

Most of this mythology was passed down orally and much of it has been lost Some of it was recorded by Christian scholars The main records come from the Eddas and the Heimskringla by Snorri Sturluson He believed that pre Christian deities were men and women rather than devils

There are also several runestones and image stones that show scenes from Norse mythology such as Thors fishing trip and Odin being devoured by Fenrir

The Germanic gods have affected elements of every day western life in most countries that speak Germanic languages An example is some of the names of the days of the week The days were named after Roman gods in Latin The names for Tuesday through Friday were replaced with Germanic versions of the Roman gods In English Saturn was not replaced Saturday is named after the sabbath in German and is called washing day in Scandinavia

JRR Tolkiens The Lord of the Rings was influenced by the myths of the Northern Europeans As it became popular parts of its fantasy world moved into how people see the fantasy genre In almost any modern fantasy novel you can find Norse creatures like elves dwarves and giants

Nikolai Andreyevich Rimsky Korsakov was a Russian composer He was one of the most famous composers of his time and influenced a lot of other composers Like so many Russian composers in the 19th century he was an amateur composer His main job was in the navy 

Rimsky Korsakov is best known for his operas orchestral music and songs He was brilliant at writing music for orchestras and wrote an excellent book about orchestration He loved to write music about fairy tale stories and legends His best known work is Scheherazade an orchestral piece which describes in music the stories told by Scheherazade in the book of One Thousand and One Nights He also completed or re orchestrated several works by Modest Mussorgsky which had been left unfinished

Rimsky Korsakov was born in 1844 Several people from his family had careers in the Russian army and navy Both his grandmothers however were simple people who had lived in the country When he was very small he showed a great interest in music He sang every tune he heard and knew without looking the names of the notes that he heard being played on the piano When he was six he started piano lessons The opera Life for the Tsar by Glinka made a big impression on him However he wanted to join the navy so in 1862 he entered the College of Naval Cadets where his brother was the director

He continued to learn the piano while he was at Cadet school He was never a brilliant pianist but he enjoyed playing tunes from operas on the piano He got to know several young composers who were already becoming famous Balakirev Cui and Mussorgsky Balakirev gave him advice about his compositions He started to write a symphony but then he had to go to sea for two and a half years He sailed on a clipper called Almaz The boat went to Gravesend the Baltic New York Rio de Janeiro and the Mediterranean When he got back Balakirev made him finish the symphony

Rimsky Korsakov now worked about two or three hours a day for the navy He spent the rest of the time composing or visiting friends He met more composers including Borodin and Dargomzhsky and he composed songs and piano music although he was not good enough to play the piano to audiences However his friends realized that he was very good at writing for orchestras and he was asked to orchestrate several pieces Dargomzhsky who was dying had not yet orchestrated his opera The Stone Guest so he asked Rimsky Korsakov to do it

Although he had not had any formal musical education he was offered a job as professor of composition at the Petersburg Conservatory In 1872 he married a girl called Nadezhda She was a beautiful woman and an excellent pianist and she helped him a lot especially in making piano arrangements of his orchestral music

He wrote three symphonies and an opera The Maid of Pskov but in 1897 he stopped composing for several years He spent his time inspecting naval bands and studied in great detail how musical instruments worked Then in 1880 he produced a new opera May Night It was performed in the Mariinsky Theatre One of the main parts was sung by Fyodor Stravinsky who was to become the father of Igor Stravinsky Rimsky Korsakov had by now become really interested in Russian folktunes and fairy tales His next opera was Snow Maiden Then his friend Mussorgsky died leaving lots of compositions unfinished Rimsky Korsakov spent a lot of time preparing them for publication He made changes to some of Mussorgskys harmonies so that it suited his Romantic tastes Nowadays many people think that Mussorgskys versions are better and that Rimsky Korsakov had not understood properly what Mussorgsky had been trying to do He also completed and orchestrated Borodins opera Prince Igor after Borodin died He composed two very popular orchestral works Spanish Capriccio and Sheherazade After this he hardly ever wrote any music which was just for orchestra he concentrated instead on writing operas eg The Tsars Bride

He became even more interested in opera after Karl Muck had conducted Richard Wagners Ring Cycle four times in St Petersburg but Wagners music did not influence his own style However he also had lots of worries particularly about the health of some members of his family He started to become depressed and worried about losing his ability to compose He became more relaxed after he moved to a new home in the country He composed the operas Christmas Eve and Sadko He wrote many beautiful songs and made changes to some of his earlier music He also wrote an autobiography

Nikolai Rimsky Korsakov died of heart trouble in 1908

Rimsky Korsakov is best known in the west for a few orchestral works especially Scheherazade Spanish Capriccio and Easter Festival overture The way he arranges the music for the different instruments of the orchestra is brilliant for example in Scheherazade his use of the trombones for the evil Sultan the violin for the beautiful Scheherazade or the bassoon for the beggar His operas are also full of wonderful effects and brilliant writing for the singers but are often hard to translate well into other languages One of his most famous piano works is The Flight Of The Bumblebee

Modest Petrovitch Mussorgsky was a Russian composer He is famous for his operas and songs He discovered new ways of writing for the voice which were very tuneful but which also suited the Russian language His most famous opera is Boris Godunov He wrote an overture called Night on a Bare Mountain Another very famous piece is called Pictures at an Exhibition He wrote it for the piano but many years after his death another composer called Maurice Ravel orchestrated it and this is the version people usually hear today Some of his works were re orchestrated and improved by the composer Nikolai Rimsky Korsakov In recent years people have started to think that what Mussorgsky wrote originally was better

Mussorgsky was born in Karevo 250 miles south of Saint Petersburg His family were very rich and owned a lot of land and servants He probably got to know the serfs well Later in his operas we can see that he had a lot of sympathy for the ordinary poor people  When Mussorgsky was six he started to have piano lessons from his mother He learned very quickly and when he was nine he performed a concerto by John Field and works by Franz Liszt for the family When he was 10 he and his brother went to a private school St Peters School When he was 12 he composed a polka His father paid for it to be published

When he was 13 he was sent to the Cadet School of the Guards His parents wanted him to be in military service like his ancestors had been It was a hard life at the school There was a lot of bullying He learned to drink alcohol and this eventually led to his alcoholism which was to kill him He played the piano for the cadets to dance to He was interested in history and German philosophy

In October 1856 when he was 17 years old he met the 22 year old Alexander Borodin They were both working in a military hospital in Saint Petersburg The two men were soon good friends He also met Alexander Dargomyzhsky who was then the most important Russian composer after Mikhail Glinka Dargomyzhsky liked Mussorgskys piano playing and Mussorgsky often went to musical parties at Dargomyzhskys home Here he met many other important Russian musicians the critic Vladimir Stasov and the composers Csar Cui and Mily Balakirev He had a very special relationship with Balakirev who was like a teacher to him and gave him a lot of advice and encouragement introducing him to a lot of music he did not yet know In 1858 Mussorgsky decided to give up his job and spend all his time on music

The following years were difficult for Mussorgsky He had a lot of depression He composed some piano pieces and some songs It was also a difficult time for his family who lost a lot of their wealth in 1861 when the new tsar of Russia ordered that the serfs could be free Mussorgsky became a member of a group of five composers who became known as the Mighty Handful The other four were Balakirev Borodin Cui and Nikolai Rimsky Korsakov The five were not together for very long The others became too busy with careers outside music or their musical tastes became very different from Mussorgskys In 1863 he started to compose an opera Salammb but he never finished it

Mussorgsky was very upset when his mother died in 1865 He started to drink heavily  In 1867 he finished the original orchestral version of his Night on Bald Mountain Balakirev did not like it and refused to conduct it so it was never performed during Mussorgskys lifetime

Mussorgsky continued his career as a civil servant but often he was not paid He was very impressed by Dargomzhskys new opera The Stone Guest and composed eleven scenes for an opera called The Marriage This too remained unfinished However he learned a lot from working at these unfinished works and developed his own style which was to be used in his greatest work Boris Godunov He learned a way of setting words to music that would keep the words flowing in a natural way which heightened their meaning It was very different from the old style operas where music was divided sharply into arias and recitatives with a few choruses

When he was 29 he was encouraged to write an opera on the historical story of Boris Godunov He based his opera on a play by Alexander Pushkin but he also read history books by Nikolay Karamzin He worked at the opera for a year while living with friends and working for the Forestry Department In 1871 he had finished it but it was not allowed to be performed in the theatre because it did not have an important part for a female Mussorgsky changed the opera adding a whole new act with a love scene with a Polish princess He made other changes as well The new version was accepted The first performance of the complete opera took place in February 1874 Mussorgsky was then at the height of his fame

After this Mussorgskys life became gradually worse He was depressed and had fits of madness He was drinking heavily He still managed to compose He wrote a song cycle Sunless a piano suite Pictures at an Exhibition and started two operas Khovanschina and The Fair at Sorochyntsi A lot of his friends were drinking and many of them died He was lucky to keep his job his boss was very keen on music and allowed him a lot of time off work  However in 1880 he eventually lost his job He was very poor A group of friends got together to give him money so that he could finish the two operas he was composing He almost managed to finish Khovanschina but The Fair at Sorochyntsi remained unfinished He became ill The famous painter Repin made a painting of the composer showing him with a red nose and glazed eyes He died a week after his 42nd birthday

Mussorgskys music uses Russian musical themes His music influenced later composers such as Dmitri Shostakovich and Sergei Prokofiev His greatest work was the opera Boris Godunov which was about an historical character who illegally made himself tsar of Russia but dies when he feels guilty about the murder he had committed

Khovanshchina was left unfinished and was completed by Rimsky Korsakov It was first performed in 1886 in Saint Petersburg This opera too was revised by Shostakovich The Fair at Sorochyntsi remained unfinished It includes a dance a Gopak which is very well known

Perhaps his best known work is Pictures at an Exhibition It was written for piano but later the French composer Maurice Ravel arranged it for orchestra and this version is very often performed today at concerts A short orchestral piece Night on Bald Mountain is also very often performed

Mussorgsky wrote a number of songs including three short song cycles The Nursery Sunless and Songs and Dances of Death One very well known song is Mephistopheles Song of the Flea

In the United States the Provost is the chief academic officer of a college or university Different schools have different rules for what the Provost does but most Provosts deal with issues about hiring and dismissing professors and giving out tenure handling complaints about academic programs and deciding what the general academic policies are for the school In other countries the Provost is sometimes the leader of the whole college or university

Robert Kocharian is the president of Armenia He is the second president Armenia has had since it left the Soviet Union On August 31 1954 Robert Kocharian was born in Nagorno Karabakh in the city of Stepanakert As president of Armenia Kocharian has been talking to the president of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev about what to do with the land of Nagorno Karabakh which the two countries had a war over

The Armenians are a nation from the Caucasus Their country is Armenia The Armenian culture is very old Armenia was the first country to be Christian when the Armenian king Tiridates III changed his religion by St Gregory the Illuminator Because of this many Armenians are Christians

In the Assyrian period the Armenian people of Nairi formed the kingdom of Ararat One of the earliest record of Armenians is from a text which says Armani together with Ibla as land conquered by Naram Sin identified with an Akkadian colony in the Diarbekr region To this day the Assyrians speak about Armenians by saying Armani Another record is by Thutmose III of Egypt says the people of Ermenen in 1446 BC and says in their land heaven rests upon its four pillars To this day Kurds and Turks refer to Armenians by Ermeni

Historically the name Armenian has come to internationally designate this group of people from the most common Armenian names Arman Armen and Armine Armenians call themselves Hay The word has traditionally been linked to the name of the legendary founder of the Armenian nation Haik which is also a popular Armenian name

Some scholars believe for example that the earliest mention of the Armenians is in the Akkadian inscriptions dating to the 28th 27th centuries BC in which the Armenians are referred to as the sons of Haya after the regional god of the Armenian Highlands 

It is a rapid transit system which links the different places of Singapore together using a network or different connections of trains When a person travels from one place to another he or she boards a train in a train station and then the train moves until the train reaches the place he or she wants to come out or alight Sometimes he or she has to change trains

About 1952 million passengers use the MRT The system is 1299 km long and has 70 stations The trains run from 530 am to 100 am every day except for the festive periods such as Christmas Eve New Years Eve and Chinese New Years Eve A train comes every 2 3 minutes in peak hours every 7 minutes during off peak hours and 5 6 minutes for the weekend service It is operated by the Singapores SMRT Corporation and SBS Transit

There are currently 4 lines in the MRT system where they are connected by special stops called interchanges The lines are North South Line East West Line North East Line and Circle Line Part of the Circle Line from Dhoby Ghaut to Marymount has been opened already The remaining lines which includes Downtown Line Thomson Line and Eastern Region Line are still being planned

On December 16 2011 the MRT network suffered what is likely to be the worst breakdown in its 24 year operating history A power rail problem made North South Line trains suddenly lost power and ground halt in darkness and without ventilation for up to an hour accompanied only by light from mobile phones

The MRT system had been using its two main lines the North South and East West Lines for more than ten years until the opening of the North East Line in 2003 While plans for these lines as well as those being built were made long before the Land Transport Authoritys publication of a white paper entitled A World Class Land Transport System in 1996 showed the governments intentions to greatly expand on the existing system The plans allow for the long term replacement of the bus network by rail based transportation as the main way of public transportation It called for the expansion of the 67 kilometres of track in 1995 to over 160 in 10 to 15 years and expected further expansion in the longer term It was anticipated that daily ridership in 2020 would have grown to 46 million from the current 14 million passengers By 2020 the density of the rail network will increase by 60 per cent from 31 to 51 km per million population comparable to cities like New York and London and surpassing Hong Kong and Tokyo

The 357 kilometre Circle Line is Singapores newest rail line It is being built in five parts of which the section from Bartley to Dhoby Ghaut is operational The first part opened to the public from Bartley to Marymount on May 28 2009 When finished the line will connect all MRT lines and will allow passengers to bypass the downtown area so that the City Hall and Raffles Place interchange stations will be less crowded It will also connect to Marina South via a spur line branching off Promenade Station and ending at Marina Bay Station The second part opened to the public from Bartley to Dhoby Ghaut on April 17 2010 while the remainder would have been finished in 2011 Only the Marina Bay Extension will be opened in 2012

The Downtown Line is being built now in three parts The first part to open will be 34 kilometres with five stations connecting Bugis on the East West Line to Chinatown on the North East Line The second part will connect Bukit Panjang in western Singapore with the first part The third part will connect Expo in eastern Singapore with the first part The parts will open in 2013 2015 and 2016 It will be 40 kilometers long and have 33 stations Stage 1 2 are in the construction phase while stage 3 is under planning stages

The 27 kilometre Thomson Line is planned to be completed by 2018 and consists of 18 stations It will connect to the North South Line at Woodlands station to the Circle Line at Thomson station to the Downtown Line at Stevens station to the North South Line at Orchard Road station to the East West and Northeast lines at Outram Park station and to the North South and Circle lines at Marina Bay station

The 21 kilometre Eastern Region Line is planned to be completed by 2020 and consists of 12 stations It will run from Marina Bay to Changi Airport

The East West Line Tuas West Extension is a elevated westward extension from Joo Koon Station The 75 kilometre extension includes 4 new stations and a depot located near the Tuas Checkpoint This extension will be completed in the 2nd quarter of 2015 The easternmost station along the Tuas West Extension will have 2 island platforms and 4 tracks as it will serve as an interchange station for the future 6 kilometre Tuas South Extension which will have 2 new stations The Tuas South Extension will only be completed after the Tuas West Extension

The North South Line Marina South Extension is a underground southward extension from Marina Bay Station The 16 kilometre extension includes 1 new station located near the upcoming International Cruise Centre at Marina South This extension will commence passenger service by 2014 a year earlier than originally scheduled

Every station has at least 4 ticket machines restrooms a passenger service center which controls what is happening in the train station and has wired radio with the train operator payphones and access for disabled Some of them have automated teller machines kiosks and a bus interchange nearby

All stations in Singapore are either elevated or underground and they are not surfaced Underground stations and trains are air conditioned A few of the elevated stations have half height platform gates which has been installed at Pasir Ris Yishun and Jurong East stations Half height platform gates are also installed at Bukit Gombak Bukit Batok Clementi and Lakeside but are not operational

Three types of the rolling stock are used on the East West and North South Lines another two types were used on North East and Circle Lines while the last two types are currently under construction Except for C751A C830 and C951 the rest are powered by 750V DC and operate in 6 cars

There are 66 trainsets which is made up of C151 built in 1986 89 by Kawasaki Heavy Industries and collaborating with three sub companies Kinki Sharyo Nippon Sharyo and Tokyu Car Corp It is the oldest trains in operation being refurbished in 2008 19 more C651s were purchased in 1994 from Siemens AG followed by 21 more C751B sets built in 1999 2000 from Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Nippon Sharyo

25 six car trainsets overhead rail of C751A were built from 1999 to 2002 by Alstom which has the model called Alstom Metropolis used as North East Line Another 40 three car trainsets third rail were built from 2005 to 2008 and were used as Circle Line

Two types are currently under construction They are C151A that will be operating in addition to C151 C651 and C751B in the East West and North South Lines and will be built from Kawasaki Heavy Industries based at Qingdao China Another model C951 will be built by Bombardier Transportation as Movia and will be based at Changchun China

Stations are divided into two areas paid and unpaid which allow the rail operators to collect fares by restricting entry only through the fare gates also known as access control gates These gates connected to a computer network are capable of reading and updating electronic tickets capable of storing data and can store information such as the initial and destination stations and the duration for each trip General Ticketing Machines sell tickets for single trips or allow the customer to purchase additional value for stored value tickets Tickets for single trips coloured in green are valid only on the day of purchase and have a time allowance of 30 minutes beyond the estimated travelling time Tickets that can be used repeatedly until their expiry date require a minimum amount of stored credit

As the fare system has been integrated by TransitLink commuters need to pay only one fare and pass through two fare gates for an entire journey even when transferring between lines operated by different companies Commuters can choose to extend a trip mid journey and pay the difference as they exit their destination station

The ticketing system uses the EZ Link and NETS FlashPay contactless smart cards based upon the System for e Payments system for public transit built on the Singapore Standard for Contactless ePurse Application system This system allows for up to 4 card issuers in the market The EZ Link card was introduced on 13 April 2002 as a replacement to the original TransitLink farecard while its competitor the NETS FlashPay card entered the smart card market on 9 October 2009 The adult EZ link card is at S15 while the NETS FlashPay card is at S13

Assurance has been given by both operators and authorities that numerous measures have been taken in an effort to ensure the safety of passengers with SBS Transit having to make greater efforts in actively publicising its safety considerations on the driver less North East Line before and after its opening Safety campaign posters are highly visible in trains and stations and the operators frequently broadcast safety announcements to passengers and to commuters waiting for trains Fire safety standards are consistent with the strict guidelines of the US National Fire Protection Association Platform screen doors are installed at all underground stations with half height platform screen doors currently being built at all aboveground stations with some at Pasir Ris Woodlands and Yishun These doors prevent suicides and unauthorised access to restricted areas as well as enable climate control in stations Above ground stations have open platforms with a wide yellow line drawn 70 cm from each platform edge requiring passengers to stand at a safe distance from arriving trains Bylaws deter uncivil disruptive and dangerous acts such as smoking the consumption of food and drink the frivolous use of safety features and trespassing on the railway tracks Penalties ranging from fines to imprisonment are imposed for these offences

Safety concerns were raised among the public after several accidents on the system during the 1980s and 1990s but most problems have been rectified On 5 August 1993 two trains collided at Clementi MRT Station because of an oil spillage on the track which resulted in 132 injuries There were calls for platform screen doors to be installed at above ground stations after several incidents in which passengers were killed by oncoming trains when they fell onto the railway tracks at above ground stations The authorities initially rejected the proposal by casting doubts over functionality and concerns about the high installation costs but made an about turn when the government announced plans to install half height automatic platform gates in a speech on 25 January 2008 citing lower costs due to it becoming a more common feature worldwide

Security concerns related to crime and terrorism were not high on the agenda of the systems planners at its original inception However in the wake of heightened security concerns after the Madrid train bombings in 2004 and the foiled plot to bomb the Yishun MRT Station the operators deployed private unarmed guards to patrol station platforms and check the belongings of commuters

Recorded announcements are frequently made to remind passengers to report suspicious activity and not to leave their belongings unattended Digital closed circuit cameras have been upgraded with recording capability at all stations and trains operated by SMRT Corporation Trash bins and mail boxes have been removed from station platforms and concourse levels to station entrances This is to eliminate the risk that bombs will be placed in them Photography without prior permission was also banned in all MRT stations since

On 14 April 2005 the Singapore Police Force announced plans to step up rail security by establishing a specialised Police MRT Unit now known as Public Transport Security Command These armed officers began patrols on the MRT and LRT systems on 15 August 2005 conducting random patrols in pairs in and around rail stations and within trains They are trained and authorised to use their firearms at their discretion including deadly force if deemed necessaryfactdateSeptember 2010

Hampshire College is a private college located in Amherst Massachusetts The current president of the college is Ralph Hexter The motto of the college is Non Satis Scire which is Latin for to know is not enough

Hampshire was created in 1965 by four other colleges as an experiment in higher education The campus opened and the first class of students arrived in 1970 The Presidents of Amherst College Smith College Mount Holyoke College and the University of Massachusetts got together in the 1950s and early 1960s and realized that there were things their own schools did not do very well They also thought that the world was changing a lot and needed a college where students would have a lot of responsibility for their own education to be successful in the future

Franklin Patterson and Charles Longsworth were chosen by these schools and wrote a book called The Making of a College that said how Hampshire was to be run and what kind of programs it would offer Today this book is considered an inspirational document by Hampshire students and faculty who try to live up to its ideals

Hampshire College describes itself as an experimenting college because it is always changing and improving how it does things rather than doing the same thing as other colleges Students usually do individual projects in order to move towards graduation There is some required coursework but it is not the main point of the school Students also do not receive grades for completing their work Instead they get something called a narrative evaluation which is a long written explanation of what they did right and what they did wrong There are also no specific required classes for graduation but students must take classes in different areas depending on where they are in their studies

The program is divided into three Divisions rather than four years and students complete each Division as they show that they are capable of harder work Most students graduate in four years but not everyone takes the same amount of time for each Division 

The Hampshire College faculty are not organized in traditional departments but in loosely collected Schools The Schools names and subjects have changed over the years but there have always been between three and five of them Since 2005 the Schools are

Exclusive disjunction is a Logic operation on two values It will be true if exactly one of the two values is true Otherwise it will be false This also means that the result of XOR will be true only if both the values are different Same values will result in a false

The best way to remember a XOR operation is One or the other but not both

This is different from inclusive disjunction

Csar Cui born Vilnius 18 January 1835 died 26 March 1918 was a Russian composer He is the least known of the five Russian composers who were nicknamed the Moguchaya Kuchka a group which included Mily Balakirev Nikolai Rimsky Korsakov Modest Mussorgsky and Alexander Borodin Cuis father came from France and his mother from Lithuania 

Like most Russian composers in the 19th century he was an amateur composer His main job was as an expert on military fortifications He became a professor in this subject and wrote important textbooks about military defences He became a general

Cui liked his friends from the Moguchaya Kuchka but was often very critical of music by other Russian composers such as Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff This may have been because he was jealous of their success He did not find orchestration easy and Balakirev helped him a lot with the orchestration of some of his compositions He was best when writing songs and short piano pieces He liked to write music that sounded Far Eastern in character Cellists like to play a short piece he wrote called Orientale

Alexander Porfiryevich Borodin was a Russian composer Like many Russian composers of the 19th century he was an amateur musician His main job was Professor of Chemistry at the University of St Petersburg He had to compose in his spare time He used to tell his friends Please do not say I hope you are well please say I hope you are ill When he was ill he had more time to write music Borodins most famous opera is called Prince Igor He wrote many fine songs chamber music and orchestral music including two symphonies The Nocturne from his String quartet no 2 is especially well known

Corrosion is the breakdown of materials due to reactions within its area It is the loss of water and air molecules Corrosion also occurs when an acidic or basic material touches another material When a material corrodes it changes it and becomes weaker Materials that corrode include iron copper plastic skin cells and wood

One form of high temperature corrosion can lead to the formation of compacted oxide layer glazes which under certain circumstances reduces wear 

Iron corrosion is called rusting

Rust is a type of corrosion Rust is the slow breaking down of metals due to a chemical reaction with oxygen when exposed to air or water Almost all metals rust but some metals are protected by a thin paint Alloys such as stainless steel rust much slower than iron When a piece of metal rusts it changes to a different color and the metal falls apart Rust appears on metal if it is left outside in the damp air For example rust occures mostly in cracks or where two parts meet on metal If it rains the water will enter the cracks and make it easier to rust because it would be hard to remove the water from the cracks So since the water stays in the cracks the metal starts to corrode Which at the end it turns into rust The iron cannot be used or reused as it is completely damaged once it rusts

Some metals such as aluminum form a very very thin coating of corrosion on the metal The metal cannot continue corroding since the coating isolates the rest of the metal from the source of oxygen That is why aluminum keeps its shine It also makes aluminum seem very unreactive even though it is reactive enough to react with water

Rust can also be any of various basidiomycete fungi that are parasitic on plants and produce reddish or brownish spots on leaves

Jamestown is a town in the United States It was founded on May 13 1607 by over 100 men and boys who came to Virginia from London England They named the town Jamestown after King James These men hoped to find gold and silver in order to become rich Jamestown was the first permanent English settlement in what would become the United States The town was built on Jamestown Island along the James River This location was selected because the local Native American tribes did not live on the island and it was a good place to defend themselves from other European colonists

The people of Jamestown had many problems They built their town near a swamp The water was bad for drinking Many insects lived around the swampy land The insects gave the people who lived there diseases The leader Captain John Smith made the rules for the men One of the rules was You dont work you don t eat The settlers traded with the Powhatan Indians They gave the Powhatans tools pots and knives in return for corn and vegetables More supplies were eventually brought over from England on a ship There was no cure for the Disease the insects gave to the people Most of the people of Jamestown ended up dying

A centipede is an arthropod with many legs Centipedes are predators They hunt during the night they are nocturnal Some centipedes are venomous though none can kill a human that is not allergic Centipedes are among the fastest moving arthropod predators that cannot fly Centipedes are in the class Chilopoda and related to millipedes which are not poisonous As the millipedes they are very segmented They have between 5 and 173 segments but only one pair of legs per segment

The house centipede is a carnivore that feeds on cockroaches house flies and other domestic pests It is therefore beneficial But because it has a scary appearance it is often exterminated

Pomerania is a region on the Baltic Sea It is now part of two countries Germany and Poland

20000 years ago the territory of present day Pomerania was covered with ice which did not start to recede until the late period of the Old Stone Age or Paleolithic some 10000 years BC when the Scandinavian glacier receded to the north Various archaeological cultures developed in the Mesolithic Neolithic Bronze Age and Iron Age

Initially at least part of Pomerania was dominated by Baltic tribes Since around 500BC and before 500 AD Pomerania was dominated by East Germanic tribes including several tribes of Goths who according to archeological evidence and their own tradition have come from Scandinavia Goths and Rugians are recorded by Roman historians in the areas of Pomerania in 98 AD The Veneti non Germanic tribe which later assimilated with Slavs are recorded by Ptolemy and Pliny the Elder around Vistula in first century AD By the 7th century Slavic tribes such as the Pomeranians settled the area

Pomerania was first conquered by the Polish duke Mieszko I in the second half of the 10th century Pagan uprisings in 1005 and 1038 resulted in independancy for Western Pomerania and Pomerelia respectively Regained by Poland in 11161121 the Polish could not hold the Pomeranian duchy longer than 1135 whereas Pomerelia after the 1138 partition of Poland among the sons of Boleslaus Wrymouth became a part of the Polish seniorat which was declared fief of the Holy Roman Empire in 1156 

The Western part the Duchy of Pomerania was declared part of the Holy Roman Empire After a brief period of Danish rule it remained part of Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation until 1806

A conscientious objector is a person who decides not to be a combatant in military forces

There are many reasons for this decision such as religious beliefs ethical and moral beliefs to not kill human beings or pacifism

Countries treat COs in various ways They have also been treated differently throughout history COs have been arrested or had to pay a fine Some countries punished them by killing them After World War II many Western countries created alternative non military services as alternative form for pacifists Often there were commissions to decide if someone really did not want to do armed service because of his beliefs or because of fear of war

Rule of law is a legal maxim that suggests that no one is above the law and governmental decisions must be made the only by applying known legal and moral principles The Rule of Law limits the powers a Government by judicial defense of laws and the Constitution which based on recognized basic legal values established in the international law The Rule of Law is meant to be a prevent dictatorship and to protect the rights of the people

The Rule of Law is especially important as an influence on the economic development in developing and transitional countries Constitutional economics is the study of government spending which in many transitional and developing countries is completely controlled by the executive The standards of constitutional economics can be used during annual budget process The availability of an effective court system to be used by the civil society in courts in situations of unfair governmental distribution of national money is a key element for the success of the rule of law in developing countries 

To date the term rule of law has been used primarily in the English speaking countries and it needs to be fully clarified even with regard to such well established democracies as for instance Sweden Denmark France Germany or Japan as well as to other counties It is important to create a bridge of mutual understanding between the English language doctrine of the rule of law and the originally German doctrine of Rechtsstaat translated into other languages of continental Europe as Etat de droit Estado de derecho Stato di diritto and  Rechsstaat can be translated into English as legal state or constitutional state 

The Electorate are the people or citizens of a state who elect representatives to represent them in a democracy Theyre also known as voters 

Paramount Pictures is an American motion picture production and distribution company It is the oldest movie studio in the United States It has been in existence for 97 years Paramount is owned by media conglomerate Viacom Paramount is one of the Big Ten movie studios

Paramount Pictures Inc can trace its beginnings to the creation in May 1912 of the Famous Players Film Company Organized in 1914 by a Utah theater owner W W Hodkinson Paramount Pictures was the first successful nation wide distributor Until this time movies were sold on a state wide or regional basis This was inefficient and costly to producers

In 1916 Adolph Zukor created a three way merger of his Famous Players Film Company Jesse L Laskys Lasky Feature Play Company and Paramount The new company was called Famous Players Lasky and grew quickly Lasky ran the production side Hiram Abrams was in charge of distribution and Zukor handled the business side of the company 

In 1927 Famous Players Lasky took on the name Paramount Famous Lasky Corporation Three years later because of the importance of the Publix theater chain it was later known as Paramount Publix Corporation The company went into bankruptcy in 1933 When the company emerged from bankruptcy it was known as Paramount Pictures Inc

Paramount Pictures had been an early supporter of television It created stations in 1939 in Los Angeles and Chicagos WBKB 

Paramounts successful run of lightweight pictures in the 1980s and 1990s created hits like Flashdance the Friday the 13th series Raiders of the Lost Ark Beverly Hills Cop and the Star Trek features 

In 1993 entertainment conglomerate Viacom made a bought Paramount 

Paramount is the last major film studio located in Hollywood Other studios such as Warner Brothers and Columbia moved to Burbank California

A chord in music is when two or more notes are played together

A chord which is built up of the 1st 3rd and 5th notes of a scale is called a tonic triad If it is made from a major scale it is a major chord If it is made from a minor scale it is a minor chord However any combination of notes is a chord 

Chords can be played on instruments such as piano keyboard organ harp guitar harmonica and xylophone Chords with two notes can be played on string instruments by bowing on two strings together By bowing on two strings and then quickly on the other two strings a violinist can sound as if he is playing a four part chord Some players of wind instruments are able to make chords by playing two or more harmonics together

A grill is a device used for cooking food With a grill food is usually roasted There are grills that use charcoal and there are those that use gas to cook the food Both have their supporters and enemies 

Very often grills are used for barbecues

In the United States there are cook offs for grilling The most common meats used are steak and burgers

It is a very bad idea to touch a hot grill with bare hands

The order of operations is a mathematical and algebraic set of rules It is used to evaluate and simplify expressions and equations The order of operations is the order that different mathematical operations are done The standard mathematical operations are addition subtraction multiplication division brackets and exponentiation

Mathematicians have agreed on a correct order to use operations and it is very important that they know these rules When people are solving a problem with more than one operation they will need to know the correct order to solve the problem correctly Otherwise the answer will be wrong

Follow all the rules in this order from left to right in the equation

Use operations inside brackets and solve any indices You should always solve brackets first when solving an equation

Example

Solve any multiplication and division in the problem Note that multiplication does not precede division this is a common mistake while the fact is that they are solved from left to right as they occur

Example

Lastly solve any addition or subtraction

A good way to remember the order of operations is by remembering this phrase The first letter of each word is also the first letter of a rule in the order

Please Parentheses

Excuse Exponents

My Multiplication

Dear Division

Aunt Addition

Sally Subtraction

Another good way of remembering the order of operations is the word BIDMAS or BODMAS The letters of the word are the same as the first letter for each rule

B stands for Brackets

I stands for Indices O stands for Orders

D stands for Division

M stands for Multiplication

A stands for Addition

S stands for Subtraction

A crystal is a solid whose molecules are arranged in a repeating pattern Sometimes pressure needs to be applied to a substance for crystals of it to form 

Different substances form different types of crystals Well known substances that form crystals are table salt and quartz 

Democracies are sometimes divided into Direct and Indirect the latter are the most popular 

In Indirect or Representative democracy citizens elect representatives to make laws on their behalf This is what most modern countries have today

In many representative democracies representatives are most commonly chosen in elections where a winning candidate has to win more votes than any other candidate While existing representative democracies hold such elections to choose representatives in theory other methods such as sortition could be used instead Also representatives sometimes hold the power to select other representatives presidents or other officers of government

In a democracy the ultimate power to decide significant electoral system reforms lies with the people The key question that democrats will tend to ask of any proposed change in electoral law or the voting mechanism is Will it actually increase the capacity of the electorate to get rid of unsatisfactory rulers and replace them with others Democrats regard that basic capacity as the best protection against governmental incompetence and abuse of power

In a direct democracy which is also called pure democracy the decisions are not taken by representatives All decisions are made at the level of the people When a budget or law needs to be passed then the idea goes to the people This obviously could get very complicated but if broken down into state levels of the same system it could be done There would be no political action groups because they would have to pay off the entire population of the country Taxes could not be raised without the permission of the people The few would no longer rule the many and the government would not cost so much money just to operate In indirect or representative democracy citizens elect representatives to make laws on their behalf This is what most modern countries have today because of the difficulties in getting millions of people together to do direct democracy

A Revolution is a very sharp change made to something The word comes from Latin and is related to the word revolutio 

Revolutions are usually political in their nature Some people feel unhappy with their lives They might join together share their ideas and make a revolution Often revolutions include fighting and civil unrest But there are also revolutions that happen without fighting 

The Soviet Union fell apart into its different republics without much fighting in 1990 But in the French Revolution there was much bloodshed The years right after this Revolution in France are often called the Reign of Terror There have been 3 main revolutions the American Revolution the English revolution and the industrial revolutionres

Western Digital is a company that can be found in California of the United States They make hard drives Hard drives are used by computers to store data

Speech is when language is used to communicate Only humans have language Speech between two people is a conversation 

Speech is made up of sounds that are made when air passes through the voice box and is shaped by the lips tongue teeth nose and palate

To make speech a person has to be able to

1 choose speech sounds 2 put them into a sequence 3 produce sound in the voice box 4 use the lips tongue teeth nose and palate to make the sounds

Difficulties can happen at any stage of this 4 stage sequence Difficulties at stages 1 and 2 are known as phonological difficulties while problems at stages 3 and 4 are known as articulation diffiulcties or motor co ordination difficulties A speech and language therapist can help work out the stage of the sequence that has difficulties and give therapy 

Animals do not have speech but they may communicate with each other by using sounds or by other means 

A speaker may say something and if it is heard what the speaker says may be understood Sometimes language is difficult to understand It may be vague confusing or even misleading It may be easy or difficult

The same speech may be made in different languages by means of translation

A stage can mean one of the following

The stage in a theatre is the area where the actors perform In classical theatres this used to be separated from where the audience is sitting

Potassium permanganate is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is KMnO4 It contains potassium and permanganate ions The manganese is in the 7 oxidation state It is also known as permanganate of potash and Condys crystals Potassium permanganate is a strong oxidizing agent which means it has a tendency to take electrons from other chemicals It dissolves in water to give purple solutions If it is evaporated it makes purple black shiny crystalsRefBurriel It has a sweet taste and is odorless 

In 1659 a German chemist JR Glauber melted a mixture of the mineral pyrolusite and potassium carbonate to obtain a material that made a green solution when dissolved in water It slowly changed colour to violet and then finally red This report is the first description of the production of potassium permanganate 

Just under 200 years later a Londoner named Henry Bollmann Condy was a chemist He had an interest in disinfectants and made some things like ozonised water He found that when he melted pyrolusite with sodium hydroxide and dissolved it in water it made a solution that had good disinfectant properties He patented this solution and sold it as Condys Fluid The problem was that the solution was not very stable This was fixed by using potassium hydroxide rather than sodium hydroxide This gave a more stable material It also was able to be dried to the just as good potassium permanganate powder This powder was called Condys crystals or Condys powder Potassium permanganate was easy to make so Condy tried to stop other people from making it and selling it themselves 

Early photographers used it in flash powder

Potassium permanganate is used as an oxidizing agentRefFatiadi1987 It also is used in disinfectants and in deodorizers It can be used to make many different kinds of chemicals In waste water treatment it is used to get rid of hydrogen sulfide a stinky toxic gas In analytical chemistry an accurate concentration of KMnO4 is sometimes used to see how much of a certain reducing agent is in the titration In a related way it is used as a reagent for wood pulp Mixing potassium permanganate and formaldehyde makes a mild tear gas

Dilute solutions of KMnO4 convert alkenes into diols This behaviour is also used as a qualitative test for the presence of double or triple bonds in a molecule since the reaction makes the permanganate solution colorless It is sometimes referred to as Baeyers reagent

Concentrated solutions oxidize a methyl group on an aromatic ring eg toluene to benzoic acid

KMnO4 oxidizes pseudoephedrine hydrochloride to produce methcathinone a Schedule I drug in the United States Consequently the DEA has restricted its use and sale by classifying it as a List I controlled precursor Potassium permanganate is listed as a Table I precursor under the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances

Concentrated sulfuric acid reacts with potassium permanganate to give manganese oxide which can be explosive RefCotton1999RefBarthel2000RefDzhabiev2005 This reaction also makes ozone The ozone can ignite paper soaked in alcohol This reaction is very dangerous

Concentrated HCl makes chlorine 

The Mn containing products from redox reactions depend on the pH Acidic solutions of permanganate are reduced to the faintly pink Mn2 ion as in manganese chloride In neutral solution permanganate is reduced to brown manganese oxide where Mn is in a 4 oxidation state Manganese oxide is the stuff that stains skin when potassium permanganate is put on it Potassium permanganate spontaneously reduces in an basic solution to green coloured potassium manganate where manganese is in the 6 oxidation state

Solid potassium permanganate is a strong oxidizer and in general it should be kept separated from reducing agents Some reactions need a bit of water For example powdered potassium permanganate and powdered sugar will ignite a few seconds after a drop of water is added Dilute solutions of KMnO4 are not dangerous KMnO4 forms dangerous products when mixed with concentrated acids

Potassium permanganate stains skin and clothing and should be handled with care Clothing stains may be washed away using acetic acid Skin stains disappear within 48 hours

Silkworms are very hungry They eat mulberry leaves day and night Silkworm eggs take about ten days to hatch When the colour of their heads turns darker it means that it is time for them to shed their skins After they shed four times their bodies turn slightly yellow and their skin becomes tighter which means they are going to become a pupa While they are a pupa they turn into moths Before becoming a pupa the silkworm wraps itself in a cocoon to help protect itself The silkworm is called a silkworm because it spins its cocoon from raw silk that it makes in its mouth Many other larva produce cocoons but only a few silkworms are used to make silk

The cocoon is made of one thread of raw silk from 300 to 900 meters long The fibers are very thin About 2000 to 3000 cocoons are needed to make a pound of silk

If the animal is allowed to survive after spinning its cocoon it will make a hole in the cocoon when it exits as a moth This would cut the threads and ruin the silk Instead silkworm cocoons are thrown into boiling water which kills the silkworms and also makes the cocoons easier to unravel Often the silkworm itself is eaten

The adult silkworms cannot fly The silkworm moths have wings about 2 inches wide and a white hairy body Females are about two to three times bigger than the males but similarly colored Adult silkworms have small mouths and do not eat

In China there is a legend that the discovery of the silkworms silk was by an ancient queen called Leizu She was drinking tea under a tree when a cocoon fell into her tea She picked it out and as it started to wrap around her finger she slowly felt something warm When the silk ran out she saw a small cocoon In an instant she realized that this cocoon was the source of the silk She taught this to the people and it became common There are many more legends about the silkworm

The Chinese guarded their knowledge of silk It is said that a Chinese princess smuggled eggs to Japan hidden in her hair The Japanese also love silk It takes 2100 silkworms to make a single kimono

In Korea silkworm pupae are boiled and seasoned then eaten as a popular snack food known as beondegi

In China street vendors sell roasted silkworm pupae The pupae are a delicacy in the Northern Area of China They are baked with Satay sauces and rice to add extra flavour In Japan Silkworm Pupae is used in many dishes including some types of sushi and even salads

Death Valley is a valley in the US state of California It is the hottest driest and lowest place in the USA It is a desert southeast of the Sierra Nevada mountain range Death Valley is a part of the Mojave Desert It is the most important part of Death Valley National Park It is an endorheic basin which means that the rivers in it do not flow to the sea

Death Valley has many famous and unusual geographical features in it Some of these features include sand dunes salt flats colorful rocks and tall mountains Large parts of Death Valley are below sea level One feature named Badwater Basin is the lowest place in North America It is 282 feet below sea level The salt flats are another famous feature in Death Valley Salt flats are very unusual They are large flattened areas where the surface of the ground is covered by salt instead of dirt The salt that makes up a salt flat can be many inches or centimeters deep The salt flats were created because thousands of years ago Death Valley was underwater Death Valley was covered by a lake that was named Lake Manly by geologists Lake Manly used to be very large but changes in the weather caused the rivers that brought water into the lake to dry up After a long time the water in Lake Manly began to dry up too As the water dried it left behind all the minerals that the rivers had brought to it along with their water As these minerals dried they created a crust of salt and other minerals on top of the dirt Many lakes and seas in other parts of the world dried up in the same way

All across Death Valley rocks and stones leave small paths behind them in curved broken wikt linkzigzagzigzagged or straight patterns The rocks are not alive of course but they still travel across the lake bed

Dr Robert Sharp a geology professor decided to find out about these rocks He put tags on 30 stones of different sizes and shapes hammered spikes into the ground where the rocks were sitting and then he studied what happened for the next seven years Twenty eight of the stones did indeed move sometimes more than six hundred feet Dr Sharp matched the movements with the weather and found that the rocks moved because of wind and rain Even though Death Valley gets less than two inches of rain a year the raindrops make the smooth clay in the dry lake bed very smooth and slippery The wind then blows the rocks across the slippery surface sometimes as fast as three feet every second

The changes in the weather that made the rivers dry up have not gone away Death Valley is still very dry There are less than two inches of rain in Death Valley every year Because Death Valley is so dry all the time even the dirt that is not covered in salt has become very hard This means that even though it does not rain often when it does rain the dirt cannot absorb all the water quickly enough and the water can turn into a flash flood In August 2004 there was a very bad flood The flood damaged many buildings and cars and killed several people The flood also destroyed many roads so nobody could go in or out of Death Valley Death Valley National Park had to be closed for a long time while the park rangers fixed everything

Death Valley can be very hot or very cold In the summer the temperature can be 130F In the winter it can be less than 32F and there is often snow On July 10 1913 it was 134F which is the hottest recorded temperature in the United States and the second hottest on Earth

Death Valley was named in 1849 Miners and settlers tried to travel across the valley during the California Gold Rush Many people died because it was so hot and dry It has very little water because the water evaporates or disappears in the clouds before it can touch the ground Of the few people who lived in Death Valley most were miners especially of borax

Much of Death Valley is part of Death Valley National Park The park was designated as a national monument in 1933 and a national park in 1994 It contains 5262 square miles in California and Nevada Death Valley National Park is the largest wilderness area in the United States 

Mulberry is a genus of 1016 species of trees They are native to warm regions of Asia Africa and the Americas with most of the species native to Asia

Mulberries are fast growing when young but soon become slow growing and rarely grow over 10 15 meters tall The leaves are simple often lobed and ridged The fruit grows in bunches 2 3 centimeters long is red to dark purple in color edible and sweet with a good flavor in several species

The fruit is used in pies tarts and wines The fruit of the Black Mulberry native to southwest Asia and the Red Mulberry native to eastern North America have the strongest flavor The fruit of the White Mulberry an east Asian species has a very weak flavor

Mulberry leaves particularly those of the White Mulberry are also important as food of the silkworm the cocoon of which is used to make silk

Mulberries can be grown from seeds and this is the best idea as seedling grown trees are generally healthier However they are most often planted from large pieces cut from other Mulberry trees which easily take root

Procaine is a analgesic drug It is used primarily to reduce the pain of getting certain shots and is also used by dentists The drug is usually sold under the name Novocaine or Novacaine

Procaine was first made in 1905 and was the first man made pain killer that could be taken as a shot It was created by the German scientist Alfred Einhorn who gave the chemical the name Novacaine from the Latin word novus and caine as in cocaine

Procaine is not often used today because other safer and better working pain killing drugs now exist Prior to the discovery of procaine cocaine was the most commonly used pain killer Procaine has the advantage of reducing bleeding unlike other pain killers and without the dangerous qualities of cocaine 

Leizu was a legendary Chinese queen According to tradition she discovered silk and invented the silk loom in the 28th century BC

Leizu discovered silkworms while on a walk near the kings mulberry trees However there are different stories of exactly how she discovered that silkworms make silk

One story says that she used her finger to touch a worm causing a strand of silk to come out As the silk continued to come out she wrapped it around her finger When the silk ran out she saw a small cocoon and realized that this cocoon was the source of the silk 

Another story says that she found silkworms eating the mulberry leaves and spinning cocoons She collected some cocoons and then sat down to have some tea While she was sipping a cup of tea she dropped a cocoon into the steaming water A fine thread started to separate itself from the cocoon Leizu found that she could unwind this soft and lovely thread around her finger

She asked her husband to give her a grove of mulberry trees where she could keep the worms that made these cocoons She is credited with inventing the silk reel which joins thin silk threads into a thicker thread strong enough for weaving She is also credited with inventing the first silk loom It is not known how much if any of this story is true but historians do know that silk was first made in China Leizu shared what she found out with others and the knowledge became common

A moth is an insect closely related to the butterfly Most species of moth are only active at night They can be told apart from butterflies in several ways Moth antenna look like little feathers and their wings are held flat on their backs when they are not flying

Moths specifically their caterpillars are a major farm pest in many parts of the world Caterpillars eat the plants that farmers grow and sometimes kill them The caterpillar of the gypsy moth causes great harm to forests in the northeast United States In warm climates the diamondback moth is perhaps the most serious pest of cabbage crops

Several different kinds of moths are commonly regarded as pests because their larvae eat fabric such as clothes and blankets made from natural fibers such as wool or silk They are less likely to eat fabric containing artificial fibers There are some reports that they can be repelled by the scent of wood from juniper and cedar trees by lavender or by other natural oils However many consider this unlikely to prevent moths from living somewhere Chemicals are the most effective way to keep moths away however there are concerns about the chemicals being dangerous to people Moth larvae are not killed by freezing the items they live in

Moths are difficult to kill and usually not killed by poisons that work on mosquitoes and flies

Some moths are farmed The most important of these is the silkworm It is farmed for the silk with which it builds its cocoon The silk industry produces over 130 million kilograms of raw silk worth about 250 million US dollars each year

Moths will fly around bright objects and appear to be attracted to light Most scientists think that this is because moths use the light of the moon to help them fly in a straight line The light from lamps confuses the moths

Night blooming flowers usually depend on moths to pollinate them and artificial lighting can draw moths away from the flowers hurting the plants ability to reproduce

Moths usually pollinate night blooming flowers because they are nocturnal A moth uses its proboscis to collect nectar just like a butterfly does However moths do not always land on the flower to get the nectar they often broken wikt linkhoverhover near the flower and flap their wings hard while they sip the nectar Because of this moth pollinated flowers do not need a landing pad In fact some moth pollinated flowers point downward like the yucca flowers

Large and dramatic Moth species include

Moths that are of economic significance include

Other notable moths

A cocoon is a shell made of silk by most kinds of moth caterpillars and other insect larvae Some butterfly larvae do spin cocoons However most butterfly pupae are called chrysalids Some caterpillars attach small twigs or pieces of vegetation to the outside of their cocoon to hide it from predators Others spin their cocoon in a hidden place Examples would be on the underside of a leaf in a crevice or down near the base of a tree trunk

Silkworm cocoons are processed and used to produce natural silk for clothing

The Columbine High School Massacre was a school shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton Colorado near Denver Colorado on April 20 1999

Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold two students at the school came to school armed with shotguns and assault rifles They walked through the school firing randomly at other students and teachers Before killing themselves in the schools library they killed 12 students and a teacher and hurt 24 other students

It was one of the first well known massacres at a school in the United States and the one with the most deaths until the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007

After the shooting many people wanted to know why it had happened Many people thought that Klebold and Harris had done it because they were bullied and schools in the United States began talking about how to stop bullying However it is now thought that Klebold and Harris were bullies themselves Other people blamed parts of the media saying that the lyrics of bands and singers like Marilyn Manson and violent video games that the shooters played might have caused it 

In 2002 filmmaker Michael Moore released a documentary movie called Bowling for Columbine that was about why the shooting happened and about the role guns have in American culture In the movie Moore interviewed Marilyn Manson

Phenylketonuria is a genetic disorder where a persons body cannot break down an amino acid called phenylalanine Amino acids are necessary to make proteins which is what the human body is made out of Phenylalanine only comes from the food we eat our bodies do not make any by themselves

Normal people produce an enzyme called phenylalanine hydroxylase in their bodies When they ingest phenylalanine the body cannot use it so this enzyme changes phenylalanine into tyrosine which the body can use In people with PKU very little or no enzyme is made Since the phenylalanine they eat is not being changed into tyrosine it builds up in their bodies This can cause problems with the way their bodies work

In the past children with PKU almost always died from having too much phenylalanine in their bodies Today scientists know what foods have phenylalanine in them and they have created a special diet for people with PKU Since they cannot use it people with PKU cannot eat foods that have a lot of phenylalanine like eggs meat and milk An artificial sweetener called aspartame which is used to flavour diet sodas and candies also has a lot of phenylalanine so people with PKU have to be careful to avoid anything with aspartame in it People with PKU also have to take a lot of vitamins to make up for the foods they cannot eat especially vitamins B6 and B12

Babies with PKU are fed a special formula called Lofenelac It has everything babies need to stay healthy but with very little phenylalanine There are also other formulas for older children and young adults PhenylAde and other types are available As well as Low Protein breads and flour

Women with PKU who are pregnant or trying to get pregnant have to be especially careful to follow this diet If they do not follow the diet Their babies could be born with severe birth defects and mental retardation Babies born to women with PKU who have followed the PKU diet throughout their pregnancy are usually healthy and do not necessarily but may develop PKU Whether or not they have PKU themselves depends on the mother and fathers genes As well as the Fact that Genetics may play a part But in fact there are people who are Carriers instead of hosts that can be passed on until they resurface in the future generations These are so far undetectable and random at best However it is subject to debate whether it is the mother or fathers genes that are dominant

While PKU kids are generally small in size and are usually attributed with blond hair and blue eyes They also tend to have very fair skin and tend to burn easily Solar protection is a must for those who wish to work play or engage in activities outdoors

Most people with PKU can live as long and healthy as anyone else if the low phenylalanine diet is started when they are babies and continued for the rest of their lives The symptoms will usually disappear after the diet is started

A group home is a private house that serves as a non secure home for unrelated people who share a common characteristic In the United States the term most often refers to homes for people who need social assistance or who are not able to live alone or without proper supervision Before the 1970s this function was served by institutions asylums poorhouses orphanages and Victorian colonies

People who live in a group home may be recovering drug addicts developmentally disabled abused or neglected youths andor young people with criminal records A group home is different from a halfway house because it is not restricted to recovering addicts or convicted criminals and also because the people who live there usually are asked or made to help maintain the household by doing chores or helping to manage a budget In most countries people can still vote and attend university while in a group home

There are typically from 3 to 16 residents as well as a resident manager or service staff Residents may have their own room or share rooms and share facilities such as laundry bathroom kitchen and common living areas The opening of group homes in neighborhoods is occasionally opposed by residents who fear that it will lead to a rise in crime andor a drop in property values

Blood pressure is the pressure made by the blood inside blood vessels Unless otherwise stated blood pressure refers to systemic arterial blood pressure This is the pressure in larger arteries delivering blood to body parts other than the lungs for example the brachial artery in the arm The blood pressure changes Blood pressure is higher in arteries than it is in other blood vessels Blood pressure is often measured in millimeters of mercury

Systolic pressure is the first number given in blood pressure readings It is the peak pressure in the arteries during the cardiac cycle The diastolic pressure is the second number given in a blood pressure reading and it is the pressure at the resting phase of the cardiac cycle The mean arterial pressure and pulse pressure are other important values

To measure blood pressure doctors use a device called a sphygmomanometer

Typical values for a resting healthy adult human are about 110 mmHg systolic and 70 mmHg diastolic This can be very different for each person Blood pressure readings change naturally during the day they also change because of stress drugs disease or even because of what you eat The American Medical Association says that even the stress of having your blood pressure taken can make it higher They call this white coat hypertension

The Italian Mafia in America The Italian American mafia began at the time when many Italians moved to the United States in the 1800s The first Italian mafia was in New Orleans in Louisiana but soon they were in many cities across the country The Italian mafia in the United States is actually called La Cosa Nostra which in Italian language means This thing of ours or Our thing The American mafia is divided into different groups or families Many large cities have only one Italian American mafia family but some larger cities like New York City have more

Many other American cities have Italian mafia families These include Chicago Philadelphia Detroit and Los Angeles

 Hierarchy  Just like in a company where people have a boss and workers the Italian American mafia or La Cosa Nostra has a hierarchy Everyone has a job to do Some people are bosses and some are workers However you can always work your way up the ladder of power and respect Below is the hierarchy of an American mafia family

Each family will have a number of associates These are people that work with them or for them but are not official members

The mafia in New York began when thousands of Italians moved there in the late 1800s and early 1900s to find a better life At this time many Irish and Germans also moved to the US for the same reasons Many of these people set up businesses or worked for businesses that were already there Most earned very little money and some who were tired of being poor decided to earn money from crime which was easier than earning money by working There were many Irish and Italian criminal groups in the city who would steal extort and murder for money These groups were known all together as the Black Hand but they did not actually work as one group called the Black Hand there were many groups and they each worked on their own and the term Black Hand actually was the name of what these gangs did not their names 

In 1920 alcohol was made illegal in the US and the gangs had a new way to make money They brought in illegal liquor from Canada and sold it in clubs They bribed police into letting them sell liquor and made millions of dollars from this because they were the only ones who had liquor and so could sell it at extremely high prices Around this time the gangs in New York became one large gang as leaders of the gangs realized that more money could be made if all the gangs worked together A man named Giuseppe Masseria and a man named Salvatore Maranzano both wanted to become the boss of the newly made New York mafia Fighting known as the Castellammarese War broke out between the two men and many of their soldiers were killed Giuseppe Masserias underboss was a man named Lucky Luciano who also wanted to control the New York mafia He met with Masserias enemy Salvatore Maranzano and plotted to kill Masseria his own boss Masseria was shot to death in a restaurant in New York by Maranzanos soldiers one of them was Vito Genovese  a man who would later become boss  this was also the end of the Castellammarese War With the death of Masseria Maranzano appointed himself the boss of the New York Mafia in Italian language called the Capo di tutti Capi meaning Boss of all Bosses He called a meeting with the other mafiosi from all over the US and made the rules that are still used today

The bosses of the five families particularly Luciano began to grow tired of Maranzanos arrogance and the way he ran the mafia Maranzano realized this and planned to have Luciano and his consigliere and underboss Vito Genovese and Frank Costello as well as others killed Maranzano did not act quickly enough and was killed by men dressed as police officers on the orders of Luciano and his friend a Jewish gangster from Florida named Meyer Lansky Luciano then became the head of the New York mafia but not in the way Maranzano was he helped the five families run their business but he did not control them or call himself the boss of bosses The five families were kept The Profaci family went on to become named the Colombo crime family after a later boss Joseph Colombo The Mangano family went on to become named the Gambino crime family after a later boss Carlo Gambino The Gagliano family went on to become named the Lucchese crime family after a later boss Gaetano Lucchese Frank Costello became the boss of Lucianos old family which later went on to become named the Genovese crime family after Vito Genovese became the boss and tried to kill Frank Costello The Bonanno family kept its name as Joseph Bonanno was the boss for a very long time

Austria Hungary or the Austro Hungarian Empire was a state in Central Europe from 1867 to 1918 It was the countries of Austria and Hungary ruled by a single monarch

The full name of the empire was The Kingdoms and Lands Represented in the Imperial Council and the Lands of the Crown of St Stephen 

The dual monarchy replaced the Austrian Empire It started with the compromise between the ruling Habsburg dynasty and the Hungarians It was an empire made up of many different peoples and great power It found its political life full of arguments between the eleven main national groups It had great economic growth through the age of industrialization It also saw social changes with many liberal and democratic reforms 

The Habsburg dynasty ruled as emperors of Austria over the western and northern half of the country and as kings of Hungary over the Kingdom of Hungary The Kingdom of Hungary had some ability to govern itself It also had a say in things that affected both it and the rest of the empire This was mainly foreign relations and defense 

The empires capital was Vienna Austria Hungary was the second largest country in Europe It had the third most people

The Ausgleich or compromise of February 1867 created the Empires dualist structure The Austrian Empire had lessened in strength and in power This was because of the AustroSardinian War of 1859 and the AustroPrussian War of 1866 Also the Hungarian people were not happy with how Vienna treated them This had been going on for many years and it led to Hungarian separation This included the Hungarian liberal revolution of 184849

Emperor Franz Joseph tried to reach an agreement with the Hungarian nobility He needed their support to keep the empire together The Hungarian nobility would not accept anything less than equality between themselves and the Austrian elites

They wanted and got the Emperors coronation as King of Hungary This showed Hungarys historic presence A separate parliament at Budapest was created It could make laws for the lands of the Hungarian crown

Hungary and Austria had different parliaments Each had its own prime minister The monarch kept the two working together He had absolute power in theory but very little in reality The monarchs central government had charge of the army navy foreign policy and the customs union 

The deaths of Franz Josephs brother Maximilian I of Mexico and his only son Crown Prince Rudolf made the Emperors nephew Franz Ferdinand next in line to the crown On June 28 1914 the heir visited the Bosnian capital Sarajevo Bosnian Serb militants of the group Mlada Bosna attacked Franz Ferdinands broken wikt linkconvoyconvoy and assassinated him

Some members of the government such as Conrad von Htzendorf had wanted to broken wikt linkconfrontconfront the Serbian nation for many years The leaders of Austria Hungary decided to attack Serbia before it could start a revolt They used the assassination as an excuse They gave Serbia a list of ten demands called the July Ultimatum They expected Serbia would not accept Serbia accepted nine of the ten demands but only partially accepted the other one Austria Hungary declared war

These events brought the Empire into conflict with Serbia Russia moved its broken wikt linktroopstroops to help Serbia This set off troop movements on both sides The Empire with help from Germany faced off against Serbia helped by Russia This was the start of World War I 

Near the end of the war it was understood that the allied powers would win Part of the empire started declaring independence from the monarch They formed their own countries

The following countries were formed from the former Habsburg lands

Some Austro Hungarian lands were also given to Romania and Italy

Sometimes people describe the ways in which people with learning difficulties and autism interact with their own bodies and the environment as behaviour problems because they find it disturbing but this is controversial These do not cause hurt and are not meant to cause upset but are seen as self expression or self soothing by the adult or child acting in these ways such as rocking themselves or repeated actions like moving doors and drawers or echoing the movement in the environment such as the movement of a flag in the wind The argument is that it is other peoples problem if self expression or self soothing that hurts no one is something which other people find disturbing

Cheema is a warrior clan found in Jatts of India and Pakistan who are descendants of Indo Scythian tribes and were named by the British as a Martial Race Martial Race is a name made by officials of British India for races that were thought to be naturally warlike in battle to have courage loyalty self sufficiency strength and orderliness and to be hard workers and smart hard fighters The British recruited many men from these Martial Races for their colonial army The British called the Cheema a powerful and united but quarrelsome tribe

Many people of Cheema clan who are Muslims are found in West Punjab and many who are Sikhs are found in East Punjab They used to follow local Peer E Tariqat Jathera and before that Buddhism Most of them today are either Sikh or Muslim in their religion There are no Hindu Cheemas although there are Punjabi Hindu Jatts 

Jatts are a large and important group of tribes in Punjab Cheemas are one of the two major subclans of the 72 subclans in Jats They speak Punjabi and usually own much farm land and are important landlords in their areas The strength of the family can be seen in the first 1947 constitution of Pakistan where the Cheema tribe was listed in the second line as one of the forty largest families coming into Pakistan

According to scholars the Sakas and Kambojas were the ancestors of todays Cheema tribe The Indo Scythians were named Shaka in India from the name Saka used by the Persians for Scythians From the time of the Mahabharata wars Shakas were mentioned many times in texts like the Puranas the Manusmriti the Ramayana the Mahabharata the Mahabhasiya of Patanjali the Brhat Samhita of Vraha Mihira the Kavyamimamsa the Brihat Katha Manjari the Katha Saritsagara and many other old texts They are called part of a mix of other war like tribes from the northwest

The Vanaparava of the Mahabharata has a prophecy saying that the kings of the Shakas Yavanas Kambojas Bahlikas and Abhiras etc shall rule unrighteously in Kaliyuga 

This seems to mean the situation after the Mauryan and Sunga dynasties fell apart and northern India was occupied by foreign armies of the Shakas Yavanas Kambojas and Pahlavas

Alexander overran the Achaemenid Empire in 331 BC and marched into what is now Afghanistan with an army of 50000 His scribes do not mention Gandhara or Kamboja instead they name twelve small countries in those territories This means that Gandhara andor Kamboja must not have been very great kingdoms in the late 4th century BC In 326 BC most of these twelve or so countries that used to be in the Gandhara Kamboja Mahajanapadas were conquered by the Macedonian conqueror

Alexander invited all the chieftains of the former satrapy of Gandhara to come to him and submit to his authority Ambhi ruler of Taxila whose kingdom extended from the Indus to the Hydaspes complied After confirming him in his satrapy Alexander marched against the Sakas and Kamboja highlanders of the Kunar also Swat valleys known in Greek texts as Aspasios and Assakenois and in Indian texts as Ashvayana and Ashvakayana who had refused to submit to Alexander The Ashvayan Ashvakayan Kamboja and allied Saka clans offered tough resistance to the invader and fought him to a man When worse came to worst even the Ashvakayan women took up arms and joined their menfolk on the field thus preferring a glorious death to a life of dishonor 

Thereafter Alexander marched east to the Hydaspes where Porus ruler of the kingdom between the Hydaspes and the Akesines refused to submit to him The two armies fought the historic Battle of the Hydaspes River on the riverbank outside the town of Nikaia Poruss army fought bravely but was no match for Alexanders When the defiant Raja was brought before Alexander a legendary conversation took place in which Alexander inquired of Porus How should I treat you the brave Porus shot back The way a king treats another king Alexander was struck by his spirit He not only returned the conquered kingdom to Porus but added the land lying between the Akesines and the Hydraotis whose ruler had fled Alexanders army crossed the Hydraotis and marched east to the Hesidros but there his troops refused to march further east and Alexander turned back following the Jhelum and the Indus to the Arabian Sea and sailing to Babylon

In the middle of the 2nd century BC the Yuezhi tribe of modern China moved westward into Central Asia which in turn caused the Sakas to move west and south The Northern Sakas also known as the Indo Scythians moved first into Bactria and later crossed the Hindu Kush into India successfully wresting power from the Indo Greeks They were followed by the Yuezhi who were known in India as the Kushans or Kushanas The Kushanas founded a kingdom in the 1st century that lasted for several centuries Both the Indo Scythians and the Kushans embraced Buddhism and absorbed elements of Indo Greek art and culture into their own Another Central Asiatic people to make Punjab their home were the Hephthalites who engaged in continuous campaigns from across the Hindu Kush finally establishing their rule in India in the fifth century

Many JattCheema were oppressed by Hindu king Raja Dahir who ruled over Punjab where the majority of the population followed Buddhism The Jat made strong alliances with the Muslim Arabs and hailed the conquest of Muhammad bin Qasim an Arab general Muhammad bin Qasim defeated the Hindu Raja Dahir in alliance with Jats and other Buddhist Rajas On his arrival at the town of Brahmanabad between six and sixteen thousand men died in the ensuing battle Buddhists and the Jat Meds and Bhutto tribes hailed him as a rescuer from tyranny at the hands of Chach and his kin

Historian Baladhuri records the local sentiments upon Qasims recall 

people of Hind wept for Qasim and preserved his likeness at Karaj

While the Chach Nama notes the following as highlights of Qasims rule

The rulers before Islam were Siharus Sahasi II Chach Dahir The first two were Buddhist Rajputs and the last two were Hindu Brahmins The new Brahmin rulers were not friendly to the many Buddhists in Sind at that time and they were cruel to the Jats and Meds who were most of the peasants Bad conditions were put on the Jats and they lost many civil rights When Chach the Brahmim chamberlain who usurped the throne of Rajput King Sahasi II went to Brahmanabad he enjoined upon the Jats and Lohanas not to carry swords avoid velvet or silken cloth ride horses without saddles and walk about bare headed and bare footed It was because of this background that Muhammad bin Qasim received cooperation from the Buddhists as well as the Jats and Meds during his campaign in Sind In fact he was hailed as deliverer by several sections of local population The position of the Buddhists in Sind seeking support from outside can be read in the Chach Nama

Mohamammad Bin Qasim came as a deliverer for the ancient tribes of Jats and Meds and he defeated the oppressing King of Sindh From then the war between Budhists and Hindus saw another contender whos future followers of the monotheistic Islamic faith would change the history of India forever

The Cheema clan holds the largest number of Political seats in the National Assembly of Pakistan Senate of Pakistan in Punjab more than any other family in Pakistan Many Cheemas have emigrated establishing successful careers in aid agencies and armies amongst other professionals Their reputation as honest if ambitious workers is maintained in the diaspora

The Udyogaparava of the Mahabharata tells us that the composite army of the Kambojas Yavanas and Shakas had participated in the Mahabharata war under the supreme command of Sudakshina Kamboja The epic repeatedly applauds this composite army as being very fierce and wrathful

Mahabharata too similarly groups the Shakas with the Kambojas and Yavanas and states that they were originally noble Kshatriyas but got degraded to vrishala status on account of their non obersvance of the sacred Brahmanical codes

This degradation of social stature of Cheemas can also be attributed to their unholy ways in conduct

Manusmriti places the Shakas with the Kambojas Yavanas Pahlavas Paradas and labels them all as degraded Kshatriyas defying the Brahmanical codes and rituals 

In the Puranas Darada the Jatt sub tribes have been called degrading terms such as Rakshasas not having darshan of the Brahmin

Cheemas of Sialkot district have in common with the Sindhu and Shahi of these parts some peculiar marriage customs such as cutting a goats ear and marking their foreheads with the blood making the bridegroom cut off a twig of jhand tree and so forth They like most other tribes of Sialkot district worship jhand tree

Cheemas of Gujranwala district have similar marriage customs which involves making the bride cut off a twig of jhand tree followed by paying a visit to local Peers or Jatheras shrine

Cheema are most numerous in Sialkot district followed by forty two villages in Gujranwala district According to Cunningham this area of high Cheema density was called Chima des Many settled in Montgomery and Sandal Bar during the British rule of Punjab due to construction of extensive canal network in these areas They also have few villages scattered across Rawalpindi Bhawalpur Amritsar Gurdaspur Jalandhar Moga Ludhiana and Sangrur

Towards west in the Punjab plains they are not found after Chaj Doab Towards east in the Punjab plains this clan was not found after district Sangrur in east Punjab until 1947 when many Sikh Cheemas moved from Sialkot and Gujranwala to settle in Patiala Karnal and Sirsa after partition of the Punjab And some families also moved afterward Udhamsingh nagarUttrakhandpilibhit Rampur Utter pradesh

In Pakistan Sialkot district has large Cheema population with many Cheema villages such as Sahowala Kamalpur Manpur Also in Rawalpindi district there is a village near Gujar Khan which is named Sui Cheemian and has a substantal population of Cheemas In Southern Punjab Bahawalpur and Yazman are richly populated with the Cheema Families and their saturated villages and the area elects more than a dozen cabinet members

There is an old folk saying about Cheema and Chatha tribes in Punjabi Cheemey tey Chatthey khaan peen nu vakkhon vakh tey larran bhiran nu katthey

All living things respire Both plant and animal cells use the process of respiration to release energy from glucose

During respiration oxygen reacts with glucose to produce carbon dioxide and water Energy is released in a form that can be used for chemical reactions inside cells Some heat is released by these chemical reactions in cells and it is this heat we experience as body heat 

Glucose Oxygen  Carbon dioxide Water

Where does respiration take place

Respiration takes place in a special structure called the mitochondria inside all eukaryote cells

Ferdinand II the Catholic was king of Aragon Castile Sicily Naples Valencia Sardinia and Navarre and Count of Barcelona 

Ferdinand was the son of John II of Aragon by his second wife the Aragonese noblewoman Juana Enriquez He married Infanta Isabella the sister by a different mother and heiress of Henry IV of Castile on October 19 1469 in Ocaa He became Ferdinand V of Castile when Isabella succeeded her brother as Queen of Castile in 1474 The two young monarchs had initially to fight a civil war against Juana princess of Castile the purported daughter of Henry IV They were ultimately successful Ferdinand succeeded his father as King of Aragon in 1479 and the Crown of Castile and the various territories of the Crown of Aragon were united in a personal union For the first time since the 8th century this created a single political unit which might be called Spain although the various territories were not properly administered as a single unit until the 18th century

The first decades of Ferdinand and Isabellas joint rule were taken up with the conquest of the Kingdom of Granada the last Muslim enclave in the Iberian peninsula This was completed by 1492 In that same year the Jews were expelled from both Castile and Aragon and Christopher Columbus was sent by the couple on his expedition which would ultimately discover the New World By the Treaty of Tordesillas of 1494 the extra European world was split between the crowns of Portugal and Castile by a north south line through the Atlantic Ocean

The latter part of Ferdinands life was largely taken up with the so called Italian Wars disputes over control of Italy with successive Kings of France In 1494 Charles VIII of France invaded Italy and expelled Ferdinands cousin Alfonso II from the throne of Naples Ferdinands alliance with various Italian princes and with Emperor Maximilian I expelled the French by 1496 and installed Alfonsos son Ferdinand on the Neapolitan throne In 1501 following the death of Ferdinand II of Naples and his succession by his uncle Frederick Ferdinand of Aragon signed an agreement with Charles VIIIs successor Louis XII Louis had just successfully asserted his claims to the Duchy of Milan and they agreed to partition Naples between them with Campania and the Abruzzi including Naples itself going to the French and Ferdinand taking Apulia and Calabria The agreement soon fell apart and over the next several years Ferdinands great general Gonzalo Fernndez de Crdoba conquered Naples from the French by 1504 Another less famous conquest took place in 1502 when Andreas Paleologus de jure Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire left Ferdinand and Isabella as heirs to the empire thus Ferdinand became de jure Roman Emperor 

After Isabellas death her kingdom went to her daughter Joanna Ferdinand served as the latters regent during her absence in the Netherlands ruled by her husband Archduke Philip Ferdinand attempted to retain the regency permanently but was rebuffed by the Castilian nobility and replaced with Joannas husband who became Philip I of Castile  After Philips death in 1506 with Joanna mentally unstable and her and Philips son Charles of Ghent only six years old Ferdinand resumed the regency ruling through Francisco Cardinal Jimenez de Cisneros the Chancellor of the Kingdom

In 1508 war resumed in Italy this time against Venice All the other powers on the peninsula including Louis XII Ferdinand Maximilian and Pope Julius II joined together against as the League of Cambrai Although the French were victorious against Venice at the Battle of Agnadello the League soon fell apart as both the Pope and Ferdinand became suspicious of French intentions Instead the Holy League was formed in which all the powers now joined together against France

In November 1511 Ferdinand and his son in law Henry VIII of England signed the Treaty of Westminster pledging mutual aid between the two against France Earlier that year Ferdinand had conquered the southern half of the Kingdom of Navarre which was ruled by a French nobleman and annexed it to Spain At this point to reinforce his claim to the kingdom Ferdinand remarried with the much younger Germaine of Foix a granddaughter of Queen Leonor of Navarre The Holy League was generally successful in Italy as well driving the French from Milan which was restored to its Sforza dukes by the peace treaty in 1513 The French were successful in reconquering Milan two years later however

Ferdinand died in 1516 in Madrigalejo Cceres Extremadura He had made Spain the most powerful country in Europe The succession of his grandson Charles who inherited not only the Spanish lands of his maternal grandparents but the Habsburg and Burgundian lands of his paternal family would make his heirs the most powerful rulers on the continent Charles succeeded him in the Aragonese lands and was also granted the Castilian crown jointly with his insane mother bringing about at long last the unification of the Spanish thrones under one head

Ferdinand and Isabella had 5 children Isabella of Asturias Juan of Aragon Joanna of Castile Maria of Aragon and Catherine of Aragon Joanna and Catherine married with several European dynasties setting the bases for the huge heritage of their grandson Charles V His granddaughter was Queen Mary I of England

The Roman Republic was a phase in history of the Ancient Roman Civilization According to legend the city of Rome was founded by Romulus in 753 BC It was a kingdom until 510 BC when the last King Lucius Tarquinius Superbus was overthrown With that date the Roman Republic began 

The Roman Republic was very well organized for ancient times The Roman people elected Consuls who ruled for a short time Some of the ideas of the Roman Republic are still used today

The end of the republic is still a matter of dispute different scholars will give different dates for it Usually the dates of the start of the First Triumvirate or the Second Triumvirate are given

The end of the republic is often said to be when Gaius Julius Caesar was appointed as dictator by the Senate of Rome This happened after a series of civil wars that lasted from about 49 BC to the year 44 BC

Some people say the republic ended with the naval Battle of Actium between Marcus Antonius and Octavian They both had been in the Second Triumvirate It was fought on September 2 31 BC Octavian won Later on he was proclaimed Roman Emperor The end date could also be when Octavian was given the title of the first Augustus This was on January 16 27 BC

These are modern views though In the view of the early emperors the res publica still existed It was simply under their protection They promised it would some day maybe be restored to its original form even though this never happened After the Roman Republic ended the Roman Empire began

The First Triumvirate is the name most historians give to the political alliance between Gaius Julius Caesar Marcus Licinius Crassus and Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus They made it in 60 BC to give each other power Each person helped the others to be more powerful It was unofficial The Triumviate lasted until Crassus death in the Battle of Carrhae in 53 BC 

Then Caesar and Pompey started fighting Caesar won at the Battle of Pharsalus Then Caesar became dictator in the year 44 BC

The Second Triumvirate was an alliance between Octavian Mark Antony and Lepidus It was formed to punish the conspirators who assassinated Julius Caesar 

The Triumvirate lasted from 43 BC to 33 BC It ended the effort by Marcus Tullius Cicero to reinstate the Senate as the sovereign body of the Republic From then on Rome was ruled by an Emperor

Occams razor is a principle from philosophy It says that if the only difference between two explanations is how complex they are the simpler one is usually better Another way of saying it is that the more assumptions you have to make the more unlikely an explanation is

William of Ockham a Franciscan friar who studied logic in the 14th century first made this principle well known In Latin it is sometimes called lex parsimoniae or the law of briefness William of Ockham wrote it in Latin as

Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem

This can be translated as

Things should not be done more times than they need to be

The principle says that if there are several possible ways that something might have happened the way that involves the fewest guesses is probably the right one In other words you do not need to think of a lot of other explanations for something when you already have a simple one However Occams razor only applies when both explanations do an equally good job If a more complicated explanation does a better job than a simpler one then you should use the more complicated one 

Occams razor is a principle not an actual razor blade But it did get its name from a razor blade because getting rid of all the extra unnecessary explanations is a lot like shaving off extra hair with a razor

Example Two trees have fallen down during a windy night Think about these two possible explanations

Even though both explanations are possible several other unlikely things would also need to happen for the meteorites to have knocked the trees down In addition meteorites are very rare Since this second explanation needs several assumptions to all be true it is probably the wrong answer Occams razor tells us that the wind blew the trees down because that is the simplest answer and therefore probably the right one

Occams razor also often comes up in medicine when there are many explanations for symptoms and the simplest diagnosis usually is the correct one If a child has a runny nose they probably have the common cold instead of a rare birth defect Medical students are often told When you hear hoof beats think horses not zebras

Rio Grande do Sul is a brazilian state in Southern Brazil It has common borders with Uruguay to the south and Argentina to the west It has a very high standard of living Its capital city is Porto Alegre About 10 million people live in the state which has a surface area of roughly 282000 square kilometres

Turbofolk or Pop folk is a style of music from the Balkans that was invented in the early 1990s It mostly comes from Serbia Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro but it is also popular in other nearby countries It sounds like a mix of Arabic style singing with electronic music and rock music

Turbofolk is sometimes associated with the recent Balkan wars and the Breakup of Yugoslavia but it is still popular

Brurier Noir are a French punk band which formed in Paris in 1983 It is made up of Loran Franois and Dede In 1985 Masto joined playing the saxophone They sing about French politics and anarchism and are one of the most famous French punk bands 

The term Roman Britain is a term is given to Britain when it was under the control of the Roman Empire from 43 to 410 The Romans invaded Britain in AD 43 led by Aulus Platus a Roman noble The Roman invasion of Britain was arguably the most significant event ever to happen to the British Isles

Shetland is an archipelago the furthest out part of Scotland

The islands are between the Faroe Islands and the Orkney Islands They are about 50 miles to the northeast of the Orkney Islands They are about 100 islands in the group People live on 16 of them 

The islands form part of the boundary between the Atlantic Ocean to the west and the North Sea to the east

The largest islands of the group are Mainland Yell Unst Fetlar Whalsay and Bressay In general the climate of the group is subarctic and rather bleak 

They used to be called Hjaltland or Zetland Today the islands are part of Scotland The administrative centre is Lerwick

The economy of the islands is largely based on agriculture The sheep are known for their fine wool Other well known exports are the Shetland ponies and Shetland Sheepdog

In 1969 crude oil was discovered near the islands leading to an alternative source of income for them

By the end of the 9th century the Norsemen shifted from plundering to invasion mainly due to the overpopulation of Scandinavia in comparison to resources and arable land available there

Shetland was colonised by Norsemen in the 9th century The fate of the native population is unknown The colonisers established their laws and language That language evolved into the West Nordic language Norn which survived into the 19th century

After Harald Finehair took control of all Norway many of his opponents fled some to Orkney and Shetland From the Northern Isles they continued to raid Scotland and Norway prompting Harald Hrfagre to raise a large fleet which he sailed to the islands In about 875 he and his forces took control of Shetland and Orkney Ragnvald Earl of Mre received Orkney and Shetland as an earldom from the king as reparation for his sons being killed in battle in Scotland Ragnvald gave the earldom to his brother Sigurd the Mighty

Shetland was Christianised in the 10th century In the Treaty of Perth in 1266 the Norwegian king surrendered his furthest British islands to Scotland They included the Hebrides and the Isle of Man In return the Scots recognised Norwegian sovereignty over Orkney and Shetland The islands did not become Scottish until the 15th century and were ratified by an Act of Parliament in 1669

For three centuries the Shetlanders sold their fish through the German Hanseatic League a trading organisation This arrangement lasted from 1400 to 1700 AD

In WWII the Shetlands were active in covert operations against the Germans in Norway The Shetland Bus sailed in covert operations between Norway and Shetland They carried intelligence agents refugees instructors for the resistance and military supplies Many people on the run from the Germans and much important information on German activity in Norway were brought back to the Allies this way

In the early 1970s oil and gas were found off Shetland The East Shetland Basin is one of the largest petroleum sedimentary basins in Europe Sullom Voe terminal opened in 1978 and is the largest oil export harbour in the United Kingdom with a volume of 25 million tons per year

Firm geological evidence shows that at around 6100 BC a tsunami caused by the Storegga Slides hit Shetland as well as the rest of the east coast of Scotland and may have washed over some of the Shetland Islands completely 

Shetland has been populated since at least 3400 BC The early people subsisted on cattle farming and agriculture During the Bronze Age around 2000 BC the climate cooled and the population moved to the coast During the Iron Age many stone fortresses were erected some ruins of which remain today

Due to the practice of building in stone on the virtually tree less islands Shetland is extremely rich in physical remains of all these periods though Shetland is less rich in material remains than Orkney

The artifacts of all the eras of Shetlands past can be studied at the newly built Shetland Museum in Lerwick

A Salt evaporation pond is a man made shallow pond Usually it is located near the sea The ponds can be filled with salt water The water is then left to evaporate The salt is left behind and can be harvested Such ponds also provide a habitat for several kinds of animals Most of these animals are birds 

The color tells how much salt there is left in the water Green colors come from special algae These algae are there in low to mid salinity ponds In middle to high salinity ponds an alga called Dunaliella salina shifts the color to red Millions of tiny brine shrimp create an orange cast in mid salinity ponds Other bacteria such as Stichococcus also contribute tints These colors are especially interesting to airplane passengers or astronauts passing above due to their somewhat artistic formations of shape and color 

 ImageSalz 01JPGPonds on the Ile de R in France ImageSan Francisco Bay Salt ponds 2002jpgSalt ponds in the San Francisco Bay area The different colors are from different kinds of microorganisms in the ponds ImageAigues Mortes2jpgAnother pond in Aigues Mortes in France ImageBatz sur Mer Marais SalantsjpgThe salt after it has been collected This one in Batz sur Mer in France 

Salinity is a scientific term Scientists use it to tell how much table salt there is in water Salinity is measured by the amount of sodium chloride found in 1000 grams of water if there is 1 gram of sodium chloride in 1000 grams of salt it is 1 part per thousand

Food preservation is the name for a number of processes that help to preserve food This means that the food treated that way will go bad later that if it had not been treated that way For thousands of years humans have used methods of preserving food so that they can store food to eat later The simplest methods of preserving food such as drying strips of fish or meat in the hot sun have been used for thousands of years and they are still used in the 2000s by indigenous peoples

Common ways of preserving food are

Many common methods use several of these approaches at the same time For example pickles preserved in a jar are heated then put in a mixture of vinegar and brine Fruit jams and jellies are heated and mixed with a large amount of sugar Some preserved fruit is heated and then mixed with alcohol and a large amount of sugar Smoked hams are cured in brine and then exposed to the smoke from burning wood chips

Clapham Junction railway station is a railway station in Battersea in the London Borough of Wandsworth It is on St Johns Hill in the south west of Battersea

All services to Waterloo and many services to Victoria and Croydon stations pass through the junction these include South West Trains Gatwick Express and Southern services Services from Clapham Junction also head north along the West London Line through West Brompton and Kensington on to Willesden Junction and Watford Junction  services are operated by London Overground

Typical off peak service of about 110 trains is

The station has 16 platforms numbered 2 to 17 and arranged in two groups Platform 1 the northernmost platform is no longer used It does not have any rails If the planned East London Line extension gets to Clapham Junction the platform may be used again The stations main entrance is from St Johns Hill into a foot tunnel which is 15 ft wide It runs under the eastern end of the 17 platforms and to a northern exit which has restricted opening hours The foot tunnel becomes very crowded during the morning and evening rush hours and ticket barriers at the end of the tunnel are a particular pinch point

A covered footbridge connects the platforms at their western end The footbridge does not provide entry to or exit from the station 

The station is named Clapham Junction because it is close to the joining point of a number of major rail linesalthough the name is not shared by any junction near the station The names of the nearby rail junctions are

Adenosine triphosphate is a nucleotide used in cells as a coenzyme It is often called the molecular unit of currency ATP transports chemical energy within cells for metabolism 

Every cell uses ATP for energy It consists of a base and three phosphate groups One molecule of ATP contains three phosphate groups and it is produced by ATP synthase from inorganic phosphate and adenosine diphosphate or adenosine monophosphate

The ATP molecule is very versatile meaning that it can be used for many things Energy is stored in its chemical bonds 

When ADP binds with another phosphate energy is stored that can be used later In other words when a bond is made energy is stored This is an endothermic reaction

When ATP breaks a bond with a phosphate group and becomes ADP energy is released In other words when a bond is broken energy is released This is an exothermic reaction The ATP phosphate exchange is a nearly never ending cycle stopping only when the cell dies 

ATP is the main energy source for the majority of cellular functions This includes the synthesis of macromolecules including DNA and RNA and proteins ATP also plays a critical role in the active transport of macromolecules across cell membranes eg exocytosis and endocytosis

In all known organisms the deoxyribonucleotides that make up DNA are synthesized by the action of ribonucleotide reductase enzymes on their corresponding ribonucleotides These enzymes reduce the sugar residue from ribose to deoxyribose by removing oxygen

In the synthesis of the nucleic acid RNA ATP is one of the four nucleotides incorporated directly into RNA molecules by RNA polymerases The energy driving this polymerization comes from cleaving off a pyrophosphate The process is similar in DNA biosynthesis except that ATP is reduced to the deoxyribonucleotide dATP before incorporation into DNA

Shrimp are small swimming decapod crustaceans in the infraorder Caridea There are shrimp in both fresh water and salt water 

Adult shrimp are filter feeding benthic animals living close to the bottom They can live in schools and can swim rapidly backwards Shrimp are an important food source for larger animals from fish to whales They have a high tolerance to toxins in polluted areas and may contribute to high toxin levels in their predators 

Shrimp are related to prawns In cooking the criterion is often only the size of the animal 

Biologically prawns and shrimp can be told apart by the structure of their gills In prawns the gills are branching in shrimp they are not

Many shrimp species are caught to be eaten Usually the head and the digestive tract are removed before the shrimp is eaten

The prawn is a crustacean It is similar to the shrimp but the gills are different Prawns are in the suborder Dendrobranchiata 

Prawns are commercially fished and used for cooking In that context the difference between prawn and a shrimp is usually that prawn are larger than shrimp

Xi Shun served in the Peoples Republic of China army but got discharged because of rheumatism He once saved some dolphins lives by getting pieces of plastic from their stomachs that veterinarians could not reach

Crabs are in the phylum Crustacea They are decapods along with lobsters crayfish and shrimps Crabs form an order within the decapods called the Brachyura Their short body is covered by a thick exoskeleton 

They are an extremely successful group found all over the world They are basically heavily armoured shell breakers Most crabs live in sea water but there are some who live in fresh water and some who live on land The smallest are the size of a pea the largest grows to a leg span of 4 metres About 7000 species are known

Crabs have very short tails A crabs tail and reduced abdomen is entirely hidden under the thorax It is folded under its body and may not be visible at all unless you turn the crab over Usually they have a very hard exoskeleton This means they are well protected against predators Crabs are armed with a single pair of claws Crabs can be found in all the oceans Some crabs also live in fresh water or live completely on land

The pincers of crabs are their most important weapons They have at least three functions The pincers role in eating is to seize and subdue the prey If the food is a shellfish then the pincers can exert force to open or break the molluscs shell Pincers are also used in fighting between males and for signalling to other crabs

Crabs are omnivores they eat almost anything they find Often this is algae but animal food is essential for its good health and development They will eat molluscs other crustaceans worms fungi and bacteria

Crabs are prepared and eaten all over the world Some species are eaten whole including the shell such as soft shell crab with other species just the claws andor legs are eaten In some regions spices improve the culinary experience In Asia Masala Crab and Chilli crab are examples of heavily spiced dishes In Maryland blue crab is often eaten with Old Bay Seasoning

For the British dish Cromer crab the meat is extracted and placed inside the hard shell One American way to prepare crab meat is by extracting it and adding a flour mix creating a crab cake Crabs are also used in bisque a French soup

True crabs appear in the fossil record in the Lower Jurassic They are part of the Mesozoic marine revolution in which a number of sea floor predators evolved

The closest relatives of the crabs are anomurans a crustacean group which includes animals such as hermit crabs king crabs and squat lobsters They look a lot like crabs and many have the word crab in their name but are not true crabs Anomurans can be told apart by the number of legs crabs have ten legs including claws while the last pair of an anomurans legs is hidden inside the shell so that only eight legs are visible

Gran Colombia was a country formed after Colombia Venezuela Ecuador and Panama declared independence These countries were part of Gran Colombia Simon Bolivar who led the independence movement became president In 1830 however Venezuela and Ecuador separated from Gran Colombia and was renamed Colombia which then faced the separation of Panama

A fingernail is a hard part of the body at the tip of the fingers of which most people have ten Toenails are also similar except that they grow four times slower and are on the toes Only mammals have fingernails Like hair fingernails never stop growing They must be cut from time to time It does not hurt when you cut your nails The nails are made up of a protein called keratin Hair and skin also have keratin Some people paint their nails to make themselves look nicer Some fingernails can grow into the skin This is called an ingrowing fingernail They can hurt so are often treated through medicine The cutting and painting of the nails is called a manicure

The Crustacea are a subphylum of arthropods with 50000 described species They are part of the phylum Arthropoda Crustaceans include crabs lobsters crayfish shrimp krill and barnacles They are relatives of insects If the Arthropods are regarded as a superphylum then the insects and crustaces would be phyla The group has an extensive fossil record reaching back to the Cambrian

Most crustaceans are aquatic mostly marine Some have moved onto land permanently Crustaceans that live on land include some crabs and woodlice Crustacea range in size from a parasite 01mm long to the Japanese spider crab with a leg span of up to 14ft and a mass of 44lb The North Atlantic lobster can weigh more than 40 pounds 

Most crustaceans are mobile but some become sessile after their larval stage Barnacles become attached to rocks on thesea shore Some are parasitic like fish lice and tongue worms Crustacea usually have separate sexes and the eggs hatch into larvae

Crustaceans have three major body parts They are front to back head thorax and abdomen Generally they have two pairs of antennae two eyes and three pairs of jaws on their head Most breathe with gills although certain land crabs have developed lungs Lobsters and crabs have hard outer skeletons and tend to preserve well as fossils As adults they moult their shells as they grow in size 

Most crustaceans crawl along the bottoms of streams rivers and the ocean sometimes coming on land Because they move along the ground under the water they are called benthic creatures Even though lobsters and shrimps can swim a bit they usually walk along the bottom of the body of water in which they live

More than 10 million tons of crustaceans are produced by fishery or farming for human consumption the majority of it being shrimps and prawns Krill and copepods are not as widely fished but may be the animals with the greatest biomass on the planet and form a vital part of the food chain

Crustaceans exhibit a number of larval forms of which the earliest and most characteristic is the nauplius In most groups there are further larval stages including the zoea This name was given to it when naturalists believed it to be a separate species It follows the nauplius stage and often has spikes on its carapace These may assist these small organisms in maintaining directional swimming In many decapods due to their accelerated development the zoea is the first larval stage In some cases the zoea stage is followed by the mysis stage and in others by the megalopa stage depending on the crustacean group involved

An organism is called motile if it can move on its own Most organisms are motile Organisms that cannot move themselves are called sessile

Gophers are very rare pests and they attack lawns and plants

Warts are growths on the skin They are caused by a virus in the HPV family They can be on the hands feet genital areas or inside the mouth Medication can be bought at a pharmacy to remove them but usually they will go away on their own Warts are usually not dangerous to a persons health but they can be passed to other people 

There are different types of warts caused by different HPV viruses

The most common means of wart removal are available at pharmacies These over the counter drugs are eiither special pads that contain salicylic acid or as a solution that contains it Getting rid of a wart that way involves cleaning the area around the wart and treating it with the salicylic acid This will slowly kill wart tissue Dead tissue can then be scraped off Getting rid of a wart that way can take up to 12 weeks

Some prescription drugs are available They usually contain salicylic acid in higher concentrations Chloroacetic acid or Silver nitrate are sometimes used

Wasps are members of the Order Hymenoptera which also includes ants bees and sawflies By far the greater number of species are the parasitic wasps Almost every pest insect species has at least one wasp species that preys upon it or parasitizes it making wasps critically important in natural control of their numbers Parasitic wasps are increasingly used in agricultural pest control as they prey mostly on pest insects and have little impact on crops The common or garden wasps Vespula vulgaris and hornets are members of the eusocial family Vespidae with 5000 species

Many people usually get confused between wasps and bees Its pretty easy to tell the difference between bees and wasps because bees look quite hairy and wasps do not Wasps also have a longer petiole or wasp waist Often the petiole that separates the thorax from the abdomen is very long and thin Some wasps also have an extensively long ovipositer that looks like a needle It uses the ovipositor to lay eggs in hard to get at places The ovipositor is also its sting

Wasps have biting mouthparts and antennae with 12 or 13 segments They usually have wings and their abdomens are attached to their thorax by a slender petiole or a waist Females have a sting which they use for piercing and egg laying Adult wasps feed mostly on nectar but their larvae feed on insects or pollen provided by the mother There are more than 20000 known species of wasps 

Most wasps are social insects like bees and ants but there are a few solitary wasps Social wasps are formed of paper wasps yellow jackets and hornets All three make paper nests from tree wood They create paper cells similar to the combs that bees make with wax They chew up bits of wood and convert it into a paste which they use to construct their paper nests

The queen lays an egg in each cell of the nests When it hatches the grub is fed regurgitated insects by the worker wasps In one group the pollen wasps grubs are fed pollen and nectar only Adult wasps eat only nectar Unlike honeybees the ony one in a social wasp colony that will survive the winter is the queen She will find a place to hibernate  in the hollows of trees under bark or in the walls of buildings In the spring she crawls out and starts all over agan building a few cells laying a few eggs and nurturing them until they can become workers who will do all the work while she lays more eggs

The mud dauber is one of the most common solitary wasps The difference between normal wasps and mud daubers can be seen easily because of its long petiole The female gathers together mud and puts it in her mouth to use when building her paper nest for her young She uses her ovipositor to sting and paralyze tiny insects spiders caterpillars and other creatures which are stuffed into the mud nest After each cell in the nest is filled and almost overflowing with spiders and insects the mud dauber lays an egg in each cell closes the openings and leaves Then when the eggs finally hatch the larvae have a perfectly nice feast upon which they will dine until they become adults

Some solitary wasps make galls which are abnormal growths on plants They form directly after the wasp lays its eggs and the plant develops a growth around the egg encasing it The trigger for the gall to form is not known The gall protects the eggs while they develop Galls can be found almost everywhere in the late summer especially on the branches of oak trees like in this picture

Some wasps deposit their eggs in wood so that the young wasp larvae will feed on the tree itself making circular tunnels through the wood as they feed until they pupate and crawl out of the tree as adult wasps

Only the female wasps can sting A few people are allergic and might die if stung by a wasp They do not usually sting something unless it bothers them first Allergy to bees is uncommon compared with allergy to wasps Some people have a very marked local reaction to a wasp sting  this can usually be prevented with good self care such as elevation cold compress pain relief tablets and antihistamines This is not the same as an allergy  it is a normal immune response If a person has symptoms at a distance from the sting  eg spreading rash or itch tight chest wheeze tight swallowing swollen lipsface faintness or nausea he or she needs to seek medical care as an emergency Prevention of stings is vital as most people do not know if they are allergic or not Prevention of stings is fairly easy if people understand how wasps live and try to avoid eating sweet foods in their environment and take care over sweet smells when they are particularly hungry in the autumn Here are special orders to do if somebody gets a wasp sting

Information on Wasps and sting prevention

Dmitri Dmitriyevich Shostakovich was a Soviet composer People think he was the greatest writer of symphonies in the mid 20th century He was also a great writer of string quartets He lived when Russia was part of the Soviet Union ruled by the dictator Joseph Stalin People who criticized the way the country was being ruled were punished The politicians wanted music and art to be easy to understand and to show how great their country was If it was too difficult to understand it was called formalist and that composer was not allowed to have his music performed When Shostakovich wanted to put his real feelings into his music he had to be careful how he did it so that he did not offend the politicians

Shostakovichs parents came from Siberia His father was a biologist and engineer and his mother was a pianist They lived comfortably although this was to change after the Revolution Shostakovich studied the piano and composition at the Petrograd Conservatory After his father diedthe family were short of money so young Dmitri had to earn money by playing the piano in cinemas for silent movies He worked extremely hard and with a lot of concentration He was very successful both as a pianist and a composer His Symphony No 1 was very popular His music sounded very modern with lots of dissonant chords His first dramatic works include an opera called The Nose and a ballet called The Golden Age

In 1930 he wrote an important opera called Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District It was a huge success and the critics said that it could only have been written by a Soviet composer brought up in the best traditions of Soviet culture One night in 1936 Stalin came to watch it He left before the end Two days later there was an article in the official government paper Pravda The title was Chaos instead of Music It said that this opera was primitive and vulgar full of screaming and noise The politicians were criticizing not just Shostakovich but all modern Soviet music Shostakovich was denounced and his friends were too frightened to defend him in case they were denounced as well Shostakovich suffered quietly and wrote his Fifth Symphony The politicians liked this symphony He was once more thought of as the leading Soviet composer He was supposed to have said that his new symphony was the creative reply of a Soviet artist to justified criticism but it was actually a critic who said this Shortly afterward he received the Stalin Prize for his Piano Quintet

During World War II Shostakovich was evacuated with his wife and two children His next two symphonies nos 7 and 8 describe the war They were hugely popular in the West In the United States the Seventh Symphony became the symbol of resistance against Nazism

After the war Soviet politicians again began to control and criticize artistic life very hard In 1948 there was a big meeting at which Shostakovich Prokofiev and several other composers were criticized Their music was called formalist anti democratic and lots of other things which had nothing to do with music There was nothing the composers could do except to say how sorry they were For the next five years Shostakovich was careful not to write anything the politicians would not like He wrote songs such as The Sun Shines on our Motherland Some of his other compositions in which he expressed his real feelings were kept in a drawer so that no one could see them

In 1953 Stalin died and things became easier again Shostakovich wrote his Tenth Symphony The whole world now saw Shostakovich as the greatest Soviet composer He suffered less from official repression Surprisingly articles criticizing the music of modern young composers carried his name but a lot of these articles he had not written He was persuaded to sign them so that the politicians would leave him in peace He wrote more symphonies and quartets as well as concertos His opera Lady Macbeth was revised and given a different title Katerina Izmaylova It was performed in many countries and was made into a movie Yet in 1962 he wrote his very serious Symphony No 13 using poems including one of the Babi Yar massacre so he suffered from repression again

In his later years Shostakovich suffered from ill health He had poliomyelitis which made it difficult for him to use his hands and legs He suffered several heart attacks and started to lose his sight He died of lung cancer in 1975

Shostakovich is best known for his fifteen symphonies and fifteen string quartets His most important opera is Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District He also wrote a lot of film music and music for plays including Hamlet Shostakovich read a lot of Russian literature His songs had words by famous Russian writers such as Alexander Pushkin Fyodor Dostoevsky and Alexander Blok He wrote twenty four Preludes and Fugues for piano a piano trio two piano concertos a piano quintet a sonata for cello and piano and a sonata for viola and piano

He had lots of friends who regularly gave the first performances of his works Most of his symphonies were first performed by the Leningrad Philharmonic conducted by Eugeny Mravinsky His string quartets were first performed by the Beethoven String Quartet The violinist David Oistrakh the cellist Mstislav Rostropovitch and the pianist Sviatoslav Richter were all close friends who played his music

Shostakovich had an amazing musical memory and could play almost anything he knew by ear When he was young he spent hours improvising composing and playing Although he had small hands he was a very gifted pianist He had no difficulty in playing any of his works on the piano even music written for an orchestra He often played his music too fast and without much expression 

Shostakovich was a very nervous person He was shy and very self critical He hated having to talk to people he did not know He did not sit still always fidgeting and twitching his face nervously He was however always very polite and very kind to everyone he met He was very careful not to criticize musicians who asked him for advice He said very little but what he said was carefully thought out He wrote lots of letters to the authorities to try to help his friends He was very reliable and always tried to arrive on time In his last years he found it very difficult to use his hands because of his illness but he always insisted on writing down his music himself

In optics transparency is the property of allowing light to pass through something 

An object that is transparent can be seen through ie what is on the other side of the object can be seen through it The image you can see through a transparent object is similar to the image you can see without it It may be changed if the transparent object behaves like a lens This could change the size of the image or change its shape

Therefore when someone says that the government and its action should be transparent it is not the right use of the term What they actually mean is that the government and its actions should be more visible 

If some light can be seen through an object but some of the detail of the image is lost it is a translucent material The opposite of transparency is opacity

Examples of translucent materials are frosted glass paper and some types of amber

Particulates are very tiny pieces of a solid or liquid that are carried floating in a gas When the tiny pieces are solid it is called a smoke When the tiny pieces are liquid it is called an aerosol

Shorthand or stenography is a way of writing Shorthand systems allow people to write much faster Shorthand systems have been in use since antiquity Now they are not used as much because there are systems that can record voices

A sine wave is a curve with this shape 

This is a picture of a sine wave

All waves are made by adding up sine waves The sine wave has a pattern that repeats The length of this repeating piece of the sine wave is called the wavelength The wavelength can be found by measuring the length or distance between one peak of a sine wave and the next peak The wavelength can be found in many other ways too 

Waves are found everywhere in the natural world Examples of waves

All of these waves are sums of signals

Sine waves have a length called a wavelength There are other properties of waves and sine waves such as their frequency amplitude phase and speed

Collingwood Football Club the Magpies is a club which plays Australian Rules Football in the AFL It comes from Collingwood a suburb of Melbourne in Victoria In the AFLVFL it has won 15 premierships

The Collingwood Football Club was formed in February 1892 Collingwood played its first game in the Victorian Football Association on 7 May 1892 against Carlton In 1902 Collingwood won its first premiership against the Essendon Football Club

The Victorian Football League formed in 1897 Collingwood was one of the original teams In the early years of the VFL Collingwood was the most successful team it won 11 premierships in the first 40 years They won the most recent AFL premiership against St Kilda in 2010 The teams had to play a second match after the scores were equal at the end of the first Grand Final game

A yard is a measure of length A yard is about the length of a mans arm The yard is sometimes abbreviated yd

The abbreviation for yard is yd

In the United States and the United Kingdom people use yards more than they use metres Other US customary units or Imperial units of measurement are also in common use

Vibration or oscillation means quick moving back and forth about a point of equilibrium The vibration may be periodic or random Something that is vibrating may shake at the same time If it vibrates in a regular way it may produce a musical note because it can make the air to vibrate This vibration will send sound waves to the ear and to the brain

In structural dynamics and particularly in earthquake engineering vibrations may be unfortunately bad they may cause the structure to fail 

The time it takes a vibrating object to go back and forth completely is the period The number of back and forth movements in one second is its frequency measured in Hertz The farthest possible distance from the equilibrium point is the amplitude

Free vibration occurs when vibration is set off with a push and allowed to vibrate freely Examples of this type of vibration are pulling a child back on a swing and then letting go or hitting a tuning fork and letting it ring The mechanical system will then vibrate at a natural frequency and gradually wind down

Forced vibration is when an alternating force or motion is applied to a mechanical system Examples of this type of vibration include 

In forced vibration the frequency of the vibration is the frequency of the force or motion applied The size of the effect depends on the actual mechanical system

Molybdenum is a chemical element It has the chemical symbol Mo It has the atomic number 42 It has 35 IsOTopEs The name Molybdenum is from the Greek meaning leadlike The color of pure molybdenum is silvery white It does not occur naturally and is made from molybdenite

It is used in alloys with other metals like stainless steel It helps to make metal stronger especially in high temperatures and makes it less likely to rust This makes it good for use in high speed tools such as drills and saw blades It is used in aircraft and missile parts as well as in nuclear reactors It is also not toxic so it is used in making metal bowls for use in making food medicines and other chemicals

Molybdenum was used for many years before it was identified in 1778 by Swedish scientist Carl Wilhelm Scheele In 1782 Peter Jacob Hjelm was able to separate it into a dark powder he called molybdenum It was first mined in 1916 at Climax near Leadville in Colorado

In chemistry a solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances The substances that are dissolved are named solutes The substance the solutes are dissolved in is named a solvent An example from everyday experience is a solid dissolved in a liquid Gases can dissolve in liquids An example is carbon dioxide or oxygen in water Liquids may dissolve in other liquids and gases in other gases

Examples of solid solutions are alloys and some minerals

Insurance is a term in law and economics It is something people buy to protect themselves from losing money People who buy insurance pay what is called a premium and promise to be careful In exchange for this if something bad happens to the person or thing that is insured the company that sold the insurance will pay money back

There are different kinds of insurance One kind is called fire insurance It pays people if their property catches on fire and burns down Another kind is called life insurance which pays somebody else money if the person who has life insurance dies or becomes seriously ill

Actuaries are the people who figure out how much the premium should be They balance how much the insurer might have to pay out against the chances of having to pay out If an actuary thinks that there is a big chance that the company will have to pay out he will make the premium higher

A Bunsen burner is a common piece of laboratory equipment It is commonly used for heating chemical substances sterilization and combustion and it works by burning flammable gas It is named after Robert Wilhelm Bunsen Bunsen was a German chemist Bunsen did not invent the burner he made it better Originally Michael Faraday developed the Bunsen burner A Bunsen Burner has different types of flames which is each a different colour

A reaction is normally any response that is caused by some other event Types of reaction are

Michael Faraday was an English chemist and physicist He was a Fellow of the Royal Society and was awarded the Royal Copley and Rumford medals of the Society 

Although Faraday received little school education and did not know higher mathematics he became one of the most influential scientists in history Faraday was the greatest experimental physicist of the nineteenth century

At the time when he lived people like him were called natural philosophers At that time only a little was known about electricity Michael Faraday discovered many things about the way electricity flowing in a wire can act like a magnet He also found out a lot about the way electricity can be used with chemicals to make them change 

He showed that magnetism is able to affect rays of light as there is an underlying relationship between the two phenomena His inventions of electromagnetic rotary devices formed the foundation of electric motor technology and it was largely due to his efforts that electricity became viable for use in technology He made the first electric motor It is thanks to his early work that the electricity has been made into a useful thing today

As a chemist Michael Faraday discovered benzene invented an early type of Bunsen burner and popularized terminology such as anode cathode electrode and ion Faraday was the first Fullerian Professor of Chemistry at the Royal Institution of Great Britain a position to which he was appointed for life He was also the Director of the Royal Institution after Sir Humphrey Davy

Albert Einstein kept a photograph of Faraday on his study wall alongside pictures of Isaac Newton and James Clerk Maxwell

Michael Faraday was born in Surrey England His family was poor His father James was a blacksmith James Faraday had come to London in the 1780s from North West England The young Michael Faraday was one of four children and only had the most basic school education He had to teach himself to read and write At fourteen he went to learn how to be a bookbinder and bookseller from a man called George Riebau 

During his seven year study of making books with Riebau he read many books He read Isaac Wattss The improvement of the mind Faraday loved to use the ideas in this book in his work He started to become interested in science especially in electricity He began to attend public lessons run by the best scientists in London at the time He showed the notes he made to the great chemist Sir Humphrey Davy Davy liked him and offered him a job as an assistant in March 1813 

Faradays knowledge continued to grow as he helped Sir Humphrey Davy until he was making new discoveries on his own He was eventually made a professor in 1833 The importance of his work was seen within his own lifetime and the British government gave him a pension in his old age as a reward

Faraday also discovered that if electricity strikes a metal object it will only pass through the outside of the object The inside is unaffected by the electricity This is what keeps the people inside safe when lightning strikes a car or a plane This is now called Faradays Cage

Robert Wilhelm Eberhard Bunsen was a German chemist He improved the burner that has his name but was invented by Michael Faraday Together with Gustav Kirchhoff he developed a method of using the reflection of light to identify the composition of solidsliquids or gases This method is known as spectroscopy today He found the elements caesium and rubidium with his spectroscope In 1841 Bunsen developed the Bunsen cell by improving the Galvanic cell William Grove had developed in 1839

Keith Haring was an American artist He was famous in the 1980s for his art which was a mixture of graffiti and pop art and used bright colors and simplistic images as well as social and homoerotic themes Haring also donated money to childrens causes and organizations His artwork became well known around the world Haring died of an HIV related illness in 1990 The Keith Haring Foundation set up in 1989 continues his legacy of promoting art and helping children

The Adventures of Tintin is a Belgian comic strip created by Herg starting in the late 1920s and into the 1970s They were originally written and published in French but have been translated into many languages and are popular around the world

The stories center around a young reporter from Belgium named Tintin who travels the world and has many exciting adventures with his dog a white wire fox terrier named Snowy and later his friend Captain Haddock joins them on their adventures Other popular characters include Professor Cuthbert Calculus an absent minded and deaf scientist and inventor and Thomson and Thompson two silly detectives

The stories are a mixture of many different genres including adventure satire and social commentary and changed over time the first story Tintin in the Land of Soviets came out in 1929 and the last fully completed story Tintin and the Picaros in 1976 another story Tintin in Alph Art was never officially finished following the death of Herg in 1983 There have been many unofficial books but most of those are parodies or not part of the official series The books in the official series are

There have also been plays films and animated cartoons based on the stories There are also Tintin Shops in Europe which sell books toys and other items based on the books Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson are making a movie about Tintin

Selenium is a chemical element It has the chemical symbol Se It has the atomic number 34 It has 34 protons and 34 electrons It had a mass number of 7896 

Selenium has several different forms They are called allotropes The most stable of these is a dense gray semimetal The way the atoms are put together is a named a trigonal polymer chain It lets electricity pass through it better in the light than in the dark This form is used in photocells 

Selenium also has many nonconductive forms a black glass like substance as well as several red crystalline forms In the red form the eight atoms of selenium form ring to make a molecule These rings then stack together to make the solid red selenium The way that red seleniums atoms are put together is similar to sulfur

Selenium is not very reactive It does not dissolve in acids It reacts with air when powdered to make selenium oxide It does not react with many things so selenium oxide is what most selenium compounds are made from

Selenium forms several oxidation states 2 2 4 and 6 The 2 state is in selenides Selenides are strong reducing agents They are stronger reducing agents than sulfides Hydrogen selenide is the acid made from selenide ion Selenium also reacts with reactive metals to make selenides such as sodium selenide or aluminium selenide

The 1 state is found in some selenium compounds such as selenium chloride They are the most unreactive selenium compounds

The 4 state is found in selenites Selenites and selenous acid are moderate oxidizing agents It is made by dissolving selenium dioxide in water and making selenous acid Then selenous acid is reacted with bases to make selenites

The 6 state is found in selenates Selenates and selenic acid are powerful oxidizing agents Selenic acid can even dissolve gold They are made by reacting hydrogen peroxide with selenium oxide to get selenium oxide which dissolves in water to make selenic acid Selenates are more reactive than sulfates

Most selenium compounds are colorless Selenium compounds are not common

Selenium is very rarely found as an element in the ground Most selenium in soil is in a very tiny amount It is easily washed away It is in very small amounts in the human body Selenium is found most in sulfide ores like pyrite This selenium is in selenides Selenium is gotten as a byproduct Sometimes selenium is concentrated in plants It can also be leached into rivers when copper is mined Too much selenium is bad for a river Some coal has selenium in it

It is made as a byproduct when refining copper and certain other sulfide ores Selenium is made by oxidizing selenide ores to selenium dioxide The selenium dioxide is dissolved in acidic water to make selenous acid which is reacted with sulfur dioxide to make selenium as an element It is the red form that is made To make the black form the red form is heated and melted 

Selenium is used in photocells The gray metallic form is used as it changes its electrical conductivity when light shines on it Selenium is also used as a catalyst The largest use is to color glass red It can be used in special brasses instead of lead It is used in some rectifiers Most use silicon instead It is used to tone photographs It can be used to remove dandruff from hair in the form of selenium sulfide

Selenium is a trace element in the human body Humans need very small amounts of selenium Only about 50 200 micrograms are needed Selenium can be toxic if more than 400 micrograms are taken Once there was coal that had a large amount of selenium in it People were getting selenium poisoning from the coal 

Selenium deficiency is rare Although selenium has some helpful effects on the human body it also has some harmful effects and only a very little should be eaten

It is toxic in large amounts Some selenium compounds are very toxic and harmful to things that live in water Eating 5 mg of selenium a day can kill you after a while

Germanium is a chemical element It has the chemical symbol Ge It has the atomic number 32 It was found by Clemens Winkler It is a shiny hard silver white metalloid The chemistry of Germanium is quite like tin Germanium forms a large number of organometallic compounds It is an important semiconductor material used in transistors

Organometallic compounds are compounds that have chemical bonds between an one or more metal atoms and one or more carbon atoms of an organyl group

The Force is a term from the Star Wars universe It is a set of mystical powers that all the Jedi and Sith have They can do many things with the Force such as lifting an object up without touching it shooting lightning out of their hands choking people and many other things

There are two sides to the Force the light side and the dark side

The light side is used for good things like healing The people who study and learn the light side of the Force are called Jedi

The dark side of the Force is used by the Sith the bad guys in the Star Wars movies Sith have a lot of anger fear love and aggression The dark side of the Force gives the bad guys powers that the Jedi the good guys do not have For example Darth Sidious is able to shoot lightning from his fingers The dark side can seem stronger but that is just because a person who uses the dark side of the Force does not have to hold anything back he is not restrained

In the fictional Star Wars universe the Jedi or Jedi Knights are members of an old order who use a power they call The Force

The Jedi use The Force to have magic like powers Their typical weapon is the lightsaber a sword like weapon with an energy blade

The Jedi try to lead a good and virtuous life serving others They keep and defend the peace of the galaxy

In the fictional Star Wars universe the Sith are users of the Dark side of The Force and the opposite of the Jedi 

The Sith live to dominate all others and to cause pain and suffering throughout the Star Wars galaxy Some famous Sith are Darth Vader Emperor Palpatine and Darth Maul

George Boole bul was an English mathematician and philosopher He created Boolean algebra This is one of the bases of modern day computer science Other people like Augustus De Morgan and Charles Peirce refined and completed his work In their times very few people knew of the work those mathematicians had done Boolean algebra was rediscovered by Claude Shannon about 75 years after Booles death In his doctoral thesis Shannon showed that boolean algebra was useful It could simplify the design of electric switches and relays Shannon also showed that such switches could solve boolean algebra problems All modern day digital circuits use such algebra to solve problems 

Managua has been the capital city of Nicaragua since 1855 There had been an Indian settlement there before the Spanish but the modern city was founded as Leal Villa de Santiago de Managua in 1811 Before 1855 Len and Granada were the capital cities The word managua comes from the Nahuatl language mana ahuac It means near water About 18 million people lived there in 2004 This makes it one of the biggest cities of Central America The city is located at the shore of Lake Managua Many people who live in Managua are White or Mestizo They all speak Spanish There are also big communities of Catalonians Germans Italians and French Many of the people belonging to those communities have lived in the city for many generations Many people see Managua as one of the safest cities in America to live in 

The city has had two destructive earthquakes in the 20th century Hurricane Mitch caused further destructions in 1998 Many old buildings were damaged or destroyed in these earthquakes and new streets and monuments were built in their place In general addresses are rarely used to give directions Instead people usually use monuments to tell where a certain place is The problem with that approach is that sometimes the monuments themselves were destroyed Therefore foreigners often have problems finding their way around the city

Flat things do not curve in any direction It is not possible to have straight lines in all directions on a surface that is not flat

In music flat can have two meanings

A curve is a line that turns or bends A curved line is never straight and a curved surface is a surface that is never flat Some curves can be drawn on paper but some curves like a helix can only be seen in 3 D A circle is a curve that can be described with the formula x2 y2 r2 x and y are used as in a Cartesian coordinate system and r is the radius of the circle Many other curves can also be described with a formula like that

where 0 u 2 and 1 v 1 This creates a Mbius strip of width 1 whose center circle has radius 1 lies in the xy plane and is centered at The parameter u runs around the strip while v moves from one edge to the other

Topologically the Mbius strip can be defined as the square 01 01 with its top and bottom sides identified by the relation for 0 x 1 as in the diagram on the right

The Mbius strip is a two dimensional compact manifold with boundary It is a standard example of a surface which is not orientable The Mbius strip is also a standard example used to illustrate the mathematical concept of a fiber bundle Specifically it is a nontrivial bundle over the circle S1 with a fiber the unit interval I 01 Looking only at the edge of the Mbius strip gives a nontrivial two point bundle over S1

A simple construction of the Mbius strip which can be used to portray it in computer graphics or modeling packages is as follows 

There have been several technical applications for the Mbius strip Giant Mbius strips have been used as conveyor belts Such belts last longer because the entire surface area of the belt gets the same amount of wear Mbius bands have also been used as continuous loop recording tapes Mbius strips are common in the making of fabric computer printer and typewriter ribbons There they allow the ribbon to be twice as wide as the print head while using both half edges evenly

A device called a Mbius resistor is an electronic circuit element which has the property of canceling its own inductive reactance Nikola Tesla patented similar technology in the early 1900s Coil for Electro Magnets was intended for use with his system of global transmission of electricity without wires

The Mbius strip is the configuration space of two unordered points on a circle Consequently in music theory the space of all two note chords known as dyads takes the shape of a Mbius strip

The Klein bottle is a geometrical object named after the German mathematician Felix Klein He described it in 1882 and named it Kleinsche Flche Like the Mbius strip it only has one surface Mathematicians call this a non orientable surface Klein bottles only exist in four dimensional space but a model of a Klein bottle can be made in 3D This model is different from the original because at some point the shape touches itself In 3D part of the shape is inside the rest This is not the case in 4D Some 3D models use different colors to show the 4th component The part that lies inside then has a different color

Because the surface is non orientable there is no inside or outside This means that if a liquid were filled in the bottle it would run down its surface This may not be true for the 3D models of the bottle

The 2 dimensional version of a Klein bottle is a Mbius strip

Entropy is the name of some different things 

The word Entropy came from the study of heat and energy in the period 1850 to 1900 Some very useful mathematical ideas about probability calculations emerged from the study of entropy These ideas are now used in Information theory Chemistry and other areas of study 

In Geometry a side is a line that is part of a flat figure made from straight lines 

As an example the square on the right has four sides The sides in this picture are made with black straight lines The four sides are

A valley is a type of landformation A valley is a long depression in the land between two higher parts which might be hills or mountains Valleys often start as a downward fold between two upward folds in the surface of the Earth A valley is made deeper by a stream of water or a river as it flows from the high land to the lower land and into a lake or sea Some valleys are made by glaciers which are slow moving rivers of ice When a valley is made deeper or wider by water or ice this is called erosion Wind can also make valleys larger by erosion

A valley has a head where it begins in the mountains or hills sides where it rises up on either side a floor which is where the valley is most flat Some valleys have an entrance where the valley opening can be seen between two hills or mountains or cliffs A place where a valley is very narrow and has high walls is sometimes called a gorge 

Many of the people of the world live in valleys because there is often a river or stream in a valley for fresh water and there is often good soil in a valley to grow crops

Mountains and hills are made when the layers of rock and soil get folded There are always valleys in hills and mountains in between the highest parts which are the peaks If the mountains are very high then people who want to travel to the other side of the mountains must go by the valleys A valley that is used for people to travel through the mountains is called a pass 

Valleys that are high in the mountains are usually made deeper by a stream or small river running fast down the mountainside from a place where there is lots of rainwater or melting snow The mountain stream winds around the biggest rocks and washes the soil away as it flows It cuts a passage for itself through the softest soil and smallest stones A small stream can cut a very deep valley Valleys that are high in the mountains are usually V shaped There are many valleys like this in hills and mountains all over the world  ImageIaovalley smjpgIao Valley in Hawaii shows a perfect V shape ImageBlick zum Muretto Pass P1000742JPGThe Muretto Pass is a V shaped valley between the mountains of the Swiss Alps ImageVallata dellamendoleajpgThe Amendolea River winds between the mountains of Reggio Calabria in Italy ImageWest TatryjpgMountains and valleys in the Czech Republic 

In country that has hills but is not very steep a river or stream runs more slowly It makes a wider valley that often has some large bends as the river flows around the hills aways following the lowest way Water running down from the hillsides often carries soil that spreads out across the valley making flat land that is good for growing food crops and raising cattle and other animals Many farms are in valleys that are in hilly land Many towns are built on the sloping sides of valleys Famous valleys of this type are the Loire Valley and the Lower Rhine Valley in Europe and the Thames Valley in England  ImageChinon and the Loire from the chateaujpgThe Loire Valley in France is famous for its old towns and castles Image080110 wolf moselJPGGrapes to make white wine are grown in the valley of the Moselle River Germany ImageCerromonje4JPGFarmland in the valley of the Uruguay River in Argentina ImageShona farms ZimbabwejpgFarming in a valley in Zimbabwe 

Some valleys are almost flat like a large saucer Valleys of this type often have a very large river with many tributaries running through them The tributaries carry water from the hills or mountains that may be far from the main river After heavy rain lots of water rushes into the main river so that it rises and floods over the flat floor of the valley When the flood waters spread they drop lots of soil which has washed down from the hills The soil that drops on the valley floor makes the valley flatter Valleys of this type are very useful for growing food crops The widest valleys in the world are like this Famous valleys of this type are the Mississippi Missouri Basin in North America the Amazon Basin in South America the Lower Danube in Europe the Ganges River Valley in India the Nile River Flood Plain in Africa and the Darling River Basin in Australia  ImageVallee fertile du Nil a LouxorjpgGrowing crops in the Nile Valley ImageFields of corn Euphrates IraqjpgGrain growing in the Euphrates Valley in Iraq ImageArge County Romania bgiujpgThe Danube Valley in Romania ImageGanges near VaranasijpgThe Ganges River Valley at Varanasi 

A glacier is like a frozen river Many countries do not have any glaciers A glacier starts in very high mountains where there is snow and ice all the year The snow and ice starts to move down a valley that has been made by a fast flowing stream As the ice starts to slide down the mountainside it does not flow around the rocks it pushes the rocks out of the way As a glacier moves it picks up more ice and gets bigger and bigger A big glacier cuts through the soil and softer rock of the valley and piles up the rocks on either side or pushes them in front of it When a big glacier melts it leaves a valley of a deep U shape Many valleys like this were made in the Ice Ages In mountainous countries like Switzerland many people live in the valleys that were made by glaciers Some of the deepest valleys in the world were made by glaciers The fjords of Norway and sounds of New Zealand are where glaciers went into the sea  ImageGlacier du Tour 100 0094JPGA glacier is a river of ice FileFranz Josef glacierJPGThe Franz Josef glacier in New Zealand ImageRanda landslideJPGThe Mattertal a glacial valley in Switzerland showing a recent landslide ImageFjaerlandfjordenjpgFjaerland Fjord in Norway 

A plateau is high land that is flat on top or gently rolling not pointed like mountains or rounded like hills In hilly or mountainous country the bands of a soil and rock are folded but in a plateau the strata are in flat layers The water that makes streams on the top of a plateau cuts down in wide valleys with sides that are steep cliffs and a bottom that is quite flat Valleys like this are often deep and very narrow Some valleys like this are very deep and wide They are called canyons Famous valleys of this type are the Grand Canyon in the United States and the Megalong Valley in Australia  ImageThreesisters2006jpgThe Three Sisters in the Megalong Valley NSW Australia ImageGrand Canyon cloudjpgThe Grand Canyon Arizona USA ImageIMG 7431 Sharyn canyonjpgSharyn River Canyon Kazakhstan ImageFoz de ArbaynjpgFoz de Arbayn in Spain 

Sometimes a valley has been formed in the hills near the coast of a country Movement in the Earths surface may cause the land to sink lower and become flooded by the sea The shape of the valley can still be seen from the tops of the hills that stick out from the water Some of the hills may become islands and others become the shore of a bay Sunken valleys often make good harbours The east coast of Australia has many sunken valleys of which the most famous is Sydney Harbour  ImageSydney HarbourjpgSydney Harbour is a sunken valley 

A Manifold is a concept from mathematics Making a manifold is like making a map of a sphere

The Earth is a sphere a three dimensional object of geometry Yet maps can be made of the Earth At the edges of a certain map the map needs to be changed That way it is possible to make a two dimensional image of the whole surface of the Earth There need to be rules on how to change the maps and some areas will be on more than one map It is not possible to make one map only which would have no edges This map would either have edges or there would be some places where the paper was torn 

Each manifold has a dimension This is the dimension of the maps in the example above It is the same for all maps

The CW Television Network is a television network in the United States launched at the beginning of the 20062007 television season It is a joint venture between CBS Corporation the former owners of United Paramount Network and Time Warners Warner Bros former majority owner of The WB Television Network The CW name is derived from the first letter of the names of these corporations According to its former President of Entertainment Dawn Ostroff the network tries to appeal to people 18 to 34 years old The network currently airs programming six days a week Monday through Friday afternoons and evenings and Saturday morning childrens programming

The network started after its two predecessors UPN and The WB ceased independent operations on September 15 and September 17 2006 respectively The CWs first two nights of programmingMonday and Tuesday September 18 and September 19 2006consisted of reruns and launch related specials The CW marked its formal launch date on Wednesday September 20 2006 with a two hour season premiere of Americas Next Top Model

The CW offers a mixture of programming that originated on both UPN and The WB along with its own original programs mostly targeted towards women and young adults

Borzoi is a type of Russian dog It used to be called a Russian Wolf Hound

This type of dog was brought to the United States in 1889 It was approved by the American Kennel Club one year later The breed is beautiful and has a gentle personality It makes it a great companion dog

The breed was approved and the descriptive standard was written in 1650 It has not changed much since then Borzoi have a long coat It is about 30  32 inches tall at the withers It weighs between 75 and 85 pounds They can be any color from solid white to brown and white gray and white or brindle They can also be all black People who look after Borzois have done an good job of stopping health problem Borzois do not have many of the problems other breeds have

In Russia they were well liked by the royalty It was illegal to sell them They were given to those who did something special for the Tzars They feature in Russian novels eg in Tolstoys Anna Karenina During the Russian revolution most of the breed were killed because they were a symbol of royalty A few were taken from the country

They have been used in advertising for luxury cars and jewelry This is because of their elegant looks

Giuseppe Garibaldi was an Italian soldier He fought for the Italian Unification Movement He led a group called the Red Shirts through the Kingdom of Two Sicilies to bring together the kingdoms of Italy in 1860

Edward spent many years in Normandy The Anglo Saxon nobles invited Edward back to England in 1041 He became part of the household of his half brother Harthacnut According to the Anglo Saxon Chronicle both were sworn in as king together 

Following Harthacnuts death on 8 June 1042 Edward ascended the throne The Anglo Saxon Chronicle indicates the popularity he enjoyed at his accession before he Harthacnut was buried all the people chose Edward as king in London Edward was crowned at the cathedral of Winchester the royal seat of the West Saxons on 3 April 1043

Edwards death left England without a clear cut successor Harold Godwinson had led successful raiding parties into Wales in 1063 He negotiated with his inherited rivals in Northumbria in 1065 and in January 1066 upon Edwards death he was proclaimed King Harold II

The Norman position was that William the Conqueror had been designated the heir and that Harold had been publicly sent to him as emissary from Edward to apprise him of Edwards decision However Williams biographer William of Poitiers admitted that the old king had made a deathbed gift of the crown to Harold On Edwards death Harold was approved by the Witenagemot which under Anglo Saxon law held the ultimate authority to convey kingship

Edward also made his great nephew Edgar theling his heir But Edgar had no following among the earls he had lived in Hungary and was a boy of fourteen This opened the way for Harolds coronation and the invasions of two claimants to the throne the unsuccessful invasion of Harald Hardrada in the north and the successful one of William of Normandy 

Edward was canonized in 1161 by Pope Alexander III and is commemorated on 13 October

A world war means a war that is fought by most of the biggest and strongest countries on the earth against each other Because technology and weapons have become so advanced most people agree that if this war ever happens nuclear biological and chemical weapons will be used Nuclear weapons get their energy from breaking or joining atoms Biological weapons are living things usually bacteria or viruses Chemical weapons might not kill quickly but poison people or their land Together nuclear biological and chemical weapons are called Weapons of Mass Destruction Conventional weapons on the other hand are normal weapons like guns or dynamite 

This could destroy much of the Earth and kill most living things Albert Einstein said I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones This shows that he believed that after World War III civilization as we know it will be gone

Several times there have been events that could have led to a third world war The Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 brought the world to the edge of a nuclear war but this did not end up happening

Some events have been called World War III For example former US President George W Bush compared the war on terrorism to World War III

A shotgun is a type of gun To make a shotgun work gunpowder is lit by a primer inside of a shotgun shell The gas from the burning gunpowder will push whatever is being fired out of the barrel Usually a shotgun shell will have many small metal balls called buckshot or birdshot These balls spread out when they are fired Sometimes a shotgun shell will have a bigger piece of metal like a bullet called a slug

A shotgun can have one or two barrels These barrels can be next to each other or on top of each other There are also different types of ways of loading and shooting a shotgun Some will snap open and shells can be put inside until they are shot again Others hold more shells and are pumped back and forth to shoot Some shotguns are semi automatic so each time the trigger is pulled one shot is fired without any need to use a pump or a lever Some shotguns are fully automatic meaning that pulling and holding the trigger back will keep shooting the gun without needing to reload until the shotgun is out of ammunition However these are uncommon

Shotguns can also fire things that do not kill people Police use things like rubber balls and beanbags filled with the small metal balls instead to cause non deadly injuries

A mosquito is a type of fly It is the common name of a family of flies in the order Diptera 

The females are ectoparasites they land on warm blooded animals pierce a capillary and inject saliva to stop the blood coagulating Then they suck up and eat the blood Deadly microscopic parasites often live in the saliva 

The males are nectar feeders and so are the females However in preparation for egg laying the females turn to blood for its protein

Females cannot lay eggs until they have filled up on enough protein from blood Then they find a pool of water to lay their eggs in Mosquitoes lay their eggs in all kinds of water  including water pooled in candy wrappers The larvae move around near the surface of the water breathing through air tubes that stick out of the water They get their food from the water usually eating algae and other tiny creatures They like to wiggle around near the surface which is why some people call them wigglers The larvae usually enter the pupa stage within a few days or weeks of hatching depending on the water temperature and the species 

The pupae are called tumblers because they tumble in the water if the water is touched Tumblers do not eat but they move around in the water a lot and like larvae they breathe from tubes that stick out of the water The pupa stage is short and then the mosquito becomes an adult

Different kinds of mosquitoes like different kinds of blood Some like human blood others like the blood of cows or horses Sadly there are so many mosquitoes that almost every mammal has at least one mosquito that likes its blood

Mosquitoes are a vector which carries disease causing viruses and parasites from person to person

The principal mosquito borne diseases are the viral diseases yellow fever dengue fever and malaria carried by the genera Anopheles and Culex Mosquitoes transmit disease to more than 700 million people annually in Africa South America Central America Mexico and much of Asia with millions of resulting deaths

Methods used to prevent the spread of disease or to protect individuals in areas where disease is endemic include

Standing water as in a pond or lake is the main breeding ground It may or may not be practical to eliminate this water The water in bird baths can be changed once a week but one can hardly do that with larger bodies of water The method used to be spray water with DDT but that does a lot of damage and in any event the mosquito is now highly resistant to the chemical

With increasing reports of the harmful effects DEET has on humans there has been a move to repellents which are organic These are of the kind that have had traditional household purposes before their being used as mosquito repellents

The dragonfly nymph eats mosquitoes at all stages of development and is quite effective in controlling populations Some copepods are predators on first instar larvae killing up to 40 Aedes larvae per day A number of fish eat mosquito larvae including goldfish catfish piranhas and minnows

The oldest known mosquito with a basically modern anatomy was found in 79 million year old Canadian amber from the Upper Cretaceous An older sister species with more primitive features was found in amber that is 90 to 100 million years old

Genetic analyses indicate that the Culicinae and Anophelinae clades may have diverged about 150 million years ago The Old and New World Anopheles species are believed to have subsequently diverged about 95 million years ago

Molasses is a by product of sugar canes or sugar beets being turned into sugar It is like a thick syrup Some people also call Molasses Sorghum syrup The quality of the molasses depends on how the sugar is refined Molasses is like a black golden syrup type liquid

During the warm months stores in North America sell desserts called slushies or slush puppies that consist of crushed ice in a cup that has flavored syrup poured in it

Sugarcane is a genus of plants There are between 6 and 37 types of sugarcane Sugarcane grows in warm and tropical climates It first grew in Asia but after the year 700 people started planting it in Africa and southern Europe Later it spread to the Americas and Australia Today the biggest producer is Brazil in South America

Sugarcane stalks grow to between 2 and 6 metres tall These stalks contain sugar which is used to sweeten food and drinks After the sugar has been taken out the remains of the stalks can be burned to generate heat and electricity It can also be made into paper cardboard and cutlery grows on a slope and rquires a medeum level of water water usualy found in hilly or slopey areas an needs a good quality soil and has a bamboo ish look to is

The soybean is a plant with fruit called beans from Eastern Asia The height of a grown soybean is between less than 20 cm and up to 2 m One soybean lives for only one year Probably it was originally a vine

Soybeans can be eaten or used to make oil sauce milk flour tofu and other foods These soy foods have much protein and many vegetarians like that Also fuel can be made from soybeans

In 1997 81 of all soybeans were of genetically modified stock This means that genes were changed directly to make things happen

A habitat describes the place where many animals or plants live Many different kinds of animals or plants can share the same habitat In that case it is called a biotope A habitat can also be called an ecosystem or a biome An ecosystem is when there are many living and non living things working together in one habitat Habitat is also called a dwelling place

Most animals live in one type of environment because they are best suited to it We say they are adapted to this environment They live there For example animals such as frogs newts and ducks have webbed feet to help them swim in the waterThere are different types of habitats

Just as animals adapt to the places they live so do plants Plants are adapted to a wide variety of habitats As a result each plant has certain characteristics Some are adapted to living on land while others live in water Plants that grow on land usually have stiff stems to hold them upright while water plants tend to have less rigid stems because the water supports them 

Plants that live in dry climates like the desert have few or no leaves and may like cacti store water when rain occurs Their adaptations cut down water loss Plants that grow in shaded areas have large leaves to capture as much sunlight as possible or climb towards the light

Political correctness means using words or behavior which will not offend any group of people Most people think it is important for everyone to be treated equally fairly and with dignity Some words have been used for a long time that are unkind to some people Sometimes these words have now been replaced by other words that are not offensive Such words are described as politically correct The term is often used in a mocking sense when attempts at avoiding offense are seen to go too far

This term has been used since the early 1990s

Politically correct words or terms are used to show differences between people or groups in a non offensive way This difference may be because of race gender beliefs religion sexual orientation or because they have a mental or physical disability or any difference from what is considered the norm

The PC word African American is used instead of the word Black

Throughout the 20th century women have been fighting to have the same rights as men In PC language this is seen in changes to job titles such as lineman postman and chairman which now commonly go by the gender neutral titles lineworker letter carrier and chairperson or chair as well as with terms having broader application such as humankind replacing mankind

People who participate in a sexual relationship between men with men or woman with woman are commonly called homosexual or Queer and the PC words being gay or lesbian is used The word queer is commonly used within the gay community to refer to others that are engaging in similar behavior

People who are mentally disabled are now rarely described as mentally retarded but may be said to have special needs MR has been changed to ID Intellectual Disabilities

People who are blind or deaf may be referred to as vision impaired and hearing impaired People who cannot speak are never dumb but mute or without speech

Some of the new politically correct words are often criticized for being rather ridiculous Some examples of these are the terms ending in challenged For example someone who is very short might be described as vertically challenged People also say that things that are obviously bad are called by something else which hides the fact that they are bad For example young people who are in trouble with the law instead of being called juvenile delinquents became children at risk Some PC terms may be ambiguous ie have two possible meanings Hearing impaired can also mean someone who is only partly deaf

Words alone cannot be good or bad It is the way they are used that determines whether people feel they are good or bad If one persons attitude towards another person is unkind then new politically correct terms will also start to sound offensive The important thing is to treat everyone with respect This is what PC tries to do

In Norse mythology Mjolnir is the war hammer of Thor the god of lightning thunder wind and rain 

Mjolnir is the most feared weapon of the Norse gods It was believed to be able to knock down giants and entire mountains with only one hit There are different stories about the war hammers origins Some say that the Black Elves made it when Loki asked them to Other stories say that it fell to earth like a meteorite Because of this many Norse followers believed that lightning strikes were a sign of Mjolnir on earth

Mjolnir was the symbol of regeneration It was not just about destruction 

When thrown Thors Hammer would return to his hand after hitting its target It is said that Mjolnir was used by Thor to slay Jrmungandr during Ragnark

He would be able to strike as firmly as he wanted whatever his aim and the hammer would never fail and if he threw it at something it would never miss and never fly so far from his hand that it would not find its way back and when he wanted it would be so small that it could be carried inside his tunic

An orphan is a child whose natural parents are absent or dead and who must be brought up in an orphanage or by foster parents

Sometimes parents get sick and die while their child or children are still young and if no close relatives take care of them if they cannot or will not do so they are normally raised in an orphanage When several children brothers or sisters are left orphaned they are normally split up one child going to one family or one child going to a foster family while another may stay in the orphanage 

Sometimes parents may not have jobs or money and abandon their children because they cannot afford to bring them up The parents may feel that if someone else brings them up they may have a better future in the long run

In many poor countries orphans are often seen wondering about begging for money and food many may not be going to school Not much organised help exists for them in poor countries 

But in richer countries many organisations and institutions help the orphans and work to help parents when they are sick or very poor so they do not abandon their children Organisations such as churches and community services assist them

Many characters of books and movies have been orphans such as Oliver Twist Annie Batman and Harry Potter

Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District is an opera by the Russian composer Dmitri Shostakovich It is one of the most important Russian operas of the 20th century The words for the opera were written by Alexander Preis who based them on a story by the Russian writer Nikolai Leskov The opera has nothing to do with Shakespeares play Macbeth except for the fact that it is about a woman who is tempted to commit a murder

Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District was the second opera that Shostakovich wrote It was first performed on 22 January 1934 at the Leningrad Maly Theatre  It was very successful and lots of people came to hear it

However Shostakovich lived in difficult times The dictator Josef Stalin was making life very difficult for creative people He thought that music and all the other arts should praise and glorify their country He did not allow people to express their own personal feelings Anything that he did not like was called formalist If Stalin did not like someone that person would not be allowed to work They might even get sent to prison in Siberia where they were treated very badly Many of them died

Stalin came to hear a performance of Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District However he did not like it and he left during the performance A few days later an article was written in the newspaper Pravda about the opera The article heading was Chaos instead of music It said that the opera was full of horrible music and noisy chords The opera was not allowed to be performed again in the Soviet Union for almost thirty years

Shostakovich had to be very careful what he said otherwise he could have been in big trouble He never spoke in public about music and culture In 1937 he wrote his Symphony no 5 The music in this symphony was easier to understand than the music he had been writing before which had a lot of atonal music Shostakovich said that this new symphony of his was a Soviet artists reply to just criticism He had to agree to say this so that he would be allowed to carry on composing Later in 1962 he made some changes to the opera and called it Katerina Ismailova  Since his death in 1975 it is usually the original version which is performed

The opera tells the story of a lonely woman in 19th century Russia who falls in love with one of her husbands servants and is driven to murder  Some of the music is influenced by Expressionism and verismo After being condemned by Stalin it was banned in the Soviet Union for almost thirty years

Katerina is lonely She is married to a merchant Zinovy but they have no children Her father in law Boris is horrible to her and blames her for not having any children When Zinovy goes away on business Boris forces her to swear to be faithful However one of the servants Sergei becomes her lover When Boris finds out he is furious and whips Sergei and locks him up Katerina poisons Boris with mushrooms When he dies she gets the key from his pocket and frees Sergei

Katerina and Sergei go to bed together but Katerina suffers from the ghost of Boris When Zinovy comes back Sergei hides but Zinovy guesses what has happened Katerina and Sergei kill Zinovy and hide his body in the cellar

Katerina and Sergei get married  A peasant finds Zinovys body in the cellar and goes to fetch the police The police arrive Katerina and Sergei try to escape but are caught and sent to prison in Siberia On the way there Sergei makes love to another girl Sonyetka When Katerina finds out she pushes Sonyetka into a river to her death and finally jumps in herself

It is hard to know why Stalin decided he did not like the opera It may have been because the police are made to look silly It may have been because it showed people being sent to Siberia Maybe it was because Katerina sings a lot of beautiful music while the other characters have music which often made them look stupid and grotesque He may have thought that Shostakovich was being critical of the leaders of the Soviet Union

Adoption is the act of adopting being adopted Adopt is to take into ones family especially by a formal legal act It can also mean the legal act of assuming parenthood of a child who is not ones own

In the West there are some doubts about the strength of family love for an adopted child Some research by the Evan Donaldson Institute shows more proof of this Almost one third of the people questioned believed adopted children were less controlled more ill and would easily be addicted to drug and alcohol Also 40 50 percent thought adoptees would probably have behavior problems at school But adoptive parents were described by almost 90 percent as lucky advantaged and unselfish

A border dispute is when two countries or more do not agree where border is between two countries An example is the State of Israel and Palestine Another example is Pakistan and the Republic of India over the territory of Kashmir

Wars are sometimes fought over border disputes

Ambiguity means something that can mean two different things Such things are ambiguous Sometimes the word is used to mean something that can mean several things or that is unclear In the proper sense it should mean two different meanings because ambi comes from the Greek word for two

Words or sentences that are ambiguous can lead to misunderstandings This can sometimes be serious but it can also be funny Jokes often rely on ambiguity

The sentence The peasants are revolting is ambiguous because it could mean

The British comedian Ronnie Barker said that he loved the English language because there are so many jokes you can make using ambiguity He gave this example 

A mother says to her little boy Johnny go over the road and see how old Mrs Jones is The boy comes back and says to his mother Mrs Jones says it is none of my business

The mother meant old in a friendly way but the sentence could also mean find out Mrs Joness age This is obviously how Johnny understood his mothers instruction

The opposite of ambiguous is unambiguous

Heavy metal is a loud aggressive style of rock music The bands who play heavy metal music usually have one or two guitars a bass guitar and drums In some bands electronic keyboards organs or other instruments are used Heavy metal songs are loud and powerful sounding and have strong rhythms that are repeated There are many different types of heavy metal some of which are described below

Heavy metal bands sometimes dress in jeans leather jackets and leather boots and have long hair Heavy metal bands sometimes behave in a dramatic way when they play their instruments or sing However many heavy metal bands do not like to do this

In the very late 1960s and 1970s rock and roll turned into a harder louder form of music called rock In the 1970s rock music bands played huge loud concerts in outdoor stadiums In the early 1970s many rock bands played psychedelic rock a type of rock music with lyrics and sounds that were intended to give the listener some idea of what it felt like to be on so called mind expanding drugs and which some believe even enhanced the experience of being on the drugs themselves Many bands from Britain played blues music mixed with rock music such as The Animals The Kinks The Who Jimi Hendrix the Jeff Beck Group

In the late 1960s a harder form of rock music called heavy metal was invented The first use of the term was in a 1968 song by Steppenwolf Born to be Wild and other early heavy metal bands appeared in the same year such as Blue Cheer Bands from Britain such as Cream and Led Zeppelin played loud heavy rock music based on blues music Heavy metal music was mostly based on the sounds of the electric guitar The electric guitar in heavy metal is always amplified through powerful amplifiers so that it has a loud distorted angry sound Other bands such Deep Purple Black Sabbath Judas Priest Eric Burdon and Alice Cooper played even louder harder forms of heavy metal rock music

Next the New Wave of British Heavy Metal came along This style of heavy metal includes bands such as Iron Maiden and Motrhead playing faster and with more anger in the music Heavy metal bands from the United States made heavy metal music popular in the late 1970s Bands such as Kiss Aerosmith and Van Halen put on large stadium concerts and attracted many fans

In the 1980s some heavy metal bands started a fashion trend called glam metal Bands such as Mtley Cre WASP and Ratt became popular Glam metal rock bands had long hair and the men wore make up and tight leather pants and boots Many glam metal songs were about sex illegal drug use and drinking alcohol In the late 1980s groups such as Poison and Warrant were very successful Glam metal is also known as hair metal

Another type of heavy metal in the 1980s was called thrash metal or thrash Thrash metal bands played a faster more aggressive type of heavy metal rock Thrash metal bands such as Metallica Megadeth Anthrax and Slayer had many fans

In the 1990s a new form of heavy metal developed called alternative metal Alternative metal combined thrash metal and grunge rock with hip hop music and industrial music Also in the 1990s was nu metal a shortening of new metal Nu metal mixed rap and hip hop style singing with metal music Nu metal bands also often include DJ decks synthesizers and other electronic instruments Nu metal was very successful and made a lot of money especially bands such as Linkin Park Limp Bizkit and Slipknot as well as Disturbed

Two other styles of heavy metal music death metal and black metal are very angry fast music A person who does not like heavy metal at all will have a much harder time listening to death metal or black metal because it is much faster louder and more aggressive than other types of music The singers usually do not sing but instead they growl or roar to make the songs more intense This makes it harder to hear the lyrics and most people are not used to singers who use their voice in this way The lyrics often tell stories from the view of people who are suffering and dying or people who are hurting others The guitars are usually distorted The drums also use very fast beats with double bass pedals

Other important styles of metal are power metal a style whose music often is about fiction and epics like The Lord of the Rings and gothic metal which has melancholy songs about abstract subjects like pain life death faith and religion

Meteor burst communication is a way of communicating using the ionized trails made by meteors as they enter the earths atmosphere It is also called Meteor scatter communication

Meteors are lumps of rock which are floating about in space There are always meteors which are entering the earths atmosphere They normally burn up in the atmosphere A few very large ones may hit the earth Most meteors are only tiny specks of dust As they enter the atmosphere they rip off electrons This produces an ionized trail This trail can reflect radio waves in the same way that a wire would

The meteorites that are used for meteor burst communication are between one thousandth and one hundredth of a gram Meteorites which are smaller than this are too weak to be used Meteorites which are larger than this are not frequent enough

The ionized trail can last for several seconds During this time messages can be sent between two radio communication stations The messages will be transmitted very fast about 200 times as fast as with ordinary radio communication A typewriter may type several lines of text during a meteor burst The two stations that want to communicate will have to keep in touch all the time as they never know when the next burst of communication will come They may have to wait for several meteor bursts before the whole message is received The transmitters are often put on buoys in the sea

Meteor burst communication was first widely used in the 1950s It was particularly useful for military use because the receiver could not tell exactly which direction the message had come from This was because the message was reflected on the way so it did not travel in a straight line

The use of satellite communication in recent years has meant that meteor burst communication is no longer as useful as it was

A vector space is a concept from mathematics A vector space is a collection of objects called vectors Two operations are defined addition of two vectors and multiplication of a vector with a scalar More formally a vector space is a special combination of a group and a field The elements of the group are called vectors and the elements of the field are called scalars

These vectors do not have to be vectors in the simplest sense For example they could be functions matrices or simply numbers So long as they obey the axioms of a vector space we can think of them as vectors and the theorems of linear algebra will apply to them

Often for example in Euclidean space a vector can be represented graphically with an arrow that has a tail and a head We normally then think of addition as the tail of one vector being placed at the same point as the head of the other vector The sum vector is the one whose tail is the tail of the first vector and whose head is the head of the second Multiplication means that one vector is made bigger or smaller

There are some combinations of vectors that are special A minimum set of vectors that through some combination of addition and multiplication can reach any point in the vector space is called a basis of that vector space It is true that every vector space has a basis It is also true that all bases of any one vector space have the same number of vectors in them This is called the dimension theorem We can then define the dimension of a vector space to be the size of its basis

Herbs are plants that are grown either as a food or because they have some use in treating diseases or for spiritual reasons Some herbs may act as an aphrodisiac

The word herb comes from the Latin word herba meaning grass green stalks or blades Botanists use the word to mean any plant with soft succulent tissues But many people use the word to mean only herbs with some economic value 

Herbs are small plants that have a fleshy or juicy stem when they are young The stems of some herbs develop hard woody tissue when they grow old 

Most herbs are perennials This means that the tops of the plants die each growing season but the roots remain alive and produce new plants year after year 

Some herbs are annuals They live for only one growing season and must be raised from seed each year 

The leaves stems or seeds of herbs can be used fresh or they can be dried for later use Dried herbs can be pounded to a fine powder placed in airtight containers and then stored

Some herbs are used in cooking to flavor foods Others give scents to perfumes Still others are used for medicines Some herbs such as balm and sage are valued for their leaves Saffron is picked for its buds and flowers Fennel seeds are valuable in relishes and seasoning Vanilla fruit pods yield vanilla flavoring Ginseng is valued for its aromatic roots 

People often grow herbs in their gardens Some people grow herb gardens for the patterned beds that they can create with these plants Many other gardeners grow herbs for the flavor that the fresh or dried plants add to food 

Herb seeds and seedlings are inexpensive and the plants grow easily People who do not have enough outdoor space for herb beds can grow most kinds of herbs in containers 

Many kinds of herbs can also be grown indoors The plants grow well with little care Gardeners plant herbs in good soil that has been well cultivated They choose a sunny spot near a window

The Woodstock Music and Art Festival was a rock music festival at Max Yasgurs 600 acre dairy farm in the town of Bethel New York from 15 August18 August 1969 It might be the most famous rock concert and festival ever held For many it showed the counterculture of the 1960s and the hippie era 

Many of the most famous musicians at the time showed up during the rainy weekend as can be seen in a 1970 movie Woodstock Joni Mitchells song Woodstock about the event also became a major hit song for Crosby Stills Nash Young In recent years a number of attempts were made to recreate it but the original Woodstock festival of 1969 has proven to be legendary

The festival was called Woodstock because it was supposed to be in the town of Woodstock in Ulster county but the town would not give a place for such a large event because they thought that over a million people would come A place was found in the town of Wallkill but when people who lived there were against it the event was almost cancelled Sam Yasgur persuaded his father Max to let the concert happen on the familys alfalfa field in Sullivan county about 40 miles southwest of Woodstock

Although the show was planned for as many as 200000 fans over 400000 came most of these did not pay to get in The roads to the concert were jammed with traffic People left their cars and walked for miles to get to the concert area The weekend was rainy and overcrowded and fans shared food alcoholic drinks and drugs Some people who lived there including those at nearby Camp Ma Ho Ge gave blankets and food to some concert goers

After two days of rain there was deep mud in many places There was almost no water for washing and not enough toilets Many of the concert goers had brought small tents to sleep in some of these turned into piles of cloth and mud Even though this may not have been the most comfortable place the crowd kept up kindness and good cheer among themselves As the half million people in the audience became aware of this a warm feeling of friendship spread to everyone 

The festival did not make any money at first but from the later record sales and the famous movie it did make money

Some of the music stars of Woodstock were The Who and Jimi Hendrix Because of arguments about getting paid The Who did not play on the stage until about 400 in the morning One part of The Whos show was the song See Me Feel Me when the sun rose just as lead singer Roger Daltrey started to sing the chorus When The Who was still playing Abbie Hoffman jumped on the stage stopping the show and tried to stir up the crowd with yippie slogans but he was knocked off the stage by the guitar of the bands leader Pete Townshend to the delight of the audience At the end of The Whos set Townshend slammed his guitar into the stage and threw it into the crowd This helped set up The Who as super stars and caused their album Tommy to sell multi platinum

Jimi Hendrix had a big show with the songs he played including a new version of The Star Spangled Banner The song caused some disagreements because the Vietnam War was going on and the sounds that Hendrix made with his guitar were like the sounds of the violence of the war Fans remember these two acts as some of the greatest in rock history although both The Who and Hendrix thought of their performances as not the best

Woodstock was put on by Michael Lang Artie Kornfeld John Roberts and Joel Rosenman Roberts was the financer backed by a trust fund his friend Rosenman a graduate of Yale Law was an amateur guitarist Their friends were Kornfeld vice president at Capitol Records and Michael Lang Lang was a light hearted hippie who had owned a wikipediahead shop and hoped to build a studio in the Woodstock area to serve singers such as Bob Dylan and Janis Joplin who had homes nearby When Lang and Kornfeld told the idea to Rosenman and Roberts Rosenman got the idea of a rock concert with the same musicians They picked the slogan Three Days of Peace and Music They hired artist Arnold Skolnick to design the artwork for the poster with the bird

In 1997 the concert place and 1400 surrounding acres were bought by Alan Gerry and have become the Bethel Woods Center for the Arts It opened on July 1 2006 with the New York Philharmonic playing On August 13 2006 Crosby Stills Nash Young amazed 16000 fans at the new Center  exactly 37 years after they played at Woodstock

It is found naturally in the minerals celestite and strontianite The 90Sr isotope is present in radioactive fallout and has a half life of 2890 years

The alkaline earth metals are a group of metals on the periodic table They are related to the Alkali metals but they do not react as much because they need more energy to remove their two electrons So they do not have to be stored in petrol As ions they have a charge of 2 The alkaline earth metals are silvered colored soft metals which react readily with halogens to form ionic salts and with water though not as rapidly as the alkali metals to form strongly alkaline hydroxides

The alkaline earth metals are beryllium magnesium calcium strontium barium and radium Radium is radioactive

My Belarusy is the official national anthem of Belarus The words of the anthem were created by two men Uladzimir Karyzny and Maxim Klimkovich The music for the anthem was created by Nyestar Sakalowski A few of the words and the music for the anthem were used before when Belarus was joined with the Soviet Union When Belarus became their own country in 1991 the music of the anthem was kept but the lyrics were never sung anymore This changed in 2002 when the leader of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko made an official rule saying that the words by Karyzny and Klimkovich will be used when singing with the music The words to the anthem are legally sung in the national language of Belarusian The title of the anthem put to the English language is We the Belarusians

The anthem is played for many events including the announcing and closing of television programming events where sports are played the new leadership given permission to run the country and during national celebrations

Yorkshire pudding is a British food It is usually served with roast meat and vegetables

Extraterrestrial life is life that is not from the planet Earth It is not known if there is any extraterrestrial life There is no proof that it exists though it is believed a large percentage of people believe in them

Most scientists believe that if extraterrestrial life exists its evolution would have happened in different places in the universe Others believe that life started on a small number of planets and spread to other planets

Extraterrestrial life forms are often referred to in popular culture as aliens or ETs and also sometimes martians although it should be used only when talking about aliens on Mars

In Arabic caliph means a successor to the prophet This is what leaders of the Islamic faith came to be called

Some of the early leaders of the Muslim community following Muhammads death called themselves Khalifat Allah meaning representative of God But the other title of Khalifat rasul Allah meaning the successor to the prophet of God became the common title Some academics write the term as Khalf

Caliphs were often also called Amr al Muminn leader of the Muslims This title has since been shortened to emir It is also found as a personal name in some countries

After the first four caliphs the title was used by the Umayyads the Abbasids and the Ottomans as well as by other dynasties in Southern Pakistan Spain Northern Africa and Egypt Most historical Muslim rulers simply titled themselves sultans or amirs and the caliph himself often had very little real authority The title was not used after the Republic of Turkey abolished the Ottoman caliphate in 1924

A false prophet is a person who claims to be a prophet but really is not In Christianity false prophets are thought of as being inspired by Satan or the Devil False prophets are the opposite of prophets False prophets try to deceive people and bring them away from god There are many false prophets in the Bible

Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac OM was an English physicist

Diracs father came from the French speaking part of Switzerland

Dirac worked out a formulation of quantum mechanics which includes Erwin Schrdingers wave mechanics and Werner Heisenbergs matrix mechanics in 1926 In 1928 he found the Dirac equation and he found out that spin in quantum mechanics is an effect of relativity The Dirac equation allowed Dirac to predict the existence of antimatter which is the opposite of matter

In 1933 he won the Nobel Prize for Physics

The literally heavenly sovereign is a symbol of the Japanese nation and the unity of its people He is the head of the Japanese Imperial Family The emperor is a ceremonial figurehead in a constitutional monarchy that means he does not have any political power In world politics he is the only reigning emperor 

The current emperor is His Imperial Majesty the Emperor Akihito He has been on the Chrysanthemum Throne since his father Emperor Shwa died in 1989

The amount of power belonging to the emperor of Japan has changed a lot throughout Japanese history The role of the emperor of Japan has alternated between that of a cleric with mostly symbolic powers and that of an actual ruler Some believe that the emperor is descended from gods Until 1945 the Japanese monarchs were always the leaders of the military

Since the mid 1800s the Imperial Palace has been located on the former site of Edo Castlein the heart of Tokyo Earlier emperors lived in Kyoto for nearly eleven centuries

The imperial dynasty that rules Japan today began as a local kingship in Central Japan in the 500s It slowly increased its power over its neighbors This led to a more centralized state made up of almost all of the central areas of what is now Japan The remote areas were outside its borders

The emperors role is defined in Chapter I of the 1947 Constitution of Japan 

The emperor of Japan has no reserve powers

While the emperor does serve as head of state many people question if the emperor is a true monarch in a political sense Efforts in the 1950s by conservative powers to change the constitution to actually name the emperor as head of state were rejected Regardless the emperor does do all the diplomatic functions of a head of state and is recognized as one by foreign powers

Succession is now controlled by laws passed by the Japanese Diet The current law does not let females take the throne A change to this law was considered until Princess Kiko gave birth to a son 

Until the birth of a son to Prince Akishino on September 6 2006 there was a potential succession problem No male child had been born into the imperial family since Prince Akishino in 1965 Following the birth of Princess Aiko some felt they needed to change the current Imperial Household Law to allow women to succeed to the throne In January 2005 Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi created a group of judges university professors and civil servants to study the problem 

On October 25 2005 they recommended changing the law to allow females of the male line of imperial descent to ascend the Japanese throne On January 20 2006 Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi made an announcement that they would change the law to allow women to ascend the throne However after finding out that Princess Kiko was pregnant with her third child Koizumi decided to wait Her son Prince Hisahito is the third in line to the throne under the current law of succession

Naming the emperors of Japan is difficult because of differences between Japan and the Western world The Japanese use name tenn or Kinj Heika for the current one Problems occur because emperors are named name tenn after their death 

Some Japanese once thought it was rude to call a person of noble rank by their given names This belief is not commonly followed today but still used for the imperial family The current emperor on the throne is almost always referred to simply as Tenn Heika or formally as Kinj Heika 

In English the recent emperors are called by their personal names

For example the previous emperor is usually called Hirohito in English but after his death he was renamed Shwa Tenn and is now only called by this name in Japanese However when he was in power he was never called Hirohito or Shwa Tenn in Japanese Rather he was simply called Tenn Heika

A pipe is a tool that people use to smoke tobacco and other drugs Pipe smokers do not usually breathe in the smoke They let it go into their mouths and then exhale it Pipe smoking is not a healthy alternative to cigarette smoking

Tobacco pipes are used to smoke tobacco In some Middle Eastern countries people smoke tobacco with water pipes which cool the smoke in water Different types of pipes are also used to smoke marijuana hashish and crack cocaine Some people who smoke marijuana or hashish use a special water pipe called a bong

Native American tobacco pipes had two parts a stone bowl and a wooden stem Japanese kiseru pipes have a metal bowl and mouth piece with a wooden stem Arabian midwakh pipes may be made from different materials European tobacco pipes have been made from clay tree root wood meerschaum stone or even maize cobs

Pipes to smoke opium may have clay or metal bowls with a wooden stem Pipes for marijuana or hashish may be metal wood or glass Pipes to smoke other drugs may also be made of glass

Pipes were first used by Native Americans in religious ceremonies When the English came to North America they tried pipe smoking and liked it They sent tobacco back to England 

Thomas Tallis was the almost important English composer of his generation

We know very little about Talliss youth He may have started his career as organist at Dover and then Waltham Abbey After the Dissolution of the monasteries he had a job at Canterbury Cathedral for a short time but he was soon made a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal and he had a job in the royal household until his death working for four monarchs Henry VIII Edward VI Mary Tudor and Elizabeth I

Tallis was organist and composer He had to write music for the royal chapels He was given the lease of a big house in Kent and a salary of 91 12s a year which was a very good salary in those days In 1575 Queen Elizabeth I gave Thomas Tallis and William Byrd a licence which meant they were the only people allowed to print and publish music in England  Tallis owned a house in Greenwich were he died in 1585

In the early 16th century church music was often very polyphonic voices imitated one another and sang different things at the same time However tastes were changing and Tallis wrote church music which was much simpler  In a lot of his music the choir sing chords homophony homophonic writing instead of using the older polyphony For a short time during the reign of the Catholic Mary Tudor polyphonic music was in fashion again This was the time when Tallis wrote an antiphon Gaude gloriosa Dei mater and a mass musical settingmass Puer natus est nobis These two works are once more very complicated polyphonic works After that his works become simpler once more but he was always keen to try out new ideas from the continent of Europe He wrote some very fine anthems Many of his works are settings of Latin words but he also made settings of English texts

One of his most beautiful works is called Spem in Alium The choir divide into forty parts ie the choir need at least 40 people to sing it and even then everybody would be singing a different line It is possible that he wrote it for Queen Elizabeth Is 40th birthday in 1573 but we cannot be sure

His Diliges Dominum is a collection of contrapuntal exercises which includes a very famous canon often simply called Talliss canon

Homophony means music in which the voices or instruments sing or play chords In homophonic music all the choir are singing the same words at the same time There is a tune on top and the lower parts are the accompaniment This is what happens in hymn singing The opposite is polyphony Polyphonic writing is more complicated the choir sing different melodic lines at the same time The terms homophony and polyphony are mostly used for choir music

In homophonic music it is easy to hear the words that are being sung In polyphonic music it is much harder for the listener to understand the words Composers often used polyphony when writing music for the mass because everyone knew the words anyway Homophonic music became more important when composers started to write operas and madrigals where a story is being told and the words must be heard clearly 

Technetium is a chemical element It has the chemical symbol Tc It has the atomic number 43 The color of technetium is silvery grey It is radioactive It is a crystaline metal In chemistry it is placed in a group of metal elements named the transition metals The chemistry of technetium is somewhere between rhenium and manganese

The isotope 99mTc is used in nuclear medicine It is used for many diagnostic tests It has a short half life 99Tc is used as a source of beta particles without emitting gamma rays The ion that has oxygen and technetium bonded together is named the pertechnetate ion The pertechnetate ion could be used as to prevent anodic corrosion in steel

Monasteries are places where monks live Although the word monastery is sometimes used for a place where nuns live nuns usually live in a convent or nunnery The word abbey is also used for a Christian monastery or convent The monk in charge of an abbey is called an abbot the nun in charge of an abbey is an abbess

Several religions have a system of monasteries Christian monasteries have a chapel for the monks to worship Monks are not allowed to marry They are also not allowed to own anything Everything they use including their clothes belongs to the monastery During the Dark Ages after the Roman Empire was defeated monasteries were some of the few places where knowledge still existed

Some monasteries were built in places far away from where other people lived The monks who live there live very isolated lives growing their own food and looking after one another Other monasteries were in or near towns Monks do a lot of work in the community including as teaching medical care or telling people about God Few monks live isolated lives nowadays

Alexander Lukashenko is the leader of the country of Belarus He has been the leader since 1994 He was the first leader of the country to be chosen by Belarus citizens Before becoming the leader he belonged to the law making section of the government He was also in the military of the Soviet Union and ran a factory that made things to help farming

A shelf is a piece of furniture that is used for storing items

It could also mean

The throat is a part of the body The throat is connected to the mouth at the top and to the stomach at the bottom The throat is where food travels after being eaten and chewed by the teeth Fluid drinks such as water also travel through the throat to the stomach and on to the rest of the body

The word safe has more than one meaning 

Gelatin or Jelly is a dessert item Gelatin can come in different taste choices or flavors depending on what fruit or artificial flavor Jelly is a cold and solid food that is normally made from hot water and powder

Depending on where you live gelatin may be called different things In the United States and Canada jelly is often called Jell OJell O is a brand of gelatin that has become a generic or typical name for a lot of gelatin Like the United States in Canada Jell O is a normal name for gelatin In Commonwealth Nations like the United Kingdom and New Zealand almost all gelatin is called jelly Also it is spelled gelatine

Sometimes alcohol is added to jelly You can make jello shots with almost any type of alcohol Jello shots can be served in small glasses and can be any color depending on the other ingredients put into the Jell O shot The jello shot is also known as the poison rainbow

Biogeography is the study of how species are distributed It aims to show where organisms live and why they are found in a certain geographical area

The basic issue is that animals and plants are adapted to the places they live in but similar places often have quite different animals and plants One might expect to find for example that the animals in a tropical rain forest would be almost the same in Amazonia equatorial Africa and Southeast Asia But that is not the case

There must be reasons for this situation Those reasons are the subject of research in biogeography At first from about 18001855 natural historians made lists of species in various regions of the world These lists were published as tables in their books A revolution started with Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace who published the idea of evolution by natural selection They had travelled in tropical countries and wrote about the life in those countries They said that evolution was the key to understanding geographical distribution

New species usually come about by an earlier species splitting in two speciation This takes place at a certain time and place From that place the new species may travel It will be blocked by geographical features and by climate Thus a species may never get to other places where it might be a great success That in general is the reason why lands with similar climate often have quite different animals and plants Classic examples are Australian marsupials and the Great American Interchange

Of course different types of animals and plants have different mobility It is easier for birds and insects to travel by flight and in the sea fish can easily travel All the same there are limits Fish on either side of the Americas are usually different species and fresh water fish do not disperse much So it comes about that

The scientific theory of biogeography grows out of the work of Alexander von Humboldt Hewett Cottrell Watson Alphonse de Candolle Alfred Russel Wallace Philip Lutley Sclater and other biologists and explorers 

Wallace studied the distribution of flora and fauna in the Amazon Basin and the Malay Archipelago in the mid 19th century Wallace and Sclater saw biogeography as a source of support for the theory of evolution Key findings such as the sharp difference in fauna either side of the Wallace Line can only be understood in this light Otherwise the field of biogeography would be a purely descriptive one

Both Darwin and Wallace gave a great deal of attention to oceanic islands as offering examples of evolution especially speciation This interest was revived by The theory of island biogeography by Robert MacArthur and EO Wilson in 1967 They showed that the species richness of an area could be predicted if one knew the habitat area immigration rate and extinction rate 

Also it was realised that habitat fragments are rather like islands They can be investigated by the same methods This spurred the development of conservation biology

Genome analysis allows scientists to test theories about the origin and dispersal of populations such as island species It allows biologists to test theories about where the species come from

Biophysics is a science where the laws of physics are used to study biology the science on life and living things Unlike biochemistry and molecular biology sciences where macromolecules or large groups of molecules are studied biophysicists study single or small groups of molecules 

A macromolecule is a molecule with a large number of atoms The word is usually used only when describing polymers molecules which are made up of smaller molecules called monomers All organic monomers are based on carbon usually with hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen There are inorganic macromolecules based on other monomers

Examples 

Dendrology is the science of trees and other woody plants such as shrubs or lianas The word dendrology comes from Greek words meaning tree and meaning study

Entomology is the science of insects People who study insects are called entomologists Insects have been studied since prehistoric times but it was not until as early as the 16th century that insects were scientifically studied

Some entomologists study how insects are related to each other Others study how insects live and reproduce because we do not know very much about some kinds of insects Other entomologists study ways to keep insects away from crops that people use for food There are billions of unknown species throughout the world and taxonomists categorize the newly found

Entomologists meet to talk about their study of insects and to share ideas just as all scientists do

Ethology is the scientific study of animal behaviour and a sub topic of zoology The term was first popularized in English by the American myrmecologist William Morton Wheeler in 1902 

The study of animal behaviour which had been going on in an anecdotal way since Aristotle was transformed during the twentieth century Studies by Charles Otis Whitman Oskar Heinroth and Julian Huxley began to set a new tone This work was mostly on bird behaviour especially mating behaviour

The next generation began during the 1930s with the work of Austrian biologists Konrad Lorenz and Karl von Frisch and the Dutch biologist Niko Tinbergen The three men were joint winners of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for 1973

Lorenz is famous for his longitudinal studies he lived with the animals he researched and made observations throughout their lives Then he wrote about what he had discovered in long very readable papers He researched instinctual behaviour which he called fixed action patterns Lorenz popularized FAPs as instinctive responses that would occur reliably in the presence of specific stimuli von Frisch worked on communication in honey bees the famous bee dances Tinbergen experimented with the stimuli which trigger fixed action patterns He found out that artificial super stimuli could often work better than the natural stimuli

Ethology is a combination of laboratory and field science with a strong relation to certain other disciplines eg neuroanatomy ecology evolution Ethologists are typically interested in a behavioural process rather than in a particular animal group and often study one type of behaviour in a number of unrelated animals

In the 1960s Nico Tinbergen set out a framework for research on behaviour It involved four questions and their answers

The only scientific explanation for an animals behaviour is that it is well adapted for survival and reproduction in its environment A trait is the result of its past contribution to survival In practice this is simple For instance birds fly south in the winter to find food and warmth and mammalian mothers nurture their young thereby having more surviving offspring

Phylogeny explains why some adaptation is less than perfect From where it is there are always some possibilities which a particular species can never get to This is because all stages in evolution must be viable else extinction occurs

Another reason is that not all traits of a species can be maximised at the same time Increase in armour for example is bound to slow down movement Teeth which are best for vegetation are much less good for meat The final result is a set of traits most of which are sub optimal

Earlier phylogenetic stages and conditions which persist often determine the form of more modern characteristics For instance the vertebrate eye has a blind spot whereas octopus eyes do not Once the vertebrate eye had evolved the only way it could improve was to minimise the effect of the blind spot We dont notice it ordinarily because with binocular vision what one eye misses the other fills in

All instances of behaviour require an explanation at each of these four levels For example the function of eating is to acquire nutrients but the immediate cause of eating is hunger Hunger and eating are evolutionarily ancient and are found in many species and develop early within an organisms lifespan It is easy to confuse such questions for example to argue that people eat because theyre hungry and not to acquire nutrients without realizing that the reason people experience hunger is because it causes them to acquire nutrients

Henry III became King of England in 1216 when he was less than ten years old He continued to be king for 56 years until he died in 1272 He was married to Eleanor of Provence

ThomasEarl of Norfolk

Edward I also Longshanks and the Hammer of the Scots was a Plantagenet King of England

He became king on 21 November 1272 until his death in 1307 His mother was Queen Eleanor of Provence and his father was King Henry III of England 

As a younger man Edward fought against Simon de Montfort in defence of his fathers crown He went on a Crusade and his father died as Edward was on his way back As a ruler he improved the laws and made Parliament regular and more important He conquered Wales and subdued the Welsh by brutal policies He was determined to control Scotland through puppet kings and just managed to do it during his lifetime He expelled the Jewish people from England

Edward was born at Westminster in June 1239 He had a good education This was because his parents loved the arts especially his mother He was carefully taught in Latin and French

In 1254 English fears of a Castilian invasion of the English province of Gascony induced Edwards father to arrange a marriage between his fourteen year old son and Eleanor the half sister of King Alfonso X of Castile 

Eleanor and Edward were married on 1 November 1254 in Castile As part of the marriage agreement the young prince got grants of land worth 15000 marks a year Though the endowments King Henry made were sizable they offered Edward little independence He had received Gascony as early as 1249 but Simon de Montfort 6th Earl of Leicester as royal lieutenant he drew the income In practice Edward derived neither authority nor revenue from this province The grant he received in 1254 included most of Ireland and much land in Wales and England including the earldom of Chester but the king kept control over the land particularly in Ireland so Edwards power was limited there as well and the king got most of the income from those lands 

The years 12641267 saw the conflict known as the Second Barons War in which baronial forces led by Simon de Montfort fought against those who remained loyal to the king The first scene of battle was the city of Gloucester which Edward managed to retake from the enemy When Robert de Ferrers Earl of Derby came to the assistance of the rebels Edward negotiated a truce with the earl the terms of which he later broke Edward then captured Northampton from de Montforts son also Simon The baronial and royalist forces finally met at the Battle of Lewes on 14 May 1264 Edward commanding the right wing performed well and soon defeated the London contingent of de Montforts forces Unwisely however he followed the scattered enemy in pursuit and on his return found the rest of the royal army defeated By the agreement known as the Mise of Lewes Edward and his cousin Henry of Almain were given up as prisoners to de Montfort

Edward remained in captivity until March and even after his release he was kept under strict surveillance Meanwhile de Montfort used his victory to set up a de facto government He even summoned the Parliament of 1265 known as de Montforts Parliament

Then on 28 May 1265 Edward managed to escape his custodians and joined up with the Earl of Gloucester who had recently defected to the kings side Montforts support was now dwindling and Edward retook Worcester and Gloucester with relatively little effort Meanwhile Montfort had made an alliance with Llywelyn and started moving east to join forces with his son Simon

Edward managed to make a surprise attack at Kenilworth Castle before moving on to cut off the earl of Leicester

The two forces then met at the second great encounter of the Barons War the Battle of Evesham on 4 August 1265 Montfort stood little chance against the superior royal forces and after his defeat he was killed and mutilated on the field

The war did not end with Montforts death and Edward continued campaigning At Christmas he came to terms with the younger Simon de Montfort and his associates at the Isle of Axholme in Lincolnshire In March he led a successful assault on the Cinque Ports A contingent of rebels held out in the virtually impregnable Kenilworth Castle and did not surrender until the drafting of the conciliatory Dictum of Kenilworth In April it seemed as if Gloucester would take up the cause of the reform movement and civil war would resume but after a renegotiation of the terms of the Dictum of Kenilworth the parties came an agreement Edward however was little involved in the settlement negotiations following the wars at this point his main focus was on planning his upcoming crusade

Edward took the crusaders cross in an elaborate ceremony on 24 June 1268 with his brother Edmund and cousin Henry of Almain Among others who committed themselves to the Ninth Crusade were some of Edwards former adversaries There was great difficulty raising funds for the expedition

Originally the Crusaders intended to relieve the beleaguered Christian stronghold of Acre but before they could do this several disasters happened to the French The French forces were struck by an epidemic which on 25 August took the life of King Louis himself By the time Edward arrived at Tunis Charles had already signed a treaty with the emir and there was little else to do but return to Sicily The crusade was postponed until next spring but a devastating storm off the coast of Sicily dissuaded Charles of Anjou and Louiss successor Philip III from any further campaigning 

Edward decided to continue alone and on 9 May 1271 he finally landed at Acre By then the situation in the Holy Land was a precarious one Jerusalem had fallen in 1244 and Acre was now the centre of the Christian area The Muslim states were on the offensive under the Mamluk leadership of Baibars and were now threatening Acre itself An embassy to the Mongols helped bring about an attack on Aleppo in the north which helped to distract Baibars forces 

In November Edward led a raid on Qaqun which could have served as a bridgehead to Jerusalem but both the Mongol invasion and the attack on Qaqun failed Things now seemed increasingly desperate Finally an attack by a Muslim assassin in June forced him to abandon any further campaigning Although he managed to kill the assassin he was struck in the arm by a dagger feared to be poisoned and became severely weakened over the following months

It was not until 24 September that Edward left Acre Arriving in Sicily he was met with the news that his father had died on 16 November Edward was deeply saddened by this news but rather than hurrying home at once he made a leisurely journey northwards The political situation in England was stable after the mid century upheavals and Edward was proclaimed king at his fathers death rather than at his own coronation as had until then been customary In Edwards absence the country was governed by a royal council led by Robert Burnell The new king embarked on an overland journey through Italy and France where among other things he visited the pope in Rome and suppressed a rebellion in Gascony Only on 2 August 1274 did he return to England and was crowned on 19 August

Edwards reign had two main phases The first phase was administration of a now peaceful country The second phase was warfare against Wales and Scotland

His first concern was to restore order and re establish royal authority after the disastrous reign of his father To do this he changed the administrators He appointed Robert Burnell as chancellor who held the post until his death in 1292 Edward then replaced most local officials such as the sheriffs This was done to prepare for an inquiry which would hear complaints about abuse of power by royal officers Laws were made to define rights about ownership of land recovery of debts trade and local peacekeeping 

Edward reformed English Parliament and made it a source for generating revenue Edward held Parliament regularly in his reign In 1295 a significant change occurred For this Parliament in addition to the lords two knights from each county and two representatives from each borough were summoned Before the commons had been expected simply to assent to decisions already made by the rulers Now they would meet with the full authority of their communities to give assent to decisions made in Parliament The king now had full backing for collecting lay subsidies from the entire population Lay subsidies were taxes collected at a certain fraction of the moveable property of all laymen Historians have called this the Model Parliament

Llywelyn ap Gruffudd was the main Welsh leader He refused to do homage to Edward and married Eleanor the daughter of Simon de Montfort In November 1276 war was declared Initial operations were launched under the captaincy of Mortimer Edmund Crouchback and the Earl of Warwick Support for Llywelyn was weak among his own countrymen 

In July 1277 Edward invaded with a force of 15500 of whom 9000 were Welshmen The campaign never came to a major battle and Llywelyn soon realised he had no choice but to surrender By the Treaty of Aberconwy in November 1277 he was left only with the land of Gwynedd though he was allowed to retain the title of Prince of Wales

When war broke out again in 1282 it was entirely different For the Welsh this war was over national identity It had wide support especially after attempts to impose English law on Welsh subjects For Edward it became a war of conquest The war started with a rebellion by Dafydd who was discontented with the reward he had received from Edward in 1277 Llywelyn and other Welsh chieftains soon joined in and initially the Welsh experienced military success The Welsh advances ended on 11 December however when Llywelyn was lured into a trap and killed at the Battle of Orewin Bridge The conquest was complete with the capture in June 1283 of Dafydd who was taken to Shrewsbury and executed as a traitor next autumn

Further rebellions occurred in 12878 and in 1294 In both cases the rebellions were put down By the 1284 Statute of Rhuddlan Wales was incorporated into England and was given an administrative system like the English with counties policed by sheriffs 

English law was introduced in criminal cases though the Welsh were allowed to maintain their own laws in some cases of property disputes After 1277 and increasingly after 1283 Edward embarked on a full scale project of English settlement of Wales He created new towns like Flint Aberystwyth and Rhuddlan 

Edward started a big program of building castles to keep the Welsh under control His castles started the widespread use of arrowslits in castle walls across Europe drawing on Eastern influences Also a product of the Crusades was the introduction of the concentric castle and four of the eight castles Edward founded in Wales followed this design 

In 1284 King Edwards son Edward the later Edward II was born at Caernarfon Castle In 1301 at Lincoln the young Edward became the first English prince to be invested with the title of Prince of Wales

Scotland and England were at peace in the 1280s Alexander III of Scotland and Edward had an understanding whereby Alexander held land in England This gave him the excuse to acknowledge Edward as his lord and left ambiguous whether or not this applied to Scotland as well

The heir to the throne was his granddaughter Margaret Unfortunately Alexander died in 1286 followed by young Margaret in 1290 This left Scotland without a king which started all the problems

There were fourteen claimants John Balliol and Robert de Brus had the best cases The competitors agreed to hand over the realm to Edward until a decision was made John Balliol was chosen in 1292

Edward continued to push his claim as overlord of Scotland He interferred in some of the legal affairs of Scotland and insisted the Scots provided military service in his army This caused the Scots to make an alliance with France They then attacked Carlisle 

Edward responded by invading Scotland in 1296 and taking the town of Berwick in a particularly bloody attack At the Battle of Dunbar Scottish resistance was effectively crushed Edward confiscated the Stone of Destiny the Scottish coronation stone and brought it to Westminster deposed Balliol and placed him in the Tower of London and installed Englishmen to govern the country The campaign had been a very successful but the English triumph would only be temporary

Although the Scottish conflict seemed settled in 1296 it was started again by William Wallace who came from one of the notable families Wallace was a warlord rather than a politician and soon started a rebellion He defeated a large English force at Stirling Bridge in 1297 while Edward was in Flanders In 1298 Edward defeated Wallace at the Battle of Falkirk After that the Scots avoided open battle in favour of raiding England with small groups

Edwards next move was political in 1303 a peace agreement was made between England and France breaking up the Franco Scottish alliance Robert de Brus and most of the other nobles pledged allegiance to Edward Wallace was betrayed and handed to the English He was publicly executed 

The situation changed again in 1306 when de Brus murdered his rival John Comyn and had himself crowned King of Scotland by Isobel sister of the Earl of Buchan Edward in ill health sent armies north under other commanders Brus was beaten at the Battle of Methven in June 1306 Edward followed this with brutal suppression of the allies of the Brus This in turn fuelled more rebellion This conflict was still in progress when Edward died in 1307

Eleanor of Castile died on 28 November 1290 Unusual for such marriages the couple loved each other Edward was deeply affected by her death He erected twelve Eleanor crosses one at each place where her funeral cortge stopped for the night As part of the peace accord between England and France in 1294 it was agreed that Edward should marry the French princess Margaret The marriage took place in 1299

Edward and Eleanor had at least fourteen children perhaps as many as sixteen Of these five daughters survived into adulthood but only one boy outlived Edward the future King Edward II

Edward was concerned with his sons failure to live up to expectations and at one point exiled the princes favourite Piers Gaveston Edward may have known his son was bisexual but he did not throw Gaveston from the castle battlements as shown in Braveheart

A cell nucleus is the part of the cell which contains the genetic code the DNA and the RNA It also controls the activities in a cell The nucleus is small and round and it works as the cells control center It contains x shaped duffel bags called chromosomes and inside the chromosomes are DNA strands The human body contains billions of cells which vary from blood cells that carry oxygen from one part of the body to another nerve cells which create reactions that stimulate feelings and data and skin cells that protect the cells underneath

Some animals consist of only one cell with the same basic materials as multi cellular organisms 

Cell nuclei are only found in eukaryotes They were first found by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in the 17th century Bacteria and Archaea are single celled organisms of quite a different type they are prokaryotes and their cells do not have nuclei or membrane bound organelle

Scotland Yard is a police force in the United Kingdom This organisation is also called the Metropolitan Police They are responsible for the security in Greater London With over 31000 officers Scotland Yard is the largest task force in the United Kingdom A particularity is that some policemen are on a horse New Scotland Yard is in a 20 story office block on Broadway and Victoria Street in Westminster about 450 metres away from the Houses of Parliament The famous rotating sign which is seen on television and in films is outside the main doors on Broadway

Founded on 29 September 1829 on a street off Whitehall Scotland Yard was called New Scotland Yard when moved in November 18901 to the Victoria Embankment beside the Ministry of Defence In 1967 New Scotland Yard moved to the present 20 story building at 10 Broadway

Antimony is a chemical element It has the chemical symbol Sb The symbol Sb is from the Latin name of stibium for the element It has the atomic number 51 Its atomic mass is 1218 It is a blue gray element that is somewhat toxic

Antimony has four allotropes The common allotrope of antimony is a blue white metalloid It looks black when powdered It is brittle soft and shiny Yellow and black antimony are unstable nonmetals Yellow antimony is only found at very cold temperatures It is made by oxidation of stibine It turns into black antimony when light is shined on it or when it is warmer Black antimony is normally made by heating metallic antimony until it boils and then cooling the vapors very quickly It can ignite spontaneously It also corrodes easily There is another explosive form of antimony that is made by electrolysis of antimony trichloride This antimony explodes when changing into the metallic form There is no chemical reaction the atoms in the antimony crystal are rearranging themselves When antimony is talked about it normally means the blue white metalloid form since it is most common

Antimony is found as two stable isotopes naturally

Antimony is a rather unreactive element It does not dissolve in acids easily It can dissolve in oxidizing acids like nitric or sulfuric acid It does not corrode easily in air although the black allotrope can corrode Antimony burns in air to make antimony trioxide In excess air it burns to antimony tetroxide

Antimony forms chemical compounds in three oxidation states 3 3 and 5 3 compounds are called antimonides They are made by reacting antimony with other metals They react with acids to make the toxic and unstable gas stibine 3 compounds are the most common They are weak oxidizing agents They are somewhat covalent having low melting points Antimony trichloride is a colorless and soft solid that has a strong odor Antimony trioxide is a white solid that dissolves a little in water The other antimony halides all react with water except for antimony trifluoride 5 compounds are strong oxidizing agents Antimony pentafluoride is highly reactive as well as antimony pentoxide FileAntimony trioxidejpgAntimony trioxide FileAntimony trifluoridejpgAntimony trichloride FileSulfid antimonitJPGAntimony sulfide 

Antimony sulfide was known for a long time Some things plated with antimony and made out of antimony were found in Egypt and Chaldea The first time antimony was mentioned in Europe was in the 1540 The first native antimony was found in Sweden in 1783 Antimony sulfide and antimony were confused sometimes in antiquity There is a question over what stibium the original name of antimony meant

Antimony is not common It is found about as often as thallium It is quite easy to get though and is in many minerals Antimony is sometimes found as an element but normally it is found as stibnite an antimony sulfide mineral Stibnite is the main ore of antimony China is the biggest maker of antimony it makes 84 of all antimony Other countries that make antimony are South Africa Bolivia and Tajikistan Antimony is not used in the human body

Antimony is made from stibnite by heating it with air This makes antimony trioxide Since it gets so hot the antimony trioxide is evaporated Other metal oxides in the stibnite ore do not evaporate The antimony trioxide gas is condensed in a container The antimony trioxide is then heated with carbon to make carbon dioxide and antimony Another way to make antimony is to heat stibnite with scrap iron This makes iron sulfide and antimony The antimony is separated and used

About half of all antimony is used to make antimony trioxide for flame proofing 

It makes an alloy with lead This alloy 5 antimony and 95 lead is harder than pure lead It is used in lead acid batteries as well as some other things It is used as an alloy with lead in the pipes of pipe organs Pewter has antimony in it Some lead free solder has antimony in it It is used as an alloy with lead in ammunition for small arms and in covering of cables as well It is also used in some alloys that have very little friction like Babbitt metal 

Another use is in a catalyst for making some plastics Antimony oxide is added to some glass to remove bubbles for things like television screens Antimony is used as a dopant in electronics Some antimony compounds were used as medicines to kill protozoans The antimony pill was a chunk of antimony that was supposed to heal diseases It is used in medicines for pets Antimony sulfide is used in matches

Antimony is toxic Its toxicity is similar to arsenic although it is less toxic than arsenic Breathing in antimony dust can be very dangerous Antimony reacts with strong oxidizing agents Small amounts of antimony come out of plastic bottles where antimony was used as a catalyst Some people were concerned that too much antimony was coming out

Buckingham Palace is the main residence of the British Monarch and is in the centre of London England It was built by John Sheffield 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby in 1703

It was bought by the British royal family in 1761 and became the official London home of the family in 1837 It is owned by the State

Buckingham Palace has 775 rooms and is one of few working palaces in the world

The 2008 Summer Olympics officially known as the Games of the XXIX Olympiad were celebrated in Beijing Peoples Republic of China from August 8 to August 24 The opening ceremony began at 080808 pm CST at the Beijing National Stadium in Beijing Peoples Republic of China During the games 10500 athletes will be competing in 302 events in 28 sports This is one event more than what was on the schedule of the 2004 games

The Olympic games were awarded to Beijing after a vote of the International Olympic Committee on July 13 2001 The official logo of the games titled Dancing Beijing features a stylised calligraphic character jng meaning the host city The mascots of Beijing 2008 are the five Fuwa each representing both a colour of the Olympic rings and a symbol of Chinese culture The Olympic slogan One World One Dream calls upon the world to unite in the Olympic spirit Several new NOCs have also been recognised by the IOC

The Chinese government used the games to promote China as an important and powerful country and spent a lot of money on building new facilities and transportation systems for the games The events were held in 37 places including 12 newly built buildings In 2007 former IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch said that he thinks that the Beijing games will be the best in Olympic history Although there was been some controversy about having the games in China the IOCs current president Jacques Rogge says that the IOC has absolutely no regrets in choosing Beijing to host the 2008 games

At the end of the Olympics China won the total gold medal count while the United States led the grand total medal count

Here is the top of the medal table at the end of the games

Medal numbers shown in bold are the highest in their section China the host nation is highlighted in lavender

Pierre de Fermat was a French lawyer at the Parlement of Toulouse southern France and a mathematician Many people see him as the father of modern calculus 

His method of finding the biggest and smallest ordinates of curved lines also makes him a contributor to differential calculus which was not known at that time His studies in the theory of numbers give him the rank of the founder of the modern theory He also made notable contributions to analytic geometry and probability

He is also famous for making a simple mathematical statement that he said he could prove but he never wrote down his proof Mathematicians tried to prove it for hundreds of years before finally managing it Fermat probably did not really have a proof for this theorem and only thought he did

He was taught law and philosophy He served as factotum to two major German noble houses Leibniz played a major role in the European politics and diplomacy of his day 

In philosophy he is most remembered for optimism His conclusion is that our universe is in a restricted sense the best possible one God could have made He was one of the great 17th century rationalists Many people see Ren Descartes and Baruch Spinoza as the other two His philosophy also both looks back to the Scholastic tradition and anticipates modern logic and analysis

Leibniz also made major contributions to physics and technology and anticipated notions that surfaced much later in biology medicine geology probability theory psychology and information science He also wrote on politics law ethics theology history and philology Sometimes he even wrote in verse His contributions to this vast array of subjects are scattered in journals and in tens of thousands of letters and unpublished manuscriptsAs of 2006 there is no complete edition of Leibnizs writings and a complete account of his accomplishments is not yet possible

Optimism is a philosophy and a way of life Optimists believe that the world is generally a positive place to be in In the view of an optimist people and things are good In their view things will work out in the end 

The opposing theory is called pessimism Gottfried Leibnitz was a famous optimist Arthur Schopenhauer is often considered to be a famous pessimist

Optimism is associated with the idea of a glass looking half full instead of looking Half empty

Pessimism is a philosophy and a way to see things in life Pessimists believe that generally things are bad and the world people live in is the worst possible world In philosophy pessimism often describes the ideas of Arthur Schopenhauer

Someone who uses the philosophy is called a pessimist they are the opposite of an optimist

An example of pessimism is seeing that a glass of water is half empty not half full

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints is the largest group in the Mormon movement It was started in 1830 in New York by Joseph Smith They believe that Joseph Smith was a prophet who restored the church Jesus Christ set up on earth when he was alive They teach that they are the only church that has the full gospel They also believe that the Father Son and Holy Spirit are three separate individuals but all have the same purpose LDS scriptures include the Bible the Book of Mormon the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price Members of the church who are often called Mormons are known for being active in missionary work They also believe in the importance of families

Today the center of the Church is in Salt Lake City Utah but there are more than 14 million members living all over the world About six million of them live in the United States four and a half million of them in the Western United States and 18 million live in Utah It is the second fastest growing church in America and the fourth largest in the United States The leader of the Church is called the President of the Church and Mormons respect him as a prophet Right now the President of the Mormon church is Thomas S Monson They believe that God guides the prophet just like Catholics believe God guides the Pope 

Mormons believe that it is important for families to spend a lot of time together and that after they die they can live together forever Mormons do not drink alcohol coffee tea smoke tobacco or use other drugs They meet once a week on Sunday for church where they have the sacrament and listen to short talks or sermons They also have Sunday School to learn more about their religion The Church also has activities during the week Mormons also have buildings called temples These are the most holy buildings in their religion After a temple has been dedicated only Mormons that are living lives in accordance with the teachings of the church can go in the temple 

Mormons believe in helping poor and needy people all around the world Because of this Mormons have given 12 billion since 1985 in cash and assistance to other people They also believe it is important to learn their family history often called Genealogy They also help others to learn their family histories and give access to all their family history records for free through the internet on the website Familysearchorg

In 1842 Joseph Smith wrote 13 paragraphs describing what the Church and its members believe these are those 13 beliefs

The ARTICLES OF FAITH

There are several divisions of the Church The biggest ones are areas An area might be a whole country or part of a continent Another division is a temple district A temple district contains all the congregations served by one temple This often means a whole state region or large city Another division of the church is the stake Stakes contain all the Mormons in a geographic area A stake often contains several thousand Mormons Stakes are divided into wards and branches Each congegation is one ward A ward might be contain only people who speak a language other than English or only young people

The church was founded by Joseph Smith in 1830 in upstate New York It was based off the Book of Mormon which Smith had translated from gold plates that were buried in a nearby hill Smiths followers first went to Kirtland Ohio in 1831 The first Mormon temple was built in Kirtland and by the mid 1830s there were over 17000 Mormons In 1838 the Mormons settled in Independence and Far West Missouri Near here Smith wanted to build a utopian community They were driven out because people in Missouri did not trust Mormons This was called the Mormon War The Mormons then moved to Nauvoo Illinois There Smith started to practice polygamy and tried to start a theodemocracy which combined Mormon rule with American democracy In 1844 an attempt by Smith to shut down the Nauvoo newspaper led to Smith being accused of treason followed by him being killed by a mob 

After Smiths death there was a controversy over who should replace Smith Brigham Young led most of the Mormons to Utah in 1847 When Utah became a territory in 1850 it was somewhat of a theocracy Later in the 1850s there was conflict between the Mormons and the US government over control of the territory This was called the Utah War The Mountain Meadows massacre was part of the Utah War In the late 19th and early 20th centuries Mormons settled the Mormon Corridor in Utah and surrounding states in the Western United States Some of the places they settled were Mesa Arizona San Bernardino California Las Vegas Nevada and Cardston Alberta By 1890 the Mormon church had built temples in three Utah cities 

Brigham Young died in 1877 Around that time the US government made polygamy against the law Polygamy had been practiced by Young and the Mormon church since the 1840s Laws by the US government led to many Mormon leaders going into hiding and many polygamists being thrown in jail In 1890 the church stopped polygamy This is thought to be the beginning of the modern era of the Mormon church

In the early 20th century the Mormon Church grew and opened its first temples outside of Utah Soon into the 20th century tithing was made a part of being a good Mormon In 1995 Gordon Hinckley became President He got the church to build many temples in the United States and elsewhere around the world

Young people are encouraged to go on missions when they get old enough Boys go from two years after they are 19 years old and girls go for 18 months after they are 21 years old More boys go on missions than girls do These missionaries go to a Mission Training Center for a few months where they learn how to be good missionaries and then live in another place for their mission The Church tells them where they need to go Then they work with one other missionary who is the same gender as they are and change companions sometimes so they are not always with the same person Missionaries will go to people who live near them and teach them about the Church and baptize people who want to join the Church They also help people around them even if these people are not in the Church Often they help by building houses for people who need them

Older people sometimes go on missions after their children grow up They get to go with their spouse There are many different kinds of missions for senior missionaries Some of them are only a few months and some of them are a few years These missions can be service missions which means that they go to help people who live in the area Sometimes the senior missionary is a mission president This means that they lead and help young missionaries in the place where they go to live

The LDS church has been heavily criticized since its creation Some of the criticisms are listed below

In Norse mythology Fenrir or Fenrisulfr is a giant wolf It is the son of Loki and the giantess Angrboa Fenrir was tied up by the gods but was destined to grow too big for his bonds and eats Odin during Ragnark After killing Odin he is killed by Odins son Viarr Fenrir has two sons Hati and Skoll He has a brother Jrmungandr and a sister Hel 

Odin found out about a prophecy that the children of Loki and Angrboa would cause trouble for the gods He had Fenrir brought to him along with its brother Jrmungandr and its sister Hel 

After throwing Jrmungandr into the sea and sending Hel into the land of the dead Odin had the wolf raised among the sir Only the god Tr was brave enough to feed the growing monster The wolf got stronger and stronger The gods were scared that he would eventually destroy them They tried to chain it up He agreed to be chained two times Both times he easily broke the chains 

Odin had the dwarfs make the chain Gleipnir It looked like a silken ribbon but was made of six magical ingredients the sound of a cats step the beard of a woman the roots of a mountain bears sensibility fishs breath and birds spittle

The gods challenged Fenrisulfr to break this chain as well The wolf saw how thin and well made Gleipnir was and thought it was a trick He agreed to try and break the chain but only if one of the gods would put his hand in the wolfs mouth He believed this would force them to free him if he could not break the chain Only Tr was willing to put his hand in the wolfs mouth Fenrir tried to break the chain The more he tried the tighter the chain held him When the gods would not free him the wolf bit off Trs hand at the wrist 

It is said that at Ragnark the wolf will break free He will join forces with the enemies of the gods and will then eat Odin After that Viarr Odins son will slay the wolf to avenge his fathers death

A knight was a soldier in the Middle Ages Knights were vassals to lords who would give them land if the knight would fight for them Knights thought honour was very important and they had a code of honour called chivalry They often had a coat of arms Knights today are named by the Queen This form of title is known as the Order of the British Empire Knights today are called Sir and then their first name Many members of nobility are descended from knights For example Wijerd Jelckama descended from a knight who died at the siege of Antioch

Knights were first used in the 4th century

The Kuiper belt is an area of the Solar System beyond the orbit of Neptune to 50 AU from the Sun 

The objects within the Kuiper Belt together with the members of the scattered disk beyond are together called trans Neptunian

The asteroids in the Kuiper belt are much bigger than the asteroids in the asteroid belt At least some Kuiper belt objects are icebound

After the Kuiper belt was discovered in 1992 the number of known Kuiper belt objects has added to over a thousand and more than 70000 KBOs over 100 km in diameter

The scattered disc is a distant part of the solar system The area has small icy minor planets known as scattered disc objects The part of the scattered disc closest to the sun is in an area of space called the Kuiper belt The first SDO was found in 1995 by Spacewatch

The scattered disk is still not understood well Astronomers believe that it was created when objects in the Kuiper belt were scattered by the gravity of the outer planets mainly Neptune Unlike most objects in the Solar System which move in a round and flat path the scattered disc is much more erratic SDOs can often move almost as much in a vertical direction as they do in a horizontal direction

Flatworms are a phylum of invertebrates They are relatively simple animals They have soft bodies 

With about 25000 known species they are the largest phylum of animals without a body cavity Flatworms can be found in marine freshwater and even damp terrestrial environments 

A troublesome terrestrial example is the New Zealand flatworm Arthurdendyus triangulatus It is an invasive species which colonized large areas of Ireland and Scotland It was brought there by accident in the 1960s Since then it has destroyed most of the indigenous earthworms

Most free living flatworms found in Britain are very small ranging from 5mm to less than 1 cm They are usually black and can easily be mistaken for debris These are mostly found in freshwater rivers or streams and are of the Turbellaria class

Most flatworms are parasitic on other animals There are four classes 

and 

Flatworms are one of the invertebrate groups which are studied in school biology The main reason for this is that they may infect humans pets and farmyard animals and this was a problem some do enormous harm to humans and their livestock Schistosomiasis caused by one genus of trematodes is the second most devastating of all human diseases caused by parasites surpassed only by malaria Effective treatments are now available for these infections Also in first world countries regulations on domestic cattle prevent infected meat from reaching the human hosts

Fluke can refer to different things

Period instruments are musical instruments which have been made in the same way that they were hundreds of years ago so that old music will sound like it used to when it was first composed

Musical instruments have changed a lot during the last few centuries Composers like Johann Sebastian Bach wrote music for instruments which sounded different from the way they do today Although most of the orchestral instruments we use nowadays were already in use in Bachs day instrument makers have made changes to them These changes often gave the instruments a bigger sound so that they could be heard well in big concert halls Orchestras also got bigger and bigger

During the 20th century musicians started to realize that the way we play the music of Bach and other composers from the past was making the music sound rather different from the way it would first have been heard People became interested in hearing what the music would have sounded like back in the 17th and early 18th centuries Very few of the old instruments still existed and those that had survived had been modernized So instrument makers started to make instruments in the old ways Some musicians and orchestras started to play these instruments The instruments are often called period instruments because they are made so that they are like instruments of older periods of history

Todays instruments of the string family may look almost the same as the old ones but there are differences the old fingerboards were shorter and the strings used to be made of gut not metal The bows were shaped differently and the technique of playing was also different

Woodwind instruments have changed a lot since the old times Flutes oboes and bassoons hardly had any keys The keys were added in the 18th century and it made it much easier to play difficult music with lots of sharps and flats Clarinets were not invented until the late 18th century but even they have developed a lot since Mozarts time

Brass instruments like the trumpet and French horn now have valves which make it easier to play in different keys The trombone is the only instrument which has not changed The tuba was invented in the early 19th century

Percussion instruments include the timpani which have changed a lot In Baroque times they had calf skin heads but now the heads are made of plastic This makes a very different sound

Baroque keyboard instruments included the harpsichord and clavichord The piano was invented during the 18th century It still sounded very different when Mozart wrote for it The frame was made of wood not of cast iron and the hammers had leather heads instead of felt A modern piano sounds quite different

The interest in period instruments started in the mid 20th century People like Wanda Landowska played Baroque keyboard music on the harpsichord instead of the piano Conductors like Nicholas Harnoncourt have trained small orchestras to play on period instruments using techniques which were used in Baroque times Gradually musicians also started using period instruments for music from the Classical music period Even in the mid 18th century the modern orchestra had not yet evolved In recent years conductors like John Elliot Gardiner have performed music by Hector Berlioz on period instruments There are now many small instrumental groups and orchestras who regularly perform on period instruments eg The English Concert and the English Baroque Soloists

Does old music sound better on period instruments Musicians do not all agree about this question and they still argue a lot about the way that some of the music should be played However it is important to listen to the way that period instruments are played Musicians such as the violinist Andrew Manze have done a lot of research in old books and old music and have done a lot to make people rethink the way in which music from former centuries should be performed

Monogenea are a type of flatworm They are parasites which means that they always need another creature to live on They live on the outside of their host Some parasites like tapeworms live on the inside of a larger creature 

Monogenea are especially common on the skin fins and gills of fish Less commonly they can be found in the urinary bladder and rectum of cold blooded vertebrates No types of Monogenea infect birds but one infects mammals It is a parasite in the eye of a hippopotamus 

Monogenea are usually hermaphrodites This means that they have both sexes First they are males and only later do they become females as well They have direct life cycles with no asexual reproduction In those types of Monogenea that lay eggs the young ones grow to a larval stage called an oncomiracidium It is at the larva stage that they are able to travel from one host creature to another When they are adults Monogenea eat the blood mucus and epithelial cells of their host creature

Turbellaria are a class of free living flatworms They are not parasites Most of them are carnivores They actively search for food Most of them are small less than 60 cm in size Almost all of them are aquatic Some also live on land in damp places Its classifications are

Domain Eukarya

Kingdom Animalia

Subkingdom Eumetazoa

Superphylum Platyzoa

Phylum Platyhelminthes

In Norse mythology Bifrst is the bridge between the land of mortals Midgard and the land of the gods Asgard The gods cross it every day to meet and decide things at Urdarbrunn under the tree Yggdrasill The bridge is a rainbow It was built by the sir and is guarded by the god Heimdall

Only the thunder god Thor was not allowed to use the rainbow because he may break it The bridge will be destroyed at the end of the world Ragnark when the army of giants and the dead run on it to attack heaven

A dosimeter is a tool that can measure different levels of hazardous environments Common dosimeters are those used for sound and radiation

A Geiger counter is an instrument that measures radiation in an area It works by measuring ionizing radiation by count rate It was developed by Hans Geiger and Ernest Rutherford in 1908 It was improved by Walther Mller in 1928

Geiger counters can detect the presence of radiation Some can also detect the intensity of it and the angle from which it comes

A Wide Area Network or WAN is made up of several computer networks connected together often over the Internet In most cases the networks in WANs all belong to the same company or school

WANs are used to connect LANs and other types of networks together so that users and computers in one location can communicate with users and computers in other locations Many WANs are built for one particular organization and are private Others built by Internet service providers provide connections from an organizations LAN to the Internet WANs are often built using leased lines At each end of the leased line a router connects to the LAN on one side and a hub within the WAN on the other Leased lines can be very expensive Instead of using leased lines WANs can also be built using less costly circuit switching or packet switching methods Network protocols including TCPIP deliver transport and addressing functions Protocols including Packet over SONETSDH MPLS ATM and Frame relay are often used by service providers to deliver the links that are used in WANs X25 was an important early WAN protocol and is often considered to be the grandfather of Frame Relay as many of the underlying protocols and functions of X25 are still in use today by Frame Relay

Academic research into wide area networks can be broken down into three areas mathematical models network emulation and network simulation

Performance improvements are sometimes delivered via WAFS or WAN optimization

A corporate network is a group of computers connected together in a building or in a particular area which are all owned by the same company

Ayrton Senna da Silva better known as Ayrton Senna was a Brazilian Formula 1 driver who won the championship three times in 1988 1990 and in 1991 He died in an accident that took place on the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari better known as Imola in the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix He is considered by many people to be the most skilled driver in the history of motor racing

Senna was born in So Paulo a city in Brazil When he was four years old he first got into a kart When he was 13 he entered a karting competition for the first time A fun fact is that he started his first kart race on pole position The start places were written on pieces of paper and put in a drivers helmet and he drew number one Because he was a lot lighter than the other racers he was much faster than all of them He won the South American Kart Championships in 1977 and was runner up in the World Championship but he never won it

In 1981 he raced in the British Formula Ford 1600 championship and won it as well He also changed his name to Senna since da Silva is used a lot in Brazil 

In 1982 Senna won two European championships the European and the British Formula Ford 2000 After testing with Williams McLaren Brabham and Toleman he got a place within the Toleman team for the 1984 Formula One season

The Toleman team was a small team compared to teams like Williams McLaren and Brabham Even though the team built a car good enough to let Senna impress with his talents Ayrton Senna scored his first championship point on April 7 1984 at the South African Grand Prix Three races later Senna impressed at the Monaco Grand Prix where it was raining Senna started on the 13th position but right after the race started he soon was gaining position after position on the track that is known for its small roads On the 19th lap he took second place from Niki Lauda and was making up a lot of time to the race leader Alain Prost It started to rain harder and the race was stopped on the 31st lap Even though almost everyone agrees Senna should have won the race Senna had a result to be proud of In the rest of the season he would finish third place in two races the Britisch and the Portuguese Grand Prix He finished his first year in Formula One racing on a shared 9th position and 13 points sharing his 9th position with Nigel Mansell

Senna did not just race in Formula One that year He also co drove a Porsche 956 with Henri Pescarolo and Stefan Johansson in the 1000km Nrburgring race He also raced in a race to celebrate the opening of the new Nrburgring He won this race

The following year Ayrton Senna joined the Lotus team and many thought he would be able to meet his potential The other driver for Lotus was Elio De Angelis Ayrton scored his first of 65 pole positions in his career during the Brazilian Grand Prix but was not able to win the race He retired with an electrical problem after 48 laps He did not had to wait a long time for his first ever victory in Formula 1 however because he won the next race the Portuguese Grand Prix starting off from pole position again He showed his true talent driving in such bad weather which even later champion Alain Prost could not race in The rest of the season was not too good for Senna though He scored a lot of points but often retired because of mechanical problems He won the Belgian Grand Prix in another wet race and finished 4th at the end of the season scoring 38 points total He also took two first places two second places two third places and seven pole positions

His second season with Lotus in 1986 was better than his first The Lotus Car was a lot more reliable He finished second in the Brazilian Grand Prix with only Nelson Piquet being faster than Ayrton He even took the lead in the World Championship standings during the Spanish Grand Prix after managing to keep Nigel Mansell away from stealing the victory The gap between both drivers was only 14 thousand of a second He did not have a lot of time to enjoy his lead however because his Lotus did not have the reliability Ayrton needed to chase after the title

Adriano Emperado is a Filipino Hawaiian martial artist He is one of five martial artists from Hawaii who developed a system of Self Defense called Kajukenbo

As a young man growing up in Honolulu Hawaii Emperado began his early training in the Filipino art of Escrima which would have a huge impact on his impute into the development of Kajukenbo Emperado would become interested in Kenpo Karate and after years of training earned him a fifth degree black belt under the direction of William KS Chow

In the year 1947 and in a dangers part of Hawaii an area called the Palama Settlement five skilled martial artist met and trained together From these training sessions these five men would create the Black Belt Society There goal was to develop and offer the best form of self defense possible

There names Peter Y Choo Frank Ordonez  Joseph Holck  Adriano Emperado and Escrima Clarence Chang After several years of training together these men would create the system of Kajukenbo developed for street fighting application

The name Kajukenbo comes from the four systems used in its development KaKarata  JuJudo  KenKenpo Karate  BoBoxing Kajukenbo has gained a reputation as the perfected art of dirty fighting on the street as one member said

The first school of Kajukenbo was opened in the Palama Settlement and directed by Adriano Emperado and his brother Joe Emperado In order to be undefeated on streets of Hawaii Kajukenbo students faced sever training regimented classes with full contact producing various injuures daily Enrollment soon decreased to a faithful few

The Kajukenbo system under the direction of Emperado would elevate several instructors to a notable position among the international community of martial arts Sid Asuncion Tony Ramos Charles Gaylord Aleju Reyes Joe Halbuna and Al Dacascos

In the year 1959 Emperado began merging the art of Wushu into Kajukenbo Wushu a soft art with opposite contrasts to Kajukenbo a hard aggressive style would mean special care combining the two together Kajukenbo has developed slowly into a system ready to meat the needs of today

The modern Kajukenbo today uses everything gained from its founding fathers Adriano Emperado life has been about teaching the martial arts Black Belt Magazine has named him its Instructor of the Year 1991

Erwin Rudolf Josef Alexander Schrdinger was an Austrian Physicist He was one of the founders of quantum mechanics and won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1933

Schrdinger went to the Academic Gymnasium from 1898 to 1906 Afterwards he studied mathematics and physics in Vienna and wrote his habilitation up from 1910

He was a soldier in World War I Afterwards he got professorships in Zrich Jena Breslau and Stuttgart In 1920 he married in 1927 he went to Berlin to fellow Max Planck

After the take over of power by the Nazis Schrdinger left Germany and got a new professorship in Oxford In 1933 he was awarded the Nobel Prize Three years later he returned to Austria and became professor in Graz In 1938 he had to leave Austria because the Nazis had taken over government He went to Dublin and became director of the School for Theoretical Physics

In 1956 he returned to Vienna and got a professorship for Theoretical Physics He died of tuberculosis in 1961

Schrdingers most important work is the wave mechanics a formulation of quantum mechanics and especially the Schrdinger equation He also worked on the field of biophysics He invented the concept of negentropy and helped to develop molecular biology

Dioxins is the name for a group of chemical compounds These are organic compounds Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins or simply dioxins are a group of halogenated organic compounds which are significant because they act as environmental pollutants They are very poisonous Many dioxins cause cancer Today Dioxins are no longer made They can occur as a by product of other processes though Examples where dioxins can result are the production of PVC or the bleaching of paper In nature they are produced in volcanoes and forest fires

A chemical accident where a lot of dioxin was released was the Seveso disaster

Arnold Johannes Wilhelm Sommerfeld was a German mathematician and theoretical physicist

Sommerfeld was the son of a practical physician After finishing school in 1886 he started studying mathematics at the University of Knigsberg In 1891 he wrote his doctorate thesis about arbitrary functions in mathematical physics Afterwards he had to do his army serve

Then he went to Gttingen He became assistant at the institute for mineralogy but was still interested in mathematical physics

In 1894 he became assistant of Felix Klein The year after he wrote his habilitation about the mathematical theory of optical diffraction and became docent for mathematics in Gttingen In 1897 Sommerfeld married

In the same year he became ordinary professor for mathematics at the mining college of Clausthal Three years later he got a professorship at the Technical University of Aachen

In 1906 he became professor for theoretical physics in Munich were he stood for his lifetime While he was professor in Munich he travelled two times around the world  in 192223 he was guest professor in Wisconsin and travelled afterwards through India China and Japan in 192829 he made a journey through the USA as teacher on universities 

In 1935 he went in pension but he still worked until 1940 There was big trouble about choosing the person who should follow him Sommerfeld wanted to have Werner Heisenberg on his seat but in the time of the Nazi regime the job could only go to a person who taught the so called German Physics which included a kind of mysticism Sommerfeld tried to prevent that

Sommerfeld died in 1951 in a traffic accident

James Clerk Maxwell was a Scottish mathematician physicist and discoverer of Maxwells equations

Maxwell grew up in a rich religious family In 1845 when he was only 14 he wrote a paper describing a way of drawing mathematical curves with a piece of string In 1847 he started studying mathematics at the University of Edinburgh In 1850 Maxwell changed to Trinity College at the University of Cambridge He won prizes from the university for his work and was given his degree in 1854 From 1855 to 1872 he did research on colour blindness

In 1856 Maxwell was made a professor of Natural Philosophy at Marischal College Aberdeen He worked there until the two colleges in Aberdeen joined together in 1860 and he lost his job He then became a professor at Kings College London In 1861 Maxwell was made a member of the Royal Society a group of important scientists In 1871 became the first Cavendish Professor of Physics at Cambridge

He studied many things but is known best for his mathematical work on electromagnetism and on the behaviour of gases

Maxwell died in 1879 from cancer

Penicillin is a common antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections Penicillin was discovered by Scottish scientist Sir Alexander Fleming in 1928 It was not mass produced until the 1940s however Penicillin is sometimes used to treat syphilis tonsilitis meningitis and pneumonia as well as other diseases It was commonly used during World War 2 Penicillin was discovered when Fleming noticed a mold that was stopping bacteria from growing in a petri dish Australian scientist Howard Walter Florey made the penicillin mould into a medicine Together with another scientist Ernest Boris Chain Fleming and Florey were given the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1945

Some people are allergic to penicillin Symptoms include nausea diarrhea or rash Rarely patients who are allergic to penicillin get a fever vomit or have serious skin irritation Because it is such a popular antibiotic penicillin is the most common cause of serious allergic reactions to a drug They are now used regularly in hospitals

Depleted uranium is what is left over after uranium is enriched Enriched uranium can be used in nuclear reactors or nuclear weapons Depleted uranium is made up mostly of the isotope uranium 238 Uranium 238 is mildly radioactive It is very dense or heavy for its size Because of this depleted uranium is used in armor piercing bullets and heavy machine guns Its high density allows weapons to put more energy into a fired bullet which causes more damage to its targets Bullets made from it will burn when they hit something hard and their smoke is dangerous to breathe

A CD RW is like a Compact disc that can be recorded and erased multiple times It can hold data or music Most of the time it will hold data since many CD players can not play CD RWs During its development the format was known as CD E which stands for Compact Disc Erasable The standard was introduced in 1997 It replaced the less successful CD MO

The disk used for this is an optical disc Phase change technology is used to write to the disk A laser beam is used to heat a certain point of the disk Once this point is hot the information stored there can be changed

According to what the manufacturers of these disks say it is possible to record and erase such a disk up to 1000 times They behave very much like CD Rs otherwise Entire sessions can be written As long as there is space on the disc new sessions can be appended To be readable in an ordinary CD drive all sessions must be closed though

CD RWs never gained the popularity of CD Rs This is because they are more expensive to make and to buy Also not all CD drives can read them Reading and writing speeds are also lower than those of pre made CDs and CD Rs

Also like with the CD R it is impractical to use these disks to quickly add or remove small files Other formats like Zip disk Jaz disk Magneto optical disks and USB flash drives are probably better able for quickly reading writing or erasing small files When a deletion needs to be made the whole disk needs to be erased

CD RWs are more like a backup solution They are usually cheaper than tape based solutions

Depending on the method used to write and the type of disk used usable capacities range from about 500 to 700 megabytes

Pretty much the same concepts are used for DVD RWs which have a much higher capacity

A Magneto optical drive is a disk drive for computers It can read and write data to magneto optical disks The technology was made at the end of the 1980s Both 525 and 35 media exist The disks look like CD ROMs but they are protected with a plastic cover The MiniDisc is a Magneto optical disk The other disks look similar but have a bigger physical size 

The operating system sees the disk like a normal hard drive 35 disks can hold between 128 megabytes and 23 gigabytes of data 525 disks hold between 650 MB and 167 GB 

All disks have a physical write protection switch They are pretty resistant to data change can support temperatures up to about 100 C and do not care much about light 

DVD RAM disks are very similar in appearance they are optical though

The United States Presidential line of succession is based on laws that says the order of who replaces the United States President if he leaves office before his term is over If President dies quits or is removed from office before his term ends the Vice President will become President until the end of the Presidents term If the Vice President cannot do it or if there is no Vice President the next person in the line of succession acts as President As of 2008 only Vice Presidents have succeeded the President

The laws about succession were first created in 1792 The second in line behind the Vice President was the President pro tempore of the United States Senate followed by Speaker of the House of Representatives In 1868 during the impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson President pro tempore Benjamin Wade nearly became new president but Johnson was found not guilty by one vote Johnson who became President after the death of Abraham Lincoln had no Vice President The Chief Justice and other members of the Supreme Court were excluded from the line of succession

In 1886 after death of Vice President Thomas Hendricks Congress passed a new law which removed the President pro tempore and the Speaker from line The new person in line behind Vice President was Secretary of State followed by other Cabinet members

The most recent law about the line of succession was passed in 1947 This is the current line of succession

Framlingham Castle is a castle inFramlingham Suffolk England It was once the home of the Dukes of Norfolk and was where Anne Mowbray 8th Countess of Norfolk was born in 1472

Warwick Castle is a large castle in Warwickshire England It is near the town of Warwick The castle was once the family home of the Earls of Warwick 

There are many rooms in the castle Some of the rooms have mannequins in them that look like real people These are dressed in broken wikt linkcostumecostume They are used to show how people might have lived in the castle hundreds of years ago Warwick Castle has a dungeon One part of the castle is said to be haunted Actors play the part of the ghost and the servant who killed him in a dramatic Spook Experience Lights and sounds are used to add to the effect

The castle has a very high wall walk It can be explored so that visitors can see from where the guards looked for enemies A long steep flight of steps leads up to the highest part of the castle where the flagpole is 

There are many paintings in the castle There are portraits of English Kings and Queens as well as of members of the family who owned the castle It is possible to see the private chambers or bedrooms where the family and their most important guests slept

Alfred Charles Kinsey was an American biologist He was interested in entomology and zoology He is best known for the research he did on human sexuality His research had a great influence on social and cultural values in many parts of the world It also had a determining influence on the sexual revolution that happened in the 1960s 

He wrote some papers which became known as the Kinsey Reports In them he asked himself how widespread or differentiated human sexual practices were He wondered how much difference there was in the way different people had sex with each other He developed the Kinsey Scale to measure sexual orientation On one end of the scale at the value 0 the individual is entirely heterosexual On the other end at value 6 he or she has a purely homosexual orientation

Many people see him as the father of sexology 

The Kinsey Reports are two books published in the late 1940s and early 1950s by Alfred Kinsey and others In the books Sexual Behaviour in the Human Male and Sexual Behaviour in the Human Female Kinsey looks at different sexual behaviours and sex practices 

The books were very shocking when they came out as they talked about subjects that were taboo It also questioned widely held beliefs about sexuality They were controversial 

In simple words Kinsey found the following amongst other things

People said that the selection of those asked was not well done One in four were prisoners and 5 were male prostitutes The institute or location Kinsey did these tests then did another such tests without asking prisoners or prostitutes and the findings were more or less the same People also say that child abuse may have been involved when collecting the data

Kinsey scale The Kinsey scale attempts to describe a persons sexual history or episodes of their sexual activity at a given time It uses a scale from 0 to 6 0 means the person tested is exclusively heterosexual A person scoring 6 is exclusively homosexual In the Kinsey Reports an extra grade was used for asexuality The scale was first published in Sexual Behavior in the Human Male It was also important in the complementary work Sexual Behavior in the Human Female

Kinsey introduced the scale

Ruthenium is a chemical element It has the chemical symbol Ru It has the atomic number 44 It is a rare metal It is silver white In chemistry it is placed in a group of metal elements named the transition metals It is also part of the platinum group Ruthenium is found in platinum ores

Ruthenium is used as a catalyst in some platinum alloys

Niobium is a chemical element It is sometimes named columbium It has the chemical symbol Nb It has the atomic number 41 It is a rare metal Niobium is soft and grey It is ductile In chemistry it is placed in a group of metal elements named the transition metals 

Niobium was discovered in a variety of a mineral named columbite Niobite is an ore of niobium Niobium is used in alloys The most important alloys are used to make special steels and strong welded joints

An explosion is a fast increase in volume and increase in energy made available It normally makes high temperatures and makes gases 

An explosion starts pressure waves in the medium where it happens Explosions are categorized as deflagrations if the pressure waves are subsonic and detonations if they are supersonic When a detonation happens the supersonic pressure waves are named shock waves

Unintentional explosions can be caused when chemicals are mixed together or if pressurized containers or flammable materials are heated or exposed to flames To cause an explosion pressure does not have to be present but is always a result of an explosion

There are a number of safety measures that are used to prevent unintentional explosions Many countries require that chemicals fuels and pressurized containers that may explode be labelled with warning labels As well many countries have regulations restricting the possession and use of potentially explosive chemicals to appropriate industrial and research uses Many countries have transportation regulations that require potentially explosive chemicals fuels and pressurized containers to be transported safely

Intentional explosions are caused when armies fire artillery or when military air forces drop bombs during a war Intentional explosions are also used by civilians in activities such as mining construction and large scale civil engineering projects such as building tunnels roads railways and dams

Rhodium is a chemical element It has the chemical symbol Rh It has the atomic number 45 It is a rare metal It is silver white and hard In chemistry it is placed in a group of metal elements named the transition metals It is also part of the platinum group Rhodium is found in platinum ores

Rhodium is used as a catalyst in some platinum alloys It is the most expensive precious metal

Tellurium is a chemical element It has the chemical symbol Te It has the atomic number 52 It has 52 protons and 52 electrons Its mass number is 1276 It has 8 natural isotopes 4 are stable and 4 are radioactive One of the radioactive ones lasts longer than any other isotope It has a half life of 22 x 1024 years 

It is a brittle silver white semimetal When it is pure it has a metallic shine It is ground easily It can be made in an amorphous form It is a semiconductor It changes conductivity a little when light shines on it similar to selenium It is corrosive to many metals when molten

Tellurium is an unreactive element It can react with reactive metals to make tellurides It can burn in air to make tellurium dioxide It can be oxidized even more to tellurium trioxide It does not corrode The chemistry of tellurium is similar to some chemistry of selenium and sulfur although its compounds are more reactive and the element is less reactive It does not dissolve in most acids although it dissolves in concentrated sulfuric acid to make a special red tellurium cation

Tellurium makes chemical compounds in several oxidation states 2 2 4 and 6 2 compounds are normally found in tellurides They are strong reducing agents Tellurides are normally the main ore of tellurium 2 compounds are found in some tellurium halides like tellurium chloride and tellurium bromide 4 compounds are found in tellurites and tellurous acid They are weak oxidizing agents that can be reduced to tellurium 6 compounds are found in tellurates and telluric acid They are powerful oxidizing agents

Tellurium is a very rare mineral There is 14 times more silver in the earth than there is tellurium Tellurium is sometimes found as an element but most of the times is found as tellurides Gold tellurides are found in the earth They are valuable ores of both tellurium and gold This gold ore was not recognized as gold during one gold rush and was used as a filler It was then discovered that it was gold telluride making another gold rush Telluride cannot replace sulfide in elements like selenide does

Tellurium can be taken from gold telluride by dissolving the gold telluride in concentrated sulfuric acid The tellurium dissolves to make a red solution while the gold sinks to the bottom

A more common way of extracting tellurium from tellurides is to heat the tellurides The tellurides are heated with sodium carbonate and air This makes sodium tellurite Selenites are normally found as an impurity They are separated by reacting them with sulfuric acid The selenites stay in solution The tellurites turn into tellurium dioxide Then the tellurium dioxide is reacted with sulfur dioxide dissolved in sulfuric acid to make tellurium metal The tellurium can be melted and reformed to make bars of tellurium metal

The main use of tellurium is in alloys It is used in iron copper and lead alloys It makes the metals more easily machinable It improves strength and durability of lead and makes it more resistant to corrosion by sulfuric acid

Tellurium is also used in cadmium telluride solar cells These are very efficient It can be alloyed with both cadmium and mercury to make mercury cadmium telluride an infrared sensitive semiconductor It is used in some rewritable optical discs Lead telluride is used in another type of infrared sensor 

It is also used to color ceramics It is used to make fiberglass that is used in telecommunications It helps increase the refraction It is also used in delay blasting caps Rubber can be vulcanized by tellurium This makes the rubber heat resistant

Tellurium is not really used in any living things Some fungi though can use tellurium instead of selenium or sulfur Most organisms can metabolize tellurium to make dimethyl telluride which is a garlic smelling chemical If someone eats a tellurium compound it gives them garlic breath 

Tellurium is not very toxic It can make breath stinky It is hard to get poisoned from it because it is so rare

Indium is a chemical element It has the chemical symbol In It has the atomic number 49 It is a rare metal It is a soft malleable and poor metal Indium looks like zinc Pieces of indium can easily be joined together by pushing one piece into another The chemistry of indium is quite like aluminium or gallium Zinc ores are the main source of indium

The main use of indium is in the chemical compound Indium tin oxide in liquid crystal displays It is also used in very thin layers as a lubricant In World War II it was used a lot to coat bearings in aircraft

Francium is a chemical element with the chemical symbol Fr and an atomic number of 87 It is a metal In chemistry it is placed in a group of metal elements named the alkali metals Francium is very radioactive It is in very small amounts in uranium and thorium ores It has the lowest electronegativity and electron affinity of all the chemical elements

Francium reacts violently with water as do all of the elements in group 1 on the periodic table 

Francium is one of the hardest to find elements on the planet Earth It is estimated that there are only about 15 grams or half an ounce in the Earths crust at a single time

Although chemists knew the element number 87 in the periodic table should exist it was a long time before it was discovered In the early 1900s nearly all boxes on the periodic table had been filled Chemists knew that one element had been found to fit into each box Francium was discovered in 1939 by a French chemist called Marguerite Perey She named it after her home country France

Rhenium is a chemical element It has the chemical symbol Re It has the atomic number 75 It is a rare metal It is silver white In chemistry it is placed in a group of metal elements named the transition metals The chemistry of rhenium is similar to manganese It was the last natural element to be discovered

Rhenium made as a by product of molybdenum refinement 

Rhenium is used in some manganese alloys Rhenium molybdenum alloys are superconductors

Thallium is a chemical element It has the chemical symbol Tl It has the atomic number 81 Its atomic mass is 2044 It is found in Group 13 of the periodic table Thallium is a gray metal that is very toxic

Thallium is a soft malleable grayish post transition metal It can be cut with a knife at room temperature It melts at a low temperature 304C This is typical of a post transition metal Thallium has 25 isotopes and two stable ones It is extremely toxic

Thallium is a moderately reactive metal It corrodes easily in air with a blue gray color that is similar to lead If it is kept in air for a long time a large amount of thallium oxide will build up It corrodes in the presence of water to make the hydroxide It burns with a greenish flame It reacts with most acids

Thallium makes chemical compounds in two oxidation states 1 and 3 The 1 state is more common and less reactive Its chemical compounds are very similar to potassium or silver compounds It makes a hydroxide that in a strong base when dissolved in water Most other transition metal and post trnansition metal hydroxides do not dissolve in water This reacts with carbon dioxide to make thallium carbonate which is also water soluble and very heavy It is the only heavy metal carbonate that can dissolve in water Other compounds are similar to silver compounds Thallium bromide turns yellow when exposed to light similar to silver bromide Thallium sulfide is black similar to silver sulfide The 3 state compounds are oxidizing agents The black oxide thallium oxide and the hydroxide thallium hydroxide are the only stable 3 compounds They break down to oxygen and thallium oxide when heated Thallium and its compounds are rare because they are toxic and polluting

Thallium was found by spectroscopy in 1861 by a bright green line in its spectrum The main use for thallium rat poison was banned in many countries in the 1970s Thallium was used to poison people similar to the more popular arsenic

Thallium is found most in certain clays and granites It cannot be gotten easily from these though Thallium is normally gotten from the waste after other ores like galena are processed Hutchinsonite is another mineral that has thallium in it

When lead and zinc are taken from their ores many impurities are left behind Sulfuric acid is used to dissolve the thallium from it as thallium sulfate Then the thallium sulfate is electrolyzed to make thallium metal

It is used in rat poisons and insecticides The use of thallium as a poison has been reduced or banned in many countries because these countries think that thallium might cause cancers It is also used in infrared detectors It has been used in some murders Like arsenic the use of thallium in murders has given it the name inheritance powder Thallium compounds are used in glass for infrared light Thallium was also used to kill skin infections but it is too toxic to be used for that now A superconductor that can work at higher temperatures than normal ones do uses thallium A radioactive thallium isotope was used for nuclear scans An alloy of thallium and mercury has a low freezing temperature and is a liquid A very dense solution of a thallium compound was used to test minerals for specific gravity but it is too toxic for use 

Thallium is very toxic It can be absorbed through skin Many of its salts easily dissolve Some are colorless tasteless and odorless but are very toxic Some think that it is a carcinogen Thallium can be a pollutant if the thallium waste from metal processing is washed away

The Cunning Little Vixen is an opera by the Czech composer Leo Janek Janek loved animals and in this opera some of the characters are humans but some are animals Some of the little animals are usually sung by children

Janek got the idea of this opera from a cartoon strip called Sharp ears The cartoon was published in a popular daily newspaper Lidov noviny It was about a vixen and her adventures in the forest He thought that the story would make a good opera He made a few changes to the story he left out a some characters changed the order of the story a little and made the humans and the animals behave in a similar way It was first performed in Brno on 6 November 1924

When Janek died in 1928 the last part of the opera was played at his funeral

A forester is sleeping under a tree Nearby a young vixen is playing She nearly catches a frog but the frog jumps away and lands on the foresters nose He wakes up and sees the little vixen playing He catches the vixen and take her home with him He gave her a name Sharp ears

Sharp ears is unhappy at the foresters cottage She is tied up with a rope in the yard The hens keep teasing her and the dog is boring One day she tells the hens that they are silly to stay in the farmyard being bossed about by the rooster She tells them they ought to fly away to freedom She pretends to die then jumps up and starts to catch them When the foresters wife comes out Sharp ears bites through the rope and disappears into the forest

She finds a nice sett where a badger lives She wants to live there herself so she chases the badger out of his home One winters night the forester is drinking in the inn He teases the priest and the schoolmaster for not having found someone to love They in turn tease the forester for having let the vixen go The schoolmaster starts to go home He is drunk He sees the vixen who reminds him of his former lover but he is too drunk to catch hold of her

Sharp ears meets a handsome young male fox called Goldskin The two fall in love When she realizes she is pregnant the fox and vixen get married The woodpecker is the priest who marries them The cubs are born in the spring

The forester is still searching the forest for Sharp ears One day he finds a dead hare The poacher persuades the forester to make a trap because he thinks that Sharp ears will come back to eat the hare The cubs arrive and play near the trap Sharp ears realizes the poacher is trying to catch her She teases him cruelly and dares him to kill her He shoots her with his rifle then he is very sad

Some time later the forester is sleeping under a tree He wakes up when a frog lands on his hand He sees a young vixen playing in front of him He tells the young cub that she looks just like her mother He reaches out for her but catches a frog instead He lets it go He realizes that life must go on

Janek made some changes to the story in the cartoon This made it more suitable for an opera He did not have all the characters that are in the cartoon and he changed the order of the story to make it more dramatic He compares the human beings with the animals For example we see vixen Sharp ears falling in love and having a family But the foresters friends the school master and the priest have not been so lucky with their love life The priest looks like the badger the woodpecker is like the priest When the opera is performed the same singer sometimes sings both parts The end of the opera is like the beginning This shows that life carries on and one generation follows another

The Guaran alphabet is a system used to write the Guaran language The Guaran language is used in Paraguay and some countries near it The alphabet has 33 letters These are

A E I O U Y are vowels just like English Those letters with tildes on top make the same sound except more nasal sounding The apostrophe sounds like a glottal stop The other letters are consonants

Lake Victoria or Victoria Nyanza is a lake in Africa It is bordered and governed by the countries of Tanzania Uganda and Kenya The lake is in the western part of Africas Great Rift Valley 

Tonsillitis is a disease The tonsils in the mouth get inflamed and grow red This may cause a sore throat or a fever Usually the inflammation goes away on its own but if it does not the tonsils may have to be surgically removed This operation is called a tonsillectomy

The disease is caused by certain viruses most of the time but can also be caused by bacteria It easily spreads between humans The most important thing is to treat sore throat if it is caused by bacteria called streptococcus with antibiotic for 10 days

Encephalitis is a disease of the brain It is when there is an inflammation of the brain This is most often caused by viruses but may also be caused by bacteria The brain is damaged when the inflamed brain parts push against the skull Encephalitis can be fatal Encephalitis can be caused by diseases such as syphilis or rabies

Mitosis is when a cell divides itself in half to make two identical copies Before mitosis the cell creates an identical set of genetic information this is called DNA replication or Interphase The duplicated genetic information then winds up into a visible object called a chromosome A chromosome is made up of two chromatids joined at the centromere 

Mitosis happens in all types of cells in the human body except with sperm and ova cells The sperm and ova are also called gametes or sex cells The gametes go through a different division method called meiosis

There are six phases of mitosis Each phase is used to describe what kind of change the cell is going through The phases are interphase prophase metaphase anaphase telophase and cytokinesis Some may consider pro metaphase as part of the phases but most believe it is part of metaphase and some of prophase Each phase is important to mitosis

Interphase is part of mitosis It is the beginning stage where chromatin start to duplicate inside the nuclear envelope

During prophase chromosomes in the nucleus condense pairs of centrioles move to opposite sides of the nucleus spindle fibers form a bridge between the ends of the cell and the nuclear envelope breaks down

 Metaphase  During metaphase the chromosomes are pulled by microtubules called spindle fibers into place The chromosomes line up on the cells equator or center line and are prepared for division

During anaphase the chromosomes move from the cells equator to their respective poles of the cell The cell begins to stretch out as the opposite ends are pushed apart

Telophase is the final stage in mitosis as the cell itself is ready to divide One complete set of chromosomes is now at each pole of the cell The spindle fibers begin to disappear and a nuclear membrane forms around each set of chromosomes Also a nucleolus appears within each new nucleus and single stranded chromosomes uncoil into invisible strands of chromatin

Cytokinesis even though it is a very important to cell division is not considered a stage of mitosis During cytokinesis the cell physically splits This occurs just after anaphase and during telophase The cleavage furrow which is the pinch caused by the ring of proteins pinches off completely closing off the cell The cell now has reproduced itself successfully After cytokinesis the cell goes back into interphase where the cycle is repeated If cytokinesis were to occur to a cell that had not gone through mitosis then the daughter cells would be different or not function properly One would still have the nucleus and the other would lack a nucleus Cytokinesis is different in both animals and plant cells In plant cells instead of splitting into two halves it forms a cell plate

Inflammation is the first reaction of the immune system to an infection or irritation First the organ involved gets red then it will get hot then it will swell and then it will hurt Finally it will stop working The first four of these reactions have been known for a long time since Antiquity Finding them is attributed to Celsus The last one was added by Rudolf Virchow in 1858

Inflammation can also be presentresponsible for skin disorders such as psoriasisdandruff joint pains arthritis etc It is possible to reduce inflammation by eliminating nightshades from the diet

 Car Rental is when you rent a car A car rental agency or a rent a car is a company that rents automobiles for short periods of time for a fee 

They can be found primarily located near airports or busy city areas The internet is changing the car rental industry with companies that are now called online car rental companies

Car rental agencies primarily serve people who have a car that is temporarily out of reach or out of service for example travellers who are out of town or owners of damaged or destroyed vehicles who are awaiting repair or insurance compensation Because of the variety of sizes of their vehicles car rental agencies may also serve the self moving industry needs by renting vans or trucks

Car rentals are subject to many conditions which vary from one brand to another The vehicle must be returned in a good condition and must not exceed a maximum driven distance otherwise extra fees may be incurred Additionally some companies set up a minimum age for the vehicle driver which in some cases is as high as 25 even in countries where the minimum legal age to hold a drivers license is much lower Recent conditions have utilised GPS technology to limit maximum speeds or driving to specific regions

Mechanical engineering is a branch of engineering that applies the principles of Mechanics and Materials science for analysis design manufacturing and maintenance of mechanical systems It is involves the production and usage of heat and mechanical power for the design production and operation of machines and tools They can vary from building a rocket ship all the way down to a modern car It is one of the oldest and broadest engineering disciplines

Paul Newman was an American actor He was born in Shaker Heights Ohio He was known especially for the 1969 movie Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid He played Butch Cassidy in the movie He was married to actress Joanne Woodward He died of lung cancer 

Like most Underground lines the Piccadilly line is operated by a single type of rolling stock In this case it is the 1973 tube stock The trains are painted in the standard London Underground livery of blue white and red Seventy six trains out of a fleet of 88 are needed to run the lines peak service One unit was severely damaged by the terrorist attack of 7 July 2005 The stock was recently refurbished and was due for replacement by 2014 but the order for new trains was cancelled in July 2010

The line was previously worked by 1959 stock 1956 stock 1938 stock standard tube stock and 1906 gate stock

The line has two depots at Northfieldsrefmap 55map 55 and Cockfostersrefmap 54map 54 There are sidings at Oakwood South Harrow Arnos Grove Rayners Lane Down Street Wood Green Acton Town Ruislip and Uxbridge

The line is controlled from the control centre at Earls Court which it used to share with the District line It is in need of resignalling and this work is planned to be carried out by 2014

The current off peak service pattern is

Often late evening services terminate at LUL stationsstationOakwood instead of Cockfosters

Trains will also make an additional stop at LUL stationsstationTurnham Green during early mornings and late evenings but will not stop at the station during the main part of the day

Other services operate at times especially at the start and towards the end of the traffic day

A Stradivarius is a string instrument built by the 17th century Italian luthier Stradivari family that was famous for making them Stradivarii are known for their high quality sound and ability to last a long time without tuning Most of these instruments survive to this day though few have been stolen They are some of the best and most expensive instruments and even each string instrument created has a name So many people have wanted Stradivarii and even one person has sold his house to buy one Famous violinists such as Midori Goto or Joshua Bell have Stradivarii

Gadolinium is a chemical element It has the chemical symbol Gd It has the atomic number 64 It is part of a group of chemical elements in the periodic table named the Lanthanides It is a rare earth element It is silvery white malleable and ductile

Its main uses are as chemical compounds in color televisions and nuclear magnetic resonance radio contrast agents In color cathode ray tube televisions some of the pixels are dots gadolinium compounds When the electrons from the cathode ray tube hit the pixels and transfer energy to the gadolinium compounds they give out light as energy Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging is used in medicine where it is named MRI It is used to take picture of inside the body How the pictures look is changed by the gadolinium compounds and how much water is around It makes the images clearer because it makes the difference in the concentration of water in different parts of the body look more clear in the picture that is made

The Grand coalition refers to if the two biggest political parties in Germany join forces together

Persephone was a Greek goddess of grain and spring Also sometimes referred to as Caliope A daughter of Zeus and Demeter She was kidnapped by Hades and he makes her eat a pomegranate which is the fruit of the underworld According to some myths if one were to eat the fruit of the Underworld they would be forced to stay there This myth explains why the seasons change Supposedly Demeter was so sad over the disappearance of her daughter that she ignored her duties to the world during this time all plants died When Demeter went to the Underworld to rescue her Persephone Hades forced Persephone to eat the pomegranate After she ate this fruit it was supposed to keep her in the underworld with Hades so she would be forced to marry him In some versions she only ate 6 seeds from the pomegranate so Hades only made her stay 6 months of the year It is during the 6 months that Persephone is with Hades that Demeter weeps causing all plant life to die and during the six months that she is with Demeter life is sustained She does not have a throne on Olympus but her mother let her sit on her lap when Persephone was a child The only reason Hades kidnapped her is because he saw her running in a field and he thought she was beautiful

The Bundestag is the legislature of Germany It meets in Berlin in the Reichstag building which was specially rebuilt ready for the Bundestag to move from Bonn

The Bundestag has at least 598 members Every 4 years the German people vote

Each party gets seats if they got at least 5 of the votes Every voter has two votes one for a person and one for a party 299 members each represent a constituency just as in the British House of Commons or the US House of Representatives

The other half are elected from a party list in each Land The total number of seats a party gets depends on the number of the second party votes it gets

But if a party wins more constituency seats than its share of the party votes then it keeps those seats These extra seats or extra mandates are the reason the Bundestag sometimes has more than 598 members

The manager is Martin Bader and the coach is Dieter Hecking

World history as it is used here is about the study of the cultural achievements of the entire human race This includes the time from prehistory to the end of the 20th century and excludes natural history before the development of human beings

Modern human beings called Homo sapiens have lived since about 250000 years ago At this time there were other species of human that were a little different to Homo sapiens These include Homo erectus and Homo neanderthalensis The theory of human evolution is that humans slowly developed from other earlier species of human like creatures Biologists believe that Homo sapiens evolved in Africa and spread from there to all other parts of the world replacing Homo neanderthalensis in Europe and the Homo erectus in Asia 

Homo neanderthalensis generally called Neanderthal Man has this name because the cranium of a skull was found in the Neanderthal Valley in 1856 it was different from a modern skull Skeletons had been found in other places since then They had lived before modern humans and had the knowledge to use tools and fire When ancient stone tools are found their style often shows whether they were made by Homo sapiens or whether they were made by a Neanderthal By the end of the Stone Age it is believed that Homo sapiens were the only type of humans left

Climate has a very big effect on the way that humans live Climate is different from one part of the world to another Some areas are hot all the year and some are cold Some areas are dry all the year and others are wet Most areas have climates that are warm or hot in the summer and cool or cold in the winter Most parts of the world get rain at some times of the year and not others Some parts of the world have seaside climates and others have mountain climates All these things affect the way that humans live in different parts of the world 

Climate has an effect on the types of food that can be found in different parts of the world Everywhere that humans live there is a staple food This is the main food that most people eat most of the time A staple food is usually a grain or vegetable that is easy to grow Staple foods found in different countries are wheat maize millet rice oats rye potatoes yams breadfruit and beans Climate also affects the type of animals that are found or can be farmed in any area which affects the types of meat that are available to eat Climate also affects the buildings that people make the clothes that they wear and the way that they travel 

The climate on earth has not stayed the same through human history There are long periods of time where it is generally warmer and there are those where it is generally colder When it is generally colder there is more ice on the poles of the planet That is why such a period is called an ice age There have been many ice ages in the history of the earth Two have affected humans

From 70000 to around 10000 years ago there was a big ice age which affected humans and the way that they lived Between 1600 AD to around 1900 AD there was a period called the Little Ice Age when the climate was colder than usual

The word Prehistory means before history It is used for the long period of time before writing was invented and humans began to write down information about their lives This time is divided into two main ages the Paleolithic Age and the Neolithic Age The two ages do not have fixed dates The dates are different depending on the way that people lived in different places 

The end of prehistory varies from one place to another It depends on the date when written documents of a civilization can be found In Egypt the first written documents date from around 3200 BC In Australia the first written records date from 1788 and in New Guinea from about 1900 

In the Paleolithic era there were many different human species According to current research only the modern human Homo sapiens reached the Neolithic era

The Paleolithic Era is by far the longest age of humanitys time about 99 of human history The Paleolithic Age dates from about 26 million years ago and ended around 10000 BC The age began when hominids started to use stones as tools for bashing cutting and scraping The age ended when humans began to plant crops and have other types of agriculture In some areas such as Western Europe the way that people lived was affected by the Ice age In these places people moved towards agriculture quicker than in warmer places where there was always lots of food to gather Their culture is sometimes called the Mesolithic Era

During the Paleolithic Era humans grouped together in small bands They lived by gathering plants and hunting wild animals This way of living is called a hunter gatherer society The hunting was probably done mainly by the men being larger and stronger while the food gathering was done by the women The food that was hunted would have included small burrowing animals like rabbits as well as birds and herds of animals like deer and cattle The food that was gathered would have included grain of different sorts in different areas Grain is often found growing on grasslands where herds of grass eating animals are found Other gathered foods were root vegetables green vegetables beans fruit seeds berries nuts eggs insects and small reptiles 

Many Paleolithic bands were nomadic They moved from place to place as the weather changed They followed the herds of animals that they hunted from their winter feeding places to their summer feeding places If there was drought or flood or some other disaster the herds and the people might move a long distance looking for food During the Great Ice Age a lot of the water on the Earth had turned to ice The sea was much lower than it is now It is believed that at this time people were able to walk from Siberia to Alaska Although much of the area was covered with ice there was a strip of land running down to the part of North America that is now the United States Bands of Homo sapiens people travelled to that area from Asia At that time there were rich grasslands with many large animals that are now extinct It is believed that many groups of people travelled there over a long time and later spread to other parts of America as the weather changed

Paleolithic people used tools of stone Sometimes a stone tool was just a rock that was useful for smashing a shell or an animals skull or for grinding grain on another rock Other tools were made by deliberately breaking rocks to make a sharp edge The next development in stone tool making was to chip all the edges of a rock so that it made a pointed shape useful for a spearhead or arrow tip Some stone tools are carefully flaked at the edges to make them sharp and symmetrically shaped Paleolithic people also used tools of wood and bone They probably also used leather and vegetable fibers but these have not lasted from that time Paleolithic people also knew how to make fire which they used for warmth and cooking  FileProtobifaz Guelmim Es SemarajpgA simple stone tool from the Sahara region FileBiface feuille de laurierJPGA carefully made spear head from France ImageVenus von Willendorf 01jpgSmall female figures such as the Venus of Willendorf are the earliest sculptures of the human figure ImageLascaux2jpgA horse from Lascaux caves in France about 16000 years old Some cave paintings are 30000 years old 



The Neolithic era was marked by changes in society During the Neolithic era people started to settle down They developed agriculture They also domesticated animals both of which took a very long time Because of these two things people did not have to migrate as much any more Villages could grow to sizes much larger than before Over thousands more years humankind developed further intellectually militarily and spiritually Over time villages fought and spread their control over a large area and developed into more advanced civilisations

When humans started to grow crops and domesticate certain animals such as dogs goats sheep and cattle their society changed Because people now grew crops and raised livestock they started to settle and built permanent settlements In most places this happened between 10000 and 12000 years ago Their diet also changed People ate more cereals and vegetables People also started to store foods so that they would have seed to plant rather than simply eat In some years there were surpluses that could be traded for other goods 

These changes occurred in several places of the world independently They did not happen in the same order though The earliest farming societies in the Near East did not use pottery It is still unclear to what extent plants were grown in Britain or if permanently settled communities existed at all Early Japanese societies used pottery before developing agriculture

In the Paleolithic there were many different human species According to current research only the modern human reached the Neolithic era though

Vere Gordon Childe gave the name Neolithic Revolution to this process in the 1920s He thought that it was as important as the Industrial Revolution

Ancient history was the time from the development of writing to the fall of the Roman Empire The fall of the Roman Empire caused chaos in Europe leading to the Middle Ages

Sumer was the worlds first known ancient civilisation The Sumerians took over the fertile crescent region of Mesopotamia around 3300 BCE By 3000 BCE many cities had been built in Sumer These cities were separated by the geography of Mesopotamia They formed independently and each had their own government They were called city states and often fought with each other

Sumer grew crops on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers A surplus in food led to a Division of labour This means that some people were able to stop growing crops and do other jobs since enough crops were already grown This brought a split in society Today such a split is called social pyramid In a social pyramid people are grouped into social classes based on their wealth and power In Sumer the king priests and government officials were at the top of the social pyramid Below them were the artisans merchants farmers and fishers At the bottom of the pyramid were slaves Slaves were often prisoners of war criminals or people working to pay off debt

In Sumer only the sons of the rich and powerful learned how to read and write They went to a school called edubba Only the boys who went to edubba could become scribes

The Sumerians created the worlds first system of writing it was called cuneiform The oldest versions of one of the worlds first literary works the Epic of Gilgamesh go back to this time They also invented sun dried bricks the wheel the ox plow and were skilled at making pottery They are also thought to have invented the sailboat

Other civilizations around this time were also built along major river systems These civilizations are called river valley civilizations River valley civilizations were the most powerful civilizations in this time period because water was needed to have an agricultural society

These civilizations were similar to Sumer in that

In the river system of Mesopotamia after the Sumers two other great civilizations rose to power the Babylonians with their king Hammurabi and the Assyrians Just to the east was the long lasting civilization of Elam

Ancient Egypt grew along the Nile river and was its most powerful in the second millennium BC When it was its biggest it went all the way from the Nile delta to a mountain called Jebel Barkal in Sudan It was created around 3500 BC and probably ended at about 30 BC when the country was invaded by the Roman Empire 

The society of ancient Egypt depended on a balance of natural and human resources especially the irrigation of the Nile Valley so that Egyptians could grow crops They are also known for writing in hieroglyphs building the famous pyramids other sorts of tombs and big temples and for their military There was a great difference between classes in this society Most of the people were farmers but they did not own the agricultural products they produced These were property of the state temple or noble family that owned the land There was slavery but it is not clear how it was practiced The rulers of ancient Egypt tried to keep their people happy by religion that made them respect the rulers and their past

The religion of Judaism formed about 1500 BCE in context with the Egyptian and Babylonian civilization

The first dynasty of Ancient China the Shang Dynasty has been carbon dated through Turtle shells with writing on them to back to about 1500 BC They say China began as city states in the Yellow River valley At the end of the Zhou Dynasty lived the greatest Chinese philosophers Kong Fuzi founder of Confucianism and Laozi founder of Daoism The Qin emperor Qin Shi Huang in 221 BC created the first centralized state in China based on his political philosophy of legalism and made everyone write the same way He fought against Confucianism He also started a precursor of the Great Wall In 202 BC the Han Dynasty took over and developed an empire of similar strength as the Roman Empire and towards the end of its rule influenced by India introduced Buddhism in China

The Indus Valley Civilization started from about 2600 BC to 1900 BC It marked the beginning of the urban civilization on the subcontinent It was centered on the Indus River and its tributaries The civilization is famous for its cities that were built of brick had a road side drainage system and multi storied houses

During the Maurya dynasty started in 321 BCE most of the Indian subcontinent was united under a single government for the first time Ashoka the Great who in the beginning sought to expand his kingdom then followed a policy of ahimsa after converting to Buddhism The Edicts of Ashoka are the oldest preserved historical documents of India and under Ashoka Buddhist ideals spread across the whole of East Asia and South East Asia

The Gupta dynasty ruled from around 320 to 550 AD The Gupta Empire included only Central India and the area east of current day Bangladesh however this empire never included present day Pakistan to the west Gupta society was ordered in broken wikt linkaccordanceaccordance with Hindu beliefs Historians place the Gupta dynasty alongside with the Han Dynasty Tang Dynasty and Roman Empire as a model of a classical civilization

The Maya civilization is a civilization that started in Central America They lived mostly on the Yucatn Peninsula in what is now known as Mexico but also Honduras Belize and Guatemala They were the only known civilization of pre Columbian America to have a fully developed written language They also made great achievements in art and architecture and had a very advanced system of mathematics and astronomy

The area where the Maya civilization developed was inhabited from around the 10th millennium BC The first Maya settlements were built there in about 1800 BC in the Soconusco region This is in the modern day state of Chiapas in Mexico on the Pacific Ocean Today this is called the Early Preclassic period At the time humans began to settle down permanently They started to grow livestock Pottery and small clay figures were made They constructed simple burial mounds Later they developed these mounds into step pyramids There were other civilizations around especially in the north such as the Olmec the Mixe Zoque and Zapotec civilizations These people mostly lived in the area of the modern day state Oaxaca The exact borders of the Maya empire in the north are unclear There were probably areas where Maya culture overlapped with other cultures Many of the earliest significant inscriptions and buildings appeared in this overlapping zone These cultures and the Maya probably influenced one another

There has been a long history of contact between Papuan peoples of the Papua New Guinea and the Aboriginal people Aboriginal people seem to have lived a long time in the same environment as the now extinct Australian megafauna There are stories about that are told in the oral culture of many Aboriginal groups

The Hallstatt era is named after the city Hallstatt in Austria where the first artifacts were found It lasted from about 1200 BC to about 275 BC There were different periods which today are mainly told apart by the kinds of brooches used at the time These brooches changed rather rapidly and can therefore give us good guesses at to what time they came from Hallstatt culture sites have been found in the east of France in Switzerland in the south of Germany in Austria in Slovenia and Croatia northwestern Hungary southwestern Slovakia and southern Moravia The culture can be divided into an eastern and a western one quite easily the dividing line runs through the Czech Republic and Austria between longitudes 14 and 15 degrees east

In this time the social structure developed into a hierarchy This can be documented by various things that were added to graves In the Bronze Age people used to live in big settlements As iron became available trade routes changed A new richer class evolved Unlike before these richer class people liked to live in big houses in the countryside as a demonstration of their wealth Funerals also changed from cremation burials to burials with stone coffins The new upper class used their wealth for import goods mostly from the Mediterranean

The La Tne culture is a culture that lasted from about 500 BC to about 100 AD It is named after the city of La Tne It was influenced a lot by the Roman and Greek cultures There are two sources for this

The Celts basically lived in clans Each clan was headed by a leader which came from the Druids or the Bards Women were much better off than with the Romans they were almost equal to men There was polygyny and polyandry

Illyria is the part of west south Balkan Peninsula populated by Illyrians whose descendants are Albanians Illyrians lived in tribunes such as Epirus Dardania Taulantia etc They had their own language the Illyrian language that was different from the Greek language and Roman language At the year 1000 BC the population of Illyria is estimated to be around 500000

What is known today as Ancient Greece is a very important period in history Most people agree that it came after the Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations It ended when the Romans invaded Greece in 146 BC Greek culture had a very powerful influence on later civilizations especially the Romans The Greeks developed what is now called a city state or a polis There were many polises Some of the more important ones were Athens Sparta Corinth and Thebes The word politics comes from there It literally means things that are about the polis Greek cities did not have much contact with each other because of the mountains and many islands Greece is made up of When a city no longer had enough food to care for all its citizens some people were sent out to set up a new city This was called a colony Each city was independent and ruled by someone within that city Colonies also looked to the city where they originally came from for guidance

When Greece went to war there was an alliance of such city states against the Persians There were also many wars between different city states

There were many artists and philosophers who lived in that period Most of them are still important for philosophy today A well known artist was Homer He wrote epics about the war against the Trojans and the early history of Greece Other well known artists were Aristophanes and Sappho Well known philosophers include Socrates Plato and Aristotle A well known mathematician of the time was Euclid Statesmen of the time were Pericles and Alexander the Great

Ancient Rome was a civilization that started in modern day Italy in the 8th Century before Christ The civilization lasted for 12 centuries It ended when Mehmed II conquered Constantinople on May 29 1453 According to legend the Roman civilization was founded by Romulus and Remus in the year 753 BC The Roman Empire developed in wars against Carthage and the Seleucid Empire Julius Caesar conquered Gaul modern France and Augustus ended the Roman republic by becoming emperor At its biggest extent the empire covered all of the Mediterranean Rome became so big because it led war against other nations and then assimilated their culture

In 293 Diocletian organized a separate administration of the western and the eastern part of the empire The capital of the western part was Rome the capital of the eastern part was Constantinople Constantine I was the first to stop discrimination against Christians Christianity became state religion under the reign of Theodosius I 

The western part of the empire had many problems with barbarians In the 5th century the Huns migrated westwards This meant that the Visigoths moved into the empire to seek protection Rome was sacked by barbarians multiple times On September 4 476 the Germanic chief Odoacer forced the last Roman emperor in the west Romulus Augustus to quit After about 1200 years the rule of Rome in the West came to an end

The eastern part had similar problems Justinian I managed to conquer parts of North Africa and Italy Shortly after he died all that was left were parts of Southern Italy and Sicily In the east the empire was threatened by the Sassanid Empire

After the fall of Western Rome the Germanic tribes that took over tried to learn from Roman civilization but much was forgotten and up to the Renaissance not many achievements happened in Europe But with the rise of Islam many changes happened during the Islamic Golden Age The Greek and Roman traditions were kept and further development took place The Chinese civilization had a Golden Age during the Tang period when their capital was the biggest in the world During the Renaissance Europe developed and made great advancements in many areas as well

In Arabia Muhammad founded Islam in 632 His followers rapidly conquered territories in Syria and Egypt They soon were a direct threat to the Byzantine Empire that suffered from the Plague of Justinian In the 8th and 9th centuries the Byzantine Empire managed to stop Islamic expansion They even reconquered some of the territories lost earlier In 1000 AD the eastern Empire was at its height Basileios II reconquered Bulgaria and Armenia Culture and trade flourished Soon afterward the expansion was abruptly stopped This was in 1071 at the Battle of Manzikert The battle lead the empire into a dramatic decline For the Byzantine Empire this meant several centuries of civil wars and Turkic invasions The Muslim caliphate had an Golden Age under the Abbasid 

Their power forced Emperor Alexius I Comnenus of the Byzantine Empire to send a call for help to the West in 1095 The West sent the Crusades These eventually led to the Sack of Constantinople It was the participants of the Fourth Crusade who did that Constantinople was conquered in 1204 Because of this what was left of the Empire became fragmented into successor states The winner of these disputes was that of Nicaea After Constantinople was again conquered by imperial forces the empire was little more than a Greek state on the Aegean coast The Eastern Empire came to an end when Mehmed II conquered Constantinople on May 29 1453 The Ottoman Empire took its place and from 1400 to 1600 was the most powerful empire in the Middle East and ruled at the southern and eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea

The Tang Dynasty with its capital at Changan was the biggest city in the world at the time and is considered by historians as a high point in Chinese civilization as well as a golden age of broken wikt linkcosmopolitancosmopolitan culture The Ming Dynasty ruled from 1368 to 1644 The Ming built a vast army and navy

From around the 6th7th century In South India Chola kings ruled Tamil Nadu and Chera kings ruled Kerala They had trading relationships with the Roman Empire to the west and Southeast Asia to the east In north India Rajputs ruled in many kingdoms 

In 1336 two brothers named Harihara I and Bukka founded the Vijayanagara Empire in an area which is now in the Karnataka state of India The most famous king of this empire was Krishnadevaraya In 1565 rulers of this empire were defeated in a battle But the empire continued for about next one hundred years Northern India was ruled by Islamic sultans

The Heian Period in Japan is famous for its art poetry and literature The writing system Kana was developed It was followed by the feudal period during which samurai and daimyos were the leading figures and the shogun the real monarch whereas the tenn had only a role as religious head Between the years 1272 and 1281 the Mongols tried to invade but were driven out by the Japanese In 1542 a Portuguese ship reached Japan Japanese learned about guns and firearms from them

Genghis Khan in 1209 brought together the Mongol tribes and founded the Mongol Empire one of the largest land empires in history Later Kublai Khan would go on to expand the empire and found the Mongol ruled Yuan Dynasty of China The empire later broke into several empires all of which were later destroyed

The Middle Ages was the time from the fall of the Roman empire until the middle of the 15th century From 500 to about 800 there was some decline compared with the Roman civilization European villages were often destroyed and looted by barbarians such as the Vikings During the High Middle Ages magnificent castles and large churches called cathedrals were built and important works of literature were written In the later Middle Ages there was a plague called the Black Death The Black Death killed one third to one half of Europes population

A system called feudalism was a very important part of the Middle Ages In this system the king was at the top of the social pyramid The king gave land to the lord in exchange for loyalty The lords were the next in the pyramid The lords gave land to knights in exchange for loyalty and protection The knights became next in the pyramid Peasants were not part of the feudal system because they did not give or receive land They worked on a lords manor in exchange for protection

The Crusades were also fought during the Middle Ages There is a theory that says the Crusades helped end the Middle Ages along with the Black Death increased trade and better farming technology

The Renaissance started in Italy Renaissance is a French word meaning rebirth The Renaissance meant that people learned from the ancient Greek and Roman or classical cultures that had been forgotten for some time Artists learned from classical paintings and sculptures So they reinvented perspective and the art of free standing realistic sculptures that had been characteristic in Greek and Roman art Some famous Renaissance artists are Leonardo da Vinci Michelangelo and Raphael The Gutenberg printing press invented by Johannes Gutenberg was also developed during this time

The Renaissance was also a time of great achievements in science philosophy and literature

What is known as the classical period lasted from about 250 to about 900 During this time many monuments were constructed There are also many big inscriptions from then In this period the Maya moved to building large cities This is known as urbanism Many important intellectual and artistic developments happened in an area that is known as the southern lowlands

Like the Ancient Greek the Maya civilization was made of many independent city states Agriculture was important around these city states like Tikal and Copn The most important monuments are the pyramids they built in their religious centers and the palaces of their rulers The palace at Cancun is the largest in the Maya area There are no pyramids in the area of the palace Other important things the archaeologists found include the carved stone slabs usually called stelae These slabs show rulers along with hieroglyphic texts describing their genealogy military victories and other accomplishments

The Maya also had trade routes that ran over long distances They traded with many of the other Mesoamerican cultures such as Teotihuacan the Zapotec and other groups in central and gulf coast Mexico They also traded with non Mesoamerican groups that were farther away Archaeologists have found gold from Panama in the Sacred Cenote of Chichen Itza

Important trade goods were cacao salt sea shells jade and obsidian

In the 8th and 9th century the cities in the southern lowlands had problems and declined At the same time the Maya stopped making big monuments and inscriptions Shortly afterwards these cities were abandoned Currently archaeologists are not sure why this happened There are different theories Either ecological factors played a role in this or the cause of this abandonment was not related to the environment

In the north development went on form the 10th to about the 16th century The influences from the outside left more traces in the Maya culture at that time Some of the important sites in this era were Chichen Itza Uxmal and Coba At some point the ruling dynasties of Chichen and Uxmal declined Afterwards Mayapan ruled all of Yucatn until a revolt in 1450 The area then degenerated into competing city states until the Yucatn was conquered by the Spanish

By 1250 there developed other city states The Itza maintained their capital at Tayasal It ruled over an area extending across the Peten Lakes region including the community of Ekckixil on Lake Quexil Postclassic Maya states also survived in the southern highlands One of the Maya kingdoms in this area is responsible for the best known Maya work of historiography and mythology the Popol Vuh

The Spanish started to conquer Maya lands This took them much longer than with the Inca or Aztecs because there was no capital city This meant that when they had conquered one city this had little influence on the whole empire The last Maya states were finally subdued in 1697

The Maya people did not disappear though There are still about 6 million of them Some are well integrated others continue speak one of the Maya languages and uphold their cultural heritage

The Aztecs built an empire in Central America mainly in Mexico The empire lasted from the 14th to the 16th century Their capital was Tenochtitlan They spoke the Nahuatl language It was built on islands in a lake Tenochtitlan was one of the greatest cities of the world in that time

The Aztecs believed in polytheism Quetzalcoatl Huitzilopochtli and Tezcatlipoca were the most important Gods Sometimes the Aztecs killed humans to please their gods Between 1519 and 1521 the Spanish leader Hernn Corts defeated the Aztecs and took their empire Some Aztecs did not want to fight against the soldiers of Corts because they thought they were Gods

Today many Mexicans have Aztec and other Native American forefathers People still use Aztec symbols in Mexico On the Mexican flag there is a picture of an eagle on a cactus with a snake in its mouth This was an Aztec symbol Also the name Mexico is an Aztec word

The Aztecs ate a lot of plants and vegetables that could be grown easily in the Mexico area The main food that they ate was corn which they called maize Another food that they ate was squash

Aztecs also had a lot of harsh punishments for certain crimes For the following crimes the punishment was death adultery wearing cotton clothes cutting down a living tree moving a field boundary making your land bigger making someone elses smaller major theft and treason

The Incans were a civilized empire in western South America The Incans are called a pre Columbian empire This means that their country was here before Christopher Columbus They ruled parts of South America around what is now Peru for a little over 100 years until the Spanish invasion in the 16th century

The Incan empire or Tawantinsuyo meaning four regions in Quechua only lasted for about 100 years as the arrival of the Spaniards in 1532 conquered them Their main language was Quechua but as the Incas were basically made up of many different groups there were probably many other different languages

Their capital was in the city of Cusco or Qosqo in what is now southern Peru

Manco Capac founded the first Inca state around 1200 It covered the area around Cusco In the 1400s Pachacuti began to absorb other people in the Andes The expansion of the Inca Empire had started The Inca Empire would become the biggest empire in the Americas before Columbus

In 1532 the civil war ended The brothers Huascar and Atahualpa fought for who would succeed their father During this time the Spanish conquerors took possession of the Inca territory They were led by Francisco Pizarro In the following years the conquistadors managed to extend their power over the whole Andean region They suppressed successive Inca rebellions until the establishment of the Viceroyalty of Per in 1542 and the fall of the resistance of the last Incas of Vilcabamba in 1572 The Inca civilization ends at that time but many cultural traditions remain in some ethnic groups as Quechuas and Aymara people

Ancient Egypt and Carthage are well known civilizations of ancient Africa But there are not many written sources in large parts of Sub Saharan Africa the history of Africa is not easy to write about But with new techniques such as the recording of oral history historical linguistics and archeology knowledge has improved not only for the empires and kingdoms of Ethiopia Ghana Mali Nubia Kush and Kerma

Colonization happened after Christopher Columbus discovered the Americas European countries such as England France and Spain built colonies in the Americas These settlers fought the native Americans to take over their land The colonisation of the Americas was the beginning of modern times

An important part about discovering the Americas was the Columbian Exchange The Columbian Exchange brought new foods ideas and diseases to the Old World and New World changing the way people lived Historians believe that almost everyone as far as Asia was affected in some way by the Columbian Exchange

Protestant Reformation started with Martin Luther and the posting of the 95 theses on the door of the castle church in Wittenberg Germany At first he protested against corruption such as simony or the sale of indulgences But then it became clear that he had different ideas about the church doctrine He thought that Christians should only read the Bible to find out what God wants from them That meant that they did not need priests The three most important traditions that came directly from the Protestant Reformation were the Lutheran Reformed and Anglican traditions

The Counter Reformation or Catholic Reformation was the Catholic Church fighting the Protestant Reformation New religious orders such as the Jesuits were founded and missionaries sent around the world Decisions were taken at the Council of Trent

The Industrial Revolution started in Great Britain It brought many advances in the way goods were produced These advances allowed people to produce much more than they needed for living The early British Empire split as its colonies in America revolted to establish a representative government

The French Revolution lead to massive political change in continental Europe as people following the ideas of Enlightenment asked for human rights with the slogan libert egalit fraternit That led to the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen but also to terror and the execution of King Louis XVI The French leader Napoleon Bonaparte conquered and changed Europe through war up to 1815 As more and more small property holders were granted the vote in France and the UK socialist and trade union activity developed and revolution gripped Europe in 1848 The last broken wikt linkvestigevestiges of serfdom were abolished in Austria Hungary in 1848 Russian serfdom was abolished in 1861 The Balkan nations began to regain their independence from the Ottoman Empire After the Franco Prussian War Italy and Germany became unified in 1870 and 1871 Conflict spread across the globe in a chase for empires The search for a place in the sun ended with the outbreak of World War I In the desperation of war the Russian Revolution promised the people peace bread and land The defeat of Germany came at the price of economic destruction which was written down in the Treaty of Versailles

From 1644 to 1912 the Qing or Manchu Dynasty ruled China The dynasty was founded by the Manchu clan in northeast China It expanded into China proper and its surrounding territories establishing the Empire of the Great Qing Its military power weakened during the 1800s and faced with international pressure massive rebellions and defeats in wars the Qing Dynasty declined after the mid 19th century It was overthrown in 1912

During the Edo period Japan had many small rulers There were about 200 of them called the daimyo Out of them the Tokugawa clan was most powerful They ruled from a place called Edo This place was around the present days Tokyo For fifteen generations they were the most powerful clan in Japan 

Beginning from the early 17th century the rulers started a policy of broken wikt linkseclusionseclusion known as sakoku in Japanese language They suspected that traders merchants and missionaries wanted to bring Japan under the control of European powers Except the Dutch and the Chinese all foreigners traders and merchants from other countries missionaries were no longer allowed into Japan

Still even during the period of seclusion Japanese continued to gain information and knowledge about other parts of the world This policy of seclusion lasted for about 200 years It ended 1868 with Meiji Restoration when the emperor took over again and started a lot of reforms

The Mughal Empire existed from 1526 to 1857 When it was biggest it ruled most of the Indian subcontinent then known as Hindustan and parts of what is now Afghanistan It was founded by Babur in 1526 and ruled until 1530 Its most important ruler was Akbar After the death of Aurangjeb the Mughal Empire became weak It continued until 1857 By that time India came under the British Raj

Settlement by the Spanish started the European colonization of the Americas it meant genocide of the native Indians The Spanish gained control of most of the Caribbean and conquered the Aztecs So they founded the Spanish Empire in the New World 

The first successful English settlements were in North America at Jamestown 1607 and Plymouth 1620 The first French settlements were Port Royal and Quebec City The Fur Trade soon became the primary business on the continent and as a result transformed the Native Americans lifestyle Plantation slavery of the West Indies lead to the beginning of the Atlantic slave trade

Rivalry between the European powers created a series of wars on the North American landmass The American Revolution led to the creation of the United States of America Spains hold on its colonies weakened till it had to give them independence 

The United States expanded quickly to the west At the same time British built more in Canada

During the 15th century the Portuguese began exploring Africa At the Guinea coast they built their first fort in 1482 They started slave trade after the European discovery of America in 1492 to supply settlers from there with workers Soon English Spanish Dutch French and Danish broken wikt linkmarinermariners built their forts as well But their influence on the inland was minor till during the 19th century larger colonies were founded

The 20th century was a very important time in history New technology and different ideas led to many worldwide changes in the time of just 100 years

World War I was a war fought from 1914 to 1918 During the time of the war it was called The Great War or The War to End All Wars Chemical poisons tanks aeroplanes and bombs were used for the first time

There were four main causes of the war

These were causes that made it likely that a war would start in Europe The spark that started the war was the assassination of the heir to the throne in Austria Hungary Archduke Franz Ferdinand by a group of young Serbians Austria Hungary declared war on Serbia and each countrys allies then joined the war This created a bigger conflict which turned into World War I 

Europe divided into two groups of allies the Central Powers and the Allied Powers The Central Powers were made up of Germany Austria Hungary the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria The Allies were made up of Britain France Russia Italy and the United States

World War I was fought on two fronts the Eastern Front and the Western Front Trench warfare was commonly used on the Eastern Front

Because of a British blockade Germany began using U boats or submarines to sink British ships After the sinking of two ships with Americans on board and the public release of the Zimmermann Note The US declared war on Germany joining the Allies

On November 11 1918 Germany signed the armistice meaning the laying down of arms to end the war After the war ended the Treaty of Versailles was written and Germany was made to sign it They had to pay 33 million in reparations

After the war the German Empire the Russian Empire the Ottoman Empire and Austrian Empire ended and France and Britain got weaker The 1920s and 1930s had military related fascist dictators take control of Italy Germany Japan and Spain They were helped by the Great Depression starting in 1929 When Hitler in 1933 had gained power in Germany he prepared World War II

Of all the wars ever fought World War II involved the most countries and killed the most people More than 60 million people died making it the worst disaster of all time It lasted six years in Europe from 1939 to 1945 It was fought between the Axis Powers and the Allied Powers At first the Axis Powers were successful but that ended in Europe with the Battle of Stalingrad in 1943 and the invasion in Normandy in 1944 But Hitler was able to pursue his plan to annihilate Jews nearly all over Europe Today this plan is called the Holocaust In the Pacific it ended with the battles of Midway and Guadalcanal Germany surrendered on May 8 The atomic bombs on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki led Japan to surrender on August 15 1945

After World War II the United Nations was founded in the hope that it could solve arguments among nations and keep wars from happening Communism spread to Central and Eastern Europe Yugoslavia Bulgaria Romania Albania North Vietnam and North Korea In 1949 China became communist During the 1950s and 1960s many third world countries became communist

This led to the Cold War a forty year argument between the United States the Soviet Union and their allies Each country wanted to promote their type of government The Soviet Union wanted to spread communism and the United States wanted to spread democracy People across the world feared a nuclear war because of the tension 

Communism became less popular when it became clear that it could not promote economic growth as well as Western states and that it was not suited for a reform that allowed freedom of speech for everybody Therefore the Soviet Union forced Hungary to give up its reform in 1956 it favoured the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961 and it stopped reform in Czechoslovakia in 1968 When in 198889 Gorbachev made clear that he would not force the countries of the East block to stick to Communism the Berlin Wall was torn down in 1989 and the Soviet Union collapsed Then the United States was the only superpower left

After Mao Zedongs death Chinas communist party proved that economic reform was possible without political freedom and paved the way for enormous economic growth

As the 20th century ended the European Union began to rise and included former satellite states and even parts of the Soviet Union States in Asia Africa and South America tried to copy the European Union

The twentieth century was a time of great progress in terms of technology People began to live longer because of better medicine and medical technology New communications and transportation technologies connected the world But these advances also helped cause problems with the environment

The last half of the century was the rise of the information age and globalisation These two things increased trade and cultural exchange Space exploration expanded all through the solar system The structure of DNA was discovered

The same period also raised questions about the end of human history because of unmanaged global dangers nuclear weapons greenhouse effect and other problems in the environment

As the 20th century ended and the 21st century started people relying on one another to deal with common dangers could be achieved Some scientists referred to this as a Planetary Phase of Civilization
