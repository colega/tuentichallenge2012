Morphology is a way of studying language It is about the way words are put together their internal structure 

Words are accepted as being the smallest units of a sentence It is clear that in most languages words can be related to other words by rules For example English speakers know that the words dog dogs and dog catcher are closely related English speakers simply know these relations from their personal experience of the rules of word formation in English They simply know that dog is to dogs as cat is to cats They know that dog is to dog catcher as dish is to dishwasher These rules come from specific patterns in the way words are formed from smaller units and how those smaller units work together in speech Morphology is the part of linguistics that studies patterns of word formation within and across languages Morphology tries to formulate rules that show the knowledge of the speakers of those languages

In linguistics syntax is the study of the rules that govern the structure of sentences 

The term syntax can also be used to refer to these rules themselves as in the syntax of a language Modern research in syntax attempts to describe languages in terms of such rules and for many practitioners to find general rules that apply to all languages 

The 1912 Summer Olympics officially known as the Games of the V Olympiad were held in 1912 in Stockholm Sweden For the first time athletes in the Games came from all five continents symbolized in the Olympic rings It was also the last time that solid gold medals were given to winners modern medals are usually silver covered in gold The main arena was Stockholms Olympiastadion

28 nations competed in Stockholm

Vyacheslav Vsevolodovich Ivanov is a SovietRussian historical linguist His main topic of study is Indo European languages He is best known for his glottalic theory of how consonants are spoken in Indo European languages and for placing point of origin for these languages in the area of the Armenian Highlands and Lake Urmia

Vyacheslav Ivanovs father was Vsevolod Ivanov one of the most famous Soviet writers His mother was an actress She worked in the theatre of Vsevolod Meyerhold His childhood was filled by disease and war which he spent in Tashkent

Tamaz V Gamkrelidze is a Georgian linguist orientalist and public benefactor Academician and President of the Georgian Academy of Sciences Doctor of Sciences Professor

Gamkrelidze was born in Kutaisi His brother Revaz Gamkrelidze is also an Academician a famous mathematician

The Georgian alphabet is used to write in the Georgian language and other Kartvelian languages The alphabet is called Mkhedruli first said around in the 11th century 

Greek and Aramaic influences have been shown but some Georgian scholars like Tamaz V Gamkrelidze have said that they were freely invented in imitation of the Greek model rather than directly based upon earlier forms of the Aramaic alphabet even though the Georgian phonological inventory is very different from Greek

Cytosine is one of the 5 main nucleobases used in storing and transporting genetic information within a cell in the nucleic acids DNA and RNA 

In DNA and RNA cytosine is paired with guanine However it is unstable and can change into uracil This can lead to a point mutation if not repaired by the DNA repair enzymes such as uracil glycosylase which cleaves a uracil in DNA

The 1908 Summer Olympics officially known as the Games of the IV Olympiad were held in 1908 in London England These games were originally scheduled to be held in Rome At the time they were the fifth modern Olympic games However it was later decided that the 1906 Summer Olympics would not be considered an official Olmpiad

Italian authorities were preparing for the Games when Mount Vesuvius erupted on April 7 1906 devastating the nearby city of Naples Money that would have gone to the Olympics in Rome were used to help re construct Naples London was then selected to host the Games and they were held in White City alongside the Franco British Exhibition which at the time was the more noteworthy event Berlin and Milan were the other candidates

The 1908 Games had athletes representing 22 National Olympic Committees Argentina Finland Turkey and New Zealand made their first appearance at the Olympic Games

Guanine is one of the five main nucleobases found in the nucleic acids DNA and RNA

The others are adenine cytosine thymine and uracil With the formula C5H5N5O guanine is a derivative of purine 

Guanine along with adenine and cytosine is present in both DNA and RNA whereas thymine is usually seen only in DNA and uracil only in RNA 

The glottalic theory says that Proto Indo European had ejective stops instead of voiced ones namely p t k rather than b d g to the traditional reconstruction of the Proto Indo European sound system

The glottalic theory was made in the United States by Paul Hopper and in the Soviet Union by Thomas V Gamkrelidze and Vyacheslav V Ivanov In its earliest theory made by the Danish linguist Holger Pedersen it did not involve the use of glottalized sounds While earlier linguists such as Andr Martinet and Morris Swadesh had seen the potential of substituting glottalic sounds for the supposed plain voiced stops of Proto Indo European the request stayed speculative until more evidence for it was published in 1973 by Hopper in the journal Glossa and by Gamkrelidze and Ivanov in the journal Phonetica

Proto Indo European may refer to

The Proto Indo Europeans were a group of people after the last Ice age Their existence from 4000 BC or earlier is implied by their language They were the speakers of the Proto Indo European language an unwritten but now partly reconstructed prehistoric language

Knowledge of them comes not only from language but also from archaeology and archaeogenetics They were a group of loosely related peoples ancestral to the Bronze Age Indo Europeans 

The Proto Indo Europeans likely lived during the Copper Age or roughly the 5th to 4th millennia BC Mainstream scholarship places them in the general region of the steppes in Eastern Europe and Central Asia Some scholars would extend the time of PIE much further back

By the mid 2nd millennium BC offshoots of the Proto Indo Europeans had reached Anatolia the Aegean Northern India and likely Western Europe

The Proto Indo European culture had some or all of these features

The Proto Indo Europeans were a patrilineal society probably half nomadic relying on animal husbandry notably of cattle and sheep They domesticated the horse ekwos The cow played a central role in religion and mythology as well as in daily life A mans wealth would have been measured by the number of his animals peus 

They practiced a polytheistic religion centered on sacrificial rites probably administered by a priestly caste Burials in barrows or tomb chambers Important leaders would have been buried with their belongings and possibly also with members of their households or wives

Many Indo European societies know a threefold division of priests a warrior class and a class of peasants or husbandmen If there was a separate class of warriors it probably consisted of single young men They would have followed a separate warrior code unacceptable in the society outside their peer group Traces of initiation rites in several Indo European societies suggest that this group identified itself with wolves or dogs

As for technology reconstruction suggests a culture of the early Bronze Age with bronze tools and weapons Silver and gold were known Sheep were kept for wool and textiles were woven The wheel was known certainly for ox drawn carts and late Proto Indo European warfare may also have made use of horse drawn chariots

The native name of this people cannot be reconstructed with certainty Aryo sometimes upheld as a self identification of the Proto Indo Europeans is shown only in the Indo Iranian subfamily since it appears on written inscriptions however the Proto Indo Europeans themselves had not yet adopted writing so there is no way to verify that Aryo was their self identification

Urheimat is a linguistic term meaning the original homeland of the speakers of a proto language Since many peoples tend to wander and spread there is no exact Urheimat but there is an Indo European Urheimat different from the Germanic or Romance Urheimat Recent studies say the original home of Indo Europeans was near the Armenian Highlands

Specific hypotheses

The Anatolian hypothesis of Proto Indo European origin is that the speakers of the Proto Indo European language lived in Anatolia during the Neolithic era When the Neolithic Revolution took place in the seventh and sixth millennia BC the speakers spread over Europe Those who advocate this hypothesis think that the Indo European languages originated in Anatolia They believe that the Proto Indo Europeans then migrated north to the location north of the Caucasus Mountains There is an another hypothesis called the Kurgan hypothesis The people who support it say the Indo European languages came from the Caucasus One of the best known advocates of the Anatolian hypothesis is Colin Renfrew

Rafael Ishkhanyan or Ishkhanian is a well known Armenian philologist and historian He was a professor of the Yerevan State University

In 1939 Ishkhanyan entered the department of Armenian language and literature of Yerevan State University He fought in World War II After the war he continued his studies and graduated from Yerevan University in 1949

His works are generally dedicated to the earliest history of the Armenian people to the comparative linguistic analysis of ancient languages and to printing He is one of the authors of Armenian Soviet encyclopedia

He was a Deputy to the Supreme Soviet Armenia in 1990 1996

Ishkhanyan claims that Armenians were the aborigines of the Armenian plateau who have been living there continuously since the fourth millennium BCE at the latest Similar claims were promoted in nationalist novels such as those of Sero Khanzatian published in the 1970s 

A Cross country race is any running race that takes place on different types of terrain Different levels of competition include middle school convert2mikmlkonabbron1 high school convert5kmmiabbron1 collegiate men convert8kmmiabbron1 and convert10kmmiabbron1 women 5km and convert6kmmiabbron1 amateur and professional 

The scoring in these events gives one point to the winner two points to the person who finished second and so on In an invitational or meet where teams of runners count up the points of their top five finishers This is their score The team with the lowest score wins If there is a tie the team with the fastest sixth man wins

Times in races depend on the terrain weather and the other runners This means that two athletes competing in different places in the world who are running the same time might not be at the same ability level

A long distance race is any running event on the track that is longer than 3000m This includes such events as the 3000m run the 3000m steeplechase the 3200m run the two mile run the three mile run 5000m run five mile run six mile run and 10000m run and so on

The Treaty of Warsaw is a treaty between West Germany and the Peoples Republic of Poland It was signed on December 7 1970 and ratified by the German Bundestag on May 17 1972

In the treaty both sides committed themselves to nonviolence and accepted the existing border  the Oder Neisse line This was a very sensitive topic at the time as Poland was concerned that one day a German government would lay claim to some of the territory Germany lost after World War II Poland tookover this territory to replace the parts of east A lot of that land was east of the Curzon Line and Poland kept it aftern the Polish Soviet War

Chancellor Willy Brandt was heavily criticized by the conservative CDUCSU opposition which indeed were in favour of such a claim accusing him of abandoning German interests The Oder Neisse line was reaffirmed by a reunited Germany in the German Polish Border Treaty signed on 14 November 1990

In the FRG at the time this treaty signed it was not seen as the last word on the border because article IV stated that previous treaties like the Potsdam Agreement were not superseded by this latest agreement so the provisions of this treaty could be changed by a final peace treaty between Germany and the Allies of World War II as provided for in the Potsdam Agreement

The History of Poland is the history of rather different territories during the past millennium At one time in the 16th century the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth was the second largest state in Europe after Russia At other times there was no separate Polish state at all Poland got back its independence in 1918 after more than a century of rule by its neighbours but its borders shifted again after the Second World War

Poland began to form into a country around the middle of the 10th century in the Piast dynasty In 966 Prince Mieszko I got himself and the whole Polish nation christened 

In the 12th century Poland broke into some smaller states which were later attacked by Mongol armies in 1241 In 1320 Wadysaw I became the King of the repaired Poland His son Casimir III repaired the Polish economy built new castles and won the war against the Ruthenian dukedom The Black Death which affected many parts of Europe from 1347 to 1351 did not come to Poland

Beginning with the Lithuanian Grand Duke Jogaila the Jagiellon dynasty formed the Polish Lithuanian Union The partnership proved beneficial for the Poles and Lithuanians who played a dominant role in one of the most powerful empires in Europe for the next three centuries The Nihil novi act adopted by the Polish Sejm in 1505 transferred most of the legislative power from the Monarch to the Sejm This event marked the beginning of the period known as Nobility Commonwealth when the State was ruled by the free and equal Polish nobility The Lublin Union of 1569 established the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth as an influential player in European politics and a vital cultural entity

In the 17th century Sweden attacked all of Poland Many wars against the Ottoman Empire Russia Cossacks Transylvania and Brandenburg Prussia ended in 1699 During the following 80 years the government and nationed were weaker making Poland dependent on Russia Russian tsars took advantage of this by offering money to traitors who would block new ideas and solutions Russia Prussia and Austria broke Poland into three pieces in 1772 1793 and 1795 which dissolved the country Polish people did not like the new kings and often rebelled

In 1791 in an attempt of reform the Sejm of Poland and Lithuania accepted the Constitution of May 3 which was the first modern constitution in Europe and the second on Earth But that did not help against the partitions of Poland in 1793 and 1795 on 123 years 

Napoleon made another Polish state the Ghosts of Warsaw but after the Napoleonic wars Poland was split again by the countries at the Congress of Vienna The eastern part was ruled by the Russian tsar 

During World War I all Western Allies agreed to save Poland Soon after the surrender of Germany in November 1918 Poland became the Second Polish Republic It got its freedom after several military conflicts the largest was in 1919 1921 Polish Soviet War

On September 1 1939 Nazi Germany attacked Poland and the Soviet Union attacked on September 17 Warsaw was defeated on September 28 and was split up into two pieces one owned by Nazi Germany the other by the Soviet Union The eastern part of the German zone was turned into the German Government area Out of all the countries that were in the war Poland lost the highest amount of its people over 6 million died half of them Polish Jews Poland also gave the most troops after the US the British and the Soviets to ultimately defeat Nazi Germany At the wars end Polands borders were moved west pushing the east border to the Curzon line The west border was moved to the Oder Neisse line The new Poland became 20 smaller by 77500 square kilometeres The shift forced millions of people to move Poles Germans Ukrainians and Jews After these events Poland became for the first time a real country There are still many Polish in the neighboring countries Ukraine Belarus and Lithuania as well as in other countries The most Poles outside of Poland are in the United States especially in Chicago

After the Second World War the Soviet Union put a Communist government in Poland and the country was named the Peoples Republic of Poland In 1989 Solidarity  a political group led by Lech Wasa  helped defeat the communist government in Poland

During the early 1990s the country turned its economy into one of the most solid in Central Europe There were many improvements in human rights such as free speech democracy etc In 1991 Poland became a member of the Visegrad Group and joined NATO in 1999 also with the Czech Republic and Hungary Polish voters then voted to join the European Union in a vote in June 2003 The country joined the EU on May 1 2004

The term Polish Lithuanian union means a development from personal union between the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania to the creation of the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth the Republic of the Two Nations in 1569 and eventually to the creation of a short lived broken wikt linkunitaryunitary state in 1791

The most important acts in the process of union were

A personal union is a relationship of two or more sovereign states which through law share the same person as their head of state 

Personal unions can begin for very different reasons The case that a princess who is already married to a king becomes pregnant and their child inherits the crown of both countries is a rather common cause But a personal union sometimes was seen as a means against uprisings if a state wants an annexation of an other state These unions can be written down in a constitution that clearly expresses that both states shall share the same person as head of state but that is not always the case Under these circumstances a personal union can easily be broken

The actual situation was slightly more complex with the Dutch provinces Holland Zeeland Utrecht Gelderland and Overijssel entering into personal union in 1689 and Drenthe in 1696 Only 2 Dutch provinces never entered into the personal union Friesland and Groningen

Scordatura in music is a technique in which players of string instruments tune their strings to different notes from a normal tuning The word scordatura is an Italian word which means mistuning It was used for lutes guitars viols and instruments of the violin family

Using a scordatura tuning made the instrument sound different For example a string tuned to a slightly higher note will sound louder and brighter because it is tighter Care has to be taken not to tune it too high otherwise it will break Scordatura also made it possible to play unusual chords or combinations of notes in string crossing

When a composer writes for an instrument using scordatura tuning he shows at the beginning of the music what notes the strings must be tuned to The music is then written not as it sounds but so that the player can read it as if the instrument were being played normally eg if a G string is tuned up to G and the composer wants a G he simply writes a G but it will sound G

Scordatura tuning was mainly popular in the Baroque period from 1600 1750 Composers such as Heinrich Biber often used it He composed a group of sonatas for violin and accompaniment called the Rosary Sonatas In each sonata the violin is tuned in a different way In Sonata XI he even asks the violinist to make the two middle strings cross over between the bridge and the tailpiece so that the violin is tuned to two Gs and two Ds

In the classical period a famous example of scordatura is Mozarts Sinfonia Concertante for Violin Viola and Orchestra in which he asks the viola to tune all four strings a semitone higher than usual This makes it sound louder and brighter so that it matches the brightness of the violin especially as the violin is playing with normal tuning in the key of E flat which sounds a soft key

In the late 19th century and 20th century there are examples of composers using scordatura In his Fourth Symphony Mahler asks the violin soloist to play on a violin tuned to Gsharp D A Eflat The music is describing a poor beggar playing a violin The violin soloist needs a second instrument for this so that he can swap quickly back to a normal violin

Saint Sans asks the solo violin in Danse Macabre to tune the E string to Eflat to make it sound like the devil

Zoltn Kodly wrote a sonata in B minor for solo cello for which the cellist has to tune down the two lower strings to F and B instead of G and C This helps to make a very dark rich sound when playing B minor chords

The Armenian Origin of the Etruscans shows a link between the Armenians and the Etruscans 

Some scholars also see in Urartean art architecture language and general culture traces of kinship to the Etruscans of the Italian peninsula

Dr Bugge a learned Norwegian had made a suggestion presented a while ago by the late Dr Robert Ellis of London that the Etruscan was an Armenian dialect 

Etruscan words have been shown from the resources of the Armenian the Albanian and the Rhaeto Romansch languages

Etruscan can mean

The Etruscan language was spoken and written by the Etruscan civilization in the ancient area of Etruria and in parts of Lombardy Veneto and Emilia Romagna in Italy

Inscriptions have been found in north west and west central Italy in the region that even now has a name that came from the Etruscans Tuscany as well as in todays Latium north of Rome in todays Umbria west of the Tiber around Capua in Campania and in the Po valley to the north of Etruria This is probably the area in Italy where the language was once spoken

The Albanian language is a Indo European language It is spoken mostly in Albania Kosovo and 500000 Republic of Macedonia

The Trialeti culture was seen around the 2nd millennium BC In the late 3rd millennium BC settlements of the Kura Araxes culture began to be replaced by early Trialeti culture sites The Trialeti culture was the second culture to appear in the Caucasus after the Kura Araxes culture The Trialeti culture shows close ties with the highly developed cultures of the ancient world particularly with the Aegean

The Kura Araxes culture or the Early trans Caucasian culture a people that lived from 3400 BC until about 2000 BC  The earliest evidence for this culture is found on the Ararat plain thence it spread to Georgia by 3000 BC

The land they lived in are now Armenia Georgia and the Caucasus

Age of Empires is a series of real time strategy computer games made by Ensemble studios and published by Microsoft Game Studios 

There are three games in the series so far These are Age of Empires Age of Empires II and Age of Empires III There is also a spinoff game called Age of Mythology It is very similar to Age of Empires but players can also control monsters like the cyclops

In Age of Empires the player usually guides a small tribe of people to build a city The people called villagers can hunt deer collect berries and farm for food They can chop trees for wood They can collect gold and stone at mines in the ground The villagers build buildings to make a large city

There are enemy cities that the player must destroy When the player has enough food wood gold and stone the player can train soldiers to fight the enemy At the beginning of the game the player only gets weak soldiers but the player can get better and better units as time goes on

Each game takes place over four or five time periods called ages Each players starts in the first age and wants to get to the last age Each game has a different set of ages

When a player has enough food and gold to advance to the next age the player must wait After about a minute the city reaches the next age The players buildings look different and the player can do new things to improve his town and soldiers New powerful soldiers such as archers cavalry and catapults can be used The player can build walls and towers to defend the city The player can even build a Wonder of the World which is a huge building that costs 1000 food 1000 wood 1000 gold and 1000 stone

All of the Age of Empires games are usually good because the game makes sure no type of soldier is too powerful There is always a way to kill a large group of enemy units For example if a group of twenty archers is attacking the player should fight back with cavalry Many people call this balance because it is impossible for one unit to get too powerful

The Age of Empires games have many different groups of people to choose from Each group has a different set of soldiers and abilities 

There are three common ways to play Age of Empires

Age of Empires can be played alone or online against human players Age of Empires used to have the MSN Gaming Zone but that no longer works Age of Empires can still be played online using programs like GameRanger

A bridge on a string instrument is something that stands on the body of the instrument and supports the strings It sends the vibrations of the strings to the main part of the instrument so that the sound can be heard

The bridge of an instrument in the violin family can be seen very clearly It is a piece of hardwood which is shaped like a bridge The top is like an arch in shape because the player needs to be able to play on one string at a time The feet of the bridge have to be shaped to fit on the front of the instrument which is curved The bridge is not fixed to the instrument it is only held up because of the tension of the strings The soundpost a small wooden column inside the body is also held up by tension of the strings and the bridge The part of the string which vibrates and gives the note is the part between the bridge and the top of the fingerboard The other end of the string is fixed to a tailpiece

On a banjo the bridge works in the same way but on a guitar the bridge is fixed to the instrument and the strings are fixed to the bridge

There are even instruments with moveable bridges such as the Japanese koto which has a separate bridge for each string

Amati is the name of a family of Italian violin makers Between about 1549 to 1740 they made some of the most wonderful violins that were ever produced They worked in Cremona in Italy the town which is famous for violin making 

The first famous member of the family was Andrea Amati who was born some time before 1511 and died in Cremona on 24 December 1577 He can be thought of as the inventor of the violin in its modern form He made violins violas and cellos A small number of his instruments are still in existence They are dated between 1564 and 1574 and they have the coat of arms of Charles IX of France on the back

Andrea Amatis two sons were Antonio Amati who was born about 1540 in Cremona and died there on 14 February 1607 and Girolamo Amati who was born about 1561 in Cremona and died of the plague there on 21 October 1630 They are known as The Brothers Amati but they did not work much together However they both produced some great instruments They made the shape of the f holes perfect and gave their instruments more strength They also made some large violas and cellos They had an enormous influence on all other violin makers

Nicol Amati was the son of Girolamo Amati He is now the most famous member of the family He was born on 3 December 1596 and died on 12 April 1684 He was the most eminent of the family He had become a very skilled violin maker by 1630 when his father died During the next few years there was a lot of suffering because of the plague and not many people could afford to buy instruments Then after 1640 there was more demand again and Nicol made many great instruments Those that have survived are among the most sought after and expensive violins today He made instruments that were slightly wider and were known as the Grand Pattern Many other violin makers learned from him These pupils include Andrea Guarneri and possibly also Antonio Stradivari

The last maker of the family was Nicolos son Girolamo Amati known as Hieronymus II He was born on 26 February and died on 21 February 1740 Although he made some improvements to his fathers instruments they are not as good Antonio Stradivari became the greatest violin maker at this time

Aqua regia is a chemical substance It is made by mixing one part nitric acid and three parts hydrochloric acid It is one of the few substances that can dissolve gold and platinum and other noble metals Tantalum iridium and a few other metals are not dissolved by it

Aqua regia was discovered around 800 AD by the Persian alchemist Geber when he mixed common salt with vitriol In the Middle Ages it was one of the ways that alchemists tried to find the philosophers stone 

When Germany invaded Denmark in World War II the Hungarian chemist George de Hevesy took the Nobel Prize medals of Max von Laue and James Franck to keep them safe De Hevesy dissolved the medals which were made of gold into aqua regia He did this so the Nazis would not steal them He placed the jar that held the solution of aqua regia and gold on a shelf in his laboratory at the Niels Bohr Institute The jar looked the same as hundreds of other jars in the laboratory The Nazis thought that all the jars had normal chemicals in them After the war de Hevesy returned to the lab He found the jar with the solution and removed the gold from it He returned the gold to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences The Nobel Foundation used the gold to make new medals for Laue and Franck

Aqua Regia is used in metal etching and scientific analysis It is also used to clean certain lab machines from tiny metal particles It is particularly used in the purification and extraction of gold and platinum

Intonation in music can have two different meanings

In music tuning an instrument means getting it ready so that when it is played it will sound at the correct pitch not too high or too low

When two or more instruments play together it is particularly important that they are in tune with one another This means that when they play the same note it is indeed exactly the same note If the two instruments are not in tune with one another it will sound unpleasant because two notes which are very slightly different in pitch will produce a beat

Instruments such as the piano or organ have to be tuned by people who are specialists in tuning For most instruments however the players themselves need to tune their instruments before they play Players of string instruments can turn the pegs at the top of their instruments to change the tension of the string Players of wind instruments can make their instruments very slightly longer or shorter by pushing out or pulling in one of the joints Timpanists turn the taps which are around the top of their instruments to change the tension of the drum head

When an orchestra gives a concert the instruments have to tune carefully so that they are in tune with one another Usually it is the principal oboists job to stand up and play the note A so that everyone can tune to that note In some countries such as the US it is tradition for the principal violinist to give the A If the orchestra are going to play with a piano soloist they will have to tune to the A of the piano because the piano has already been tuned by the piano tuner

When a violinist tunes his instrument he is making sure that his four strings are tuned perfectly to G D A and E Each string is wound around a peg near the top of the scroll so that turning the peg changes the tuning He may also have adjusters or fine tuners which are at the other end of the string where it is attached to the tailpiece The adjusters make it easier to make small changes to the tuning The violinist will make sure that the A is in tune then the A and D can be played together so that they are exactly a fifth apart then the D and G and finally the A and E are compared

If they are not tuning to a piano players of instruments sometimes use a tuning fork which gives an exact note so that they know they are in tune There are also electronic tuning devices

When an instrument such as the piano is tuned the piano tuner has to know how to make each note relate correctly to the others During the course of music history there have been several systems of doing this These different tuning systems are all about the exact scientific relationship between the notes of the scale There has been an enormous amount of discussion among musicians about how best to tune instruments

When two notes are an octave apart the higher note is vibrating at twice the speed of the lower note For example if a string is vibrating at 440 Hz the note we hear is an A If the string is stopped halfway up it will vibrate at 880 Hz and we will hear the note one octave higher

The note which vibrates at 1 times the frequency of the basic note will be the note a perfect fifth higher

If a piano tuner starts by tuning a C then tunes a G so that it is exactly 1 times the frequency of the C he can continue tuning in fifths until he arrives back at C again However he will find that for mathematical reasons the last C is not in tune with the first C This was discovered long ago by Pythagoras and is called the comma of Pythagoras

Solutions to the comma of Pythagoras 

Musical tuning systems throughout the centuries have tried to find ways of dealing with this problem From the 16th century onwards several music theorists wrote long books about the best way to tune keyboard instruments They often started by tuning up a fifth and down a fifth so that these notes were perfectly in tune then they would continue until they met in the middle around F sharp Sometimes old organs today are tuned by such a method Playing in keys with very few sharps or flats sounds very beautiful but playing in keys with lots of sharps or flats sounds horribly out of tune

Around the time of the great composer Johann Sebastian Bach a new system called well tempered was developed in which the comma of Pythagoras is spread over all the notes of the octave This meant that it was possible to play in any key Bach wrote two books of 24 preludes and fugues to prove that it was now possible to play in any key

Here are some of the main ways of tuning the twelve note chromatic scale which have been developed in order to get round the problem that an instrument cannot be tuned so that all intervals are perfect

This is a list of Members of the Red Army Faction After Andreas Baader escaped from jail in 1970 the media began referring to the Baader Meinhoff Gang When Baader and Meinhof were arrested they became known as the Red Army Faction

The Captain of Kpenick was a German shoemaker criminal and impostor who became world famous in 1906 for a trick he played in Berlin when he pretended to be a Captain in the army

Voigt was born in Tilsit a town which was then part of Germany but is now called Sovetsk near Kaliningrad Russia In 1863 aged 14 he was sent to prison for 14 days for stealing He was expelled from school 

Voigts father taught him how to make shoes However Voigt continued to steal and forge and was often sent to prison Eventually he was let out of prison in 1906

Voigt travelled around until he went to live with his sister who lived near Berlin He worked briefly as a court shoemaker until on August 24 1906 police expelled him from Berlin as an undesirable Although he was supposed to have gone to Hamburg he stayed in Berlin He could not get a job because he was an unregistered citizen but he could not register to live in Berlin because he had no job

On October 16 1906 Voigt was ready for the big adventure that made him famous He had bought parts of a captains uniform from different shops He had resigned from the shoe factory ten days before He put on the captains uniform and went to the local army barracks stopped four grenadiers and a sergeant on their way back to barracks and told them to come with him These soldiers had been taught to obey officers without asking any questions so they did what they were told He told the commanding sergeant to report to his boss and told 6 more soldiers to come with him Then he took a train with the soldiers to Kpenick east of Berlin occupied the local city hall and told the soldiers to guard all the exits He told the local Police to go and look for people breaking the law and told the local Post Office not to let anyone make telephone calls to Berlin for an hour

He arrested the town secretary and the mayor saying that they had been taking money from the town hall and he took a large amount of money 4002 marks and 37 pfennigs signing a receipt for it but using the name of the governor of the jail where he had been Then he stopped two carriages and told the grenadiers to use them to take the mayor and the treasurer to the police so that they could be questioned He told the remaining guards to stand in their places for half an hour Then he went to the train station Later he changed back into ordinary clothes and disappeared

During the next few days the newspapers around the world reported what had happened Everybody seemed to think it was a very amusing joke

Voigt was arrested on October 26 and on December 1 he was sentenced to four years in prison for forgery impersonating an officer and wrongful imprisonment However so many people seemed to have sympathy with Voigt Even the Emperor Wilhelm II was probably amused by it and he pardoned him on August 16 1908

In England everybody thought the whole story was funny The English people thought it showed that the stereotype they had about Germans was right ie that they were taught to obey orders and not to think

After Voigt had been pardoned and let out of jail he spent his remaining years travelling to many countries including United States and Canada where he told people about his great adventure He appeared in small theatres and signed lots of photographs A waxwork was made of him in Madame Tussauds museum in London

In 1910 he moved to Luxembourg and worked as a waiter and shoemaker Two years later he bought a house and retired but the inflation after World War I made him poor Voigt died in Luxembourg

Many plays and movies were written about him including a play by the German author Carl Zuckmayer called Der Hauptmann von Kpenick Several movies were produced about the affair including an English language adaptation by John Mortimer

The Hittites were an ancient people from Anatolia who spoke an Indo European language They established a kingdom centered at Hattusa in north central Anatolia from the 18th century BC

At its peak the Hittite Empire covered most of modern Turkey and Syria This was under the reigns of Suppiluliuma I and Mursili II They had up and down relationships with Ancient Egypt to the south and the Assyrian Empire in Mesopotamia They were a party to the first known peace treaty which was made with Ramesses II of Egypt by Hattusili III in 1258 BC

After 1180 BC the empire disintegrated into several independent Neo Hittite city states some surviving until as late as the 8th century BC

The Hittite Kingdom reached its zenith during the reign of Suppiluliuma I The kingdom of Mitanni wracked by civil war was unable to withstand the Hittite onslaught Suppiluliuma swiftly attacked the Mitanni heartland capturing and plundering the Mitanni capital of Washshuganni He then turned west recrossed the Euphrates and captured all the Syrian kingdoms which were vassals to the Mitanni including Aleppo Mukish Niya Qatna Upi and Kadesh Other kingdoms such as Ugarit and Amurru voluntarily became vassal states of the Hittites 

When hostilities flared up once more with Mitanni Tulipinu Suppiluliumas son and viceroy at Aleppo invaded Carchemish but was unable to take the city Suppiluliuma met with his son and then invaded Syria himself laying siege to the city of Carchemish Suppiluliuma broke the siege on the eighth day installing his son Piyassili as viceroy of the kingdom With his sons as viceroys of Aleppo and Carchemish Suppiluliuma had cemented his rule over Syria and brought the empire of Mitanni to an end The Mitanni King was assassinated soon after

When Tutankhamun the Egyptian Pharaoh died to Suppiluliumas amazement Tutankhamuns wife asked him to marry one of their sons Suppiluliuma sent an envoy to Egypt to confirm this message After meeting with his returning ambassador and an Egyptian envoy Suppiluliuma agreed to send his son Zannanza to Egypt to marry the queen However Zannanza was assassinated en route to Egypt Suppiluliuma was furious and blamed the new Egyptian Pharaoh Ay for his sons death A Hittite army under crown prince Arnuwanda invaded Egyptian territory from Syria pillaging and taking many prisoners These prisoners brought with them a plague which ravaged the Hittite Kingdom continuing well into Mursilis reign and may have killed Suppiluliuma himself

Mursili II was young and inexperienced but he proved to be a strong king In the first years of his reign he carried out punitive campaigns against several kingdoms In Syria the Nuhashshi king Tette rebelled and was joined by Egyptian troops Troubles in Syria continued when Mursili brothers Tulipinu and Piyassili both died The loss of his Syrian viceroys led to rebellion and even the invasion of Carchemish by Assyria Leaving his generals to deal with Syria and Hayasa Mursili invaded Carchemish and drove out the Assyrians Later in his reign Mursili II campaigned against the Kaska once again retaking the Hittite holy city of Nerik He also decisively defeating the King of Tummanna

Suppiluliuma II the son of Tudhaliya IV was the last known king of the New Kingdom of the Hittite Empire ruling 1207 BCE c1178 BCE contemporary with Tukulti Ninurta I of Assyira 

He is known from two inscriptions in hieroglyphics They record wars against former vassal Tarhuntassa and against Alasiya in Cyprus 

After the fall the Kaskians were probably in control of Hatti Hattusa itself was destroyed its site only re occupied by a Phrygian fortress some 500 years later

The Parthian empire had a friendly relations with the Armenians The fighting between the Roman Empire and Parthia was centered in Armenia Armenia was in between Parthian and the Roman Empire The Armenians had already played a role in the early history of the Roman Parthian relations 

Tigranes put military and political relations with Rome and Parthia on an international legal foundation

The Parthians were allies to Armenians in many times Many Parthian noble families had moved out and they went to Armenia 

The Battle of Rhandeia was a battle fought between Armenia and Parthia against the Roman Empire It was fought just after the Mithridatic Wars The Romans were lead by Lucius Caesennius Paetus They were defeated by the Parthian Armenian army lead by Tiridates I of Armenia

The Parthians made Tiridates the King of Armenia He was the brother of the Parthian king Vologases I Tiridates replaced Tigranes a Roman ally as king The Romans fought to take back the throne but were forced into surrender at Rhandeia

Hydrochloric acid is a chemical compound It is a solution of hydrogen chloride gas that is dissolved in water It used to be called muriatic acid It is widely used in industry and it is also made by the stomach to help digest food Hydrochloric acid like all acids react with bases to produce salts

In high concentrations hydrochloric acid can make acidic mists Both the mist and the solution hurt human tissue They are caustic and can cause chemical burns These can damage the eyes the skin the respiratory system and other organs of the human body

When hydrochloric acid is mixed with certain chemicals such as bleach the toxic gas chlorine is made When working with hydrochloric acid certain safety measures should be taken These include using rubber or PVC gloves wearing goggles to protect the eyes as well as special clothing that is resistant to chemicals 

Hydrochloric acid reacts with some metals corroding them and making flammable hydrogen gas

Kobayr is a 12th century Armenian Apostolic Church monastery It is located in the village Kober within Lori marz Armenia 

Kobayr was built on a shelf of a gorge by the princes of the junior Bagratuni branch Kyurikids in 1171 The monastery was later acquired by the Zakarids and converted into a Chalcedonian monastery Many of the writings in the monastery are written in Georgian

The monastery is being fixed and paid for by the government of Armenia with the help of the government of Italy The ruins of the main church in the monastery contain frescoes of Christ and the twelve apostles as well as the Church fathers and other Christian figures

Hnevank is a 7th century Armenian Apostolic Church monastery It is located nearby the city of Stepanavan in the Lori marz of Armenia The monastery is on a hill within a gorge near where the Dzoraget and Gargar rivers join

The monastery was all rebuilt by lord Smbat of the House of Orbelian a branch of the Liparitids who were removed to Armenia in the late 12th century from Georgia Liparitids were themselves a branch of the Mamikonians Smbat was the ancestor of the Armenian princes of Syunik Georgian writings around the drum attests his name The monastery has a gavit and various service buildings around the site The government of Armenia has recently begun fixing the monastery The broken dome of the main church has been restored entirely

Huntingtons disease or chorea is a genetic disease It affects the brain and can lead movement coordination problems and behaviour On average it leads to death about fifteen years after showing It is found in about 5 7 in 100000 people The disease is named after George Huntington who described it accurately in 1872 According to Huntington the disease is characterized by three things

Of these the last one proved to be wrong

As of 2011 there is no treatment for the disease as such but the different symptoms can be treated However the effects can be dramatically reduced by the use of stem cells

Adenoidectomy is the process of taking out a persons adenoids from the back of their throat through the process of surgery They may be removed for several reasons including difficulty breathing through the nose and having ear infections The surgery is common in young kids The procedure is usually performed using a substance called anaesthesia and the substance puts a person to sleep when it is applied Recovery time from the operation can vary from several hours to a few days

Adenoidectomy is usually done on young children because their adenoids were infected by a virus If the disease was to be left alone it would worsen The affected person could have harder times breathing or hearing and may possibly be killed from the disease Normally functioning adenoids help maintain the bodys healthy immune system during early childhood They shrink when a person gets older When a person becomes an adult their adenoids completely disappear

The Turkish Armenian Reconciliation Commission was made in 2001 to help Turkey and Armenia be closer The main goal was to make the governments more active

ROT13 is a very simple form of encryption cipher It is a variant of a Caesar cipher In it the alphabet is written in two lines of 13 characters each Encryption and decryption is done by simply switching the letters that are below each other That way A becomes N B becomes O and so on

It is widely used in USENET forums

ROT13 can also be used for letter games There are some words that will produce another existing word when they are treated with ROT13 The longest example in the English language is the pair of 7 letter words abjurer and nowhere there is also the 7 letter pair chechen and purpura Other examples of words like these are shown in the table

The 1989 International Obfuscated C Code Contest had an entry by Brian Westley Westleys computer program can be ROT13d or reversed and still compiles correctly Its operation when executed is either to perform ROT13 encoding on or to reverse its input

The newsgroup altfolkloreurban made a wordfurrfu It was the ROT13 encoding of the frequently encoded utterance sheesh Furrfu evolved in mid 1992 as a response to postings repeating urban myths on altfolkloreurban after some posters complained that Sheesh as a response to newcomers was being overused

Tony Kahn is an American radio host narrator and writer who has won many awards He is the son of Hollywood movie writer Gordon Kahn 

Kahn was born in in Los Angeles California His father was placed on a list of people with political beliefs that some people thought were not acceptable This happened during a time in American history known as the Red Scare The Red Scare is a term used to describe a time during the 1940s and 1950s in the United States when people were accused of being communists 

Because of the Red Scare Kahn had to leave Los Angeles with his family They went to Mexico during the 1950s They returned after a few years and Kahn went to school at Harvard University where he studied the Russian language He graduated with very good grades He then went to Columbia University where he got a masters degree  an advanced academic degree or diploma  in Slavic studies

Tony Kahn is known for his work in radio He produces and directs a radio show called Morning Stories for the radio station WGBH in Boston Massachusetts He has also contributed to other radio shows such as Minnesota Public Radios The World On The World Kahn is sometimes the host and sometimes a reporter He has won twelve New England Emmys six Gold Medals of the New York International Festival and an award called the Edward R Murrow Award for Feature Reporting 

DDT is a well known pesticide The abbreviation stands for Dichloro Diphenyl Trichloroethane one of its names The Swiss chemist Paul Hermann Mller was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1948 for his discovery In the 1960s there was a study that questioned if it was good to spread large amounts of DDT indiscriminately The study also found that DDT could cause cancer DDT is also higly poisonous to birds and other animals further up the food chain This is why DDT was replaced by other pesticides The Stockholm Convention which took effect in 2004 restricts the use of DDT to vector cotrol The convention does not affect the use of DDT for pulic health issues This is because there are very few affordable alternatives DDT is still widely used in India North Korea and possibly elsewhere 

Nucleobases are important for genetics They are parts of RNA and DNA that may be involved in pairing 

They include cytosine guanine adenine thymine in uracil in and xanthine and hypoxanthine These are abbreviated as C G A T U X and HX broken wikt linkrespectivelyrespectively They are usually simply called bases in genetics Because A G C and T appear in the DNA these molecules are called DNA bases A G C and U are called RNA bases

Uracil replaces thymine in RNA

Kdainiai is a town in the center of Lithuania The river Nevis passes by the town More than 30000 people live here Kdainiai has an old town with a lot of churches Also Kdainiai is a center of industry especially chemistry 

In molecular biology two nucleotides on opposite complementary DNA or RNA strands that are connected by hydrogen bonds are called a base pair 

In the Watson Crick base pairing adenine forms a base pair with thymine and guanine with cytosine in DNA In RNA thymine is replaced by uracil But there is also non Watson Crick base pairing with other hydrogen bonding patterns especially in RNA 

In molecular biology complementarity is a property of nucleic acids such as DNA and RNA Each nucleotide has a nitrogenous base and each nitrogenous base can pair up with the nitrogenous base from another different nucleotide One can say that the nitrogenous base is complementary to the other in that the base pairs between them are non covalently bonded by hydrogen bonds

Since there is only one complementary base for any of the bases found in DNA and in RNA enzymes can make a complementary strand from any single strand This is needed for DNA replication

The bases which are complementary are

For example the complementary strand of the DNA sequence A G T C A T G is T C A G T A C

In music a glissando is a slide up or down the notes of a scale The plural is glissandi In written music the instruction to the player is often shortened to gliss The word comes from the French glisser to slide

With the singing voice or with an instrument such as the trombone or a string instrument a glissando is a smooth slide in which the pitch gradually changes becoming higher and higher The trombonist can make a glissando by blowing whilst pushing out or pulling in the slide The violinist can make a glissando by sliding a finger up or down the fingerboard

With instruments such as the piano xylophone or harp a glissando is a quick slide in which we hear one note after another because the pitches between the notes cannot be played On the piano there are two ways to play a glissando either on the white notes or on the black notes At the end of the piano piece called Ondine from Gaspard de la Nuit by Maurice Ravel both these types of glissando can be heard The pianist has to play a glissando with tips of the fingers or the finger nails It can be quite painful to practise them a lot  Harpists are very fond of playing glissandi By changing the position of the harp pedals a harpist can change the scale which will sound when the glissando is played

Many modern timpani have pedals which tighten or slacken the drum head These can be used to make a glissando The Hungarian composer Bla Bartk often used this effect

Some jazz clarinettists manage to play a glissando on the clarinet They do this by gradually changing the way they blow whilst at the same time gradually lifting all the fingers off the keys George Gershwins Rhapsody in Blue starts with a glissando on the solo clarinet 

When composers write a glissando they write the first and the last note and then put a long straight line between the notes and write the word glissando or gliss

The Almudena Cathedral is a Catholic cathedral in Madrid Spain It is one of the newest landmarks in Madrid It is on a hilltop next to the Royal Palace

It was designed as long ago as 1879 but then the plans were changed to make it look like a 13th century cathedral like the one in Rheims Building started in 1882 but during the Spanish Civil War no more work was done do it and the building was not finished until the 1980s The architects who finished it Fernando Chueca Goitia and Carlos Sidro made some of the building look neo classical style It was consecrated in 1993 by Pope John Paul II

From the front of the cathedral visitors can see parts of the old city wall which was built in the 9th century

In May 2004 Prince Felipe the heir to the throne married Doa Letitia Ortiz Rocasolano in the cathedral She was a newsreader on Spanish television

The Puerta de Europa towers are two office buildings in Madrid They were built in 1996 by the Kuwait Investments Office now owned by Caja Madrid and Realia Bussines Each building is 115m tall and leans 15 They are located near Plaza de Castilla

In music portamento is a gradual slide from one note to another It is very similar to a glissando but a glissando is deliberately written in the music by the composer and may be a long slide between two or three octaves or more A portamento is a much shorter slide usually between two notes which are quite close Opera singers often used to slide from one note of a tune to another instead of singing each note separately and clearly The habit of putting in portamento between notes spread to other instruments as well When listening to recordings of violin playing from the early 20th century we can hear that the players used a lot of portamento

Over the last half century portamento has gone out of fashion and singers and instrumentalists are taught not to slide from one note to another However there are some places especially in opera where it can be effective so long as it is not done all the time It is a matter of taste

A hydrogen bond is a special type of dipole dipole bond that exists between an electronegative atom and a hydrogen atom bonded to another electronegative atom This type of bond always involves a hydrogen atom That explains the name 

Hydrogen bonds can occur between molecules or within different parts of a single molecule The typical hydrogen bond is stronger than van der Waals forces but weaker than covalent ionic and metallic bonds 

Intermolecular hydrogen bonding is responsible for the high boiling point of water

Thalidomide is a drug It can be used as a sedative It also has uses for other illnesses It was mainly prescribed to pregnant women The drug can cause birth defects in rats primates and humans Before the drug was released not enough tests were done so this was unknown About 10000 children were born with deformities between 1956 and 1962 These could be directly linked to the fact that their mothers had taken the drug during their pregnancy After this discovery more rigorous tests were required in the United States before a drug can be said to be safe to take during pregnancy Other countries made similar laws Thalidomide was not used as a drug for decades

Researchers continued to look for ways to use the drug They discovered that it had good effects on certain types of skin diseases associated with leprosy Currently studies are being done to see how this drug could help with cancer treatment as well as some other less known diseases It has been used in Multiple myeloma treatment with success

The Sibylline Books were a collection of prophecies in rhyme written in Greek The legendary king of Rome Tarquinius Superbus bought them from a Sibyl and the prophecies used to be consulted in times when great danger happened in the history of the Roman Empire 

The books were also known to the Greeks They were kept in the Temple of Apollo at Gergis on Mount Ida in the 7th century BC and said to be written by the Hellespontine Sibyl From there it passed to Erythrae and was called the work of the Erythraean Sibyl It seems that this collection travelled from there to Cumae Italy and from there to Rome 

According to Virgil in the Aeneid Aeneas had consulted the Cumaean Sibyl before he travelled to the lower world The story of how king Tarquinius bought them from the Cumaean Sibyl was a famous legend She offered to sell Tarquin a collection of nine books of prophecy but he refused the price so she burnt three After that she offered to sell the six remaining books for the same price He refused again and she burnt another three Finally he bought these three remaining books for this price so they would not be destroyed and put them in the temple of Jupiter in Rome 

The books were given to the trust of two Roman patricians Beginning in 367 BC ten keepers  five from the patricians and five from the common citizens  were appointed for them After this the number of keepers was increased to fifteen The job of these keepers was to consult the books on what was the right action or ceremony to escape from threats Even so they would not reveal the prophecies themselves but only tell the action or ceremony needed

The influence of the books brought eastern gods such as Apollo the Great Mother Cybele and Ceres as well as Greek pagan beliefs into the Roman pagan religion 

Because the verses were written in Greek the keepers would always be helped by two Greek translators The books were destroyed when the Temple of Jupiter burned down in 83 BC Because of this the Roman Senate sent messengers in 76 BC to find similar prophecies and replace them The prophecies were gathered especially from Troy Erythrae Samos island Africa and from Sicily and Tibur in Italy After they brought the new collection to Rome Roman priests separated what they thought was true but threw others out of the collection 

The Roman Emperor Augustus in 12 BC moved them to the Temple of Apollo when they were studied and a new copy was made They stayed there until 405 AD It is said that at that time Stilicho who fought for the teachings of Arianism burnt them 

Modern scholars believe these books are not the same as the Sibylline Oracles that were often quoted by early Christian writers from the 2nd century through the 5th century AD It is certain that when one Christian writer Athenagoras of Athens wrote A Plea for the Christians to Emperor Marcus Aurelius in around 176 AD at a time when Christians were being punished by the pagan Roman Empire he quoted word for word from these Oracles that are known today Quoting them along with writings by Homer and Hesiod he wrote many times that these books are all known to Caesar The Sibylline Books were still to be found in the Temple of Apollo at Rome at this time so it is thought possible that at least some of these Sibylline Oracles were partly the same 

70 lines agreed to be from the real Sibylline Books were quoted in the 2nd century Book of Marvels by Phlegon of Trales This quote speaks about the birth of a hermaphrodite and ceremonies for sacrificing to idols

Molecular biology is the study of biology at a molecular level The field overlaps with other areas of biology and chemistry particularly cell biology genetics biophysics and biochemistry 

Molecular biology chiefly concerns itself with understanding the interactions between the various systems of a cell including the interrelationship of DNA RNA and protein biosynthesis and learning how these interactions are regulated 

Researchers in molecular biology use specific techniques that are typical for molecular biology but they combine these with techniques and ideas from genetics and biochemistry There is not a hard fast line between these disciplines as there once was The following figure is a schematic that shows one possible view of the relationship between the fields

Double stopping means playing two notes at once on a bowed string instrument by drawing the bow across two strings at once while stopping two notes by pressing the fingers down on the fingerboard one finger on each of the two strings being played

On instruments such as the violin the player is mostly playing one note at a time It is not difficult to play two open strings at once but fingering two strings at once can be very difficult so double stopping is an advanced technique Sometimes triple or quadruple stopping is needed This is sometimes called multiple stopping It is not really possible to play three or four notes at the same time on a violin The bridge is curved so that the player can bow on one string without hitting the others by accident Multiple stopping is done by playing first two strings and then while still letting the sound from these two ring quickly playing the other two strings

Multiple stopping was used a lot in Renaissance music when playing the viol Baroque composers such as Johann Sebastian Bach in Germany or Arcangelo Corelli in Italy often require double stopping when writing for solo string instruments It is also used a lot in virtuoso music of composers in the Romantic period such as Niccol Paganini

The law of large numbers is a theorem from statistics If there is a random variable it will be stable in the long run This means that in the long run the observed value will get ever closer to the expected value 

When rolling dice the numbers 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 are possible outcomes They are all equally likely The population mean of the outcomes is

The following graph shows the results of an experiment of rolls of a die In this experiment it can be seen that the average of die rolls varies wildly at first As predicted by the LLN the average stabilizes around the expected value of 35 as the number of observations become large

Jakob Bernoulli first described the LLN He says it was so simple that even the stupidest man instinctively knows it is true Despite this it took him over 20 years to develop a good mathematical proof Once he had found it he published the proof in Ars Conjectandi in 1713 He named this his Golden Theorem It became generally known as Bernoullis Theorem In 1835 SD Poisson further described it under the name La loi des grands nombres Thereafter it was known under both names but the Law of large numbers is most frequently used

Other mathematicians also contributed to make the law better Some of them were Chebyshev Markov Borel Cantelli and Kolmogorov After these studies there are now two different forms of the law One is called the weak law and the other the strong law These forms do not describe different laws They have different ways to describe the convergence of the observed or measured probability to the actual probability The strong form of the law implies the weak one

The Tell Tale Heart is an 1843 short story by Edgar Allan Poe It is about someone who has killed an old man with a strange eye The murder is carefully planned and the killer hides the old mans body by cutting it into pieces and hiding it under the floor The killer who tells the story feels guilty about the murder and the guilt makes him imagine that he can hear the dead mans heart still beating under the floor

The story does not say if the old man and the killer are related Some people think that the old man is a father figure Some people think that the mans strange vulture like eye is a symbol of some unknown secret Perhaps that his vulture eye represents some sort of veiled secret 

The story was first published in James Russell Lowells The Pioneer in January 1843 The Tell Tale Heart is one of Poes most famous short stories and it is widely considered a classic of the Gothic fiction genre The story has been made into or inspired many different works in film television and other media

The Tell Tale Heart is a story told in the first person meaning that the storyteller talks about his or her own feelings and actions The story does not say if the narrator is male or female

The narrator is taking care of an old man with a clouded vulture like eye The narrator has feelings of paranoia and becomes afraid of the old mans strange eye The narrator becomes so bothered by the eye that he plots to murder the old man For more than a week the narrator sneaks into the old mans room at night watching and waiting for the right time to strike However the old mans eyes are shut hiding the clouded eye and the narrator loses the urge to kill 

One night though the old man awakens as the narrator watches revealing the eye The narrator strikes smothering the old man with his own mattress The narrator chops up the body and hides the pieces under the floorboards The narrator then cleans the place up to hide all signs of the crime When the narrator reports that the police respond to a call placed by a neighbor who heard a distressful scream the narrator invites them to look around confident that they will not find any evidence of the murder They sit around the old mans room right on top of the very hiding place of the dead body yet suspect nothing 

The narrator however begins to hear a faint noise As the noise grows louder the narrator hallucinates that it is the heartbeat of the old man coming from under the floorboards This paranoia increases as the officers seem to pay no attention to the sound which is loud enough for the narrator to admit to having heard Shocked by the constant beating of the heart and a feeling that the officers must be aware of the heartbeats the narrator loses control and confesses to killing the old man and tells them to tear up the floorboards to reveal the body 

Throughout the story the narrator insists on being sane yet at the same time giving the impression of serious hallucinations or paranoia possibly caused by guilt from having murdered an elderly man

The Tell Tale Heart starts in medias res in the middle of an event The opening is an in progress conversation between the narrator and another person who is not identified in any way It is speculated that the narrator is confessing to a prison warden judge newspaper reporter doctor or psychiatrist Whoever it is it sparks the narrators need to explain himself in great detail The first word of the story True is an admission of his guilt

One of the driving forces in this opening and throughout the story is not the narrators insistence upon his innocence but on his sanity His drive to convince however is self destructive because he fully admits he is guilty of murder His denial of insanity is based on his systemic actions and precision  a rational explanation for irrational behavior This rationality however is undermined by his lack of motivation Despite this however he says the idea of murder haunted me day and night The storys final scene however is a result of the narrators feelings of guilt Like many characters in the Gothic tradition his nerves dictate his true nature Despite his best efforts at defending himself the narrators over acuteness of the senses which help him hear the heart beating in the floorboards is what convinces the reader that he is truly mad Readers during Poes time would have been especially interested amidst the controversy over the insanity defense in the 1840s

It is unclear however if the narrator actually has very acute senses or if he is merely imagining things If his condition is believed to be true what he hears at the end of the story may not be the old mans heart but death watch beetles The narrator first admits to hearing death watches in the wall after startling the old man from his sleep According to superstition death watches are a sign of impending death One variety of death watch beetles raps its head against surfaces presumably as part of a mating ritual while others emit a ticking sound

The relationship between the old man and the narrator is ambiguous as is their names their occupations or where they live In fact that ambiguity adds to the tale as an ironic counter to the strict attention to detail in the plot The narrator may be a servant of the old mans or as is more often assumed his son In that case the vulture eye of the old man is symbolizing parental surveillance and possibly the paternal principles of right and wrong The murder of the eye then is a removal of conscience The eye may also represent secrecy again playing on the ambiguous lack of detail about the man or the narrator Only when the eye is finally found open on the final night penetrating the veil of secrecy that the murder is carried out

Former poet laureate Richard Wilbur has suggested that the tale is an allegorical representation of Poes poem To Science The poem shows the struggle between imagination and science In The Tell Tale Heart the old man represents the scientific rational mind while the narrator is the imaginative

The Tell Tale Heart was first published in the Boston based magazine The Pioneer in January 1843 edited by James Russell Lowell Poe was likely paid only 10 It was slightly revised when republished in the August 23 1845 edition of the Broadway Journal It was reprinted multiple times during Poes lifetime

Vibrato is a series of very quick changes up and down to the pitch of a note It is like a deliberate controlled wobble The word vibrato is related to the word vibrate

Vibrato is used to make a melody sound more beautiful by making it more expressive Singers use vibrato especially when singing dramatic solo music such as opera In Italy a singers vibrato is sometimes called tremolo

Violinists and other players of string instruments produce vibrato by moving the finger backwards and forwards on the fingerboard Vibrato has to be learned carefully as the hand needs to be very relaxed Many beginners who start to use vibrato will try to vibrate too fast and this makes an unpleasant sound Vibrato can be produced on wind instruments by small changes of breath control

Musicians sometimes disagree about how much vibrato was used in earlier times People who play music from the Renaissance or Baroque on period instruments sometimes play without any vibrato Other people think that players of those days did use some vibrato

The glockenspiel is a type of percussion instrument It is in the same category of musical instruments as the xylophone and timpani A Glockenspiel usually has a range of two and a half octaves It is set up in a keyboard format similar to the xylophone Unlike the wooden xylophone the glockenspiel is a metallophone It is made of metal The glockenspiel is played by hitting it with mallets with a plastic or felt tip It has a soft sound but it is very high pitch If it is hit too hard it makes a very bad sound It is often used to represent things such as fairies birds and butterflies The glockenspiel is from Germany

Titan AE is a 2000 animated science fiction movie from Fox Animation Studios and Twentieth Century Fox The name of the movie comes from the fictional spacecraft that is a main part of the plot The AE meaning After Earth The movie was created using both hand drawn animation and computer generated imagery 

Titan AE did not make much money in theaters It made only 9376845 during its opening weekend and a total of 22753426 in theaters

In the year 3028 AD Earth is attacked by aliens called the Drej They are made of pure energy The Drej spacecraft destroys Earth with an energy beam just as hundreds of space vehicles leave the planet with the last of mankind on them The secret Titan ship with Professor Sam Tucker aboard leaves at the same time but not with the other vessels One of the one of the people escaping the planet is Sams young son Cale Cale carries with him a ring given to him by his father

Fifteen years later Cale works on a salvage station Cale hates his father for having disappeared on the Titan Without a home planet humans have become outer space drifters They are constantly treated badly by other races A human captain named Joseph Korso and his pilot Akima seek out Cale They tell him that he must help them find the Titan They say that the ship has machinery that will create a new Earth Doing this will bring humanity back together again The Drej want to find the Titan so that they can destroy it

With Korsos help Cale learns that the ring his father gave to him can help him find the Titan Before long Cale and Akima find out that Korso is looking for the Titan in order to hand it over to the Drej They escape from him but become stranded on a drifter colony Cale and Akima repair one of the wrecked spacecraft at the colony They use it to go to where the Titan has been hidden 

Inside the Titan Cale and Akima learn that Professor Tucker had been one of the main people who designed the craft The designers felt that the destruction of Earth would happen Because of this they gave the Titan the ability to create a new planet They loaded it with the DNA of every living Earth plant and animal so they could repopulate the new world Unfortunately the ship had no energy left and they could not recreate the planet

Korso finds and boards the Titan He attacks Cale and Akima but one of his men attacks him Korso kills the man by breaking his neck then fights with Cale During the fight Korso falls over a railing Cale trying to save him but Korso slips from Cales grip and falls to his apparent death Akima Cale and others from Korsos ship work together to defend the Titan against the Drej attack Cale thinks that the energy that makes up the Drej and their ships may be used to power up the Titans systems Korso shows up again but sacrifices himself repair a circuit breaker just as the Drej ship shoots an energy beam at the Titan Using the power of the beam the Titan powers up and takes all the Drej energy The Drej are destroyed while the ship creates a new planet

The movie ends with Akima and Cale standing on their new world Akima wants to name the planet New Earth while Cale wants to name it Bob The final scene is of all the human coming to the planet named New Earth Planet Bob

To tie in with the movie there was a series of novels as well as a comic book mini series that tell stories that take place before the movie

The Dark Horse Comics comic told the story of Sam Tucker and his crew It also told about them hiding the Titan

Titan AE became the first major movie to be digital from start to finish On June 6 2000 before it was shown in theaters the movie was in Atlanta Georgia as well as in Los Angeles California at the same time The movie was sent to both screens from 20th Century Fox in Los Angeles using a private internet LAN line This was the first time a major movie had been created distributed and shown digitally

Johann Heinrich Schmelzer was a German composer He was one of the most important composers of instrumental music in the mid 17th century 

Nothing is known about his early life He became a member of the imperial chapel in the mid 1630s His job there was probably a violinist We know very little about his life except that over the years he became a famous composer The emperor must have liked him because he gave him presents of money and gold chains

In 1671 he became deputy Kapellmeister at the imperial court In 1673 the emperor gave him the honorary title von Ehrenruef which he put after his name A few years later the court moved to Prague to try to escape the plague that was killing so many people in Vienna  At the end of 1679 the emperors Kapellmeister died and Schmelzer became Kapellmeister It was the first time that the Kapellmeister at the Habsburg court had not been a foreigner but an Austrian However the following March Schmelzer died of the plague

Schmelzer wrote a lot of music for small groups of instruments as well as a lot of ballet music His dance suites are made up of several dances such as galliard bourree sarabande gigue gavotte and allemande as well as more unusual dances He wrote several sonatas for two violins and continuo They are full of fast scales and arpeggios He also seems to have written church music but it has all been lost

The Oireachtas is the national parliament of Ireland

There are three parts of the Oireachtas

A quasar occurs when gas near a supermassive black hole at the centre of a distant galaxy goes into the black hole but electromagnetic forces cause it to swirl around above the hole and blast off into space in the form of huge jets of energy When the gas gets close to the black hole the gas heats up because of friction Therefore the gas glows very brightly and this light is visible on the other side of the Universe It is often brighter than the whole galaxy that quasar is in The first quasars were discovered with radio telescopes in the late 1950s and are still actively studied by astronomers today

Astronomers now think that when a galaxy has a quasar the quasar changes the galaxy Gas and dust from the galaxy falls onto the quasar and the bright quasar heats up gas in the galaxy This stops new stars from forming in the galaxy so many of the elliptical galaxies we see in the universe now may have once had a quasar in their centers When the gas and dust stop falling onto the quasar and firng out it stops being so bright and the black hole becomes very hard to see

Galaxies with a quasar in process are often called active galaxies Artist illustration 

Dil ireann is the lower house of the parliament of Ireland Its members are elected by all Irish citizens of voting age Members of Dil ireann are called Teachta Dala 

The First Dil was elected at the British General Election of 1918 The Sinn Fin people who were elected did not go to the House of Commons Instead they stayed in Dublin and set up the First Dil

The First Dil passed the Declaration of Independence of the Irish Republic a Constitution and set up a government

The first British woman MP was Countess Markiewicz Because she was a Sinn Finer she went to the first Dil ireann instead That is why many people think Lady Astor was Britains first woman MP

In 1922 during the War of Independence the British passed the Government of Ireland Act The act set up two parliaments one for Northern Ireland and one for Southern Ireland There was no election in Southern Ireland because only Sinn Fin candidates stood They did not meet as the House of Commons of Southern Ireland Instead they and the only Sinn Feiner elected only in Northern Ireland met as the Second Dil

On the first day of the Second Dil amon de Valera President of the Irish Republic said there would be no need to fight or negotiate with Britain if the British prime minister remembered that he had said quotePoland has chosen her own Government by universal suffrage and it is intolerable that any country from outside should come in and impose upon her a Government which she does not want De Valera said that if Poland had the right to its own government so did Ireland

The Second Dil ratified the Anglo Irish Treaty by a vote of 64 to 57 After this the 64 pro treaty members met as the House of Commons of Southern Ireland with the four University MPs and voted to accept the treaty again

The Third Dil was two things

The Third Dil passed the constitution of the Irish Free State and after 6 December 1922 it was the lower house of the Oireachtas of the Irish Free State

The official record of everything said in the Dil is called Dil Debates or Dospireachta Dla Volume one starts on the day the Third Dil met so the record of the First Dil is called Book F and the Second Dil starts with book S

TDs are elected in multi member constituencies unlike the British House of Commons or the American House of Representatives which are single member constituencies There can be three four or five TDs in each constituency Voters can vote for as many candidates as they want but they rank them in order of preference 123

Working out who has been elected can sometimes take two or even three days because the votes are counted several times under the Single Transferable Vote system

If the Chairman of Dil ireann called the Ceann Comhairle wants to stand for re election he is does not have to be elected The law and the constitution say that he is given a seat in his old constituency

The Dail is the more powerful of the two Houses of the Oireachtas

The Taoiseach the Tnaiste and the Minister of Finance must be members of Dil ireann

Bills to raise tax have to start in the Dil and cannot be vetoed by the Seanad

The Dil can pass a bill even if the Seanad objects but the Supreme Court can decide that the act is not allowed by the Constitution The President can also ask the Supreme Court if the bill is not allowed by the constitution before heshe signs it

The Taoiseach tix in English tix also referred to as An Taoiseach is the head of the government in Ireland The term prime minister is not used by the Irish media

When a new Dil ireann meets after an election it nominates one of its members to be Taoiseach He then visits the President and is appointed He then presents a list of ministers to the Dil and when this is approved they are also appointed by the President 

If the Taoiseach resigns all members of the government are said to have resigned as well If a minister does not resign when asked by the Taoiseach the Taoiseach can ask the President to sack the minister The President cannot refuse to do this

The Department of the Taoiseach helps the Taoiseach to do his job The main duty of the Taoiseach is to start policy and coordinate policy of the rest of government Especially policies on Economic and Social Development Northern Ireland the European Union and Public Sector Change and Oireachtas Reform

The Government Chief Whip who has to make sure the governments policies and ideas are turned into law is a part of the Taoiseachs department

The current Taoiseach is Enda Kenny

Anton Webern was an Austrian composer Webern and Alban Berg were the most famous pupils of Arnold Schoenberg the composer who had invented the twelve tone system This style of composition is often called the Second Viennese School Webern was probably Schoenbergs first pupil and Berg joined them a few weeks later Webern used the rules of the twelve tone system very strictly in his music His compositions had a lot of influence on composers of the mid 20th century who were interested in serialism especially Karlheinz Stockhausen and Pierre Boulez Most of Weberns compositions are very short

Anton was born Anton von Webern Weberns father was a mining engineer who later got an important government job The family had belonged to the nobility which is why they had von before the family name In 1918 a law was made in Austria to stop people from using von as part of their name and so from then onwards he was always known as Anton Webern Anton learned to play the cello and the piano They had a country house where the family spent the summer and the young boy spent a lot of time composing especially songs to the poems of famous German poets such as Stefan George and Richard Dehmel Together with his friend and cousin Ernst he read the philosophical books of Friedrich Nietzsche studied modern paintings and listened to the music of Richard Wagner His father took him to the Bayreuth Festival 

He went to study at the University of Vienna where he continued to compose a lot of music By 1906 he had been given a doctorate for writing about the composer Heinrich Isaac

When Webern became a pupil of Schoenberg he was joining a small group of musicians who were to be life long friends Alban Berg was a member of this group The music these people were writing sounded very modern at the time and they had to face a lot of criticism Berg and Webern were official pupils of Schoenberg only for two years but they continued to work with him often copying out music for him They also helped him financially and when Schoenberg moved to Berlin Webern moved there to be near him

Webern composed more and more twelve tone music in these years He also had conducting jobs which brought in some money He was a very good conductor He was only interested in music by German and Austrian composers He tried to get several teaching jobs but the only one he managed to get was at the Israel Institute for the Blind in Vienna where he taught for six years

During the 1930s Webern faced many difficulties He did not have much money Schoenberg went to live in France and then United States because of the political situation in Europe Alban Berg died in 1935 and his own conducting career came to an end When the Nazis came to power in Austria they banned Weberns music because they thought it was bad His son was killed fighting in World War II Four months after the war had ended he was sitting on the veranda of his daughters house smoking a cigar after dinner when he was shot dead by one of the occupying troops He should have been inside because there was a curfew on His son in law had just been arrested for selling things on the black market

Weberns early music is in an Expressionist Later he used more and more the twelve tone system He liked using very high and very low notes as well as silences in his music Although most of his pieces are very short they are very concentrated every note is part of a careful plan Officially he composed 31 works and these fit onto 6 CDs A lot of his music still sounds very modern to us today

Seanad ireann is the second house of the Irish parliament the Oireachtas

Seanad ireanns main business is the revising of legislation sent to it by Dil ireann

It can initiate and revise legislation except bills for raising tax and spending money Financial legislation must start in Dil ireann and the Seannad can only suggest changes it cannot force the changes to be accepted

Seanad ireann slows Dil ireann All bills must be looked at by the Seannad so it is a safeguard against laws being passed too quickly

Seanad ireann also debates important issues Also Seanad ireann can debate these issues with more freedom because the fate of the Government will not be at stake If the government loses a vote in Seanad ireann it could be embarrassing but under the constitution if the Government loses a vote in Dil ireann they might have to call new elections

Members of Dil ireann are members from the first meeting of Dil ireann after a general election until the Dil is dissolved Members of Seanad ireann are members from the first meeting until the day before the next general election of the Seanad

Elections for Dil ireann must be within 30 days of being dissolved Elections for the Seanad must be within 90 days of Dil ireanns dissolution The Seanad must be elected after the Dil because new TDs are allowed to vote in a Seanad election

There are sixty Senators

At least 5 senators must be elected from each panel but no more than 11 from any one panel

About 1000 people can vote for the Seanad

The senators from the Universities are elected by any Irish citizen with a degree from that university

The university seats shows how much amon de Valera who wrote the Constitution of Ireland was influenced by the British Parliament At the time it was written the universities of Oxford and Cambridge had their own MPs in the House of Commons Graduates of those universities voted for these MPs as well as for the MP were they lived

Protein biosynthesis is when cells build proteins The term is sometimes used to refer only to protein translation but more often it refers to a multi step process beginning with amino acid synthesis and transcription which are then used for translation Protein biosynthesis differs between prokaryotes and eukaryotes though several parts of the process are the same in both

A California hurricane is a tropical cyclone that affects the state of California Usually Pacific hurricanes weaken a lot before they hit California No hurricane has ever made landfall in California in recorded history But two tropical storms are thought to have hit California  one by direct landfall from offshore the other after making landfall in Mexico

Normally rainfall is the only effect that Pacific hurricanes have on California Sometimes this rainfall is strong enough to cause flooding and some damage For example floods from Hurricane Kathleen in 1976 created damages scattered across the southeastern California area and killed three people

The main reason why hurricanes do not hit California is because of cold sea surface temperatures off the California coastline and the California Current

Tropical cyclones usually need sea surface temperatures above 265 C with a depth of 50 metres to survive But the waters off the California coast are too cold for tropical cyclones even during the summer Normally the waters temperatures do not get above 17 C although El Nino effects may sometimes warm the waters a little bit

Also the California Current moves down from the northwestern US coast to the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula which is the opposite in which Northern Hemisphere tropical cyclones move While a few tropical cyclones may hit the southern and central areas of the Baja California peninsula they do not make landfall any farther north than that

Because of a possible threat of California hurricanes in the future and from the damaging effects of a 1858 tropical storm the National Weather Service created tropical cyclone warning stations across the southern California coast But because of the fact that Pacific hurricanes rarely affected California the idea of a warning station was later brought down

The most serious damage from a California hurricane would be from heavy rainfall rather than hurricane force winds or a storm surge although distant hurricanes may still create heavy surf maybe hurting or killing people

Yuma is a city in and the county seat of Yuma County Arizona United States According to 2005 Census Bureau estimates the population of the city is 84688

A storm surge is a sudden rise of water hitting areas close to the coastline Storm surges are usually created by a low pressure weather system normally a tropical cyclone

The California Current is a Pacific Ocean current that starts along the northwestern United States coast and ends on the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula

The Baja California Peninsula or Lower California is a peninsula of North America It is located west of Mexico It extends some 1250 km from Mexicali in the north to Cabo San Lucas in the south separating the Pacific Ocean from the Gulf of California

Waterworld is a 1995 science fiction movie The movie stars Kevin Costner who also produced it Waterworld was released in the United States on July 28 1995

Problems during the making of the movie caused it to cost much more than expected It was the most expensive movie ever made at the time With a budget of 175 million the movie earned 88 million at US theaters However the movie was successful in other countries It made more than a 100 million profit

Some time in the future after global warming the polar icecaps have melted The Earth is almost entirely covered with water The humans that are still alive have forgotten the past Most people believe the world was created in a flood It is blasphemy to believe anything else There is however a belief of many peoples that dry land exists

The peoples can be classified into four groups

The main character in the movie is a drifter For most of the movie he has no name People call him the Mariner He is a genetic mutant with webbed feet and gills He also appears to have very good reflexes

The Atollers offer a trade with the Mariner if he will stay with them long enough to get one of their women pregnant they will give him all the supplies he needs The Mariner does not accept their offer He does not like being around many people The Atolls leaders are mad about this They have him arrested During the fight to capture him they learn that he is a mutant They fear him and plan to recycle him in the Atolls midden

As they get ready to recycle the Mariner the Smokers attack Their leader is the Deacon He is the captain of an old oil tanker the Exxon Valdez They are looking for a young girl named Enola She has a map to Dryland tattooed on her back One of their spies told them that she was there Enola lives with her guardian Helen a woman in her twenties or thirties Helen and Enola plan to escape with Gregor in search of Dryland Like the Mariner they do not fit in with the other people

Gregors escape balloon is accidentally let loose too early This leaves Helen and Enola on the Atoll as the Smokers attack it They free the Mariner after he says he will take them with him They all escape on his ship

Helen learns that the Mariner knows where Dryland is and wants to see it The Mariner puts her in a diving bell made out of plastic and swims down to a sunken city to show her While they are looking at the sunken city the Smokers find the Mariners vessel and take control of it Enola hides on the ship When the Mariner and Helen return to the surface the Smokers capture them The Deacon wants the Mariner and Helen to tell him where Enola is but they will not help him find her The Deacon pretends to kill the Mariner and Helen by firing a gun into the sky This scares Enola out of hiding and she is captured by the Smokers The Deacon has his crew burn the Mariners vessel and shoot at them but they escape by diving deeper underwater than the bullets can reach Since the Mariner can breathe underwater he breathes for both of them using a kiss

Gregor soon appears in his flying machine He tells them that it was good thinking to burn the boat Gregor then takes them to where a new Atoll is being built The Mariner tells everyone that he is going to rescue Enola No one else will help him

The Mariner goes after the Exxon Valdez on a stolen jetski The Deacon and his crew are celebrating finding the map to Dryland Unfortunately neither the Deacon nor his crew has any idea how to read the map Based on the shape of the area of Dryland the Deacon believes that the area must be Japan The crew begins to row the large ship with huge oars in the style of a Viking longship

The Mariner walks out onto the empty deck of the ship and threatens to throw a flare down into the oil holds unless the Deacon returns Enola The Deacon does not believe Enolas warning that the Mariner never bluffs He refuses and tells the Mariner that he would be crazy to blow up the ship The Mariner drops the flare into the oil hold The flare causes the oil catch on fire This destroys the Deez in a large explosion

The Mariner frees Enola and escapes the ship They float at sea for a while and then have one last battle with the Deacon before being rescued by Gregor Gregor understands the map and leads them in the direction of what does in fact turn out to be Dryland Mount Everest Gregor Enola Helen and the others start to rebuild civilization on the island The Mariner builds a boat and sails away back to his old life

Douglas Hyde was the first President of Ireland from 1938 to 1945 He founded the Gaelic League one of the most influential cultural organisations in Ireland He promoted use of the Irish language using the Irish spelling of his name and the pseudonym An Craoibhin Aoibhinn

Hyde was born at Longford House in Castlerea in County Roscommon while his mother was on a short visit there His father Arthur Hyde was a Church of Ireland rector He became fascinated with hearing the old people in the locality speak the Irish language At the time the Irish language was looked down on seen as backward and old fashioned

He founded the Gaelic League or in Irish Conradh na Gaeilge in the hope of saving it from extinction in 1893

The league was set up to encourage the Irish culture music dances and language Many of the new generation of Irish leaders who played a central role in the fight for Irish independence in the early twentieth century including Patrick Pearse amon de Valera Michael Collins and Ernest Blythe first became passionate about Irish independence through their involvement in Conradh na Gaeilge or

Hyde himself was uncomfortable at the league becoming political instead of cultural and resigned as its president in 1915 He was replaced by the radical political activist and Irish language teacher Patrick Pearse Pearse led the Easter Rising and his election showed that the league had been infiltrated by the Irish Republican Brotherhood just like the Irish Volunteers and the Gaelic Athletic Association

Hyde had no association with Sinn Fin or the Independence movement But he did accept an appointment to the senate part of the Irish Free State parliament

In November 1925 he lost the election to the senate because of lies about his support for divorce and his Protestantism

He became Professor of Irish at University College Dublin where one of his students was future Attorney General and President of Ireland Cearbhall Dlaigh

In April 1938 he was retired but Taoiseach amon de Valera appointed him to Seanad ireann He was not a Senator for very long because he was chosen to be first President of Ireland

Hyde was inaugurated as the first President of Ireland in June 1938 and moved into the old Vice Regal Lodge the old home of the British Lords Lieutenant of Ireland The lodge was also used by Governors General of the Irish Free State Hyde renamed it the House of the President or ras an Uachtarin

Hyde said the Presidential oath of office in Irish The recording of his Roscommon dialect is one of the few recordings of the dialect which has now died out

Hyde was a popular president United States President Franklin D Roosevelt called him a fine and scholarly old gentleman President Hyde and King George VI corresponded about stamp collecting

President Hyde twice asked the Supreme Court if a bill was Constitutional

On the first occasion the court held that the Bill referred  Offences Against the State Bill 1940 was Constitutional

The second reference the Court decided that the particular provision referred  section 4 of the School Attendance Bill 1942  was repugnant to the Constitution and told the Dil he was refusing to sign it

Hyde left office on 25 June 1945 Due to his ill health he did not return to his Roscommon home Ratra Instead he was moved into the former Secretary to the Lord Lieutenants residence in the grounds of ras an Uachtarin which he renamed Little Ratra and where he lived out the remaining four years of his life He died quietly at 10pm on 12 July 1949 aged 89

As a former President of Ireland he was given a state funeral As an Anglican his funeral service took place in Dublins Church of Ireland St Patricks Cathedral But the Catholic Church did not let Roman Catholics attend services in Anglican churches As a result all but one member of the Catholic cabinet Dr Noel Browne remained outside the cathedral while Hydes funeral took place They then joined the cortge when his coffin left the cathedral amon de Valera by now Leader of the Opposition was represented by a senior Fianna Fil figure who was a member of the Church of Ireland Erskine Childers a future President of Ireland himself Hyde was buried in County Roscommon where he had spent most of his childhood life

Cearbhall Dlaigh was born in Bray County Wicklow

 Dlaigh trained as a lawyer He became Irelands youngest Attorney General in 1946 under Taoiseach amon de Valera He was re appointed as Attorney General in 1951 and in 1953 he became the youngest member of the Supreme Court Less than a decade later he became the youngest Chief Justice of Ireland

When Ireland joined the European Economic Community Jack Lynch appointed Dlaigh as Irelands judge on the European Court of Justice When President Childers died suddenly in 1974 all parties agreed to nominate Dlaigh for the post 

 Dlaigh proved to be a mixed success as president While popular with Irish language enthusiasts and artists he had a strained relationship with the Coalition Government

In 1976 he decided to refer a series of tough state security Bills to the Supreme Court to test their constitutionality This worried and angered members of the Fine Gael Labour national coalition government Dlaigh then announced that he would sign the bill at midnight of the 15th of October which he made public There was a historical precedent for the referral of this bill Dubhghlas de hde referred the Offences Against the State Act of 1939 to the Supreme Court Jim Duffy claims that as a result of this the PIRA arranged an attack in Mountmellick which resulted in the killing of Garda Clerkin Others would dispute that the PIRA would have held the Presidents opinion in such high regard as their members at the time did not recognise the State of which Dlaigh was then the Head 

 Dlaighs actions were seen by government ministers to have contributed to the killing of this Garda and greatly angered them The following day following a minor car accident Paddy Donegan a controversial and outspoken Minister for Defence described the incident as a thundering disgrace The president thought the minister meant that the President was a disgrace not what the President was doing was a disgrace Donegan a known alcoholic was likely under the influence of alcohol at the time he spoke He was speaking to members of the Irish Defence Forces and was only at the barracks to open a new cookhouse Donegan insulted the President who is Head of the Defence Forces in front of the defence forces created a major political incident  Dlaigh thought that the President and the Minister of Defence would be unable to work together

The apologetic Donegan immediately offered his resignation But Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave refused the offers an offer he repeated subsequently Cosgrave never met the President personally to apologise That added to two years in which Cosgrave had failed to do his constitutional duty to regularly brief the President The manner in which his government treated the President was the last straw for President Dlaigh 

He became the first Irish president to resign 

The incident meant even more people saw the Government as arrogant and out of touch with public opinion and contributed to their defeat in the 1977 general election

The opposition proposed outgoing EEC Commissioner Patrick Hillery for the presidency Hillery served two unchallenged terms of office before retiring at the end of his second term in 1990

 Dlaigh died in 1978 less than two years after leaving office He is buried in Sneem County Kerry 

Cearbhall Dlaigh was the most politically nave president but the Government he worked with was notable for its own inability to offer him the help to overcome the problem The Taoiseach did not support Dlaigh when Donegan attacked him 

Translation is the second part of protein biosynthesis It is part of the process of gene expression 

Before translation comes 

In eukaryotes translation happens on the ribosomes in the cytoplasm and in the endoplasmic reticulum In bacteria translation happens in the cell cytoplasm they have no nucleus

Ribosomes are made of a small part and a large part which surround the mRNA In translation mRNA has the base sequence to make a specific polypeptide This sequence is originally specified by the DNA and copied by the mRNA The polypeptide can be a whole protein Or it can be just a part waiting to be combined with other polypeptides so it can make a whole protein The polypeptide also has to be folded before it works as a protein 

Amino acids are carried by specific tRNAs with anticodons to connect with mRNAs matching codons Each tRNA has its own anticodon and carries an amino acid An anticodon is always together with the same amino acid 

When the tRNA matches with the mRNA the amino acid that is connected to the tRNA is unconnected from the tRNA and connected to the amino acid brought by the previous tRNA 

So a ribosome works a lot like a stock ticker and ticker tape Many ribosomes together with mRNA will attach themselves to the outer membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum Any proteins that those ribosomes make go into the inside of the endoplasmic reticulum where it will probably go into a vesicle later The vesicles will then bring the proteins to other organelles or even the outside of the cell

Translation happens in four stages activation initiation elongation and termination These terms describe the growth of the amino acid chain Amino acids are brought to ribosomes and assembled into proteins In the activation stage the correct amino acid is covalently bonded to the correct transfer RNA

When the tRNA is connected to an amino acid it is charged Initiation is when the small part of the ribosome connects to 5 end of the mRNA with the help of initiation factors Elongation is when the amino acids brought by the charged tRNAs are connected to each other to form a polypeptide Termination of the polypeptide happens when site A of the ribosome meets a stop codon There is no tRNA that matches that codon so no tRNA can connect to it This breaks the polypeptide off the ribosome

Some antibiotics work by keeping translation from happening Prokaryotic ribosomes are different from eukaryotic ribosomes So antibiotics can kill bacteria without hurting the eukaryotic host For example antibiotics taken by a human would kill the bacteria that is making the human sick but wouldnt hurt the human

Gene expression is the process by which the heritable information in a gene the sequence of DNA base pairs is made into a functional gene product such as protein or RNA The basic idea is that DNA is transcribed into RNA which is then translated into proteins Proteins make many of the structures and all the enzymes in a cell or organism

Several steps in the gene expression process may be modulated This includes both the transcription and translation stages and the final folded state of a protein Gene regulation switches genes on and off and so controls cell differentiation and morphogenesis Gene regulation may also serve as a basis for evolutionary change control of the timing location and amount of gene expression can have a profound effect on the development of the organism

The expression of a gene may vary a lot in different tissues This is called pleiotropism a widespread phenomenon in genetics 

In biology epigenetics is the study of inherited changes in phenotype or gene expression caused by mechanisms other than changes in the underlying DNA sequence 

These changes may remain through cell divisions for the remainder of the individuals life and may also last for multiple generations However there is no change in the underlying DNA sequence of the organism Instead non genetic factors cause the organisms genes to behave differently

The best example of epigenetic changes in eukaryote biology is the process of cellular differentiation During morphogenesis totipotent stem cells become the various cell lines of the embryo which in turn become fully differentiated cells In other words a single fertilized egg cell the zygote divides and develops The daughter cells change into the many cell types of the mature embryo These include neurones muscle cells epithelium blood vessels an so on This happens by activating some genes while inhibiting others

Epigenetic changes are long term and usually survive the process of cell division Changes occur in the chromatin which is a combination of the DNA and its surrounding histone proteins in the chromosome The details of how this happens are still being worked out but it is fairly certain that the wrapping of the DNA and histone is a key feature

Up regulation increases the expression of one or more genes and as a result the protein encoded by those genes Down regulation is a process resulting in decreased gene and protein expression

Gene regulation can be summarized as

There are a number of RNAs which regulate genes that is they regulate the rate at which genes are transcribed or translated The following are two important examples 

Micro RNAs act by joining an enzyme and blocking mRNA or speeding its breakdown This is called RNA interference

Small interfering RNAs interfere with the expression of a specific gene They are quite small double stranded molecules Their discovery has caused a surge in biomedical research and drug development

El Limn is a Municipal district of Santa Brbara de Saman Saman province Dominican Republic It is on the north coast of the Saman Peninsula on the Atlantic coast

There are other two Municipal districts with the same name in the country one in the Independencia province and the other in the Santiago province

Thodore Chassriau a French painter was born in El Limn on 1819

In the last national census the population of El Limn is included with that of the city of Saman

The most important economic activities of the province are agriculture fishing and tourism Tourism above all nature tourism is important here because many tourists visit El Limn Waterfall

Thodore Chassriau was a French romantic painter noted for his portraits historical and religious paintings and images inspired by his travels to Algeria

Chassriau was born in El Limn Saman in Saint Domingue Her mother Maria Magdalena Couret de la Blagnire was born in Haiti but she moved with her parents to Santo Domingo when the Haitian revolution At that time the eastern part of Hispaniola was a French colony There she met Bnoit Chassriau and soon they got married and moved to Saman

When the eastern part of the Hispaniola became again a colony of Spain the family moved to Venezuela and Jamaica Then in 1821 the family went to live in Paris France Thodore was three years old at that time

In 1830 at the age of eleven he started to study with Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres and soon he became the favorite pupil of the great classicist

After Ingres left Paris in 1834 to become director of the French Academy in Rome Chassriau fell under the influence of Eugne Delacroix a well known romantic painter From that moment on Chassriau tried to combine the two styles

His works could be grouped in two periods

Chassriau died when he was 37 years old in Paris on October 8 1856

In physics chemistry and biology intermolecular forces are forces that act between stable molecules or between functional groups of macromolecules 

These forces are generally much weaker than the chemical bonding forces Their bonding energies are less than a few kcalmol But they are responsible for many different physical chemical and biological phenomena In general one distinguishes short and long range intermolecular forces 

Hydrogen bonding is an intermolecular interaction with a hydrogen atom being present in the intermolecular bond

Venture capital is a type of private equity capital 

Typically it is provided by outside investors to new businesses that promise to grow fast Venture capital investments are usually high risk but offer the potential for above average returns 

A venture capitalist is a person who makes such investments A venture capital fund is a pooled investment vehicle that primarily invests the financial capital of third party investors in enterprises that are too risky for the standard capital markets or bank loans 

Venture capital can also include managerial and technical expertise Most venture capital comes from a group of wealthy investors investment banks and other financial institutions that pool such investments or partnerships This form of raising capital is popular among new companies or ventures 

Moment of inertia also called mass moment of inertia is the rotational broken wikt linkanaloganalog of mass 

That is it is the inertia of a rotating body with respect to its rotation The moment of inertia plays much the same role in rotational dynamics as mass does in basic dynamics It determines the relationship between angular momentum and angular velocity torque and angular acceleration 

Multiple choice questions ask people to choose the answer from a list Tests elections and surveys can use multiple choice questions Frederick J Kelly made the first multiple choice questions in 1914 at the University of Kansas This testing method is popular in the United States

In physics the angular velocity specifies the angular speed at which an object is rotating along with the direction in which it is rotating

It is a vector quantity The SI unit of angular velocity is radians per second But it may be measured in other units as well When it is measured in cycles or rotations per unit time it is often called the rotational velocity and its magnitude the rotational speed Angular velocity is usually represented by the symbol omega The direction of the angular velocity vector is perpendicular to the plane of rotation in a direction which is usually specified by the right hand rule

In SI units angular frequency is measured in radians per second with dimensions t1 since radians are dimensionless 

In physics and mathematics a pseudovector is a quantity that transforms like a vector under a proper rotation but gains an additional sign flip under an improper rotation

Physical examples of pseudovectors include the magnetic field torque vorticity and the angular momentum 

Twister is a 1996 disaster movie It starred Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton as storm chasers people who follow tornadoes to learn about them It was directed by Jan de Bont The movie was based upon a script by Michael Crichton and his wife former actress Anne Marie Martin

A spoke is one of several rods radiating from the center of a wheel connecting the hub with the round traction surface 

The term originally meant the portions of a log which one had split lengthwise into four or six sections The radial members of a wagon wheel were made by carving a spoke into their finished shape Eventually the term spoke was applied to the finished product of the wheelwrights work

An examination is a special test to see how good somebody is at something

In its widest sense to examine somebody or something is look at it very carefully perhaps to find out why something is not working properly Someone who is ill may need to go to a doctor to have a medical examination A machine that is not working properly may need an examination to find out the cause of the problem

In education an examination is a test to show the ability of a student A student who takes an examination is a candidate The person who decides how well the student has performed is the examiner An examination may be a written test an on screen test or a practical test Examples of a practical test may be driving a car speaking a language playing a musical instrument and doing a scientific experiment An on screen test is a test which uses the computer

If the candidate is successful he will have passed the examination If he is unsuccessful he will have failed In some cases it is possible for a student who has failed to take the exam again another time 

A student who passes an examination may get a certificate or diploma Some certificates are professional qualifications allowing the person to do a particular job eg plumber teacher doctor lawyer

In England Ireland Republic of Ireland Irish Republic and Southern Ireland are sometimes used as if they are different words for the same country They are not and using the wrong name is an insult at least to the government Veterans and their families of the Wars of Independence and the Civil War are also greatly offended 

The Irish Republic was a declared independent state of the United Kingdom in the Easter Rising of 1916 and established in 1919 by the First Dil It only existed during the Irish War of Independence of 1919 1922 between the Irish Republican Army and the forces of the United Kingdom

It formally ceased to exist in 1922 with the ratification of the Anglo Irish Treaty that ended the war when 26 of the countrys 32 counties became the Irish Free State and the other six remained within the United Kingdom as Northern Ireland Sin Fein refused to accept the treaty said that the Irish Republic existed even if it did not control any territory This is why elected Sinn Fin TDs never took their seats in the parliaments of the Irish Free State or the Republic of Ireland

In English the revolutionary state was known as the Irish Republic Two different Irish language names were used 

Saorstt ireann was also the official Irish title of the Irish Free State

This was Dil ireann It was made up of the majority of Irish Members of Parliament elected in the 1918 general election Two further general elections called by the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland the head of the British administration in Dublin Castle were treated by nationalists as elections to the Dil The Second Dils members were elected in the 1921 elections for the Parliaments of Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland the Third Dil was elected in 1922 as the provisional parliament of Southern Ireland as provided for by the Anglo Irish Treaty

At its first meeting the Dil adopted the Dil Constitution It also passed a Declaration of Independence 

The Dil Constitution gave executive authority in a cabinet called the Aireacht or Ministry The Aireacht head was first known as the Promh Aire He in turn appointed the ministers According to the original version of the constitution enacted in January 1919 there were to be four ministers

In April 1919 the ministry was increased in size to not more than nine ministers In August 1921 it underwent a final overhaul when the post of president was created The six ministers were

A number of previous cabinet ministers notably Constance Markiewicz were demoted to under secretary level Countess Markiewicz was the first women elected to the British House of Commons She never took her seat but instead she sat as a member of the first Dil

The Aireacht met as often as secrecy and safety allowed

The Anglo Irish Treaty was signed on 6 December 1921 Then it had to be confirmed three times

House of Commons of Southern Ireland and Dil ireann were the same people except for 4 pro British members of the House of Commons

Kingston upon Hull often shortened to Hull is a city and unitary authority in the East Riding of Yorkshire England It is located on both sides of the River Hull where it meets the River Humber on the north bank estuary near Englands east coast mi to kmnum25abbrnospellCommonwealthprecision2wikiyes from the North Sea

Hull has been a market town military supply port trading centre fishing and whaling port and industrial giant Hull was also an early battleground in the English Civil Wars and was the backdrop to events leading to the abolition of the slave trade in Britain Hull was heavily damaged during the Second World War and after a period of decline when many factories closed the city has started to regenerate The Port of Hull is one of the UKs largest goods and passenger ports

Meaux Abbey was founded between 1150 and 1179 This is the earliest date people are known to have lived in the area

Edward I used the port to help supply his troops when he was fighting the Scots as a site from which to supply his troops as they engaged their northern foes

The king granted a royal charter dated April 1 1299 that renamed the settlement of Wyke to Kings town upon Hull or Kingston upon Hull The charter remains preserved in the archives of the citys Guildhall

In 1440 a new charter allowed the town to choose a mayor a sheriff and twelve aldermen to run its own affairs The charter also said that the aldermen also be justices of the peace for the town and its county

Hulls port grew busier in the Middle Ages sending wool cloth and leather to north Germany towns on the Baltic Sea and the Low Countries bringing back timber wine furs and dyes

Sir William de la Pole was the towns first mayor

The town grew rich during the 16th and early 17th centuries At this time Wilberforce House was built It is now a museum about William Wilberforce who campaigned to abolish the slave trade

In 1642 Hulldecided to support for Parliament and refused to let Charles I enter the town This meant the king could not have Hulls arsenal Named a traitor Hotham was eventually executed in spite of a pardon issued by Parliament Charles I besieged the town that is he ordered his army to surround the town and force Hull to surrender This siege helped start the fighting in the Civil War

Hull became a city in 1897 This was then time when the city was the richest it had ever been Catching whales and fishing were very important Whaling is now banned and fishing is limited by EU rules But Hull is still a major port sending bulk goods and commercial road traffic by RORO ferry to and from the Dutch ports of Rotterdam and Zeebrugge and on to Europe Hull is also an important centre of food processing for the United Kingdom

In the Second World War much of the city centre was completely destroyed Hull was the most severely bombed city or town apart from London during World War II with 95 of houses being damaged or destroyed

Hull was hit hard by the June 2007 floods There was standing water over a wide area affecting 20 of the citys housing and damaging 90 out of its 105 schools But the flooding was not as dramatic as the localised flooding in Sheffield and Doncaster Newspapers and television reported about other areas and Hull Council leader Carl Minns said Hull was the forgotten city of the floods Damage to schools alone has been estimated at 100 million

Kingston upon Hulls city centre is close to the Humber The city is surrounded by the rural East Riding of Yorkshire isolating it from the rest of the United Kingdom

Much of Hull is on reclaimed land at or below sea level The Hull Tidal Surge Barrier is where the River Hull joins the Humber Estuary and is lowered at times when unusually high tides are expected It is used between 8 and 12 times per year and protects approximately 10000 people from flooding Due to its low level Hull is expected to be at increasing levels of risk from flooding due to global warming

The city is quite small but there are many villages in the metropolitan area The largest of these suburbs is Cottingham

Hull has the following twin towns

Hull Massachusetts in the USA is named after this city as is Hull Quebec which is part of Canadas national capital region

Hull is the only city in the UK with its own independent telephone network company now called Kingston Communications On 24 May 2007 the council sold their remaining stake in the company for over 107 million

People associated with the city include

In the United Kingdom a riding is a division of certain large historic counties It is usually one of three parts the word itself comes from Old English trithing which means third part

Several counties are divided into ridings but are usually governed by a council bearing the same name as the county However the ridings of Yorkshire are so large that each riding was given its own county council Thus there were county councils for the East Riding the North Riding and the West Riding In 1974 when all the administrative counties of England and Wales were reorganised these councils were replaced by six new ones within Yorkshire called North Yorkshire South Yorkshire West Yorkshire Cleveland Durham and Humberside

In Canada a riding is a federal constituency or electoral division as they are known in Canada

Emmental cheese is a Swiss cheese It first came from Switzerland It is named after the Emmental the valley of a river near Berne Emmental cheese was first made around 1292 in that region 

Today most cheese producing countries make a cheese called Emmental cheese  These cheeses often have little in common with the original though except for the holes in the cheese In 1882 was the first time products could be protected in Europe Already at that time Emmentaler was made in countries other than Switzerland

Emmental cheese is amongst the best known types of cheese It is made from cows milk Two of the features that make Emmental distinctive are its holes and sweetness The holes are there because of the way the cheese is made with bacteria which produce the cheese and over time create bubbles of carbon dioxide gas

Today Switzerland France Austria and Germany produce Emmental cheeses that have a Protected Designation of Origin In Switzerland and Germany untreated milk is used for the production most of the other countries use pasteurized milk About 12 litres of milk are needed to make 1 kg of cheese

Emmental is produced in loaves of 7080 kg Usually Emmental cheese is left to ripen for a period of 67 weeks Ripening it for 812 weeks gives a more spicy cheese In Europe about 464 200 tons of Emmental are produced each year This means that about 6 of the total amount of milk these countries produce is used to make Emmental cheese France is the biggest producer of Emmental In 2005 247 069 tons were produced there For this 131 of national milk production was used About 19 of the production was exported

French and Swiss people eat the most of this kind of cheese about 33 kg per person per year Germans eat about half that amount 17 kg per person per year

Emmental is also widely used in convenience food products because it is so widely known

Emmental is a part of Switzerland It is made of low hills Most of it is in the Canton of Berne  Its biggest rivers are the Emme and the Ilfis The biggest localities are Burgdorf Langnau and Huttwil 

The landscape is mostly made of meadows There are some forests too Most of the people live from raising cattle or from things closely related to cattle raising Emmental cheese has its name from this region Langnau is known for Ceramics Pottery from the region is also well known

There is also some industry The Emmental had one of the first fully electric railway lines in Switzerland

Jeremias Gotthelf was a famous writer who spent most of his life in the Emmental

An improper rotation can be understood as an inversion followed by a proper rotation 

Equivalently it is the combination of a rotation and an inversion in a point on the axis Therefore it is also called a rotoinversion or rotary inversion

A simple example of an improper rotation in 3D is a coordinate inversion x goes to x y to y and z to z Under this transformation a and b go to a and b but p clearly does not change

Inverse or Inversion could mean

Endorphins are proteins that are similar to opioids They are made by the endocrine system of many vertebrates When they are released into the body they cause a sense of well being They also act as analgesics  that is they can fight pain They are sometimes named natural pain killers Endorphins were first found in 1970s In 1977 Roger Guillemin and Andrew W Schally won the Nobel Prize in medicine because of their studies on hormones in the brain including endorphins

The term endorphin is a general name for many opioid like proteins Special endorphins have their own names like enkephalin and endorphin

Four types of endorphins are created in the human body They are named alpha beta gamma and sigma endorphins The four types have different numbers and types of amino acids in their molecules they have between 16 and 31 amino acids in each molecule

Beta endorphins are the most powerful endorphins in the body They are usually in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland More endorphins are released in the pituitary gland during times of pain or stress Exercise increases the endorphin release too For the same reason exercise results in a better mood

Met enkephalin and leu enkephalin are in the brain stem and spinal cord they are the pain killers of the spinal cord Both of them have five amino acids in their structure the first four are similar but the last one is different

All of the endorphins bind to the opioid receptors in the brain Many of the analgesic drugs have a similar action in the brain The main difference between the natural endorphins and the analgesic drugs is that natural endorphins are cleared from the blood very quickly Endorphins are also involved in the release of sex hormones in the pituitary gland Also scientists think that acupuncture results in the release of more endorphins Endorphins may have a role in obesity diabetes and psychiatric diseases too

The term endorphin rush is sometimes used in normal speech to refer to a feeling of wellness caused by exercise danger or stress However it is not a medical term and it is not proven that higher endorphin production after exercise really has a role in the wellness feeling

Another term which is commonly used is runners high It refers to the feeling being high after exercise It is commonly said that the high is a result of the release of bigger amounts of endorphins in the body during the exercise However some scientists think this feeling is caused by the challenge and is not related to endorphin release

For example in some studies a drug was given to people which blocked the effect of endorphins These people still felt the runners high it means this feeling is not caused by the release of endorphins in the blood Another study was performed in 2004 which showed this feeling is related to a different body chemical named anadamide Anadamide is similar to one of the chemicals in marijuana The body produces anadamide to fight with the stress and pain in a long exercise

Team Fortress 2 is a multiplayer first person shooter video game made by a company called Valve Corporation

The game has nine characters called classes and two teams that battle each other in many different ways like Payload which has one team pushing a cart along a track while the other team tries to stop them and a twist on capture the flag where instead of a flag players must capture a briefcase with important papers 

The game was first released in October of 2007 in The Orange Box a package with Half Life 2 Portal and Team Fortress 2

Team Fortress 2 has nine classes The classes are split into groups of three which are offense defense and support Each class has its own strengths and weaknesses causing the classes to rely on each other to win promoting teamwork

The offensive classes are the Pyro the Scout and the Soldier These classes have abilities that make them best suited for attacking the other team but also easy to kill

The Pyro is a character wearing a full body rubber suit and gas mask so nobody knows race age and gender Pyros main weapon is a flamethrower used to set enemies on fire Once an enemy is set on fire they will burn for several seconds meaning they can die even if they have killed the Pyro that set them on fire

The Scout is a young man from Boston with an interest in baseball He is the fastest runer in the game making him a good player to use in capture the flag as he can run in grab the enemy teams briefcase and run out However he also has the lowest health of any class His weapons include a scatter gun and a baseball bat

The Soldier is a middle aged man from the American midwest His main weapon is a rocket launcher which he can use to blow up enemies or if fired at his own feet can be used to make him jump very high Jumping with a rocket will hurt the Soldier though and if he is low on health it could kill him Soldier also uses shotguns and shovels to attack

The defensive classes are the Demoman the Engineer and the Heavy Weapons Guy The abilities of these classes make them best for defending things their team needs such as control points briefcases and carts

The Demoman short for Demolition Man is a black Scotsman with an eye patch His main weapons are grenade launchers and sticky bombs Grenades will explode a few seconds after they hit something while sticky bombs can stick to walls and then be set off by the Demoman when an enemy gets close

The Engineer is a middle aged man from Bee Cave Texas with 11 PhDs His main use is building sentry guns which fire automatically at nearby enemies dispensers which heal and give ammunition to any friendly players that stand near them and teleporters which can take teammates quickly to the front lines Engineer also has a shotgun and pistol to defend himself

The Heavy Weapons Guy also known as the Heavy is a middle aged man from the Soviet Union who is built like a tank Because of his large size he has the highest health of all the classes Also because of his size he is the slowest runner His main weapon is a minigun which he named Sasha and treats like a person His gun uses a lot of ammunition very quickly so if he runs out he can use his fists to punch enemies to death

Finally the supporting classes are the Sniper the Spy and the Medic Their abilities are there to help the team so they do not typically engage in combat but can if they must

The Sniper is Australian His main weapon is a sniper rifle He often stays in one area away from the main battlefield and shoots enemies from a distance using careful aim He also has a long knife he can use in close combat

The Spy is French His main asset is stealth He has a watch which makes him invisible for short periods of time and a cigarette case with disguises in it He can disguise as any member of the other team to trick them into not hurting him For fighting he has a revolver and a knife The knife allows the Spy to kill an enemy instantly if he stabs them in the back

The Medic is an older man from Stuttgart Germany His main duty is healing the other classes He has a machine called the Medigun which when pointed at a teammate slowly restores their health After healing for a few minutes the Medic is able to deploy an bercharge which makes him and his heal target invincible for a few seconds For defense the Medic has a bone saw and a gun that shoots syringes

There are several different ways the game can be played each with different goals for the two opposing teams For all games players are split into the RED and BLU teams RED stands for Reliable Excavation and Demolition Players on this team have red uniforms Buildings owned by the RED team are also usually red and made of wood BLU stands for Builders League United Players on this team wear blue uniforms Buildings owned by the BLU team are usually blue and made of concrete

The Payload game mode has the offensive team pushing a cart with a bomb on it along a track while the defending team tries to stop them If the offensive team cannot get the cart to the end of the track before the time limit runs out they lose If they are successful the defending teams base is blown up Along the track are Checkpoints Each Checkpoint the offensive team pushes the cart over will give them extra time to get the cart to the end of the track

Valve later added a race mode to Payload maps where both teams push a cart along a track to the other teams base The team that gets the cart to the other teams base first wins

Control Point maps involve both teams attacking and defending the opposing teams Control Points A Control Point is a circle on the ground that glows the color of the team that has captured it Control Points are captured by standing on them for a certain length of time

In attackdefend maps one team has captured all the Control Points and the other team has a time limit to capture them all In territorial control maps each team has captured half of the Control Points and must try to capture the other teams while defending their own King of the Hill maps have a single Control Point that either team must have captured for a certain length of time to win

In Capture the Flag mode the map is split into two nearly identical bases one for each team Both bases have a briefcase in them The goal is for one team to grab the other teams briefcase and bring it back to their own base while defending their own briefcase

Fecundity coming from the word broken wikt linkfecundfecund generally means the ability to reproduce 

In biology and demography fecundity is the ability to reproduce of an organism or population measured by the number of gametes seed set or asexual propagules Fecundity is under both genetic and environmental control and is the major measure of biological fitness Fecundation is another term for fertilisation 

Fecundity can increase or decrease in a population according to current conditions and certain regulating factors For instance in times of hardship for a population such as a lack of food juvenile and eventually adult fecundity may decrease 

In the philosophy of science fecundity refers to the ability of a scientific theory to open new lines of theoretical inquiry

 Ceallaigh was born in Dublin on Capel Street in the north inner city Dublin He joined the National Library of Ireland in 1898 as a junior assistant The same year he joined the Gaelic League becoming a member of the governing body in 1910 and General Secretary in 1915

In 1905 Ceallaigh joined Sinn Fin Sinn Fin then wanted a dual monarchy He was honorary secretary of the party from 1908 until 1925 In 1906 he was elected to Dublin Corporation which id Dublins city council He retained the seat until 1924 

Pdraig Pearse made Ceallaigh his assistant when preparations for the Easter Risingwere being made

After the in 1916 Ceallaigh was imprisoned released and re arrested He escaped from detention in Fairfield in the UK and returned to Ireland

OKelly was elected Sinn Fin MP for College Green in the 1918 British general election Along with other Sinn Fin MPs he refused to take his seat in the British House of Commons Instead they set up an Irish parliament called Dil ireann in Dublin Ceallaigh wasCeann Comhairle of the First Dil He was the Irish Republics envoy to the post World War One peace treaty negotiations at Versailles but the other countries refused to allow him to speak because they did not recognise the Irish Republic

 Ceallaigh was a close friend of amon de Valera and both he and de Valera opposed the Anglo Irish Treaty of December 1921 

When de Valera resigned as President of the Irish Republic on 6 January 1922 Ceallaigh returned from Paristo try to persuade de Valera to return to the presidency A de Valera was furious and ordered Ceallaigh to return to Paris 

During the Irish Civil War OKelly was in jail until December 1923 Afterwards he spent the next two years as a Sinn Fin envoy to the United States

In 1926 when de Valera left Sinn Fin to found his own republican party Fianna Fil Ceallaigh followed him becoming one of the partys founding members In 1932 when de Valera was appointed President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State he made Ceallaigh Minister for Local Government Ceallaigh often tried to publicly humiliate the Governor General of the Irish Free State James McNeill Stunts such as withdrawing the Irish Armys band from playing at diplomatic functions which the Governor General attended or in one notorious case the sight of OKelly and Defence Minister Frank Aiken storming out of a diplomatic function at the French Legation when McNeill the guest of honour arrived damaged Ceallaighs reputation and image particularly when the campaign backfired

Before resigning McNeill published his letters to de Valera about this It made de Valera appear foolish and made de Valera choose a new Governor General To the surprise of many Ceallaighs was not considered for the office Instead former Fianna Fil TD Domhnall Ua Buachalla from County Kildare would be the last Governor General

In 1938 many thought that de Valera wanted to make Ceallaigh the Fianna Fil choice to become President of Ireland under the new Irish constitution Bunreacht na hireann When Lord Mayor of Dublin Alfie Byrne said he wanted to be president there was an all party agreement to nominate Dubhghlas de hde a Protestant Irish Senator Irish language enthusiast and founder of the Conradh na Gaeilge They thought de hde was the only person who might win an election against Alfie Byrne Ceallaigh was appointed Minister of Finance instead and helped create Central Bank in 1942 

 Ceallaigh left the cabinet in 1945 when he was elected President of Ireland in a popular vote of the people defeating two other candidates 

 Ceallaigh was re elected unopposed in 1952 During his second term he visited many nations in Europe and spoke to the United States Congress in 1959 He retired at the end of his second term in 1959 to be replaced by his old friend amon de Valera

 Ceallaigh did not refer any Bills to the Supreme Court to see if they were legal but he did ask his official advisors called the Council of State if he should refer the Health Bill 1947 but he decided not to

 Ceallaighs strong Roman Catholic beliefs sometimes caused problems de Valera often thought that Ceallaigh either deliberately or accidentally leaked information to the Knights of Columbanus and the Church leaders Ceallaigh ensured that his first state visit following the creation of the Republic of Ireland in 1949 was to the Vatican to meet Pope Pius XII  Ceallaigh accidentally revealed the Popes private views on communism This angered the Pope and Stalin This is why he was not given the papal Order of Christ which was given to many Catholic heads of state 

On his retirement as president in 1959 he was described as a model President by the normally hostile Irish Times newspaper Though controversial Ceallaigh was widely seen as a genuine and honest but tactless

He died on November 23 1966 fifty years after the Easter Rising that first brought him to prominence He is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery Dublin

Mary Kate Ryan and Ceallaigh were married from 1918 until Mary Kates death in 1934

In 1936 he married his second wife Phyllis who was Mary Kates sister Another sister was married to Fine Gael leader General Richard Mulcahy and a brother was Fianna Fil minister James Ryan

Lo Delibes was a French composer of Romantic music He is particularly famous for his ballets especially Copplia and operettas and operas of which Lakm is the most famous

Delibess father worked for the post office His mother was musical and played the piano Her father the composers grandfather had been a baritone in the Opra Comique and she had a brother who was an organist and professor at the Paris Conservatoire

When Delibess father died in 1847 his family moved to Paris so that the young Lo who was 11 could continue having a good musical education At first he found it difficult living in a large city as he was used to the countryside He was a student of the well known composer and teacher Adolphe Adam At first he did well in his music lessons and won prizes but after a few years he no longer won any prizes He never tried to win the Prix de Rome which is what all French students of composition normally want to do As a young boy he sang in choirs Later he became a church organist and an accompanist at the Thtre Lyrique

Soon Delibes started to composer operettas He wrote 14 operettas in 14 years He was commissioned to write some music to celebrate the emperors return from Algiers The piece he wrote was called Alger It was a huge success The emperor gave him a gold medal personally fastening a pin with diamonds to his broken wikt linklapellapel In 1864 he became chorus master at the Opra where he coached the chorus to sing many famous operas Two years later he started to write ballets These became very successful and three years later he stopped writing operettas

In 1870 his ballet Copplia was produced By 1884 it had been performed 100 times Together with La Sylphide and Giselle it was one of the most popular of all ballets The story is about a man who makes a mechanical doll Another popular ballet he wrote was Sylvia His most successful opera was Lakm which was first performed at the Opra Comique in 1883 It gives great opportunity for the main soprano especially in the song called the Bell Song Musicians usually think Lakm is his greatest work

Delibes died in 1891 and was buried in the Cimetire de Montmartre Paris

Delibes started to compose at a time when ballet had become less popular in France than it had been earlier Around the time of the Revolution there had been lots of performances of ballet but during the 19th century there was less interest with the exception of La Sylphide and Giselle Delibes was to change that He had a great gift for writing easy melodies At one time he thought he ought to compose like Wagner using richer harmonies and leitmotifs but fortunately he chose not to following instead the style to which he was so well suited Copplia is in the repertoire of all major ballet companies and several of its tunes are familiar to people even if they do not know where they come from The Flower duet from Lakm became particularly well known in recent years through an advert for British Airways

Enkephalins were the first endorphins that were discovered in the brain They are found in many parts of the brain specially in the basal ganglia They act as natural pain killers

Enkephalins are small proteins They consist of five amino acids in each of their molecules The last amino acid is either leucine or methionine

Enkephalin is a brain neurotransmitter that is formed when tyrocine glycine glycine phenylalanine and methionine through a condensation reaction or dehydration synthesis

In biochemistry receptors are special structures that can be found in cellsThese are made of protein molecules such as glycoproteins Receptors bind to specialised molecules If the receptor has this type of molecule it is activated but if it does not it is deactivated Depending on its state a change inside the cell may happen 

In short receptors work like locks and keys With the key the lock can be locked or unlocked If it is unlocked the door belonging to it can be opened

Copplia is a sentimental comic ballet with music by Lo Delibes The choreography was by Arthur Saint Lon to a ballet libretto by Saint Lon and Charles Nuitter It is based on a story by the German writer ETA Hoffmann called Der Sandmann which had been published in 1815 The ballet was first performed in 25 May 1870 at the Thtre Imprial de l Opra in Paris

The story is about a man called Dr Copplius who makes dolls He has just invented a mechanical doll which he calls Copplia The doll looks just like a real person He puts the doll on the balcony of his house A young man called Franz sees the doll thinks she is real and falls in love with her Franzs fiance a girl called Swanilda is very angry

The peasants come in and dance The mayor comes in and says that because the town is going to get a new bell there will be a feast All couples who are engaged to be married will get some money from the Duke The mayor asks Swanilda whether she will be there Swanilda wants to know whether Franz will still be faithful to her She has an ear of corn If it makes a rustling noise then that will mean that Franz does love her However much she shakes it there is no sound Franz tells her that he still loves her

When Dr Copplius goes out for a walk he drops his key Swanilda and her 4 friends find it and pick it up They decide to go into the house to see Copplia Franz decides to go too When Dr Copplius comes back he finds his house full of people

Swanilda and her friends are astonished to find that Copplia is only a doll They make the other mechanical dolls move and they dance around them Doctor Copplius enters and chases them all away apart from Swanilda who has hidden She takes Copplias place When Franz looks through the window Doctor Copplius pretends to be one of his own dolls He invites him in then grabs him and threatens to punish him Then he has another idea He gives Franz something to make him fall asleep and then tries to bring Copplia to life by putting Franzs spirit into the doll The dollmaker is delighted when it seems to be working but he does not realize that it is in fact Swanilda who has disguised herself as the doll He does not know what to do with her and teaches her a Spanish dance and a Scottish dance When Franz wakes up Swanildas friends return and Doctor Copplius realizes he has been tricked

The Duke gives out purses of gold to the couples who are engaged to be married Doctor Copplius comes in and complains that his dolls have been ruined The Duke gives him some gold The peasants dance the Masque of the Hours Franz and Swanilda are forgiven and they are married

The story of the ballet comes from a story called Der Sandmann by ETAHoffmann but the ballet has a different character ETA Hoffmanns story is quite frightening but the ballet is pure comedy Ten years later the composer Jacques Offenbach wrote an opera The Tales of Hoffmann which is about the same story Like the book Offenbachs opera has come quite frightening moments especially when the doll breaks apart

The plan for the first performance of Copplia to take place in 1869 had to change because the dancer who was to dance the main part of Swanilda was seriously ill A desperate search for another dancer took place Delibes went all the way to Italy looking for a suitable ballerina but he did not find one However the choreographer Saint Lon then discovered a girl of 15 in Paris Her name was Giuseppina Bozzacchi She was exceptionally gifted and very youthful She was very young indeed to be chosen for a big part in a professional ballet but Saint Lon made some changes to suit the young girl and she danced the part with tremendous success at its first performance on Napoleon III and the Empress Eugnie were in the audience Bozzacchi danced with incredible grace and she was an excellent actress as well Everyone loved her charm

In July the Franco Prussian War broke out and there were no further performances of Copplia for a while as the theatres were closed Saint Lon died in September and then tragically Giuseppina Bozzacchi died of cholera on her 17th birthday

Copplia has been performed more often at the Paris Opra than any other ballet

de Valera was a leader of Irelands struggle for independence from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland He also led opposition to the anti Treaty in the Irish Civil War  de Valera was the author of the Constitution of Ireland

de Valera was born in the New York Nursery and Childs Hospital in New York City in 1882 to an Irish mother he said that his parents were Catherine Coll Wheelwright an immigrant from Bruree County Limerick and Juan Vivion de Valera a Spanish Cuban settler and sculptor and that they were married in 1881 in New York 

In 1885 after his fathers death de Valera was taken to Ireland by his Uncle Ned He was brought up by his grandmother Elizabeth Coll her son Patrick and her daughter Hannie in County Limerick At the age of sixteen he won a scholarship to Blackrock College County Dublin In his first year in Blackrock College he was Student of the Year In 1903 was became mathematics teacher at Rockwell College County Tipperary When he graduated in mathematics from the Royal University of Ireland he went back to Blackrock College He taught in many other colleges including Belvedere college where he taught Kevin Barry the young Irish republican by the British during the Irish War of Independence

de Valera was an active gaeilgeoir In 1908 he joined the Conradh na Gaeilge where he Dubhghlas de hde later first President of Ireland and also Sinad Flanagan another teacher who he married on 8 January 1910 at St Pauls Church Arran Quay Dublin

On 25 November 1913 when he joined the Irish Volunteers He was soon elected captain of the Donnybrook company then commandant of the Third Battalion and adjutant of the Dublin Brigade He also joined the Irish Republican Brotherhood which secretly controlled the central executive of the Volunteers

On 24 April 1916 the rising began de Valera occupied Bolands Mills Grand Canal Street in Dublin After the fighting de Valera was court martialled convicted and sentenced to death but the sentence was changed to for life imprisonment This was because he was not kept in Kilmainham Jail with the first prisoners executed The delay meant British authorities started to check if he really was an American citizen and wonder how the United States would react to the execution of one of its citizens

de Valeras supporters say he showed leadership skills and a great ability for planning His enemies claim he suffered a nervous breakdown during the Rising

After imprisonment in Dartmoor Maidstone and Lewes prisons in England de Valera and other prisoners were released under an amnesty in June 1917 On 10 July 1917 he was elected member of the British House of Commons for East Clare in a by election after MP Willie Redmond died fighting in World War I

British newspapers and picture postcards often called the Easter Rising the Sinn Fin rebellion From 1917 de Valera was president of Sinn Fin He and the other survivors of the Rising took over Sinn Fin and then turned into a republican party Arthur Griffith had wanted an Anglo Irish dual monarchy with an independent Ireland governed separately from Britain their only link being a shared monarch like Canada and Britain today 

That had been the way Ireland was governed with the so called Constitution of 1782 under Henry Grattan until Ireland joined with Great Britain to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801

Sinn Fin won 73 out of 104 Irish seats in the 1918 general election A lot more people wanted an independent Ireland after the leaders of the Easter Rising were executed of the 1916 leaders and the threat of conscription In January 1919 these Sinn Fin MPs or TDs met in the Mansion House Dublin and formed the First Dil ireann 

de Valera was not at this meeting because he had been arrested  He escaped from Lincoln Prison in February 1919 and when he got back to Dublin he replaced Cathal Brugha as Prime Minister Promh Aire  The Dil Constitution passed by the Dil said that the Promh Aire was prime minister not head of state 

In September 1919 the British authorities said that The Dil was illegal The fighting against Britain escalated into the Irish War of Independence

In January 1921 he got back from The United States with a loan of 5500000 This made him very popular 

In August 1921 de Valera had Dil ireann change the 1919 Dil Constitution to upgrade his title from prime minister to President of the Republic He said that as Irish head of state he would not go to the Treaty Negotiations of OctoberDecember 1921 because the British head of state King George V would not be there either

The Treaty replaced the Republic by a dominion of the British Commonwealth with the King represented by a Governor General of the Irish Free State This was just how Canada was governed Treaty was finally signed on 6 December 1921

de Valeras opponents said that he did not join the negotiations because he knew that the British would only allow an Irish dominion not a republic and did not want to be blamed for giving up the idea of a republic de Valera said he was angry because the delegates working out the treaty had not asked him before signing the treaty But at a secret session of the Dil during the Treaty Debates and publicised in January 1922 his ideas for a treaty included dominion status the Treaty Ports a veto by the parliament in Belfast and the king as head of the Commonwealth Irelands would pay a share of the imperial debt 

When the Treaty was accepted by 64 votes to 57 de Valera and a large minority of Sinn Fin TDs left Dil ireann He resigned and Arthur Griffith was elected President of Dil ireann in his place

In March 1922 de Valera made an angry speech saying that if the Treaty was accepted it might be necessary to wade through Irish blood to achieve Irish freedom Later he said that quotethe IRA would have to wade through perhaps the blood of some of the members of the Government in order to get Irish freedom de Valera speaking in Thurles de Valeras enemies said that this was encouraging civil war

Civil War broke out in late June 1922

Fighting in the Irish Civil War started on 28 June 1922 and ended in May 1923 when the pro treaty Free State forces beat the anti Treaty IRA 

de Valera was supposed to be the head of the anti Treatyites but he had little power Usually he had little influence with the IRA Chief of Staff Liam Lynch de Valera formed a republican government on 25 October 1922 but it had no real authority and was never like the Dil governments of 191921 which was an alternative government to the British even running their own courts 

When the IRAs new Chief of Staff called a ceasefire Frank Aiken on 30 May 1923 the government had won Many republicans were arrested when they came out of hiding and returned home de Valera was arrested in County Clare and interned until 1924

de Valera resigned from the presidency of Sinn Fin after losing a vote to accept the Free State Constitution In March 1926 he formed a new party Fianna Fil Fianna Fil was successful in elections but for over a year a it did not take its seats in the Dil When a new law made candidates promise to take the oath if elected de Valera and his TDs took the Oath of Allegiance in 1927 They said the oath was an empty formula that is just words they had to say they did not have to believe them

Six years after it was founded Fianna Fil won 72 seats in the 1932 general election and had a plurality in the Dil That is it was the largest party but had less than half of all of the seats which would be a majority On 9 March Governor General James McNeill appointed de Valera President of the Executive Council He abolished the oath and stopped paying money owed to Britain 

de Valera called a general election in January 1933 and won 77 seats giving him an overall majority Under his leadership Fianna Fil won further general elections in 1937 1938 1943 and 1944 

de Valera was his own Minister for External Affairs He attended meetings of the League of Nations and was president of the Council of the League on his first appearance at Geneva in 1932 In 1934 he supported the admission of the Soviet Union into the League In September 1938 he was elected nineteenth president of the Assembly of the League a tribute to the international recognition he had won by his independent stance on world questions

During the 1930s de Valera changed a lot of the Irish Free State constitution 

The Governor General of the Irish Free State could reserve or deny the Royal Assent to any changes after being advised by His Majestys Government in London After a legal argument with the British Government the power this was changed to His Majestys Government in the Irish Free State

That meant that de Valera was the only person who could stop a bill becoming law

de Valera abolished

When King Edward VIII abdicted as King of Ireland de Valera passed two Bills 

In July 1936 de Valera wrote to King Edward in London saying that he planned to introduce a new constitution This was only a little different from the Bunreacht na hireann 

The new constitution was not an act of the Dil but was voted for in a referendum because de Valera wanted a new start for the new country he was setting up

Ireland stayed neutral in World War II which was called The Emergency in Ireland  Both the possibility of a German invasion and a British invasion were discussed in the Dil

But even though de Valera hated Britain Irish neutrality often favoured the allies

To be neutral de Valera visited the German minister in Dublin to express sympathy over the death of the Fhrer Along with President Douglas Hyde de Valera was the only head of government to do this de Valera did not visit the American embassy following the death of Roosevelt as David Gray the American Ambassador said he would not receive de Valera All flags were flown at half mast on Roosevelts death on de Valeras instructions

After sixteen years in power Fianna Fil lost the 1948 election John A Costello was Taoiseach of a coalition Government  It was Costello who declared Ireland a republic making de Valeras friend President Ceallaigh Irelands head of state In 1951 de Valera was returned to power but without an overall majority Many people thought this was his worst government He spent several months in the Netherlands where he had six operations on his eyes

Fianna Fil was defeated again in the 1954 general election but in 1957 de Valera won a majority of nine seats This was the beginning of another sixteen year period in office for Fianna Fil But de Valera was only Taoiseach for two years

Operetta is a term which started to be used in the 19th century to describe an opera that was not too serious and often full of fun It is often described as light opera In an opera everything is usually sung In an operetta there is a lot of spoken dialogue and songs and dances are added to this Similar traditions already existed in other countries eg in Germany where the Singspiel tradition was popular

The operetta tradition started in France and soon spread to Austria and other countries It remained popular until the mid 20th century when it gradually turned into musical comedy

The composer Jacques Offenbach can be thought of as the creator of the operetta tradition It grew out of the opra comique which had become quite long and serious There was a need for shorter more humorous musical entertainments Offenbach was composing operettas in the 1850s in Paris  In England such works were often called comic operas or opera comedies  Then Johann Strauss became very popular in Vienna He was already very well known in the ballroom but when he started to write for the theatre he soon became a rival to Offenbach whose operettas had become very popular in Vienna Strausss operetta Die Fledermaus has been performed more than any other operetta In Spain the Zarzuela was a kind of operetta

Many people were involved in the creating and performing of operettas The performers often had to both sing and act very well Bizet Chabrier and Delibes all wrote operettas as well as operas and other types of music In England the operas of Gilbert and Sullivan were a kind of English form of operetta

One of the most popular of all operettas was Die Lustige Witwe by Franz Lhar It was produced in 1905 in Vienna Lhar wrote many other operettas as well Franz von Supp is another composer who wrote operettas in the Austrian tradition The most known Romanian operetta is Crai nou by Ciprian Porumbescu 

In the early 20th century the French operetta became less popular as there was more interest in the Viennese operetta After World War I Berlin was the centre of German operetta By the middle of the 20th century many composers were writing light operas which were based on American dance band music These were no longer called operettas The word operetta continued to be used for light operas which were more in the style of traditional central European music

Investiture means the formal installation of somebody in public office by formally giving him the insignia The term is normally reserved for formal offices of state aristocracy and church

In the Middle Ages investiture was the ceremonial transfer of a fief by an overlord to a vassal The lord invested the vassal with a fiefdom by giving a symbol of the land or office From feudal times up to the present the term has been used in ecclesiastical law to refer to a cleric receiving the symbols of spiritual office such as the pastoral ring mitre and staff signifying transfer of the office 

In the United Kingdom around 2600 people are invested personally by The Queen or a member of the Royal Family A list of those to be honoured is published twice a year in either the New Years Honours List or The Queens Birthday Honours List Approximately 22 Investitures are held annually in Buckingham Palace one or two at the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh and one in Cardiff

The question who should invest whom was the subject of a conflict between the Catholic church and state in the Middle Ages during the so called lay investiture controversy

The Irish War of Independence was fought by the Irish Republican Army against the British soldiers who were trying to keep Ireland under British control

The war was fought between 1919 and July 1921 when the fighting was stopped while a peace treaty was worked out

It began because of the 1916 rising held in Dublin The men who fought the British soldiers that day wanted Britain to move their army out of Ireland and for Ireland to be its own country

These men were defeated and sixteen of the leaders were executed This made Irish people mad Many Irish people turn against British rule These people were called Republicans Republicans lived all over Ireland except in areas in Ulster where people called Unionists lived The Unionists wanted to stay under control of the British Empire In Dublin the political party Sinn Fin won most seats in the Irish Dil They set up the IRA to fight the British soldiers in Ireland The Dail was hated by the British government The British wanted to destroy it

In 1919 fighting started By 1921 the IRA had beaten the Royal Irish Constabulary and Ireland had no police In London the British government began to row over Ireland The war went on until 1922 when Irish Sinn Fin leaders and British MPs made up a peace treaty Most of Ireland was made its own country except in six of the nine counties of Ulster where Unionists still lived The area where Ireland was its own country was called the Irish Free State and the area that stayed under British rule was called Northern Ireland

A bishop is a piece in the board game of chess Each player starts the game with two bishops One starts between the kings knight and the king the other between the queens knight and the queen In chess notation the starting squares are c1 and f1 for Whites bishops and c8 and f8 for Blacks bishopsThe bishop was also already known in Chaturanga He was represented as an armed attendant who sat on the back of an elephant The Arabs called this figure al fil which means elephant The problem was that in Central Europe elephants were not known so they could not recognize the figure The bishops were interpreted differently by the different nations That is why the bishop is a Lufer in Germany a fou in France and a alfiere in Italy

The bishop moves diagonally and can move as far as a player wants it to unless another piece blocks it A bishop can never leave the color of square that it starts on and so can only move to 32 squares of the board

A South Atlantic tropical cyclone is an unusual form of weather event Usually strong wind shear is the biggest problem why tropical cyclones do not normally form in the southern Atlantic Ocean If there was ever a hurricane season in the south Atlantic it would most likely happen during the opposite of the north Atlantic season from December to May with mid March being the peak when the oceans are warmest in the Southern Hemisphere

Cyclone Catarina was an extraordinarily rare tropical cyclone forming in the southern Atlantic Ocean in March 2004 Just after becoming a hurricane it hit the southern coast of Brazil in the state of Santa Catarina on the evening of March 28 with winds estimated near 180 kmh making it a Category 2 storm on the Saffir Simpson Hurricane Scale The cyclone killed 3 10 people and caused millions of dollars in damage in Brazil

This event is thought to be a nearly once in a lifetime event by meteorologists

On April 10 1991 what was either a strong tropical depression or a weak tropical stormFactdateApril 2007 formed in the eastern South Atlantic recorded by weather satellites off the coast of Angola It reached a peak on the 13th and dissipated two days later drifting west southwestward from where it formed Of the few South Atlantic tropical cyclones that have existed this was the only one in the eastern Atlantic This was also the first South Atlantic tropical cyclone ever observed

A small area of convection developed on a trough of low pressure in mid January off Brazil It organized and appeared to become a tropical depression on January 18th The next morning it had a small amounts of convection near the center and well defined bands and the system either a weak tropical storm or a strong tropical depression likely reached its peak Located 150 n miles southeast of Salvador Brazil it weakened as upper level shear normal for the basin prevailed The depression moved inland on the 20th as a circulation with no convection and dissipated the next day over Brazil where it caused heavy rains and flooding This would mark the first time in recorded history that two tropical cyclones have been seen during the same year in the South Atlantic and may be considered to make up the 2003 04 South Atlantic hurricane season

A small area of convection 600 miles southeast of Rio de Janeiro moved into an area of low wind shear and barely 26C warm waters on February 23 2006 The wave had deep convection was able to form a closed LLC and had 35 mih winds as measured by Quikscat on February 24 2006 These characteristics were operationally recognized for three hours before high shear began to tear the system apart just short of the six hours required to be officially declared a tropical depression It is possible that the system maintained these features longer and may have briefly been a tropical depression While under study the system was referred to as 90L Invest The shear would eventually cause the system to dissipate later that night Picture 

Opera buffa is an Italian term meaning comic opera It is mainly used for 18th century Italian comic operas Opera buffa contrasts with opera seria in which the story was a tragedy Opera seria was supposed to be serious while opera buffa was an entertaining musical comedy Like the opera seria everything was sung there was no spoken dialogue This was different from comic opera in other countries The story in opera buffa is told in recitative and then there were arias for the characters to show their feelings and show off their voices 

Although we use the term opera buffa today in the 18th century they called such operas by other names eg commedia in musica dramma giocosa operetta burlesca etc An opera buffa was usually a full length work one which would fill a whole evenings entertainment It was different from an intermezzo or farsa which was a short musical comedy that was performed during the intervals of a musical tragedy although the difference between the two is not always obvious The intermezzo became longer and longer during the 18th century and gradually developed into opera buffa Pergolesis La Serva Padrone was an intermezzo which became very famous after Pergolesis death It influenced opera buffa 

Opera buffa always included a lot of caricature The characters showed human weaknesses such as broken wikt linkstupiditystupidity broken wikt link vanityvanity broken wikt link greedgreed and broken wikt link affectationaffectation They often poked fun at the ruling classes

In opera buffa the acting was always very important It was a very lively show with a lot happening very quickly At the end of each act all the main characters sang together this is called an ensemble

Opera buffa started in Naples and gradually spread to other parts of Italy It was particularly popular at carnival time Important composers of opera buffa include Carlo Goldoni and Baldassare Galuppi

By the end of the 18th century it was not always possible to tell the difference between an opera buffa and an opera seria Mozarts opera Don Giovanni for example has a lot of comedy but there is also a serious side

Opera seria is an Italian term which refers to the serious style of Italian opera in the 18th century It was different from opera buffa which was a musical comedy Opera seria was supposed to be about serious tragedy The term opera seria only started to be used after the time when it was popular in order to talk about the historic period

Italian opera seria was always in the Italian language even when it was composed or performed in other countries such as Germany Austria England and Spain In France the opera seria was not so popular They had their own forms of opera

Popular composers of opera seria included Hasse Vinci Jommelli George Frideric Handel Piccinni Paisiello Cimarosa Gluck and Mozart

Opera seria was often called dramma per musica The story was told in recitative a quick flowing music with simple accompaniment Then there were arias which were the big songs where the singers could show off their skills They were normally in da capo form The opera would start with an overture and there would also be some ensembles where several characters sung at once

The stories of opera seria were usually about the ancient Greek and Roman gods or kings This was different to opera buffa which was about ordinary people and which often made fun of kings and nobility

The main singers in opera seria were mostly castrati male singers who had been castrated when they were young so that they still sang with high voices Gradually during the 18th century the female singers got more of the main roles

One of the first composers of opera seria was Alessandro Scarlatti In England George Frideric Handel wrote many great opera seria The most important man in the development of mid 18th century opera seria was Metastasio who wrote libretti His words were set by the greatest composers in Europe Hasse Porpora and especially Mozart

In the later part of the 18th century Christoph Willibald Gluck changed a lot of traditions in opera He did not want opera to be just a way for singers to show off their voices He wanted the story to be important He did not use dry recitative but tried to make the drama dance and music all important especially the chorus Orfeo ed Euridice was his first important opera followed by others such as Alceste 

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was influenced by Glucks reforms His two great opera seria were Idomeneo and La clemenza di Tito Mostly however Mozart was not so interested in writing about the old Greek gods and kings His other great Italian operas Cosi fan tutte Le Nozze di Figaro and Don Giovanni are something between opera seria and opera buffa These were set to libretti by Lorenzo da Ponte 

Other important opera seria composers were Luigi Cherubini and Gaspare Spontini followed by Rossini whose musical style made further changes to opera seria

Polders make new land for agriculture and make flood protection better because the lake is smaller

Plans for the works date back to the 1600s but it was not until a very bad flood in 1916 that the Dutch parliament finally agreed to pay for the works

First some dams or dykes were built to separate the Zuiderzee from the North Sea The biggest was the Afsluitdijk It is convert32kmmi1 long When it was finished in 1932 the Zuiderzee was completely dammed off and from then on would be called the IJsselmeer

There are gates and sluices at the ends of the Afsluitdijk The gates called locks can be opened to let ships through The sluices let water out of the IJsselmeer If there were no sluices the lake would fill up and flood the countryside This is because it is always being filled with water from rivers and from the polders which are still being drained

A brass mouthpiece is the part of a brass instrument that a player blows into to make a sound The purpose of a mouthpiece is to send vibrations down the instrument to make a musical note

Larger mouthpieces are used on larger instruments and smaller ones are used on smaller instruments This is because a larger mouthpiece makes a lower sound and a smaller mouthpiece makes a higher sound and bigger instruments make lower sounds and smaller instruments make higher sounds

A mouthpiece has many different parts and all its parts have different names

Some very small changes in how a mouthpiece is made can change the sound of an instrument a lot

Some players gold plate their brass mouthpieces or cover them with a thin layer of gold This makes the sound of the instrument better than with any other mouthpiece For some people that are allergic to silver this is the best way to play a brass instrument without getting sick Gold does not smudge so it only has to be cleaned with soap and water once in a while

Silver plating is almost always used on brass mouthpieces because it does not cost too much money and a silver plated mouthpiece helps a player make a pretty good sound Silver plating is not as expensive as gold but it is sometimes very important to have if a player plays a certain way Silver plate gives a clearer sound than gold and is good for styles of playing that need a lot of volume Also silver needs to be cleaned more often because it smudges easily

Another type of mouthpiece is a plastic mouthpiece These mouthpieces are good because they never break or dent they do not cost as much as silver or gold mouthpieces and they are good for playing outdoors They are very often given to players in marching bands They do not make as good sounds as silver or gold mouthpieces though

Two of the newest things mouthpieces can be made out of are stainless steel and titanium They are very rare and are only made by a few companies Steel and titanium mouthpieces do not vibrate as much so they make a very clear sound require much less cleaning and they do not need to be silver plated However they are much more expensive than mouthpieces that are silver or gold plated

Under the Irish Free State the deputy leader was Deputy President of the Executive Council In 1937 the title was changed to Tnaiste 

In history the tnaiste was the heir of the chief or king

The government was called the Executive Council and it was headed by the President of the Executive Council instead of a Prime Minister

The change meant that the King and the Governor General were advised by the Irish government about what to do in Ireland and stopped the British government from having any control over Irish affairs

The constitution of 1937 changed the name of the country to ire or Ireland but the King stayed head of state until 1948

So the British government set up Southern Ireland but there was never any government to take power

After the treaty was confirmed Michael Collins head of Dil ireanns government became Chairman of the Provisional Government

According to the British he met the Lord Lieutenant and was made the Kings prime minister  According to the Irish viewpoint Collins went to accept the surrender of Dublin Castle Arthur Griffith became President of Dil ireann and then both Dil ireann and the House of Commons of Southern Ireland were then replaced in a new election for the Third Dil sometimes called the Provisional Parliament or the Constituent Assembly When Griffith died and a week later Collins was assassinated both in August 1922 WT Cosgravewas appointed to both offices so the Irish nationalist and the British both systems of government joined into one temporary system until the 1922 Constitution of the Irish Free State came into force in December 1922

The Bankstown Bunker was a top secret Royal Australian Air Force base that was used during the Second World War During the war it was Australias main air defence base It is no longer in use The bunker is buried underneath a public park in the suburb of Condell Park in the City of Bankstown which is in the state of New South Wales Australia It is still possible to go into the bunker through a secret passage way

The Bankstown bunker is a three story building that was mostly underground It was secretly used during the Second World War by the Australian air force Builders started to build the bunker in 1942 Workers and volunteers began to work inside the bunker in January 1945 It was called the Sydney Air Defence Headquarters and replaced another secret air force base that was in a secret tunnel This was the Number One Fighter Sector Headquarters underneath St James train station in Sydney After that it was moved to a picture theatre in Bankstown called the Capital Hall The main job for the people who worked in the bunker was to track all planes in the eastern area of the South West Pacific Some of the people who worked in the bunker were from the No2 Volunteer Air Observer Corps The Womens Auxiliary Australian Air Force and a few members of the Royal Australian Air Force and the United States Army Air Forces Workers worked in the bunker 24 hours a day seven days a week in shifts called Flights The people who worked inside the bunker traveled to work in buses with tinted windows Everyone that worked in the bunker had to receive special training

At the end of the war the bunker was no longer used and people forgot about it In 1971 it was rediscovered by a reporter who worked for a local newspaper in the area In 1972 the bunker was set on fire In 1976 houses were built over part of the building whilst the main part is underneath a public park

The bunker was built in the same fashion as the underground Operations rooms of wartime England which planned Britains air defence fighter plane attacks on the invading German Luftwaffe

To get inside the bunker you had to enter through a secret passageway which was hidden under a grassy hill Stairs led to a maze of hallways that lead to different sections There were two different entrances to get inside the bunker The two doors were guarded by special police that worked for the military

The bunker walls were 15 metres thick and it was almost bomb proof It had all the latest equipment of the time to allow it to run as a top secret defence base It had its own code room plotting rooms two escape tunnels radio transmitter room kitchen dining area bathrooms and bedrooms In the center of the bunker was a large operations room This was a large room about two stories high It was the control centre for all air force missions in the Pacific area The room also had a big map of the South West Pacific theater of World War II The bunker also had its own generator air conditioning and switchboards which directed fifty telephone lines The telephone lines went to various locations including radar stations and VAOC lookout posts which reported aircraft locations to the bunker There are rumours of a tunnel running from the bunker to an unknown location

There is a small park at the end of Taylor Street In this park there is a large hill that looks totally out of place It is under this hill that the bunker has been buried It is still possible to get in through a secret doorcite news firstSarah lastHarris authorlink coauthors titleMoves to restore old war rooms url work publisher Sunday Telegraphdate 19th of October 1997accessdate13 09 2007 ref

Coldplay are an English alternative rock band formed in London in 1996 1997 Chris Martin who became the lead singer and frontman of the band and Jonny Buckland who became lead guitarist were looking forward to form a band while at University College London After forming Pectoralz Guy Berryman joined the group as a bassist and they changed their name to Starfish Will Champion joined as a drummer and backup vocalist who plays various instruments making the bands lineup complete Phil Harvey was the groups manager between 1998 and 2001 and has been described as the bands fifth member The band finally changed their name to Coldplay in 1998 Tim Rice Oxley was to be added to the lineup but he refused as he was working with Keane The band later recorded and released three EPs Safety in 1998 Brothers Sisters as a single in 1999 and The Blue Room in the same year The latter was their first release on a major label after signing to Parlophone 

Coldplays early material was compared to acts such as Radiohead Jeff Buckley U2 and Travis They had worldwide fame with the release of the single Yellow in 2000 followed by their debut album released in the same year Parachutes which was nominated for the Mercury Prize The bands second album A Rush of Blood to the Head won multiple awards including NMEs Album of the Year Their next release XY received a slightly less enthusiastic yet still generally positive reception upon its release in 2005 The bands fourth studio album Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends was produced by Brian Eno and released again to largely favourable reviews earning several Grammy nominations and wins Coldplay have sold over 50 million records worldwide

Since the release of Parachutes Coldplay have drawn influence from other sources including Echo the Bunnymen Kate Bush George Harrison and Muse on A Rush of Blood to the Head Johnny Cash and Kraftwerk for XY and Blur Arcade Fire and My Bloody Valentine on Viva la Vida Coldplay have been an active supporter of various social and political causes such as Oxfams Make Trade Fair campaign and Amnesty International The group have also performed at various charity projects such as Band Aid 20 Live 8 Sound Relief Hope for Haiti Now A Global Benefit for Earthquake Relief and the Teenage Cancer Trust

Chris Martin and Jonny Buckland first met during their orientation week at University College London in September 1996 The pair spent the rest of the college year planning a band ultimately forming a group called Pectoralz Guy Berryman a classmate of Martin and Buckland later joined the group By 1997 the group who had renamed themselves Starfish performed gigs for local Camden promoters at small clubs Martin also had recruited his longtime school friend Phil Harvey who was studying classics at Oxford to be the bands manager Coldplay have since accepted Harvey as the fifth member of the group The bands lineup was completed when Will Champion joined to take up percussion duties Champion had grown up playing piano guitar bass and tin whistle he quickly learned the drums despite having no previous experience The band finally settled on the name Coldplay which was suggested by Tim Crompton a local student who had been using the name for his group By 1997 Martin had also met then Classics student Tim Rice Oxley During a weekend on Virginia Water they asked each other to play off their own songs on the piano Martin finding Rice Oxley to be talented asked him to be Coldplays keyboard player but Rice Oxley refused as his own band Keane was already operational Days after this event would shape the second line up of Keane and keep Coldplays unaltered thus leaving both bands as quartets 

In 1998 the band released 500 copies of the Safety EP Most of the discs were given to record companies and friends only 50 copies remained for sale to the public In December of that year Coldplay signed to the independent label Fierce Panda Their first release was the three track Brothers and Sisters EP which they had quickly recorded over four days in February 1999

After completing their final examinations Coldplay signed to Parlophone for a five album contract in the spring of 1999 After making their first appearance at Glastonbury the band went into studio to record a third EP titled The Blue Room Five thousand copies were made available to the public in October and the single Bigger Stronger received BBC Radio 1 airplay The recording sessions for The Blue Room were tumultuous Martin kicked Champion out of the band but later pleaded with him to return and because of his guilt went on a drinking binge Eventually the band worked out their differences and put in place a new set of rules to keep the group intact Inspired by bands like U2 and REM Coldplay decided that they would operate as democracy and that profits would be shared equally Additionally the band determined they would fire anyone who used hard drugs

At first the band planned to record their debut album in the space of two weeks However tours and other live performances caused the recording to spread out between September 1999 and AprilMay 2000 In March 1999 Coldplay began work on their debut album recorded at Rockfield Studios Matrix Studios and Wessex Sound Studios with producer Ken Nelson although the majority of Parachutes tracks were recorded at Liverpools Parr Street Studios The band worked in three studio rooms at Parr Street and tracked much of the album in one of these roomsthe project studio which Nelson describes as basically a demo room The album was mixed by American engineer Michael Brauer in New York Coldplays record label had originally intended to use a mixing engineer for the tracks they picked as singles but eventually hired Brauer to work on all songs for the album During that period they played on the Carling Tour which showcased up and coming acts

After releasing three EPs without a hit song Coldplay charted into the Top 40 with the lead single from Parachutes Shiver Released in March 2000 it reached number 35 on the UK Singles Chart June 2000 was a pivotal moment in Coldplays history the band embarked on their first headlining tour including a showing at the Glastonbury Festival The band also released the breakthrough single Yellow The song shot to number four on the UK Singles Chart and placed Coldplay in public consciousness Yellow and Shiver were initially released as EPs in the spring of 2000 The former was later released as a single in UK on 26 June 2000 In the United States the song was released as the lead single off the then untitled debut album In October 2000 the track was sent to US college and alternative radio outlets

Sleeping sickness or African trypanosomiasis is a disease It is caused by a protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei The tsetse fly spreads it It is endemic in certain areas of tropical Africa Today between 50000 and 70000 people are infected with it

Today drugs are available that can treat the disease The treatment is usually done in a hospital because the drugs have many side effects Second stage drugs based on arsenic are dangerous and about 8 of the people die from taking the drug The best prevention is to avoid insect bites 

The Ayyubid or Ayyoubid Dynasty was a Muslim dynasty of Kurdish origins which ruled Egypt Syria Yemen Diyar Bakr Mecca Hejaz and northern Iraq in the 12th and 13th centuries The Ayyubids are also known as Ayoubites Ayyoubites Ayoubides or Ayyoubides

The Ayyubid Dynasty was begun by Saladin Saladin and his uncle Shirkuh conquered Egypt for the Zengid King Nur ad Din of Damascus in 1169 The dynastys name comes from Saladins father and Shirkuhs brother Najm ad Din Ayyub

The Executive Council was the cabinet of the Irish Free State it was headed by the President of the Executive Council

Constitution of The Irish Free State said that the Vice President would act for the President of the Executive Council while he was absent or until a new President was elected

Because the Executive Council only had five six or seven members the Vice President was also a minister in charge of a department

Neither the ministry of the Irish Republic nor the Provisional Government had a deputy head of government so the office of Vice President of the Executive Council was a new idea of the Free State In 1937 when the Constitution of the Irish Free State was replaced by Bunreacht na hireann the Vice President was replaced by the Tnaiste

Tsetse flies are large bitimg flies that live in the tropical regions of Africa They bite vertebrates and drink their blood They are the insect vectors of some serious diseases

They have been studied a lot because they can spread sleeping sickness and other diseases

The genus Glossina has about 34 species in three groups of species One group of species lives out on the savannah another group lives near rivers and the third group lives in tropical forests

Tsetse have an unusual life cycle Female tsetse only fertilize one egg at a time and keep each egg in their uterus while the offspring develops internally during the first larval stages During this time the female feeds the developing offspring with a milky substance secreted by a modified gland in the uterus 

In the third larval stage the tsetse larva finally leave the uterus and crawl into the ground There it forms a hard outer shell and becomes the pupa It completes its metamorphosis into an adult fly This takes twenty to thirty days while the larva relies on stored resources 

Normally insect larvae feed themselves before pupation but tsetse development occurs without feeding The development is based only on nutritional resources provided by the female parent which shows how blood is a rich source of nutrition The female must get enough energy for her needs for the needs of her developing offspring and to store the resources which her offspring will require until it emerges as an adult

Before the 20th century people and their cattle simply did not live in areas infested with tsetse flies In the 20th century using pesticides after World War II caused as many problems as it solved Now more subtle methods are preferred Tsetse flies can be trapped by using large blue cloths as a lure Another good method is to release irradiated male flies which are sterile Since females mate only once in their lives that much reduces the population

A pun is a joke which is a play on words People make puns in order to make other people laugh Many jokes are actually puns A pun usually uses a word which can have more than one meaning even if the spelling is different

Sometimes a pun may use a whole phrase that can be heard in more than one way as in the following knock knock joke

There is a joke about a man who sent ten different puns to friends in the hope that at least one of the puns would make them laugh Unfortunately no pun in ten did

There are many websites and books which have jokes very often with puns

Puns are easier to make in some languages than others Languages with many homophones are most suitable for puns

Puns do not have to be about homonyms They can sometimes be about a literal use of the word and a metaphor For example if a young man joins the Navy and someone says that he sailed through his exams this is a joke because 1 the expression to sail through something means to do it easily but 2 the Navy is about sailing in ships It is possible to say something like that without realizing that it is a pun

Many British people love making puns especially bad puns Lewis Carroll made many puns in his books Alice in Wonderland and Alice through the Looking Glass

These are also a few examples of different puns Really cool music as the rock band plays on an iceberg Youre fired as the man is shot from a gun

Timpani are drums that are made out of large bowls that are usually made of copper shaped by craftsmen which after being tuned have a skin like material stretched over the top This material used to be a type of vellum or treated skin but modern drums use a synthetic material This top section is known as the drumhead Timpani is an Italian word It is also a plural of the word timpano However timpano is rarely used in informal English More often a timpano is referred to as a drum a timpani or simply a timp Someone who plays a timpani is called a timpanist

Timpani are different from other drums because they are tuned to certain musical notes A tympanist will often describe the drum as being in voice when it is correctly tuned To play it it is hit with a special drumstick or timpani mallet Other drums that are used in orchestras and bands make a sound rather than a note and are not tuned A player normally sits with a group of two three or four timpani around him which is why the name timpani is in the plural 

Timpani were originally used in official bands They can still be seen in the bands of the modern official as in the Household Cavalry of Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom in which the kettle drums are carried by large broken wikt linkpiebaldpiebald drumhorses In the 1700s timpani became popular in orchestral music and can be heard in the music of Handel Beethoven and other 19th century composers wrote music that needed the timpani Nowadays all large orchestras have timpani and some bands that play popular music use them as well

A timpani drumhead also called a timpani head can be made out of two different things Some are made out of animal skin like calfskin or goatskin Other ones can be made out of thick plastic Because plastic heads are hard to break and do not cost as much as animal skin heads they are used more often than animal skin heads However a lot of professional players prefer skin heads because they think that skin heads make a better sound when they are hit The drumhead is stretched over the bowl of the timpani and held on by screws for tuning the timpani 

The screws that hold and tune the drumhead are called tension rods To tune the timpani the tension rods can all be tightened or loosened The timpani makes a higher sound if the tension rods are made tighter and a lower sound if they are loosened There are usually around seven tension rods on the timpani 

Tuning a timpani by turning every tension rod by itself can be very hard so some timpani makers invented different ways to change the drums pitch more quickly 

In a chain timpani the tension rods are all attached to a chain This chain is hooked up to a lever and when a player moves the lever back and forth it tightens and loosens all the screws at the same time to change the pitch of the drum 

A pedal timpani is a timpani that uses a pedal to change its pitch It is the kind of timpani that is used the most today A player can push on the pedal to make the timpani play higher notes or let the pedal come back up to play lower notes There are three different kinds of pedal timpani

Timpani are played with a special kind of drumstick called timpani mallets A player uses two mallets at a time when they play the drum The two parts of the mallet are called the shaft and the head The head is the part of the mallet that is shaped like a circle and is the part that hits the timpani and the shaft is the wooden part of the mallet that is held by a timpanist A timpani mallets head can be made out of many things but is usually made out of a wood sphere that is covered with felt or a thin cloth The shaft of the mallet is usually made out of wood like hickory cherry or bamboo but can also be made out of a metal like graphite or aluminum Some timpani mallets do not have a felt head and just have a wooden one These mallets are sometimes used in classical and baroque music

In the beginning of the 20th century some mallets had shafts made out of whale bones and heads made out of sponges

Hurricane Lorenzo was the twelfth named storm and fourth hurricane of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season It formed in the Bay of Campeche off the east coast of Mexico where it quickly strengthened into a hurricane It made landfall in central Mexico early on September 28 as a Category 1 hurricane

On September 21 an area of convection formed in the western Caribbean Sea associated with a trough of low pressure Convection increased and a wide area of low pressure formed on September 22 as the convection moved northwestward towards the Yucatan Peninsula On September 23 the area of low pressure moved over the Yucatan Peninsula and was creating thunderstorms from the southern Gulf of Mexico to the northwestern Caribbean Sea Over the next few days the large area of low pressure was moving unevenly over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico but convection was restricted from strong upper level winds By September 25 upper level winds started decrease as conditions became more favorable for tropical cyclone formation and by that morning visible satellite imagery showed that a tropical depression could be forming about 180 mi east of Tampico Tamaulipas

During the evening of September 25 a United States Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft found that the area of low pressure had turned into a tropical depression The depression tracked slowly to the south and southwest into the Bay of Campeche On September 26 convection increased and the depression was getting closer to strengthening into a tropical storm At 0300 UTC September 27 the Government of Mexico gave out a tropical storm watch for parts of the Mexican Gulf Coast as the depression was predicted to strengthen into a tropical storm The depression began to quickly strengthen on September 27 and the depression became Tropical Storm Lorenzo around midday Continued strengthening that afternoon brought Lorenzo to hurricane strength less than seven hours after being named Lorenzo made landfall in central Mexico south southwest of Tuxpan as a Category 1 hurricane with 80 mph winds on the Saffir Simpson Hurricane Scale Lorenzo dissipated later that afternoon as the final advisory was given out

A tropical storm warning was given out for the central Mexican Gulf Coast on September 26 When Lorenzo began to rapidly strengthen the warning was raised to a hurricane warning Mexicos Civilian Protection officials declared a red alert for much of the state of Veracruz

At first no evacuations were given out right away as a result of the up coming start of Lorenzo although shelters were set up in the state of Veracruz and officials cancelled classes at all local schools Because of the fast development of the storm though officials quickly evacuated over 100000 people just before landfall by using bullhorns on the streets warning people of the up coming threat

Pemex oil production continued in spite of the threat of the system and its offshore impacts Nonetheless the price of oil increased to record highs of 8390 a barrel from the concerns by investors about possible damage

Moderate damage was reported in east central Mexico as Lorenzo hit the area Shacks were badly damaged by the strong winds a lot of tree damage was reported and many areas lost electricity service Flooding was also reported as rivers quickly rose from the heavy rain and wet ground Scattered landslides were also reported The area was already cleaning up after Hurricane Dean which hit the area in late August

Heavy rain was the cause to at least five deaths which included a woman and two children in Chiconcuautla in Pueblas Sierra Norte region and a senior citizen who fell into a hole near his home in Pnuco Veracruz

Organic matter is matter that has come from a recently living organism 

It is capable of decay or the product of decay or is composed of organic compounds There is not one definition of organic matter only It varies upon the subject it is being used for

Soil is composed of minerals and organic matter as well as living organisms The organic matter in soil comes from plants and animals In a forest for example leaf litter and woody material falls to the forest floor This is sometimes called organic material When it decays to the point it is no longer recognizable it is called soil organic matter When the organic matter has broken down into a stable humic substances that resist further decomposition it is called humus 

The equation of organic with living organisms comes from the now abandoned idea of vitalism that attributed a special force to life that alone could create organic substances This idea was first questioned after the abiotic synthesis of urea by Friedrich Whler in 1828

She defeated Fianna Fils Brian Lenihan and Fine Gaels Austin Currie in the 1990 presidential election the first time Fianna Fil had lost a presidential election

She resigned the presidency four months ahead of the end of her term of office to begin a five year term in the United Nations as United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees In 2002 Robinson became Honorary President of Oxfam International And from 2008 to 2010 she was the predident of the International Commission of Jurists

In 1982 the Labour Party entered into a coalition government with Fine Gael Many expected Robinson to be the attorney general but the Labour party leader instead picked an unknown new senior counsel called John Rogers Shortly afterwards Robinson resigned from the party in protest at the Anglo Irish Agreement she said that unionist politicians in Northern Ireland should have been consulted as part of the deal

Robinson decided not to seek re election to the senate in 1989 One year later she agreed to become the first Labour candidate for the presidency and the first woman candidate in what was only the second presidential election to be contested by three candidates since 1945

The main opposition party Fine Gael was no well organised They gambled that former Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald would run as its candidate then they asked Peter Barry who had previously been willing to run but had run out of patience and was no longer interested The partys third choice was the former civil rights campaigner Austin Currie a new TD and former minister in Brian Faulkners power sharing executive in Northern Ireland from 1973 1974

Fianna Fil chose Tnaiste and Minister for Defence Brian Lenihan Lenihan was popular and widely seen as humorous and intelligent Like Robinson he had made liberal policy reforms In the 1960s he abolished censorship for example He was seen as a near certainty to win the presidency The only question asked was whether Robinson would beat Currie and come second

But Taoiseach Charles Haughey of Fianna Fil was not popular and the Labour Party leader Dick Spring was becoming more popular

During the campaign people found out that what Lenihan had told friends in private showed he had lied in public about the 1982 dissolution of Dil ireann

Lenihan denied he had pressured the President but then a tape was produced of an on the record interview he had given to a postgraduate student the previous May where he talked about trying to apply pressure Lenihan claimed that on mature recollection he had not pressured the President and had been confused in his interview with the student But the government threatened to fall over the issue

Lenihan was dismissed as Tnaiste and Minister for Defence

Lenihan still managed to win the first count In the Single Transferable Vote system Austin Currie was eliminated and his second choice votes were counted Most were for Robinson Lenihan became the first Fianna Fil presidential candidate in the history of the office to lose a presidential election Robinson now became President

Trail of Tears was a forced movement of Indians in the United States Because so many died it is called Trail of Tears In the Cherokee language the Trail of tears is called nu na hi du na tlo hi lu i Through this movement the USA expanded their country in size

In 1829 gold was found near Dahlonega in Georgia This resulted the first Floridian gold rush in American History But at that time an Indian nation called Cherokees lived in Georgia It was a civilized nation Many Cherokee children went to American schools the Cherokees had their own newspaper built three story houses and even some owned slaves Even so President Andrew Jackson wanted this land to belong to the United States Therefore he signed a law that forced the Cherokee nation to move The was is called the Indian Removal Act At that time the Cherokee nation had its own government This means that laws made by the USA could not affect them Therefore Jackson signed laws that let him take nearly all the Cherokees rights The Cherokee nation did not want to accept those laws or the Indian Removal Act so the Cherokees chief John Ross decided to try to defend the Cherokee rights through US courts

In 1832 the Supreme Court said that the Indian Removal Act was illegal The judges said the Cherokee nation does not belong to the USA They are living in their own country with their own government in which the laws of Georgia can have no force So the US government had no right to take the land

Nevertheless the US government used a treaty called treaty of New Echota to remove the Cherokee nation by force The treaty was not signed by an official Cherokee leader so it was not legal A petition signed by 15000 Cherokees was ignored by the government and the Supreme Court

The deadline for Cherokees to leave their land voluntarily was on May 23 1838 President Martin van Buren sent General Winfield Scott to lead the forcible removal On May 26th the operation began 7000 soldiers forced Cherokees to leave their land All Cherokees who lived until this moment in their land had to leave now They went to the new Indian territory This was what now is Oklahoma and Arkansas

About 17000 Cherokees and 2000 of their slaves had to move to their new land Within three weeks they were all forced into camps They travelled in groups of 1000 to 3000 people on three main routes they started in Chattanooga Tennessee Guntersville Alabama and Charleston Tennessee From there they started their trip to a new Indian territory Most Cherokees had to walk by foot others wealthy men could use wagons There were also about 660 wagons provided by the Federal government The trip was about 1200 miles long During the trip many had problems with diseases and the winter weather There are different numbers of how many died Some say 2000 and others say 6000 but most say 4000 people died About half of them died in camps and the other half during the trip It is said that many Cherokees sang a Cherokee version of the song Amazing Grace which became a kind of anthem for the Cherokee nation

There were different routes the Cherokees took

This route was taken by three groups in total 2800 Cherokees The first group left on June 6 and reached the Indian territory after 13 days All groups started at Rosss Landing at the Tennessee River They used boats to travel to the Ohio River They then took this river southward which took them to the Mississippi River From there they moved through the Arkansas River westwards They arrived near Fort Coffee The second and third group had a lot of problems with diseases so their trip took longer

All others took land routes They traveled in groups with a size of 700 1600 people all led by conductors chosen by John Ross except for those who signed the Treaty of New Enchota They were led by other people They usually took the southern route and John Ross groups the northern route Both sides used already existing roads The most Cherokees took the northern route The route lead through central Tennessee southwestern Kentucky and southern Illinois The groups crossed the Mississippi in the north of Cape Giraudoux in Missouri then traveled through southern Missouri and west of Arkansas Many died because of diseases lack of water and bad road conditions All land routes usually ended near Westville Oklahoma There were many more different land routes only taken by few people Through their trip Cherokees had problems with illnesses Because they were in large groups they broken wikt linkinfectinfected each other easily

Oregano or Pot Marjoram is a species of Origanum It is native to Europe the Mediterranean region and southern and central Asia It is a perennial herb It can grow to 20 80 cm tall Its leaves are opposite each other They are 1 4 cm long The flowers are purple They can grow 3 4 mm long The name of the plant comes from the Greek origanon oros mountain the verb ganousthai delight in 

 Growing Oregano for cooking 

The subspecies of oregano Origanum vulgare hirtum is an important herb It is used for cooking especially in Greek and Italian cuisines The leaves are used for cooking

Oregano is often used for tomato sauces fried vegetables and grilled meat Together with basil it adds much to the special character of many Italian dishes

Oregano is an ingredient needed for Greek cuisine It adds flavour to the Greek salad It can be used separately It can also be added to the lemon olive oil sauce that goes with almost every fish or meat barbecues and some casseroles

Oregano has an aromatic warm and slightly bitter taste The taste varies in intensity good quality is so strong that it almost numbs the tongue but the cultivars adapted to colder climates have often unsatisfactory flavour The influence of climate season and soil on the composition of the essential oil is bigger than the difference between the various species

The related species Origanum onites and O heracleoticum have similar flavours A closely related plant is marjoram from Asia Minor That plant has a completely different taste This is because phenolic compounds are missing in its essential oil Some breeds show a flavour intermediate between oregano and marjoram The Oregano plant is also commonly found in the meditteranian region and the black sea

The dish most associated with oregano is pizza

Oregano is high in antioxidant activitybecause of a high content of phenolic acids and flavonoids  Additionally oregano has shown antimicrobial activity against food borne pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes Both of these characteristics may be useful in both health and food preservation In the Philippines oregano is not commonly used for cooking but is rather considered as a primarily medicinal plant useful for relieving childrens coughs

Origanum is a genus of herbs They are native to the Mediterranean and Asia well known members include Oregano and Marjoram Some of the species are used by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species

Basil is a plant of the Family Lamiaceae It is also known as Sweet Basil or Tulsi It is a tender low growing herb that is grown as a perennial in warm tropical climates Basil is originally native to India and other tropical regions of Asia It has been cultivated there for more than 5000 years It is prominently featured in many cuisines throughout the world Some of them are Italian Thai Vietnamese and Laotian cuisines It grows to between 3060 cm tall It has light green silky leaves 35 cm long and 13 cm broad The leaves are opposite each other The flowers are quite big They are white in color and arranged as a spike 

The plant tastes somewhat like anise with a strong pungent sweet smell Basil is very sensitive to cold It is best grown in hot dry conditions While most common varieties are treated as annuals some are perennial including African Blue and Holy Thai basil 

The word basil comes from the Greek meaning royal This is because it is believed to have grown above the spot where St Constantine and Helen discovered the Holy Cross The Oxford English Dictionary quotes speculations that basil may have been used in some royal unguent bath or medicine Basil is still considered the king of herbs by many cookery authors An alternative etymology has basil coming from the Latin word basilicus meaning dragon and being the root for basilisk but this likely was a linguistic reworking of the word as brought from Greece

Most of the time Basil should be used fresh In recipes it is generally added at the last moment Cooking it quickly destroys the meal The fresh herb can be kept for a short time in plastic bags in the refrigerator Using a freezer will allow for it to be kept a longer time In both cases it needs being blanched quickly in boiling water The dried herb also loses most of its flavour and what little flavour remains tastes very different with a weak coumarin flavour like hay

Mediterranean and Indochinese cuisines frequently use basil In Mediterranean cuisines it is often combined with tomato Basil is one of the main ingredients in pestoa green Italian oil and herb sauce from the city of Genoa The other two main ingredients of Pesto are olive oil and pine nuts The most commonly used Mediterranean basil cultivars are Genovese Purple Ruffles Mammoth Cinnamon Lemon Globe and African Blue Chinese also use fresh or dried basils in soups and other foods In Taiwan people add fresh basil leaves into thick soups They also eat fried chicken with deep fried basil leaves

Basil is sometimes used with fresh fruit and in fruit jams and sauces Most commonly this is done with strawberries but also raspberries or dark colored plums Some people say that the flat leaf basil used in Vietnamese cooking is more suitable for use with fruit

When soaked in water the seeds of several basil varieties become gelatinous They are used in Asian drinks and desserts such as falooda or sherbet Such seeds are known variously as sabja subja takmaria tukmaria falooda or ht They are used for their medicinal properties in Ayurveda the traditional medicinal system of India

Several other basils including some other Ocimum species are grown in many regions of Asia Most of the Asian basils have a clove like flavour that is generally stronger than the Mediterranean basils In China the local cultivar is called while the imported varieties are specifically called or although often refers to another different kind plant parsley

Lemon basil has a strong lemony smell and flavour very different from those of other varieties because it contains a chemical called citral It is widely used in Indonesia where it is called kemangi and served raw together with raw cabbage green beans and cucumber as an accompaniment to fried fish or duck Its flowers broken up are a zesty salad condiment

Basil grows well in hot weather It behaves like an annual if there is any chance of a frost In Northern Europe the northern states of the US and the South Island of New Zealand it will grow best if sown under glass in a peat pot It can be planted out in late springearly summer when there is little risk of frost It fares best in a well drained sunny spot

Although basil will grow best outdoors it can be grown indoors in a pot Like most herbs it will do best on a south facing windowsill It should be kept away from extremely cold drafts It grows best in strong sunlight A greenhouse or cloche is ideal if available Basil plants can even be grown in a basement under fluorescent lights

If its leaves have wilted from lack of water it will recover if watered thoroughly and placed in a sunny location Yellow leaves towards the bottom of the plant are an indication that the plant needs more sunlight or less fertilizer

In sunnier climates such as Southern Europe the southern states of the US the North Island of New Zealand and Australia basil will thrive when planted outside It also thrives over the summertime in the central and northern United States but dies out when temperatures reach freezing point to grow again the next year if allowed to go to seed It will need regular watering but not as much attention as is needed in other climates

Basil can also be propagated very reliably from cuttings in exactly the same manner as Busy Lizzie with the stems of short cuttings suspended for two weeks or so in water until roots develop

If a stem successfully produces mature flowers leaf production slows or stops on any stem which flowers the stem becomes woody and essential oil production declinesTo prevent this a basil grower may pinch off any flower stems before they are fully mature Because only the blooming stem is so affected some can be pinched for leaf production while others are left to bloom for decoration or seeds 

Once the plant is allowed to flower it may produce seed pods containing small black seeds These can be saved and planted the following year Picking the leaves off the plant helps promote growth largely because the plant responds by converting pairs of leaflets next to the topmost leaves into new stems

Basil suffers from several plant diseases that can ruin the crop and reduce yield Fusarium wilt is a soilbourne fungal disease that will quickly kill younger basil plants Seedlings may also be killed by Pythium damping off 

A common foliar disease of basil is gray mold caused by Botrytis cinerea can also cause infections post harvest and is capable of killing the entire plant Black spot can also be seen on basil foliage and is caused by the fungi genus Colletotrichum

Basil like other aromatic plants such as fennel and tarragon contains estragole a known carcinogen and teratogen in rats and mice While human effects are currently unstudied the rodent experiments indicate that it would take 1001000 times the normal anticipated exposure to become a cancer risk 

There are many rituals and beliefs associated with basil The French call basil herbe royale Jewish folklore suggests it adds strength while fasting It is a symbol of love in present day Italy but represented hatred in ancient Greece and European lore sometimes claims that basil is a symbol of Satan African legend claims that basil protects against scorpions while the English botanist Culpeper cites one Hilarius a French physician as affirming it as common knowledge that smelling basil too much would breed scorpions in the brain

Holy Basil also called Tulsi is highly revered in Hinduism and also has religious significance in the Greek Orthodox Church where it is used to prepare holy water It is said to have been found around Christs tomb after his resurrection The Serbian Orthodox Church Macedonian Orthodox Church and Romanian Orthodox Church use basil to prepare holy water and pots of basil are often placed below church altars

In Europe they place basil in the hands of the dead to ensure a safe journey In India they place it in the mouth of the dying to ensure they reach God The ancient Egyptians and ancient Greeks believed that it would open the gates of heaven for a person passing on 

In Boccaccios Decameron a memorably morbid tale tells of Lisabetta whose brothers slay her lover He appears to her in a dream and shows her where he is buried She secretly disinters the head and sets it in a pot of basil which she waters with her daily tears The pot being taken from her by her brothers she dies of her grief not long after Boccaccios tale is the source of John Keats poem Isabella or The Pot of Basil A similar story is told of the Longobard queen Rosalind

Guy Fawkes Night remembers the Gunpowder Plot This was when a group of people wanted to use explosives to destroy the British Houses of Parliament in 1605 The people who created the Gunpowder Plot wanted a Catholic king for Britain On 5 November at night the British king James I was inside the Houses of Parliament King James was a member of the Protestant church and the Gunpowder Plot group were Catholic If the plan worked then the new Parliament may have been destroyed

The plan did not work and soldiers captured the Catholic rebels One of the rebels was Guy Fawkes

Today people create open air fires in towns across England They remember the explosives by exploding fireworks in public places People put cotton dummies on the bonfires The guys represent Guy Fawkes These guys are burnt at the top of the fire

Traditionally children make the guy some days before 5 November then carry it in the streets asking for money  the traditional expression is penny for the guy

In British schools children draw fireworks and learn the traditional rhyme for November 5

Remember remember the Fifth of November

The Berlin Blockade was from 24 June 1948 to 11 May 1949 It began when the Soviet Union blocked railway and road access by the three Western powers to the Western occupied sectors of Berlin The Blockade stopped after the Western powers used aeroplanes to airlift food and other things that people needed

The Soviet Union began the blockade because they thought that monetary reform in the three German Occupation zones controlled by the Western powers which started on 21 June 1948 made the western parts of Germany too strong and wanted to force the west out of their occupation zone The Russians wanted one Germany without an army that they could control

When the Allied Powers met at Potsdam they agreed to divide Germany into four occupation zones and divided Berlin into four zones as well Berlin was surrounded by the Soviet occupation zone so the only way to get to the three western controlled sectors was driving through Soviet controlled territory

On 24 June 1948 the Soviet Union blocked access to the three Western held sectors of Berlin They cut off all rail and road routes going through Soviet controlled territory in Germany They also blocked routes by river and canal to the Baltic Sea The Western powers had arranged a treaty with the Soviets guaranteeing the right to use the roads railways and waterways

The commander of the US occupation zone in Germany General Lucius D Clay wanted to send some tanks along the Autobahn from West Germany to West Berlin with instructions to fire if they were stopped or attacked President Truman said no because that may start a war Clay was told to ask General Curtis LeMay commander of United States Air Forces in Europe to see if an airlift was possible General Albert Wedemeyer the US Army Chief of Staff was in Europe when the blockade began He had been commander of the American forces in India and China in 194445 He knew about the Allied airlift from India over The Hump of the Himalayas to China He was in favour of starting an airlift

The first flight of the airlift was thirty two C 47 cargo planes on 26 June 1948 They carried 80 tons of cargo including milk flour and medicine

So many things had to be flown into Berlin that aircraft took off every three minutes If an aircraft missed its landing place it could not fly around the airfield and try again it had to return to its base This was easier and safer than holding up the aircraft following behind

The Americans also recruited ex Luftwaffe aircraft mechanics to help with maintenance when the Allies realised that the blockade was going to last longer than the expected three weeks

British US Australian Canadian New Zealand and South African pilots flew in the airlift The French were fighting in their colonies in South East Asia and could not spare many aeroplanes for the airlift Instead they built a new and larger airport in its sector on the shores of Lake Tegel They completed the building in less than 90 days Today it is the Berlin Tegel International Airport

Hundreds of aircraft nicknamed Rosinenbomber by Berliners were used to fly in a wide variety of cargo ranging from large containers to small packets of candy with tiny individual parachutes intended for the children of Berlinflown out of Berlin on return flights

278228 flights were made and 2326406 tons of food and supplies including more than 15 million tons of coal were delivered to Berlin

The USSR lifted its blockade at midnight on 11 May 1949 But the airlift did not end until 30 September 1949 because the Western states wanted to build up enough supplies in West Berlin in case the Soviets blockaded it again

The three major Berlin airfields involved were Tempelhof in the American Sector RAF Gatow in the British and Tegel in the French To keep everything safe air traffic control located at Tempelhof A new four power organization also started Berlin Air Safety Center BASC only closed down in 1990 when Germany was reunited and the ordinary German civilian air traffic control took over

The British had about 150 C 47 Dakotas and 40 Avro Yorks The RAF was also using 10 Short Sunderlands and later by Short Hythe flying boats These flew Finkenwerder on the Elbe near Hamburg to the Havel river The flying boats were designed to resist rust and water damage so were very useful for transporting bulk salt which would have rusted the other planes Many other aircraft were later used and the British had flown in about 100000 tons of cargo by the end of the blockade

39 British and 31 US pilots died during the blockade There is a monument with their names in front of Tempelhof airport Similar monuments can be found at the military airfield Wietzenbruch near Celle and at Rhein Main Air Base

Tegel was developed into west Berlins principal airport and by 2007 had been joined by a redeveloped Berlin Schoenefeld in Brandenburg As a result of these two airports Tempelhof is being closed whilst Gatow no longer serves as an airport and now hosts the Museum of the German Luftwaffe During the 1970s and 1980s Schoenefeld had had its own crossing points through the Berlin Wall for western citizens

The lancelets or Cephalochordata are a group of primitive chordates which were formerly called Amphioxus 

Lancelets are the modern survivors of an ancient chordate lineage with a fossil record dating back to the Cambrian period The lancelets are usually said to be the sister group of the craniates They are a small group of about 30 species in two genera

Lancelets are usually found buried in sand in shallow parts of temperate or tropical seas In Asia they are harvested commercially as food for humans and domesticated animals They are an important object of study in zoology as they provide indications about the origins of the vertebrates 

Lancelets serve as an intriguing comparison point for tracing how vertebrates have evolved and adapted Although lancelets split from vertebrates more than 520 million years ago their genomes hold clues about evolution particularly how vertebrates have employed old genes for new functions They are regarded as similar to the archetypal vertebrate form

The genome of the Florida lancelet has been sequenced Most authors regard amphioxus as the closest relative of the Vertebrata on the basis of 1015 morphological features that are not seen in tunicates

Anna Gldi was probably the last person in Europe to be executed as a witch 

Gldin was born into a poor family and worked as a servant She had two children Her first child died shortly after being born and Gldin was accused for killing it She later worked for a physician from Glarus Jakob Tschudi who was one of the richest and most influential people in the Canton of Glarus When she worked there small needles were found in the milk for one of the daughters of Tschudi Additionally Tschudis relatives claimed that the daughter had spewn nails on several occasions 

For this reason Gldin was accused of bewitching Tchudis daughter Under torture she confessed that she had used the powers of the Devil On June 13 1782 she was sentenced to die by the sword but the verdict did not mention witchcraft The execution followed soon afterwards After the execution the paper trail was destroyed Despite these efforts the case created an uproar in other parts of Switzerland and in Germany because the public saw Gldin as an innocent victim

Walter Hauser a journalist looked at sources that were not known to date He thinks Anna Gldin might have had an affair with her master Johann Jakob Tschudin During this affair he might possibly have raped her Adulterers were seen as unfit to hold a public office at the time For this reason Tschudi probably decided to do away with Gldi He initiated the trial for witchcraft which ended in her execution

Gertrud Pinkus made a film about Anna Gldins life in 1992 It is called Anna Gldin  Letzte Hexe In it Cornelia Kempers plays Anna Gldin

In March 2007 both the government and the Church of Glarus refused to say Anna Gldin had been innocent 225 years after her execution They said that in the minds of the people of Glarus this rehabilitation had already taken place

On 20th September 2007 the Swiss parliament decided that in Anna Gldins case justice was wrong Fritz Schiesser as representative for Glarus in the Swiss parliament called for Anna Gldins exoneration A museum is open in Glarus dedicated to her

Tropical Storm Gabrielle was a tropical storm that moved over eastern North Carolina before turning out to the sea It was the seventh named storm of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season Gabrielle formed as a subtropical cyclone on September 8 about 385 miles southeast of Cape Lookout North Carolina Wind shear affected the storm for much of its existence although a brief decrease in the shear allowed the system to strengthen into a tropical storm On September 9 Gabrielle made landfall on the coast of North Carolina Turning to the northeast the storm quickly weakened and died out on September 11 The storm dropped heavy rainfall near its actual landfall location but little precipitation in other areas Total damage was minor and there were no reported deaths

A dying cold front moved off the coast of Georgia on September 2 leaving an area of clouds and showers that slowly moved eastward This area began to organize and by late on September 4 the thunderstorms had built up to the east of the systems center On September 5 a Hurricane Hunters aircraft reported that the system had not yet become a tropical or subtropical cyclone A trough caused some wind shear which stopped the storm from gaining any strength However the area soon became more favorable for the storm to strengthen 

Because of this the storm started to develop about halfway between North Carolina and Bermuda The storm began to turn slowly toward the west northwest On September 7 its center became slightly stronger On September 8 the storm was named Subtropical Storm Gabrielle by the National Hurricane Center At this time Gabrielle was about 385 miles southeast of Cape Lookout North Carolina

After becoming a subtropical cyclone Gabrielle was found to be in an area with cooler air to the north dry air to the south and west some wind shear and cooler water temperatures along the storms path These conditions made it so the storm could not strengthen much However a curved band of thunderstorms formed in the storms northern and western sections and the circulation became better organized Later the rainbands died out leaving the center of the low pressure system far away from the area of thunderstorms To be a strong tropical cyclone the center and the thunderstorms need to be located over each other Soon the storm began to gain more strength and it was re named to Tropical Storm Gabrielle on September 7 while located about 185 miles southeast of Cape Lookout North Carolina

Wind shear slowly went down as the storm passed over the Gulf Stream allowing strong thunderstorms to quickly form near the center and at about 1545 UTC Tropical Storm Gabrielle hit the coast of North Carolina It had winds possibly as strong as 60 mph at time The storm turned to the north and north northeast and re entered the ocean on September 10 Gabrielle weakened to a tropical depression and still kept scattered thunderstorms near it as it tracked along the northern part of the Gulf Stream By midday on September 11 Gabrielle died out to the south of Canada By early the next day the remnants of Gabrielle were absorbed by another cold front

When Gabrielle became a subtropical storm the National Hurricane Center sent out a tropical storm watch from Edisto Beach South Carolina to Oregon Inlet in North Carolina including the Pamlico Sound As the storm came close to land the storm watch for areas south of Cape Fear North Carolina was taken away At the same time a tropical storm warning was declared from Surf City North Carolina to the North Carolina Virginia state border A tropical storm watch was also issued for parts of the Delmarva Peninsula and Chesapeake Bay 

Before the storm arrived the National Park Service closed visitor centers and campgrounds along the Outer Banks For about 12 hours the ferry between Hatteras and Ocracoke was closed down The governor of North Carolina put rescue teams on standby Some people were told to tighten down loose objects and to stay inside when the storm passed over Because the tropical storm was expected to be minor no evacuations were ordered On Ocracoke Island boats were taken out to prepare for Gabrielle The threat of the storm made it so a fishing contest was canceled at Atlantic Beach 

At first forecasters or weather men were not sure where Gabrielle would go They said it was possible for the storm to hit areas as far north as New York Big waves and rip currents were predicted so the Coast Guard helped to prepare for the storm in the Northeastern United States On Cape Cod Massachusetts a jet airplane flew along the coastline giving storm advisories to offshore boats A Coast Guard patrol boat was sent offshore for search and rescue Sailors were told to be very careful in the storm However the storm passed well to the south with little effect

Large waves from Gabrielle along the coast of Florida caused a surfer to drown Around 200 others had to be rescued from the rough seas People at New Smyrna Beach Florida said waves reached convert6to9ftm 

By September 9 the outer rainbands of the cyclone began hitting southeastern North Carolina Constant high winds occurred along coast reaching 44 miles per hour at Frisco Wind gusts were sometimes stronger a gust of 61 miles per hour was recorded at Ocracoke Along the coast of North Carolina waves were convert10to12ftm high Rip currents caused many swimmers to be rescued by lifeguards There was not much rain from the storm in most areas but near the storms center 903 inches of rain fell

Where the most rain fell some flooding formed This prevented farmers from harvesting their crops Much of North Carolina was considered to be in a drought so people hoped Gabrielle would bring needed water However in most locations no rain occurred The storm left part of North Carolina Highway 12 on Hatteras Island closed for three hours because of flooding Other streets in Morehead City and Beaufort were closed A few buildings in the area had minor damage from the flooding In Carteret County the flood waters did 5000 in damage Storm surge from Gabrielle was small at just convert3ftm above normal at Hatteras Island Overall damage in the state was minor and no people died

When the storm was called Gabrielle it was the fourth time that the name was used for a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic Ocean The name was used previously in 1989 1995 and 2001 Because Tropical Storm Gabrielle was not bad the name Gabrielle was not retired and will be used for the 2013 Atlantic hurricane season

Eutheria is the taxonomical name for the main group of living mammals 

This taxon contains the placental mammals of which humans are one species 

Eutheria was introduced by Thomas Henry Huxley in 1880 Members of Eutheria are now found on all continents and in all oceans

The terms Eutheria and Placental do not mean quite the same thing A few early eutherians in the Lower Cretaceous were not placentals Eomaia is the earliest example

All living Eutherians are placental mammals This means that a Eutherian fetus is fed during gestation by a placenta The offspring of Eutherians are carried in the mothers uterus until fully developed

Eutherians are different from other mammal groups such as monotremes and marsupials which are not placental 

Monotremes for example lay eggs which protect the young until they are fully developed Marsupials give birth to young who are not completely developed Their young then move to a special pouch in the mothers body to continue their development 

The earliest known eutherian species is the extinct Eomaia scansoria from the Lower Cretaceous in China

Cetartiodactyla is the taxonomical superorder which includes whales and even toed ungulates The name was created by merging the name for the two orders Cetacea and Artiodactyla into a single word Cetartiodactyla is commonly used because it is thought that whales evolved from the artiodactyls Because of this their closest living land relative is thought to be the hippopotamus 

Tetrapods are vertebrate land animals The basic tetrapod plan is four legs and feet This kind of locomotion is quadrupedal Amphibians reptiles dinosaurs birds and mammals are all tetrapods Even though snakes do not have limbs they are tetrapods because they evolved from animals with four limbs 

The earliest tetrapods evolved from the Sarcopterygii or lobe finned fish into air breathing amphibians perhaps in the Upper Devonian period This means the transition took place in fish before the land was the main habitat This is typical of transitional fossils undergoing mosaic evolution

Research by Jennifer Clack showed that the earliest tetrapods lived entirely in water They could not live on land Before this it was believed that fish had first moved onto land either looking for food or to find water when the pond they lived in dried out It was believed that they later evolved legs lungs and other body parts to live better on land 

Early tetrapods have been found in swampy habitats like shallow wetlands coastal lagoons brackish river deltas and even shallow marine sediments There is much to suggest that these are the kind of environments in which the tetrapods evolved Also because fossils of early tetrapods are found widely in the Old Red Sandstone continent they must have spread by following the coastal lines This means they could not have lived only in freshwater

Clear fossil tetrapod tracks from the mid Devonian predate previous tetrapod records by 18 million years These tracks are from the Middle Devonian of Poland dated to nearly 400 million years ago The footprints were made in the mud of a tropical lagoon and no animal of that time could have made the tracks except a tetrapod The find strongly suggests that the animals were fish not amphibia when the transition to limbs occurred The term fishapod is becoming used They would have been derived from lobe finned fish but of a genus whose body fossil has not yet been found The Polish team suggest the fish tetrapod transition might have taken place as early as the Lower Devonian

Between the lobe finned fish tetrapods and the first amphibia and amniotes in the Middle Carboniferous lies a gap of 30 million years with few satisfactory tetrapod fossils This noted in 1950 is Romers Gap Some new fossils were found in the 1990s such as Pederpes right in the middle of the Romer Gap The gap still obscures the details of the tetrapod transition

Whereas amphibia lay their eggs in water all other tetrapods lay cleidoic eggs These eggs are like private little ponds protecting and nourishing the embryo until it grows into a hatchling This was a key evolutionary invention which allowed the amniotes to invade the land Once the amniotes were truly land animals there followed a huge adaptive radiation This was one of the most significant advances in vertebrate evolution

Simple example cladogram   Warm bloodedness evolved somewhere in the synapsidmammal transition  Warm bloodedness must also have evolved at one of

Some notes The tetrapod clade separated from fish in the Upper Devonian The amniotes were the earliest to lay cleidoic eggs The Synapsids and the sauropsids are sister clades in particular reptiles did not give rise to mammals

There are three main groups of living tetrapods Each group also includes many extinct groups

Snakes and other legless reptiles are tetrapods because they are evolved from ancestors who had four limbs This is also true for caecilians and aquatic mammals



A partial taxonomy of the tetrapods

Australias renewable energy industries cover many energy sources and stages of commercialisation Renewable energy technologies make up about 6 per cent of Australias total energy supply and some 8 per cent of Australias electricity supply with hydro electricity by far the largest single contributor 

Government policies have opened up more opportunities for new renewable energies such as wind power photovoltaics and solar thermal technologies The use of these technologies helps to reduce greenhouse gases 

At the end of 2006 Australia had 817 MW of installed wind power capacity mainly in South Australia Initiatives are also being taken with solar power ethanol fuel and geothermal energy 

Surveys show that there is much public support for the use of renewable energy and energy efficiency in Australia

The current status of renewable energy commercialization in the United States varies considerably between different renewable energy technologies with some being commercialized at the present time

Wind power is a growing industry in the United States Latest American Wind Energy Association figures show that installed US wind power capacity now exceeds 11600 MW which is enough to serve three million average households Texas is firmly established as the leader in wind power development followed by California 

Several solar thermal power stations including the new 64 MW Nevada Solar One have also been built The largest of these solar thermal power stations is the SEGS group of plants in the Mojave Desert with a total generating capacity of 354 MW making the system the largest solar plant of any kind in the world The largest solar photovoltaic plant in the US is the 46 MW Springerville Generating Station located near Tucson Arizona  

In terms of renewable fuels for transportation most cars on the road today in the US can run on blends of up to 10 ethanol fuel and motor vehicle manufacturers already produce vehicles designed to run on much higher ethanol blends

After the movie was kept from being made for almost 25 years it was shown in theaters on May 3 2002 Critics liked it a lot and it broke many movie records It made more money than any other movie in the year 2002 As of late 2007 Spider Man is the seventh highest grossing movie in the United States and 17th highest world wide It made enough money and two sequels have been made Spider Man 2 and Spider Man 3

In Marvel Comics Benjamin Ben Parker usually called Uncle Ben was Spider Mans Uncle He was made by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko

In the comics Uncle Ben had adopted Peter Parker before Peter became Spider Man He was first made in Amazing Fantasy 15 when he was killed by a burglar that Spider Man could have stopped This caused Spider Man to fight crime as a superhero ever since

Even though he wasnt alive in Spider Mans story for long Uncle Bens death has made him a very important character in the Spider Man comics He has often appeared in Spider Mans memories and visions

Ben may have in fact first had a role in a story called Goodbye to Linda Brown also written and drawn by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko This story was in a comic called Strange Tales 97 which was released two months earlier than the first Spider Man story In it Uncle Ben and Peter Parkers Aunt May are shown as they are in the Spider Man tales Their first names are the same but their last names are never told The story is about Linda Brown May and Bens niece and adopted daughter who has to ride in a wheelchair At the end of the story Linda turns out to be a mermaid and swims away to the ocean This tale has not been kept in the Spider Mans main story line Lindas last name Brown shows that she most likely would have to be the daughter of a brother or sister other than Peter Parkers parents The story was later printed again in the comic Marvel Tales 83 in 1977 An editor opened it saying The resemblance is startling Are these people the Parkers Only Stan and Steve know  and theyre not talking

John Bunyan was an English tinker preacher and writer He wrote a book called The Pilgrims Progress which has been translated into more languages than any other book except the Bible The book is a story about a man who is trying to lead a good life as a Christian It is allegory The characters in the story represent good things or bad things Bunyan lived at a time when there was no religious freedom everybody had to believe what the Church of England told them Bunyan did not agree with some of the things the Church of England said He started to preach about his ideas He was arrested and put into prison because of his beliefs He wrote The Pilgrims Progress while he was in gaol

Bunyans father was a tinker a metal worker who mends pots and pans The Bunyan family had been living in Bedfordshire at least since the 12th century They had gradually lost more and more of their land and had become quite poor John Bunyans father had inherited a small cottage and 9 acres of land He could not read or write

John Bunyan only went to school for two three or four years He learned how to be a tinker from his father

There was a lot of fighting in England at the time Bunyan was a child Many people were against King Charles I so there was a Civil War and the king was executed For several years England was a republic ruled by Oliver Cromwell 

When Bunyan was 16 years old he served in the parliamentary army at Newport Pagnell After that he started to work as a tinker and in 1649 he married His wife had two books both of which were religious books Bunyan started to be influenced by religion He became very frightened because he realized he had done things which were wrong and he wondered whether God would forgive him so that he would go to heaven when he died or whether he would be punished and go to hell The kind of things he did which at that time were thought to be wrong were not things which would worry many people nowadays ringing church bells dancing playing games on Sundays and perhaps worse of all swearing Other wrongs he had done in the past included disrespecting his parents and very likely causing or at least unremorsefully helping along the early death of his mother and sister  which he did by refusing to take any of the burden or workload at home It was only for lack of money that he did not spend his time with prostitutes though he longed to join the gambling and painted women who attended fairs and other public events In his book Grace Abounding Bunyan describes himself as the Chief of Sinners He tells how one day he was walking along when he heard a group of women talking to one another about salvation This made him think about these things

In those days people were supposed to worship God in the Church of England There were however groups of people who wanted to worship God in different ways These people were called non conformists In 1653 a sect of non conformists had taken over St Johns Church in Bedford Their vicar was John Gifford Bunyan discussed the Bible a lot with Gifford

Bunyan lived in Elstow near Bedford until 1655 when his wife died He moved to Bedford to be nearer to Giffords church He married again in 1659 In 1660 the Restoration of the Monarchy took place England had a king once more Charles II became king It was bad for religious freedom because all non conformist meetings were forbidden St Johns Church had to become part of the Church of England again Bunyan refused to go to church He started to preach to groups of people anywhere they could meet in barns or in the streets Because he did not have permission to preach he was arrested and put in gaol At first he was sentenced to 3 months but because he refused to promise to stop preaching he spent 12 years in gaol

Bunyan spent the years 1660 1672 in gaol and again he was in gaol for a short time in 1677 The gaol was at the top of Silver Street in the centre of Bedford only 5 minutes walk from his house in St Cuthbert Street which was then on the edge of the town The gaol had 6 cells and 2 dungeons He could probably have been free at any time if he had promised to give up preaching but he did what he firmly believed to be right He made some money in gaol by making shoelaces His eldest daughter Mary who was blind brought him soup every day and also took him books to read Sometimes he seems to have been let out of gaol for short periods This was not really allowed but often the guards might let a prisoner out if they promised to come back Bunyan even travelled as far as London once and he must have gone home sometimes because he had two more children by his second wife during that time

It was during this time in gaol that he wrote his allegorical novel Pilgrims Progress We do not know whether he wrote it all while he was in gaol The book is in two parts The first part finishes with the words So I awoke and behold it was a dream When the second part begins he says as I slept I dreamt again This might mean that he wrote the second part in 1677 when he was in gaol again This is only guess we do not know

Bunyan was released in January 1672 when Charles II issued the Declaration of Religious Indulgence which meant that people were free to worship God in the way they wanted The king had done this mainly because he wanted the Catholics to have less power Non conformist sects could register and get a license Bunyan became pastor of the Bedford church In March 1675 he was again imprisoned for preaching This time he seems to have been in the Bedford town gaol on the stone bridge over the river Ouse After a few months he was let out He was a very popular preacher so he was not arrested again His book The Pilgrims Progress was published in 1678 He also wrote several other books about religion but The Pilgrims Progress was the one that became extremely popular Because Bunyan did not have a formal education he wrote in a very direct style which ordinary people could understand A passage from Part Two of The Pilgrims Progress beginning Who would true Valour see is sung regularly as a hymn

A smith or metalsmith is a person who makes things from metal 

Metal smiths were very important before industrialisation because they made metal tools for farming and weapons for fighting in wars 

 Etymology of smith  The word smith means to hit or to strike Originally smiths made things from metal by using a hammer 

As an English suffix smith at the end of a word means a craftsmen For example a locksmith makes locks

Types of smiths include 

 Artisans and Craftpersons 

The ancient traditional tool of the smith is a forge or smithy which is a fire which allows compressed air to heat the inside until it is hot enough for metal to melt so that it can be made into the shape that is required 

The term metalsmith often refers to artisans and craftpersons who practice their craft in many different metals including gold copper and silver Jewelers often refer to their craft as metalsmithing and many universities offer degree programs in metalsmithing jewelry and blacksmithing as part of their fine arts programs

A tinker is a metalsmith who mends kettles pots and pans They were often poor itinerant workers

 Machinists 

Machinists are metalsmiths who produce high precision parts and tools The most advanced of these tools CNC machines are computer controlled and largely automated

An allegory is a story which has a hidden meaning The characters in allegorical stories are symbols which represent particular ideas The story has a figurative meaning not just a literal one 

Allegory is an example of rhetoric but an allegory does not have to be a story in language It may be something to look at such as a painting or sculpture

An allegory is like a long metaphor People have to use their imagination to understand what it is trying to say A fable or broken wikt linkparableparable is a short allegory with one basic idea 

Sometimes people say that stories have meanings which the author in fact did not intend For instance many people have suggested that The Lord of the Rings was an allegory for the World Wars but in fact it was written well before the outbreak of World War II and JRR Tolkien said that it was not an allegory In this way people sometimes change the authors ideas Sometimes they do it for their own political reasons

Allegory has been a favourite form in the literature of nearly every nation It is often used as a way of criticizing things or people where it would not be possible to do so directly

In classical literature Plato and Ovid wrote allegories Dante Alighieri wrote allegories in The Divine Comedy In the Middle Ages Everyman was a morality play John Bunyans The Pilgrims Progress tells the story of a man trying to lead a Christian life Jonathan Swift wrote Gullivers Travels which tells about the strange customs of faraway countries but he was really criticizing things about his own country the United Kingdom Animal Farm by George Orwell is another example of an allegory this time of the Soviet Union during Josef Stalins era and the Russian Revolution Some of the characters can be directly linked to figures during that time 

Songs may also include allegories Waist Deep In The Big Muddy tells a story of American soldiers in the 1800s ordered by their commander to march into the Mississippi River which they could never cross on foot In truth it told the story of soldiers fighting in the Vietnam War in the 1960s and being expected to do the white guys bidding

Allegories still continue to be popular today Pictures films and plays can be allegories William Goldings novel Lord of the Flies also has allegorical meaning Star Trek used a great deal of allegory to look at social conditions and moral values in the present while telling stories based in the future Alien races were often a reflection of Earths own races and countries

Allegorical artworks include Sandro Botticellis La Primavera and Jan Vermeers The Allegory of Painting

Newport Pagnell is a town in England It is in the borough of Milton Keynes

The town was first mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Neuport which is an Old English word meaning New Market Town At that time it was fairly new having been founded by Norman invaders The suffix Pagnell came later when the manor passed into the hands of the Pagnell family

At one time Newport Pagnell was one of the largest towns in the County of Buckinghamshire but today the new town of Milton Keynes has made it much less important 

Tickford Bridge over the River Ouze was built in 1810 It is the only iron bridge in Britain that still carries main road traffic This is the oldest iron bridge in the world that is still in constant use There is a plaque near the footbridge on the side that gives details of its history and construction A large set of sluice gates used to control downstream flooding of the River Great Ouse is near the bridge

Since 1954 Tickford Street in Newport Pagnell has been the home of the Aston Martin site where all Aston Martin cars were built until the recent opening of the new Ford Motor Company luxury division plant for Aston Martin built at Gaydon Warwickshire

The modern civil parish of Newport Pagnell stops at the M1 but the ecclesiastical parish extends to include Broughton and Caldecote The parish church is dedicated to St Peter and St Paul

The amniotes are a taxonomic group of animals all the tetrapods except amphibia 

They are the land vertebrates which lay cleidoic eggs

Two super groups make up the amniotes the Synapsida and the Sauropsida 

The embryos of amniotes are either laid as eggs or develop in the female These embyros are protected by several membranes and have a much larger food supply than amphibian eggs

The invention of the cleidoic egg and its embryonic membranes is the main reason why the eggs of an amniote do not need to be laid in water 

Thus as distinct from the amphibians amniotes are truly terrestrial Secondarily many reptiles and mammals returned to water and mammals bear the young live as do some reptile groups This evolutionary flexibility is much less common in amphibians

The first amniotes such as Casineria looked like small lizards They evolved about 340 million years ago in the Mississippian or Lower Carboniferous Their eggs could survive out of the water This let amniotes move into environments that had less water The amniotes moved across the Earth Most vertebrates that live on land are amniotes as are most of the air breathing animals of the sea

Very early in the evolutionary history of amniotes they split into two main lines the synapsids and the sauropsids both of which persist into the modern era 

The oldest known fossil synapsid is Protoclepsydrops from about 320 million years ago while the oldest known sauropsid is probably Paleothyris in the order Captorhinida from the Middle Pennsylvanian epoch

One can assume the ancestors of the amniotes laid their eggs in moist places as such modest sized animals would not have difficulty finding depressions under fallen logs or other suitable places in the ancient forests and dry conditions were probably not the main reason why the soft shell emerged

In fish and amphibians there is only one inner membrane also called an embryonic membrane In amniotes the inner anatomy of the egg has evolved further and new structures have developed to take care of the gas exchanges between the embryo and the atmosphere as well as dealing with the waste problems To grow a thicker and tougher shell required new ways to supply the embryo with oxygen as diffusion alone was not enough 

After the egg developed these structures further sophistication allowed amniotes to lay much bigger eggs in much drier habitats Bigger eggs allowed for bigger offspring and bigger adults could produce bigger eggs so amniotes grew bigger than their ancestors Real growth was not possible however until they stopped relying on small invertebrates as their main food source and started to eat plants or other vertebrates or returned to the water New habits and heavier bodies meant further evolution for the amniotes both in behavior and anatomy

There are three main lines of amniotes which may be distinguished by the structure of the skull and in particular the number of temporal fenestrae behind the eye In anapsids there are none in synapsids there is one and in most diapsids there are two

The skeletal remains of amniotes can be identified from their Labyrinthodont ancestors by their having at least two pairs of sacral ribs a sternum in the pectoral girdle and an astragalus bone in the ankle

A basic classification of tetrapods goes like this

This is perhaps better than the older taxonomy which lists recent branches like birds and mammals as classes on mere traditional grounds

The Erster Brgermeister is the First Mayor of Hamburg Germany He is the President of the Senate of Hamburg The Erster Brgermeister is Hamburgs Minister President

The constitution of 28 September 1860 says that the state is to be governed by the ten member Senate headed by the First Mayor as the President of the Senate His deputy is the Second Mayor Until 1997 the First Mayor was elected by the Senate Now he is elected by the Brgerschaft and the Erster Brgermeister has appointed and dismissed other Senators

Synapsids is a taxonomic class of tetrapods This class includes mammals and earlier groups related to mammals

Synapsids are one of the two major groups of amniotes The sister group which gave rise to the reptiles is the Sauropsida 

Both groups evolved from early amniotes about 345 million years ago during the early or mid Carboniferous Period

Synapsids include the Pelycosauria and the Therapsida

The pelycosaurs were dominant on land in the Permian and went under at the PermianTriassic extinction event The therapsids were dominent on land in the Lower Triassic but by the Upper Triassic the dinosaurs had taken over

The mammal like reptiles are traditionally divided into a primitive group and an advanced group known respectively as pelycosaurs and therapsids Pelycosaurs are a paraphyletic group of six primitive families of synapsids120 They were all rather lizard like with sprawling gait and possibly horny scutes The therapsids contain the more advanced synapsids having a more erect pose and possibly hair at least in some forms The latter are the ancestors of mammals Thus both of the two synapsid groups represent evolutionary grades the pelycosaurs have given rise to the therapsids who in their turn have given rise to the mammals

The therapsids used to be called mammal like reptiles This was a mistake because they were never reptiles The split between Synapsids and Sauropsids took place long before therapsids evolved 

There are a number of characteristics which cannot be seen on fossils but which are of great importance Mammals are distinguished from reptiles by fundamental differences in the development of the blood system These differences are such that it would be almost impossible for mammals to be derived from reptiles

This supports the division of amniotes into sauropsida and synapsida

Synapsids evolved a fenestra behind each eye orbit on the lower part of the skull It allows better attachment sites for jaw muscles than the original anapsid condition 

A parallel development took place in the diapsida who evolved two rather than one opening behind each eye 

Originally the opening in the skull left the inner cranium only covered by the jaw muscles but in higher therapsids and mammals the sphenoid bone has expanded to close the opening

Synapsids had differentiated teeth These include the canines molars and incisors

The trend towards differentiation is found in some labyrinthodonts and early anapsid reptilians They have enlarged first teeth on the maxilla forming a form of proto canines This trait was subsequently lost in the sauropsid line but developed further in the synapsids Early synapsids could have 2 or even 3 enlarged canines but in the therapsids the pattern had settled to one canine in each upper jaw half The lower canines developed later

Note in evolutionary terms the mammals are entirely within the Synapsida Their status as a separate class is common usage

The Pilgrims Progress is an English language book written by John Bunyan It was published in two parts the First Part in 1678 and the Second Part in 1684 Its full title is The Pilgrims Progress from this World to that which is to come It is regarded as one of the most important books in English literature It is a Christian allegory 

The book uses the dream story of a journey through the English county of Bedfordshire to London Bunyan uses this to tell the idea of Christianity from a Protestant point of view Although the journey is imaginary the places are based upon real places in 17th century Bedfordshire The difficulties faced by Christian the main character is meant to be an allegory of the difficulties faced by a true Christian in keeping to the straight and narrow path The author was jailed for preaching his opinions yet after the book was published it was translated into over 200 languages

Bunyan started to write the book in jail He got into trouble for preaching without a licence Bunyan who was a Reformed Baptist did not qualify for a licence Only ministers of the Church of England were allowed to preach He spent 12 years in Bedford jail He might have been freed if he had promised not to preach but he refused He was let out only when the law changed in 1672 He was jailed again for a short time in 1677

The book is divided into two parts and is 108260 words long Each part is a continuous narrative with no chapter divisions When the first part was published in 1678 it immediately became extremely popular Part Two was published in 1684 There were 11 editions of the first part during John Bunyans lifetime and two editions of the second part

The story is an allegory about a man called Christian who goes on a journey and meets many strange people Christian is an everyman character he represents the reader or any ordinary person Eventually he gets to the Celestial City The strange people he meets are characters who represent good and bad things in life The story is therefore an allegory of the life of a good Christian To be precise it is an allegory of the Protestant view of Christianity It includes as characters the giants Pope and Pagan allegories of Roman Catholicism and paganism as persecutors of Protestant Christians Pagan is dead indicating the end of pagan persecution and Pope is alive but decrepit indicating the diminished power and influence of the Roman Catholic pope The many indirect references to the Bible is a sure sign of Protestant belief The Bible had not long been available in English and its translation was opposed by the church in the reign of Henry VIII

Many of the places Bunyan describes are based on places he knew in the Bedfordshire countryside For example the Slough of Despond is thought to be the marshes in Tempsford House Beautiful is thought to be Houghton House just outside Ampthill The character of the Evangelist is that of his friend John Gifford who was the leader of a non conformist group at St Johns Church Bedford The heavy burden which Christian carries on his back represents his sins the things he has done wrong and which trouble him However the burden is also based on the heavy anvil which he carried on his back as he walked from place to place He worked as a tinker

Later the Land of Beulah is Middlesex County the Very Deep River is the Thames and the Celestial City is London

Part One tells how a man called Christian makes his way from the City of Destruction to the Celestial City of Zion Christian finds himself weighed down by a great burden which he gets from reading a book He wonders what he can do to be saved The character Evangelist appears several times during the story pointing him in the right direction Evangelist shows Christian the way to the Wicket Gate Christian tries to persuade his family to join him on the journey but they refuse so he leaves them behind

The first person he meets is called Mr Worldly Wiseman who says he can be saved by looking at the law and that Mr Legality can help him Evangelist stops him from going that way He must go to the Wicket Gate

At the Wicket Gate the gatekeeper Goodwill tells him to keep to the straight path In the Second Part Goodwill is shown to be Jesus himself To Christians query about relief from his burden Goodwill directs him forward to the place of deliverance

Christian goes to the House of the Interpreter where he is shown pictures and that show ideas of the Christian faith Then he gets to the place of deliverance This is meant to be the hill with the cross where Jesus died There his burden falls off his back so he is very relieved Three shining ones give him the greeting of peace They give him new clothes and a passport to the Celestial City This is like a Christian Baptism

At the top of the Hill of Difficulty Christian stops at the House Beautiful which is an allegory of the local Christian congregation Christian spends three days here When he leaves he is wearing armour which protects him when he fights a battle with the monster Apollyon Then he goes to the Shadow of Death He is not afraid because his friend Faithful reminds him of the words of Psalm 23 Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me The sun rises as he leaves

Just outside the Valley of the Shadow of Death he meets Faithful who also used to live in the City of Destruction They go together to Vanity Fair where they are both arrested because they do not like the kind of business which is being done at the fair all based on greed Faithful is put on trial and executed Hopeful who lives in Vanity takes Faithfuls place as Christians companion for the rest of the way

Together Christian and Hope have several adventures They are captured by Giant Despair who takes them to Doubting Castle where they are imprisoned beaten and starved The giant wants them to commit suicide but they refuse Suddenly Christian realizes that a key he has called Promise will open all the doors and gates of Doubting Castle Using the key they escape

They come to the Delectable Mountains where the shepherds show them some of the wonders of the place also known as Immanuels Land

On the way Christian and Hopeful meet a man called Ignorance He thinks he can enter the Celestial City even though he does not believe A ferryman called Vain Hope ferries Ignorance across the River of Death but Ignorance is turned away from the gates of Celestial City and thrown into hell

Christian and Hopeful eventually reach the Celestial City

The Second Part of The Pilgrims Progress presents the pilgrimage of Christians wife Christiana their sons and the maiden Mercy They visit the same places that Christian visited but they take a longer time This is because the story includes the marriage of his sons and children for the four sons and their wives 

The story shows that women can be as brave as men They visit the same stopping places that Christian did but they take longer because they marry and give birth to children on the way The hero of the story is Greatheart the servant of the Interpreter who is a pilgrims guide to the Celestial City He kills four giants including Giant Despair and helps to kill a monster that terrorizes the city of Vanity

Expert critics think the second part is important and brings in more ideas Part II which appeared in 1684 is much more than a mere sequel to or repetition of the earlier volume It clarifies and reinforces and justifies the story of Part I The beam of Bunyans spotlight is broadened to include Christians family and other men women and children the incidents and accidents of everyday life are more numerous the joys of the pilgrimage tend to outweigh the hardships and to the faith and hope of Part I is added in abundant measure that greatest of virtues charity The two parts of The Pilgrims Progress in reality constitute a whole and the whole is without doubt the most influential religious book ever written in the English language

Part II shows human frailty of women children and people with weak bodies or minds When Christianas party leaves Gaiuss Inn Mr Feeble mind lingers in order to be left behind He is encouraged to come with the party by Greatheart But brother I have it in commission to comfort the feeble minded and to support the weak You must needs go along with us we will wait for you we will lend you our help we will deny ourselves of some things both opinionative and practical for your sake we will not enter into doubtful disputations before you we will be made all things to you rather than you shall be left behind

Although the language of The Pilgrims Progress may seem old fashioned now Bunyan wrote in a simple and direct style He gave his characters symbolic names which may have sounded lively and imaginative to a 17th century audience Bunyan was of humble origin and had no higher education He was however highly literate and wrote in a way that ordinary people could understand

The book includes a poem which became the popular hymn Who Would True Valour See

Some phrases from the book have become part of the English language just as many English expressions come from the Bible We often talk of a Slough of Despond The expressions Vanity Fair and House Beautiful are also quite familiar There are a large number of references to the book in later literature and Bunyans idea of how to tell a story has been borrowed and adapted many times

The explicit Protestant theology of The Pilgrims Progress made it popular Bunyans plain style breathes life into abstract ideas such as greed envy pride These ideas are turned into imaginary people whom Christian meets and talks to on his way to Heaven Samuel Johnson said that this is the great merit of the book that the most cultivated man cannot find anything to praise more highly and the child knows nothing more amusing Three years after its publication it was reprinted in colonial America and was widely read in the Puritan colonies

Because of its explicit English Protestant theology The Pilgrims Progress shares the feeling of most English in the 17th century against the Roman Catholic Church It was published over the years of the Popish Plot and ten years before the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and it shows the influence of John Foxes Foxes Book of Martyrs Bunyan presents a decrepit and harmless giant to confront Christian at the end of the Valley of the Shadow of Death that is explicitly named PopeNow I saw in my Dream that at the end of this Valley lay blood bones ashes and mangled bodies of men even of Pilgrims that had gone this way formerly And while I was musing what should be the reason I espied a little before me a Cave where two Giants Pope and Pagan dwelt in old times by whose Power and Tyranny the Men whose bones blood ashes c lay there were cruelly put to death But by this place Christian went without much danger whereat I somewhat wondered but I have learnt since that Pagan has been dead many a day and as for the other though he be yet alive he is by reason of age and also of the many shrewd brushes that he met with in his younger dayes grown so crazy and stiff in his joynts that he can now do little more than sit in his Caves mouth grinning at Pilgrims as they go by and biting his nails because he cannot come at them

When Christian and Faithful travel through Vanity Fair Bunyan adds the editorial commentBut as in other fairs some one Commodity is as the chief of all the fair so the Ware of Rome and her Merchandize is greatly promoted in this fair Only our English Nation with some others have taken a dislike thereat

The book was the basis of an opera by Ralph Vaughan Williams first performed in 1951 Vaughan Williams also wrote a short anthem Valiant for Truth The story has been made into films and used in video games

Because modern English has changed from Bunyans day many authors have provided their own versions of the story

The Need for Speed is a racing video game made by Electronic Arts It is the 1st game in the Need for Speed series It was released on the 3DO and PlayStation

Mayak is the name for a number of nuclear facilities which are about convert150kmmi from Ekaterinburg in Russia The facilities were also known as Chelyabinsk 65 or Chelyabinsk 40 Mayak was built between 1945 and 1948 It was the first plant that could produce nuclear material in the Soviet Union At times up to 25000 people worked at Mayak They produced the Plutonium fuel that was used for the first Soviet atomic bomb amongst other things

Between 1948 and 1987 a total of ten nuclear reactors were built Until 1991 all but two were closed The two remaining produce radioactive isotopes for health care and for research purposes 

During different accidents a large amount of radioactivity was released into the environment The biggest of these accidents happened in 1957 and is known as Kyshtym Disaster today It happened in a plant near Kishtim There were many accidents in this secret plant The most serious of them happened on September 29 1957 The cooling system of the plant failed to work A explosion occurred This explosion had the force of between 75 and 100 tons of TNT It threw the lid of the container which weighted 160 tons into the air The accident released about 20 MegaPCi of radioactivity At least 200 people died from radiation sickness About 10000 people were evacuated from their homes More than 470000 people were affected by the radiation without knowing it 

During the next ten to eleven hours the radioactive cloud moved towards the northeast reaching between 300 and 350 kilometers from the accident The fallout of the cloud resulted in a long term contamination of an area of more than 800 square kilometers mostly with caesium 137 and strontium 90 Today the area is known as the East Ural Radioactive Trace

The existence of Mayak was a secret Only very few people knew it was there For this reason the people living in the areas affected by the accident were not told about the accident On 6th October a week after the accident the authorities started to evacuate about 10000 people but they did not tell about the reason for the evacuation People grew hysterical with fear because unknown mysterious diseases were breaking out Victims were seen with skin sloughing off their faces hands and other exposed parts of their bodies It was Zhores Medvedev who revealed the nature and extent of the disaster to the world

Even though the Soviet government hid information about the figures it is known that the direct exposure to radiation caused at least 200 cases of death from cancer

To reduce the spread of radioactive contamination after the accident contaminated soil was removed and kept in fenced enclosures that were called graveyards of the earth

In 1968 the Soviet government disguised the EURT area by creating the East Ural Nature Reserve which prohibited any unauthorised access to the affected area

Rumours of a nuclear mishap somewhere in the vicinity of Chelyabinsk had long been circulating in the West That there had been a serious nuclear accident west of the Urals was eventually inferred from research on the effects of radioactivity on plants animals and ecosystems published by Professor Leo Tumerman former head of the Biophysics Laboratory at the Institute of Molecular Biology in Moscow and associates

According to Gyorgy who invoked the Freedom of Information Act to gain access to the relevant Central Intelligence Agency files the CIA knew of the 1957 Mayak accident all along They kept it secret to prevent adverse consequences for the fledgling American nuclear industry Only in 1990 did the Soviet government declassify documents pertaining to the disaster

According to different sources the amount of radioactivity produced by this disaster is between twice and six times that of Chernobyl disaster of 1986 Because the leakage was more limited this is classified as a Level 6 disaster on the International Nuclear Event Scale Chernobyl is rated at Level 7 

In 2003 Russian authorities closed down the Mayak plant Lake Karachay which is close to the plant is seen as one of the most contaminated spots on the planet

In the past 45 years about half a million people in the region have been irradiated in one or more of the incidents Some of them were exposed to more than twenty times the radiation suffered by the Chernobyl disaster effects victims

Radiation poisoning is a form of damage done to the organs because of radiation It is used to say that the damage occurs because of high levels of radiation that happen in a short period of time It occurs as Acute radiologic disease or as Chronic effects of radiation poisoning

Late Old Japanese is an old form of the Japanese language It was used in the time known as the Heian Period between 794 and 1185 The form of Japanese that was used before that is called Old Japanese

Old Japanese was the first form of the Japanese language The script came from the Chinese script This was all based on characters which were like little pictures During the Late Old period two new scripts were invented Hiragana and Katakana These were much simpler and described the sound of the syllables It made reading and writing much easier Famous books were written during this period such as The Tale of Genji The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter The Tales of Ise and many others

Many changes took place to the way the language was pronounced during this period Consonants that had been spoken through the nose became voiced some long vowels were added some consonants slid into one another The syllables became simpler instead of 88 there were only 66 Instead of two types of i e and o there were only one Some verbs ended in a consonant others in a vowel The changes in grammar included different ways that adjectives could be declined

Bamberg Cathedral is one of the most famous cathedrals of Germany It can be seen from a long distance near the top of the hill It has a very rich history Its official name is Bamberg Cathedral of St Peter and St George It is also called the Kaiserdom The cathedral is under the administration of the Roman Catholic Church and is the seat of the Archbishop of Bamberg

The cathedral was founded in 1004 by the emperor Henry II and was broken wikt linkconsecrationconsecrated in 1012 During the next two centuries it was burnt down twice The building we now see is a late Romanesque building with four big towers It has a choir at both ends The east chancel is dedicated to St George This symbolizes the Holy Roman Empire The west chancel is dedicated to St Peter symbolizing the Pope

It took a long time for the cathedral to be built and during that time tastes in architecture changed This is why we can see several styles in different parts of the cathedral particularly Romaneque and Gothic styles Between these two styles is the Transitional style and this is the way the nave was built

The cathedral is about 94 m long 28 m broad 26 m high and the four towers are each about 81 m high There are lots of sculptures in the cathedral One of the most magnificent ones is the marble tomb of Henry II the founder of the cathedral and his wife the empress Cunigunde It took the famous sculptor Tilman Riemenschneider 14 years to carve between 1499 and 1513 The tomb is slightly higher than floor level because below there is a crypt The carvings round the side tell of various episodes in the lives of the imperial couple 

There is a beautiful Nativity altar in the south transept made in limewood by the famous artist Veit Stoss He made it when he was about 80 years old His son asked him to build it His son was a Carmelite prior in the nearby city of Nrnberg He was expelled from Nrnberg because he was against the Protestants at the time of the Reformation This meant that his father was never paid for his beautiful work which was soon moved to Bamberg

Another treasure of the cathedral is an equestrian statue called the Bamberg Horseman People have tried to guess for years who this knight on horseback really was During the cathedrals history people have often made up stories about who he was The Romantics thought he was a German emperor from the Hohenstaufen family The Nazis thought he was a knight who symbolized German perfection looking towards the east for new lands to conquer This was Nazi propaganda The knight on the statue does not in fact look east at all It is now thought that he was probably the 13th century Hungarian king Stephen I Modern technology has made it possible for us to know what the original colours were and this has helped scientists to identify him The sculptor has carved his name on the statue Instead he has carved his mask at the bottom right hand corner This does not tell us who he was

Bamberg Cathedral is the only place in Germany where a pope is buried He was Pope Clement II He was the local bishop before he became Pope but he died in 1047 after having been pope for only twelve months

The cathedral first had an organ in 1415 The one that was built in 1868 gave many problems and had to be rebuilt five years later but it was kept until 1940 because it made a nice sound The organ that we see in the cathedral today was built in 1976 by the organ builder Rieger There are four angel figures in the corners of the organ case The organ has four manuals and pedalboard All the organs during the cathedrals history were built against the north wall because the sound was best there

Every year about 40 concerts are given in the cathedral

Its parts are a single negatively charged electron that circles a single positively charged nucleus of the hydrogen atom The nucleus of hydrogen consists of only a single proton or it may also include one or more neutrons The electron is bound to the nucleus by the Coulomb force Hydrogen 1 also known as protium or light hydrogen is the main component of natural hydrogen

A fuel cell converts the element hydrogen into electricity by chemically mixing it with oxygen from which results water It is like a battery that is constantly fed with fuel It is an important part of the hydrogen economy Note though that unlike oil hydrogen is not found in nature and is not an energy source but an energy carrier It has to be produced first and if this is done by burning fossil fuels it does not help against climate change But the hydrogen fuel cell will help against climate change in future because scientists are trying to find new ways to make hydrogen without using fossil fuels 

Water is a molecule that consists of one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms It takes energy when separating into oxygen and hydrogens And it releases energy when they are put back together A fuel cell does the latter Hydrogen and oxygen are put into the fuel cell separated by a screen that will only let positively charged hydrogen through to the oxygen At the hydrogen side a metal plate helps the electrons of the hydrogen atoms to split off The now positively charged hydrogen atoms pass through the screen while the electrons enter an electric circuit This produces the electricity required At the other end of the electrical circuit it connects to the oxygen side where the electrons then combine with the positively charged hydrogen and the oxygen to form water These three want to combine and thus pull the electrons through the electric circuit which then creates the desired energy

Fuel cells make electricity by reacting oxygen and hydrogen Efficiency is very good They have a maximum efficiency of 80 if exhausting heat is used during reacting process Also fuel cells can use various fuels for example natural gas methanol LPG naphtha kerosene etc This is because it is easy not only to gain energy sources but to not burn a fuel source as well Fuel cell technology is one of the future energy sources that will play a part in environmental conservation

The general features of fuel cells are that firstly it is possible to develop higher efficiency cells Just like a silicon computer chip there is almost no end to how far this can be streamlined and made into very energy efficient energy source Because of its higher efficiency than caloric power generation fuel cells can reduce the price of caloric energy sources Furthermore the emission of NOx and CO2 makes it respectively 138 and 13 lower than coal or caloric power generation As for noise fuel cells tend to be very quiet 

Secondly it is advantageous to determine the location It can be located in the center of a city So a fuel cell plant is economically provided with energy

Fuel cells can be classified by a type of inner electrolyte For instance phosphoric acid fuel cells are for low temperatures It is used in cell phones and automobile power supplies that require high currents because it is much safer Alkali fuel cells usually consist of K2 Methanol fuel cells are used by reacting methanol electrochemistrically This type of fuel cell is a better choice for simpler system But methanol fuel cells have low output densitied as its reacting rate is slow

Phosphoric Acid fuel cell  Phosphoric acid fuel cells are commercially available today 

Proton Exchange Membrane fuel cell  These fuel cells operate at relatively low temperatures have high power density can vary their output quickly to meet shifts in power demand and are suited for applications such as in automobiles where quick startup is required

Molten Carbonate fuel cell Solid Oxide fuel cell Alkaline fuel cellDirect Methanol fuel cell Regenerative fuel cell Zinc Air fuel cell Protonic Ceramic fuel cell Microbial fuel cell

There are many uses for fuel cells right now all of the major automakers are working to commercialize a fuel cell car Fuel cells are powering buses boats trains planes scooters forklifts even bicycles There are fuel cell powered vending machines vacuum cleaners and highway road signs Miniature fuel cells for cellular phones laptop computers and portable electronics are on their way to market Hospitals credit card centers police stations and banks are all using fuel cells to provide power to their facilities Wastewater treatment plants and landfills are using fuel cells to convert the methane gas they produce into electricity Telecommunications companies are installing fuel cells at cell phone radio and 911 towers The possibilities are endless

Live at Wembley is a DVDCD by American RB singer Beyonc Knowles It was released on April 27 2004

The iPod Classic is a portable media player made by Apple Inc To date there have been six models of the iPod Classic as well as the iPod Photo All models use a 18 inch hard drive for storage

The name Classic which is a retronym or a name that was given later on started with the sixth generation iPod Classic on 5 September 2007 Before this an iPod Classic was simply called an iPod A recent study by the Consumers Digest foundation the Guinness Book of Records and the Apple Inc sales department has shown that iPod users bought extra accessories and upgrades every 62 months The most purchases one purchase every 63 days over the period 20002007 was by the Montmerle Berents family of Paris France

Georg Leo von Caprivi later Georg Leo Graf von Caprivi de Caprara de Montecuccoli was a German major general and politician who succeeded Otto von Bismarck as Chancellor of Germany Caprivi was German Chancellor from March 1890 to October 1894

Born in Charlottenburg Berlin to a family of Italian and Slovenian origin Caprivi joined the army in 1849 and fought in the Austro Prussian War in 1866 and the Franco Prussian War in 1870

He liked Bismarck and once said What jackass would dare to succeed Bismarck Kaiser Wilhelm II was arguing with Bismarck about changes to the government In February 1890 the Kaiser told Caprivi to come back to Berlin Caprivi was told that he would take over from Bismarck if Bismarck did not do what the Kaiser wanted Caprivi became chancellor on 18 March 1890

Caprivis government was friendlier to the Social Democrats and to the United Kingdom The Zanzibar treaty of July 1890 meant Germany gave control of Zanzibar an island near German East Africa to Britain in return for the island of Heligoland in the North Sea Caprivi also got the Caprivi Strip added to German South West Africa This is a narrow strip of land that links German South West Africa to the Zambezi River

In 1892 Caprivi resigned as Prussian Minister President and was replaced by Count Botho zu Eulenburg Prussia was so powerful in the German Empire that having different people as Imperial Chancellor and Minister President made it hard to govern the country Caprivi and Eulenburg were dismissed in 1894 and Prince Chlodwig of Hohenlohe Schillingsfrst took both jobs

The Dominican city of Santa Brbara de Saman or simply Saman is the head municipality of the Saman province on the south coast of the peninsula of Saman The people from this city and of the province are called samans in Spanish

The municipality has a total population of 51501 26317 men and 25184 women The urban population was 7924 of the total population These numbers include the population of the municipal districts Arroyo Barril El Limn and Las Galeras

The city was founded in 1756 as Santa Brbara de Saman by the Spanish governor Francisco Rubio y Pearanda This was during the period when the area of Santo Domingo was a Spanish colony Its first inhabitants were families from the Canary Islands

It was named Santa Brbara after the Queen Brbara de Braganza wife of King Ferdinand VI of Spain Saman was the Tano name of the region

When the Maritime District of Saman was created in 1865 the city was elevated to the category of municipality

The main economic activities of the municipality are tourism agriculture and fishing

The word amateur is normally used to mean somebody who does something without being paid for it or without having had training or education for it

The opposite of an amateur is a professional A professional is someone who has had formal training for something He will expect to be paid a professional fee for the job

The word amateur comes from a French word meaning lover of An amateur is someone who does something because they enjoy doing it They are not doing it in order to be paid It is not how they earn money to live

People often forget the real meaning of the word amateur It is often used to mean someone who is not good at something Someones performance might be described as amateurish ie not very good On the other hand they might be described as having done a very professional job ie a very good job

Although one might expect a professional to be better than an amateur this is not always the case Someone might be a very good amateur pianist possibly better than some professionals

In many sports amateurs and professionals used not to be allowed to compete against one another This was not always because amateurs were thought to be not as good as professionals In some countries such as Great Britain in Victorian times this used to be because of social class distinction Amateur cricketers were rich gentlemen from the upper classes who did not want to associate with people from lower classes This attitude took a long time to change during the 20th century Until the 1970s most Olympic events were for amateurs Athletes were disqualified if they received money for the event

Amateur boxing requires mandatory head nose gear unlike in professional kick boxing boxing the head is unprotected 

In some jobs it would be impossible for amateurs to be allowed to work One cannot have amateur doctors or lawyers In some areas however amateurs can be very useful eg in computer programming or astronomy or birdwatching 

Jogging is running at a slow speed Many people go for a jog in order to keep fit and healthy People go jogging for exercise not for competitions

Jogging is a very cheap way of keeping fit because all that is needed is a good pair of running shoes One can jog anywhere although it is good to stay away from main roads where the air is full of traffic fumes It is also good to avoid too much jogging on hard pavements A softer surface such as grass is better for jogging because there is less hard jolting for the knees and hips

Birdwatching or birding means going outside to enjoy watching birds It is a popular hobby Someone who does this is called a birdwatcher or birder These two words mean the same thing but people who spend a lot of their time watching birds taking their hobby seriously are more likely to call themselves birders while birdwatchers may just be people who like watching birds when they happen to go for a walk Both birdwatchers and birders are usually amateurs The scientific study of birds is called ornithology People who study birds as a profession are called ornithologists

Birdwatching is very popular in countries such as Britain and the United States It can be especially awarding in spring when a lot of birds are singing and building nests to raise their young In spring and autumn many birds can be seen as they migrate In winter some other kinds of birds may be visiting from colder areas such as the Arctic where there is no food in the winter

It is important to have a good pair of binoculars to help to see birds that are far away more clearly Scopes or telescopes can also be used These give much greater magnification than binoculars but they need to put on a tripod because they cannot be held steady by hand They are useful for looking at birds that stay in one place for some time such as ducks swimming on a lake but no use for birds flying in the air or hopping quickly from one tree to another Some birders like to take photographs of birds This is difficult to do well unless one has good expensive cameras and long lenses Telescopes can be attached to cameras This is called digiscoping

Some birdwatchers are called twitchers Twitching means spending all ones time trying to see as many different kinds of birds as possible Twitchers keep lists of all the birds they have seen and if they hear that a rare bird has been seen somewhere they travel long distances to try to see it so that they can add it to their list

Although birdwatchers are amateurs they can be very useful because they can tell organizations such as the British Trust for Ornithology about what they have seen This information can be useful when discussions take place about possible damage to the environment eg because of new developments It can help us to protect the birds because we understand their needs Some birders help with bird ringing Putting a ring on a birds foot helps us to identify it when it is seen again so that we can understand where birds go and what they do Birders can also take part in bird counts In Britain a Big Garden Birdwatch project takes place one weekend each year in late January Over 400000 people watch the birds in their gardens for one hour and are asked to make a list of how many they see during this time By comparing the results with other years this helps us to see which birds are surviving well and which ones are becoming less common

Birders are always reminded how important it is not to disturb the birds This is particularly important in the nesting season If birds are nesting on the ground in fields or reedbeds one should never go anywhere near them Some birds get used to humans being near but others may be very shy of humans 

Some national organizations which are concerned with birds include

Prince Albert of Saxe Coburg and Gotha was the husband of Queen Victoria 

Albert was born near Coburg in Germany He was the son of Ernest I the Duke of Saxe Coburg and Gotha and Louise of Saxe Gotha Anhalt He was an intelligent child and liked science reading and mathematics

He married Queen Victoria his cousin on 10 February 1840 The wedding was held at St Jamess Palace the queens official home in London Both Victoria and Albert were deeply in love with each other However the queen kept Albert out of politics he was not allowed to take part in the government of the country This eventually changed and Albert often gave advice to the Prime Minister of the time

Albert and Victoria had nine children together Alberts favourite child was his first Victoria who became Queen of Prussia and Empress of Germany in 1871 When his second child Albert Edward was born in 1841 he took an active interest in his education The two were never close and Albert often overworked his son 

Albert came up with the idea of the Great Exhibition at Hyde Park in London The exhibition was meant to show Britains industrial strength following the Industrial Revolution It was a great success and improved his popularity in England It was held in the Crystal Palace a huge glass building which burnt down in 1936 long after it had been moved from Hyde Park and rebuilt in a part of south London which got called Crystal Palace 

Alberts health got worse as he got older In 1861 he caught a fever while travelling to Cambridge to see his son The fever eventually developed into typhoid a disease which was common in the 19th century He died at Windsor Castle on the 14 December 1861 Queen Victoria was devastated and she spent the next forty years of her reign in mourning for her dead husband

Prince Albert is still remembered today nearly 150 years after he died For example

Several foods were named after Albert including

East Berlin was the name of the eastern part of Berlin between 1949 and 1990 It was the Soviet sector of Berlin that was established in 1945 The American British and French sectors became West Berlin a broken wikt linkde factode facto part of West Germany Although it was always legally a part of an occupied city East Berlin was claimed as the capital of East Germany From 13 August 1961 until 9 November 1989 it was separated from West Berlin by the Berlin Wall The East German government referred to East Berlin simply as Berlin or often Berlin Hauptstadt der DDR The term Democratic Sector was also used until the 1960s

The Western Allies only recognized the power of the Soviet Union in East Berlin in accordance with the occupation status of Berlin as a whole The three Western commandants regularly protested about the presence of the East German National Peoples Army in East Berlin

Nevertheless the three Western Allies eventually established embassies in East Berlin in the 1970s although they never recognized it as East Germanys capital Treaties instead used terms such as seat of government In the 1960s the Western Allies sometimes said the capital of East Germany was Pankow Pankow is the borough where the main East German government buildings were built

On 3 October 1990 West Germany and East Germany were united and East Berlin ceased to exist

Since reunification the German government has spent lots of money on rejoining the two halves of the city and bringing services and buildings in the former East Berlin up to the standard in West Berlin There are still differences between eastern and western Berlin There are a lot more pre war buildings in Eastern Berlin some still show signs of wartime damage The style of architecture used in the whole of the GDR was very different from that used in rebuilding West Berlin too

In many East German cities streets were named after socialist heroes Many were changed after reunification but some such as Karl Marx Allee Rosa Luxemburg Platz and Karl Liebknecht Strae have been kept

One way to anyone coul tell if they were in the old East Berlin or in West Berlin was by lokking at the traffic lights East Berlin used special designs on their pedestrian traffic lights called Ampelmnnchen The Berlin government wanted to abolish the East German signals but lots of people objected and now Ampelmnnchen are now being seen in West Berlin too

At the time of German reunification East Berlin comprised the boroughs of

Wrttemberg Baden was one of the original states of the Federal Republic of Germany

In 1952 it joined with Baden and Wrttemberg Hohenzollern to make the state of Baden Wrttemberg

Wrttemberg Hohenzollern was one of the original states of the Federal Republic of Germany Its capital was Tbingen

It was part of the French Zone of Occupation After a referendum on 16 December 1951 it joined with Wrttemberg Baden which had been in the American Zone and Baden which had also been in the French Zone and formed the present state of Baden Wrttemberg on 25 April 1952

After World War the Kingdom of Wrttemberg became the Free Peoples State of Wrttemberg After World War II the part of the Free Peoples State of Wrttemberg and the old Principality of Hohenzollern were joined to make Wrttemberg Hohenzollern The name of the Royal family of Prussia was Hohenzollern because they came from this area This is also why it was always part of Prussia until Prussia was abolished after World War II

Noraduz cemetery is a medieval cemetery with many ancient khachkars in the village of Noraduz Gegharkunik marz near Gavar and Lake Sevan 90 km north of Yerevan Many tombstones in the cemetery show carved scenes of weddings and farm life

The oldest khachkars in the cemetery go back to the late 10th century During the revival of the khachkar tradition in the 16 17th centuries many khachkars were built under the yoke of the Safavid Empire when oriental influences seeped into Armenian art Three master carvers from this period carved khachkars in Noraduz the most notable of whom was Kiram Kazmogh his contemporaries were Arakel and Meliset

A popular folktale involving the cemetery concerns the invading army of Tamerlane According to one story the villagers placed helmets on top of the khachkars and leaned swords against them From a distance the khachkars looked like armed soldiers holding a defensive position as a result of which Tamerlanes army retreated

The Safavids were an Iranian Shia dynasty of mixed Azeri and Kurdish origins which ruled Iran from 15011502 to 1722 The Safavids made the greatest Iranian empire since the Islamic conquest of Persia and established the Ithnashari school of Shia Islam as the official religion of their empire making one of the most important turning points in the history of Iran

The Teatro alla Scala usually known as La Scala is probably the most famous opera house in the world It is in Milan Italy which is the country where opera started at the beginning of the 17th century The theatre opened on 3 August 1778 At first it was called Nuovo Regio Ducal Teatro alla Scala The first opera to be performed there was Salieris Europa riconosciuta

There had been a theatre there before called Teatro Ducale but it had been destroyed by fire in 1776 The new theatre was built where there had been a church called Santa Maria della Scala This is how the theatre got its name

The theatre had more than 3000 seats arranged in six tiers of boxes and above that the two loggione or galleries It has a very large stage The money for the building was found by selling the palchi to wealthy noblemen and other rich people in Milan In the platea there were no seats and the audience there stood up to watch like they do today in the Royal Albert Hall at the Proms The orchestra could be seen very well as they were not in an orchestra pit like they are today

Above the boxes La Scala has always had a gallery where people who are not so rich can watch This is still there today It is called the loggione Some people in the loggione known as the Claque are known to applaud wildly if they like a singer or boo loudly if they do not like a singer During La Scalas history this has often been because of bribery or blackmail

La Scala was originally lit with 84 oil lamps mounted on the palcoscenico and another thousand in the rest of theater In case they ever caught fire several rooms were filled with hundreds of water buckets Later oil lamps were replaced by gas lamps In 1883 electric lights were put in 

The building was renovated in 1907 After that it had 2800 seats as it does today In 1943 during World War II La Scala was badly damaged by bombing It was rebuilt and reopened on 11 May 1946 with a brilliant concert conducted by Arturo Toscanini with a soprano solo by Renata Tebaldi

Many famous operas were first performed at La Scala including some by Giuseppe Verdi For several years however Verdi did not allow his music to be played here because he did not like the way the orchestra had played it However the composer later conducted his Requiem there on May 25 1874 and in 1886 announced that La Scala would host the premiere of his opera Otello The first performance of his last opera Falstaff was also given in this theatre

La Scalas season traditionally opens on 7 December Saint Ambroses Day Milans patron saint All performances must end before midnight long operas start earlier in the evening if necessary

There is also a La Scala Museum which has an extraordinary collection of paintings drafts statues costumes and other documents about opera and La Scalas history

Recently there have been more broken wikt linkrenovationrenovations to La Scala Some people were worried that it would spoil the historic building but the opera company were very pleased when the work was done There was a new stage and lots more room behind the stage The heavy red carpets were taken away and the sound was better The seats include monitors so that the audience can follow the words in English or Italian if it is in a foreign language The renovated opera house was opened on 7 December 2004 with the same opera by Salieri that had opened it in 1778 The conductor was Riccardo Muti

Hyde Park could mean any of the following

Born in Poland Andrew Schally received his education in Scotland and England In 1952 he moved to Canada He received his doctorate in endocrinology from McGill University in 1957 That same year he left for a research career in the United States where he has worked mainly at Tulane University A Canadian citizen when he left Canada Schally became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1962 He was affiliated with the Baylor College of Medicine for some years in Houston Texas

He developed a whole new realm of knowledge concerning the brains control over the body chemistry His works also addressed birth control methods and growth hormones He  as well as Roger Guillemin described the neurohormone GnRH that controls FSH and LH He was awarded an honorary Doctoral Degree from Jagiellonian University at Krakw

Hyde Park is one of the largest parks in central London England and one of the Royal Parks of London famous for its Speakers Corner

The park is divided in two by the Serpentine Lake Hyde Park is 350 acres together with Kensington Gardens that is in the immediate neighbourhood the parks have an overall area of 625 acres 

The park was the site of The Great Exhibition of 1851 for which the Crystal Palace was designed

The park has become a traditional place for mass demonstrations 

See also Kensington Gardens South Australia a suburb of Adelaide Australia

Kensington Gardens once the private gardens of Kensington Palace is one of the Royal Parks of London lying immediately to the west of Hyde Park Most of it is in the City of Westminster but a small section to the west is in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea It covers 275 acres

Delfzijl is a small town in the very north of the Netherlands It has around 30000 inhabitants It has the fourth most important harbour in the country

The Great Exhibition also known as the Crystal Palace Exhibition was an international exhibition held in Hyde Park London England from 1 May to 15 October 1851 and the first in a series of Worlds Fair exhibitions of culture and industry that were to be a popular 19th century feature 

Spandau is the westernmost borough of Berlin It is along the western bank of the Havel and is where the rivers Havel and Spree meet It has an area of convert9191km2sqmi1abbronlinkon and has about 226100 inhabitants Its current mayor is Helmut Kleebank

The history of Spandau begins in the 7th or 8th century when Slavs settled in the area and built a fortress It was conquered in 928 by the German King Henry I but returns to Slavic rule later in the 10th century

The first written mention of Spandau was in 1197 It was given City rights in 1232

The Spandau Citadel was completed in 1594 by Joachim II of Brandenburg In 1558 the village of Gatow became part of Spandau Spandau was surrendered to the Swedes in 1634

In 1806 after the Battle of Jena and Auerstedt French troops under Napoleon took possession of the city and stayed there until 1807 In 1812 Napoleon returned and the Spandau Citadel was besieged in 1813 by Prussian and Russian troops

In 1920 the city of Spandau became a borough of Berlin Before World War I Spandau was a seat of large government cannon foundries factories for making gunpowder and other munitions of war The most dangerous weapon invented in Spandau was the Renana This was a small round bomb that detonated if put under pressure it was especially dangerous in the mornings

After World War II it was part of the British Occupation Zone in West Berlin and the Spandau Prison built in 1876 was used to house Nazi war criminals who were sentenced to imprisonment at the Nuremberg Trials After the death of Rudolf Hess the prisons last inmate Spandau Prison was completely destroyed by the allied powers A NAAFI supermarket was built on the site When the Allies left Berlin this military supermarket became a MediaMarkt store and carpark

Modern industries include metal working chemicals and carpet making

The popular British New Romantic band Spandau Ballet takes its name from Spandau

Spandau is twinned with

Las Terrenas is a Dominican municipality in the Saman province on the north coast of the peninsula of Saman

The name Las Terrenas comes from the French La terrienne

In the last national census the municipality had a total population of 13869 6985 men and 6884 women The urban population was 474 of the total population

The main economic activities of the municipality are the same of the province tourism agriculture and fishing

Schwieberdingen is a city in the center of Baden Wrttemberg in Germany The city was first mentioned 1304 It is found 5km away from Ludwigsburg and 10km away from Stuttgart

About 11000 people live in Schwieberdingen The largest sport club is the TSV Schwieberdingen

Snchez is a Dominican municipality in the Saman province on the south coast of the peninsula of Saman

The municipality has a total population of 26505 13436 men and 13069 women The urban population was 5828 of the total population

The old town of Las Caitas was elevated to the category of municipality in 1866 with the name of Francisco del Rosario Snchez one of the three Founding Fathers of the Dominican Republic

It was a very small town but it grew in importance and population when the railway from town to La Vega began to run across the rich region of the Cibao Snchez became the most important port of the country during the rest of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century The railway worked until 1966

The port has lost its importance because When other ports in the country grew in importance Snchez lost its importance as a port And the Yuna River has been filling the Saman Bay with solid material and only small boats can get to the port

The main economic activity of the municipality is agriculture Fishing was the main activity but now is not so important

Parking a vehicle means stopping and leaving it somewhere It is important to make sure that the vehicle is parked somewhere where parking is allowed otherwise the driver may have to pay a fine or even worse the vehicle may be clamped Cars are usually parked in driveways parking lots garages or on the side of the street

Parking a car is easier than parking a large vehicle such as a lorry or a coach These large vehicles often have to go to special parks Rules about parking are part of traffic rules and these will vary a lot from one country to another

Vehicles can often be parked at the side of the road parallel to the curb Sometimes there are no broken wikt linkrestrictionrestrictions one can park there free for as long as one likes In other places parking may not be allowed at all eg where there are double yellow lines or it may be allowed only for limited periods Drivers may have to pay to park Money can either be put in parking meters which are to be found by every parking bay or there may be a machine nearby where the driver has to pay and then he receives a ticket which he has to leave inside the car to show that he has paid The time and date of arrival will be printed on the ticket

If a driver does not pay or he stays longer than he is allowed he may be given a parking ticket by a traffic warden These wardens have the job of patrolling the streets and finding any cars which are illegally parked In some cities the cars may be clamped This means that a heavy clamp is fixed to one of the wheels so that the car cannot be driven away The driver then has to phone the clamping firm and arrange for them to unlock the clamp This will cost a lot of money A third possibility is that the car may be broken wikt linkimpoundimpounded This means that it is lifted by a crane onto a lorry and taken away It costs a lot of money to get ones car back

Car parks are large spaces where one can leave ones car A car park can be a large space of land It can also be a large building with several storeys This is called a parking garage Usually there are machines where one has to pay and then display a ticket inside the car With multi storey car parks the driver usually pays as he drives out or he pays at a machine where the ticket is validated He then puts the validated ticket into the machine at the exit the barrier goes up and he can drive off

Another type of car park called an attendant car park is one where the driver leaves the car keys with an attendant The attendant will then drive the car and park it so that all the cars are bunched up close to one another This saves space This type of car park is common at airports The driver can tell the attendant when he expects to be back

Cars are usually parked side by side in a car park

A Park and Ride is a big car park on the edge of a town Instead of driving into the centre of the town drivers can park there and take a bus or tram into the centre

Some car parks are private car parks They can only be used by people who are visiting the hotel store or firm to whom the car park belongs People who park there illegally may find that their vehicle gets clamped

Every car park whether it is a public or a private car park has to have a few spaces that are reserved for disabled people These spaces are usually conveniently near the exit of the car park or near the entrance of the store hotel restaurant etc The disabled bays are usually wider than ordinary bays so that the vehicle doors can be opened wide for the disabled person to get out It is important to display a valid disabled badge in the car

When driving along a road the driver may see a space big enough for him to park his vehicle He needs to park carefully First he should check in the mirror whether anything is close behind him He should stop just after he has passed the space alongside the next car then reverse slowly in aiming towards the curb then turning the steering wheel so that he just misses the car in front Then he can adjust leaving equal room between the two cars If the space is wide enough for two cars he can drive forwards into the space instead of reversing in This helps him to get out of the way of traffic coming up behind him

Wherever one parks it is very important to make sure that the vehicle is not in anyones way The vehicle must not cause an obstruction ie it must not be in the way of traffic or obstruct somebodys driveway It should not be parked somewhere where it might be dangerous such as on a corner

The Michaelskirche in Bamberg is a 12th century church It stands on the top of a very high hill overlooking the town of Bamberg It can be seen from nearly all directions Bamberg is built on seven hills each with a building at the top The hill on which the St Michaels Church stands is the highest one An old cobbled road with some ancient houses leads from the cathedral up to the church Not far beyond the church are fields and woods

The church is built in the Romanesque style It used to be the church of a Benedictine monastery The monastery was broken wikt linksecularizesecularized in 1803 There is now an almshouse there as well as a museum and municipal art collections

Emperor Heinrich II was the founder of the Bishopric of Bamberg The first bishop of Bamberg was Eberhard who founded the abbey of St Michael It belonged to the bishop The abbot had to obey the bishop The monks who came to live there came from the towns of Amorbach and Fulda

In the 12th century the abbey flourished This was the time of Bishop Otto of Bamberg The abbey started to become more independent of the bishop

The abbey went through hard times during the wars around 1525 In the 17th and 18th centuries it went through better times again When the bishops lost their political power in 1803 the abbey started to belong to the town The people asked for the almshouses in the town to be moved to the St Michael abbey There is still a home for old people there today

Behind the altar is the tomb of Bishop Otto of Bamberg which dates from 1443 There is a hole in the middle of the tomb which is just big enough for a person to crawl through Visitors to the church like to crawl through the hole because it is said that it helps people who have backache

The roof of the nave is very unusual It has paintings of 580 different kinds of plants These include plants from faraway countries eg pineapple cotton pomegranate and tobacco as well as plants that are found locally The paintings date from the 17th century Many of the plants were grown in the herb gardens around the church

In the side isles of the church the ceiling has more paintings These include paintings of birds There are even six parrots

A bypass is a road or highway that goes around a town or village so that traffic which is passing that town does not have to go through the town centre

Bypasses are good because they reduces the amount of traffic in the centre where the people live and work It makes it much safer for them to cross the roads and reduces pollution It is better for the vehicles passing the town because their journey is made quicker

People are not always happy when a bypass is built The main objections people sometimes have is that a new road uses up a lot of land Also some people who have businesses in the town may think that they will not get so many customers

If there are no strong rules that control the use of land buildings are built along a bypass making it an ordinary town road so that it might become just as busy as a town street again

A road that goes all the way around the town in a large circle is called a ring road The M25 is a ring road for London

DNA polymerase is an enzyme in the body helps connect deoxyribonucleotides into a piece of DNA The most famous things that DNA polymerases do is DNA replication In DNA replication DNA polymerase reads a piece of DNA thats already there and uses it to make a new piece that is exactly the same as the old piece

DNA polymerase does not know how to start a new piece of DNA it can only connect nucleotides to a 3 OH group that is already there DNA polymerase needs a primer to start making the new strand of DNA DNA polymerase can only add deoxyribonucleotides to the 3 end of a new piece of DNA so DNA is always made in the 5 3 direction

The Aldeburgh Festival is an English arts festival where classical music concerts take place during the summer Aldeburgh is in Suffolk in the south east of England It is where the composer Benjamin Britten lived with his friend the tenor Peter Pears A lot of Brittens music is played at the festival but music by many other composers can be heard as well Most of the concerts take place in the Maltings a concert hall in the village of Snape not far away from Aldeburgh

The Festival was started in 1948 by the Benjamin Britten Peter Pears and the librettist Eric Crozier They started the festival so that the English Opera Group would have a place to perform their operas but soon the festival became bigger There were poetry readings drama performances lectures and art exhibitions The first festival was mostly held in Aldeburgh Jubilee Hall a few doors away from Brittens house in Crabbe Street His opera Albert Herring was performed as well as his St Nicolas Cantata

Over the years the festival grew Some of the performances took place in the church or in churches or other halls in nearby villages and small towns such as Orford and Framlingham However the festival needed a large concert hall In the 1960s the old malthouse in Snape was changed into a concert hall It was opened by the Queen on 2 June 1967 at the start of the twentieth Aldeburgh Festival 

Two years later on the first night of the 1969 Festival the concert hall was destroyed by fire Only the main walls remained For that year the Festival was moved to other local places but by the next year the hall had been rebuilt and once again it was opened by the Queen this time at the start of the 1970 Festival

The festival is now organized by Aldeburgh Music which also runs the Britten Pears Young Artist Programme which gives young musicians a chance to learn from famous music teachers and perform in concerts

The festival has a nice atmosphere because it is in the country near the sea and marshes New music is often performed In the past there have been first performances of several works by Britten and also Harrison Birtwistles Punch and Judy in 1968

The Festivals Artistic Director is now the composer Thomas Ads who was appointed in 1999

Sir Peter Neville Luard Pears CBE was an English tenor and life long partner of the composer Benjamin Britten

Pears was at school at Lancing College He then studied music at Keble College Oxford He was organist at Hertford College Oxford but left Oxford without taking his degree He later studied singing for two terms at the Royal College of Music

He met Britten in 1934 when he was a member of the BBC Singers Pears and Britten gave their first recital together in 1937 at Balliol College Oxford In 1939 they went to America together because of World War II However in 1942 they decided to return to their own country Back in England they performed Brittens song cycle Seven Sonnets of Michelangelo together at the Wigmore Hall in London and then recorded them for EMI their first recording together

Peter Pears was a great inspiration for Brittens vocal writing Many of Brittens operas have a main tenor role which was written for Pears to sing Britten also wrote over 100 songs with piano accompaniment Britten also wrote works for tenor and orchestra These include Les Illuminations Nocturne the Serenade for Tenor Horn and Strings and the Canticles In Brittens operas he sang Peter Grimes and Albert Herring The Beggars Opera Owen Wingrave Billy Budd The Turn of the Screw Death in Venice and the three Church Parables 

Pears helped to write the words for A Midsummer Nights Dream based on the Shakespeare play In most of Brittens operas Pears sang serious roles but in A Midsummer Nights Dream he had a comic role the part of Flute the Bellowsmender In this role he was dressed up as a female and did a parody of the great opera singer Joan Sutherland singing the mad scene from Lucia di Lammermoor 

Pearss voice was a lyrical tenor not a heavy operatic one Britten was extremely skilful in writing music for him which suited his voice very well He sang regularly at the Royal Opera House and many other opera houses in Europe and the United States

He was also a great singer of Franz Schuberts Lieder usually with Britten as accompanist and he often sang the part of the Evangelist in Johann Sebastian Bachs Passions

His last great role written for him by Britten was as Aschenbach in Death in Venice He sang this in 1973 at the Aldeburgh Festival and the following year in the Royal Opera House Britten by then had heart disease and was too ill to go to the performances dying in 1976

Pears continued to live in the Red House Aldeburgh After he retired from performing he continued to teach young singers at the Britten Pears Foundation He was awarded a CBE in 1955 and knighted in 1977 

In his last years Pears also suffered from heart disease He died ten years after Britten He is buried next to him in the churchyard of Saint Peter and Saint Pauls Church in Aldeburgh

There are many recordings of Pearss singing including almost all the music that Britten wrote for him as well as the roles of the Evangelist in Johann Sebastian Bachs St Matthew Passion and St John Passion and Gerontius in Elgars Dream of Gerontius

An encore is an extra piece that is played at the end a performance It is not on the programme although the performer may have secretly planned it A performer will play an encore if the audience claps a lot Sometimes the audience shout encore when they want an encore The word encore is the French word for again

An encore is usually a short piece Often it is a fast piece to finish the performance off happily but if a musician has just played a very energetic loud piece then the encore might be a quiet piece A concert given by a solo performer or small group of performers is more likely to finish with an encore than a concert with an orchestra but a lot depends on the tradition from one country to another

Although encore is a French word in France the audience shout bis

A cay is a small low island consisting mostly of sand or coral and situated on top of a coral reef

The English word cay comes from the Spanish word cayo and this from the Tano word cayo meaning small island The English words key and quay come from the old French kai meaning sand bank Because it is a Tano word cay are used mainly in the Caribbean but the type of island is found in the tropical seas where there are coral reefs

Sand cays are built on the edge of the coral reefs opposite the direction from which the wind blows most of the time Because of that cays are often elongated Tides and wind deposit coral debris Weather affects the formation of cays greatly large tides would bring much more debris onto the cay and thus make it larger while a hurricane destroys a cay

Some cays are very large Cayo Coco north of Cuba is about 370 km2 Those large cays are being used for tourism because they have beaches with white sand and the presence of coral reefs

FileFishapodsjpgthumbright320pxIn the later Devonian descendants of pelagic lobe finned fish like Eusthenopteron were followed by  Panderichthys suited to muddy shallows

Tiktaalik with limb like fins that could take it onto land

Early tetrapods in weed filled swamps such as Acanthostega which had feet with eight digits and Ichthyostega with limbs Descendants also included pelagic lobe finned fish such as coelacanth species 

Sarcopterygii is a taxonomical class of animals The class is made up of lobe finned fish for example the lungfish and coelacanths They are a clade of bony fish which first appeared in the Silurian 418 million years ago One line in this group gave rise to the tetrapods

These are bony fishes with paired rounded fins These fins being similar to limbs suggest that these fish may be ancestors of land vertebrates All sarcopterygians possess teeth covered with true enamel

Many people who study taxonomy include the Tetrapoda within this group This means the group includes all species of four limbed vertebrates The fin limbs of sarcopterygiians are very similar to what people believe was the ancestral form of tetrapod limbs The ancestors of tetrapods are to be found amongst the lobe fins of the Devonian period The term fishapod is becoming used for this transitional group

Sarcopterygians and their relatives the Actinopterygii make up the superclass Osteichthyes the bony fish which have a bony skeleton rather than cartilage Otherwise there are vast differences in fin respiratory and circulatory structures between the Sarcopterygii and the Actinopterygii 

The first sarcopterygians found in the uppermost Silurian closely resembled the Acanthodii the spiny fish which went extinct at the end of the Paleozoic era In the earlymiddle Devonian while the predatory placoderms dominated the seas some sarcopterygians came into freshwater habitats

In the early Devonian the sarcopterygians split into two main lineages the Coelacanths and the Rhipidistia The former never left the oceans and their heyday was the late Devonian and Carboniferous from 385 to 299 mya as they were more common during those periods than in any other period in the Phanerozoic coelacanths still live today in the oceans

The Rhipidistians whose ancestors probably lived in the oceans near the river mouths left the ocean world and migrated into freshwater habitats They in turn split into two major groups the lungfish and the tetrapods The lungfish evolved the first proto lungs and proto limbs they learned in the middle Devonian how to live outside a water environment using their stubby fins to walk on land and find new water if their waterhole was depleted and their lungs to breathe air and get sufficient oxygen The lungfishs greatest diversity was in the Triassic period today there are fewer than a dozen genera left

The first tetrapodomorphs which included the gigantic rhizodonts had the same general anatomy as the lungfish who were their closest kin but they appear not to have left their water habitat until the later Devonian epoch with the appearance of tetrapods Tetrapods are the only tetrapodomorphs which survived after the Devonian

Non tetrapod sarcopterygians continued until towards the end of Paleozoic era suffering heavy losses during the Permian Triassic extinction event

The ray finned fishes get their name from the fact that they have lepidotrichia or fin rays Their fins are webs of skin held by bony or horny spines This is different from the fleshy fins of the fish in the Sarcopterygii 

Actinopterygians are the largest class of vertebrates There are nearly 25000 species They can be found in both fresh water and marine environments from the deep sea to the highest mountain streams Most of the living species are teleosts

The fires are occurring in a very dry area and they are being exacerbated by seasonal winds called the Santa Ana winds The San Diego Union Tribune reported Santa Ana winds blowing up to 60 mph combined with temperatures into the 90s to create in the worst possible fire conditions

Southern California is in the midst of an unusual drought in Los Angeles California with only 321 in of precipitation in the entire 2006 2007 rain season it is the driest year on record receiving less rain than Death Valley in a normal year

The Santa Ana winds are warm dry winds that characteristically appear in Southern California and Northern Baja California weather during autumn and early winter Santa Anas are a type of fhn wind the result of air pressure buildup in the high altitude Great Basin between the Sierra Nevada and the Rocky Mountains This high energy wind spills out of the Great Basin and is pulled by gravity into the surrounding lowlands The air circulates clockwise around the high pressure area bringing winds from the east and northeast to Southern California The air heats up due to adiabatic heating while being compressed during its descent While the air has already been dried by orographic lift prior to reaching the Great Basin the relative humidity of the air declines rapidly as it descends and warms in its final stages as it passes over the Transverse and Peninsular Ranges

The air is then forced down the mountain slopes out towards the Pacific coast the air mass is further heated by compression as it drops in altitude before reaching the Los Angeles Basin western San Diego County and Tijuana at typical speeds of 35 knots The southern California coastal region gets some of its hottest weather of the year during autumn while Santa Ana winds are blowing During Santa Ana conditions it is typically hotter along the coast than in the deserts and the humidity plummets to less than 15

As the Santa Ana winds are channeled through the mountain passes they can approach hurricane force The combination of wind heat and dryness turns the chaparral into explosive fuel for the infamous wildfires the region is known for Wildfires fanned by Santa Ana winds burned 721791 acres in two weeks during October 2003factdateApril 2009

Death in Venice is an opera by Benjamin Britten It is based on the story Death in Venice by the German writer Thomas Mann

The libretto for the opera was written by Myfanwy Piper It was the last opera that Britten wrote It was first performed at Snape Maltings near Aldeburgh England on June 16 1973 Britten was too ill to conduct it himself The main part of Aschenbach was sung by Sir Peter Pears

The story is supposed to take place in the year 1911 It starts in Munich and then moves to Venice The opera is divided into two acts

Aschenbach is a famous German writer He is getting old and starting to find it difficult to think of new ideas for stories As he is walking in Munich he stops in front of a cemetery He sees a traveller who is obviously from another country This makes him think he ought to travel somewhere to get new ideas for his books

He takes a boat to Venice On the boat he watches a group of young people Their leader is showing off Aschenbach realizes that although their leader looks young he is in fact old He has dressed in clothes and used make up to make him look young Aschenbach does not like him

In Venice he is takes a gondola but the boatman does not take him where he wants to go Aschenbach argues at first but the boatman does not take any notice 

Aschenbach arrives at the hotel In the hotel he watches the people coming down to dinner Suddenly he sees Tadzio Tadzio is a young Polish boy who is unbelievably beautiful Aschenbach realizes it is stupid for him to feel love for the boy but he cannot get the boy out of his mind

Aschenbach watches Tadzio playing on the sandy beach When he notices that the boy hates the Russian guests he realizes that the boy is not quite perfect after all

Aschenbach walks along the streets of Venice Everywhere beggars are asking him for money There is a horrible smell coming from the water of the canals Aschenbach decides to leave Venice The hotel manager is very sorry that he going so soon Tadzio walks past Aschenbach Aschenbach goes to the train station but his luggage has been put on the wrong train so he goes back to the hotel He is annoyed but he is also pleased because he can see Tadzio again

Aschenbach sits in his chair on the beach watching Tadzio and his friends play It makes him think of the Greek gods The boys do different sports on the beach running long jump discus javelin and wrestling Tadzio wins easily Aschenbach wants to congratulate him but when the chance comes he cannot speak

Aschenbach realizes that he loves the boy He goes to the barber for a shave The barber tells him that lots of people in Venice are getting sick Aschenbach wants to know whether it is something serious but the barber says it is nothing to worry about

Aschenbach is being rowed on the water He can smell disinfectant There are notices in the streets warning people to be careful of the sickness In a German newspaper he reads that the sickness in Venice is cholera It says that all German people should leave the city and return home Aschenbach does not want the Polish family to leave Venice He does not want them to know about the cholera He follows then to a caf and to church but he still cannot find the courage to speak to them After dinner the guests watch a group of actors Aschenbach notices that Tadzio like himself cannot laugh at their jokes

Lots of the hotel guests are leaving An English clerk tells him that lots of people in the city have Asiatic cholera He tells him he ought to leave immediately before they stop everyone from leaving the city

Aschenbach decides to warn Tadzios mother of the danger of the illness but he just cannot do it He has a dream about the Greek gods When he awakes he realises that these wild thoughts about Tadzio have gripped him He cannot do anything about it

Again Aschenbach watches as Tadzio and his friends play a game on the beach they soon leave Aschenbach goes to the barber He asks him to try to make him beautiful and young When he goes on a gondola he realises he is just like the old man he saw on the boat He follows the Polish family Tadzio starts to walk separately from his family He waits for Aschenbach and looks straight at him but Aschenbach turns away He is pleased that Tadzio does not let his mother notice what happened Aschenbach is alone again and buys some strawberries They are not fresh He thinks about the Greek gods again and about the relationship between a writer and what he writes about

The hotel manager organizes the departure of the last guests The Polish family are leaving Aschenbach watches Tadzio and another boy playing on the beach The game gets rough and the other boy pushes Tadzios face into the sand Aschenbach tries to get up to help him but he is too weak to get out of his chair Tadzio is left alone on the beach He gives Aschenbach a sign to follow him but Aschenbach slumps back in his chair and dies Tadzio continues walking far out into the sea

The part of the boy Tadzio is a dancing part He and his family never speak or sing in the opera

All the different characters that Aschenbach meets the man by the cemetery the old man dressed as a young man the gondolier the hotel manager the barber the leader of the actors and the voice of the God Dionysus are really like one character They are sung by the same singer a bass baritone Apart from him and Aschenbach the only other solo singer in the opera is the voice of Apollo sung offstage by a countertenor as the boys play sport on the beach There are several choruses the groups of young people hotel staff actors church choir and tourists

The whole sound of the opera is written with the voice of Peter Pears in mind Brittens music is partly tonal but also uses twelve tone music and gamelan music from the Far East When Aschenbach sings recitative he is just accompanied by the piano Britten deliberately uses a limited number of musical sounds This gives the opera a specially expressive character particularly in the beautiful ending

The Territory of the Saar Basin was usually called the Saar or the Saargebiet It was a territory governed by the League of Nations under the Treaty of Versailles for 15 years from 1920

Its population in 1933 was 812000 and its capital was Saarbrcken

It was made up of parts of the Prussian Rhine Province and the Bavarian Palatinate of the Rhine It was slightly smaller than the modern German state of Saarland

According to Treaty of Versailles the highly industrialized Saarland was to be governed by the League of Nations for a period of 15 years and its coalfields given to France The Commission of Government which represented the League of Nations had five members At least one member had to be French and one a native of the Saar

At the end of the 15 year period in 1935 the people of the Saar voted on how they wanted their country They voted to become a part of Nazi Germany

It had a currency the Saar franc and its own postage stamps during this period

The League of Nations control to the region was represented by the following Chairmen of the Commission of Government

In 1933 a lot of anti Nazi Germans fled to the Saar as it was the only part of Germany left outside the Third Reichs control As a result anti Nazi groups wanted the Saarland to remain under control of League of Nations as long as Adolf Hitler ruled Germany However France had a lot of power in the Saar France had control of the coalmines and even had the Saars currency called the franc Not many Saarlanders liked France and in the plebiscite on 13 January 1935 90 of those voting that wished to join Germany 886 wanted to stay with the League of Nations Only 040 wanted to join France

On 17 January 1935 the territorys re union with Germany was approved by the League Council On March 1 the Nazi Germany took over the region and appointed Josef Brckel as Reichskommissar fr die Rckgliederung des Saarlandes Reich Commissioner for the re union of Saarland

Many former politicians and office holders of the Saargebiet were changed or arrested by the Nazis

When re incorporation was completed the governor became Reichskommissar fr das Saarland Reich Commissioner of Saarland on 17 June 1936

Sir William Walton OM was a British composer and conductor He was one of the most important British composers of the mid 20th century a period that included Benjamin Britten and Michael Tippett His music has very lively rhythms which are often jazzy

Waltons family were musical but they had very little money Both his parents sang and Walton sang in the local church choir His father would hit him if he made a mistake This may be why in later life he was so careful about every note he wrote

At the age of ten he joined the choir of Christ Church Cathedral in Oxford He learned the piano and violin He was only 16 years when he went to University of Oxford where he was at Christ Church Oxford Most of what he knew about composing he taught himself He studied the scores of works by Stravinsky Debussy Sibelius and others He had some lessons from Hugh Allen the cathedral organist At Oxford Walton became friends with two poets Sacheverell Sitwell and Siegfried Sassoon Most of the music he wrote when he was very young has been lost but the choral anthem A Litany written when he was just fifteen shows his musical talent with its modern harmonies 

Walton left Oxford in 1920 without a degree having failed his exams three times He went to live with the Sitwell family who introduced him to many important people including the composer Constant Lambert and song writer Noel Coward He also travelled with the Sitwells to Italy In 1923 he set one of Edith Sitwells poems to music The piece was called Faade The music was very jazzy and almost jokey and it sounded very modern to many people at that time

During the 1920s Walton earned some money playing the piano at jazz clubs but he spent most of his time composing in the Sitwells broken wikt linkatticattic The orchestral overture Portsmouth Point was the first work which shows Waltons real style In 1929 the Viola Concerto started to make him really famous This was followed by Belshazzars Feast the Symphony No 1 the coronation march Crown Imperial and the Violin Concerto All these works are very popular today

During World War II Walton did not have to do military service so that he had time to compose music for propaganda films such as The First of the Few and Laurence Oliviers adaptation of Shakespeares Henry V After composing a second string quartet Walton spent most of the next seven years writing his opera Troilus and Cressida The opera was not very popular This was because his music was rather Romantic very different from a lot of modern music that was in fashion in the 1950s especially the music of Pierre Boulez and his followers

Walton also composed the music for two more Shakespeare Olivier films  the Academy Award winning Hamlet and Richard III Walton however did not win Oscars for any of his Shakespeare based scores

Walton then started to write more orchestral music the Cello Concerto the Symphony No 2 and the Variations on a Theme by Hindemith He started to have many honours He was knighted in 1951 and received the Order of Merit in 1968 People liked his one act comic opera The Bear when it was performed at the Aldeburgh Festival in 1967 and he was asked by people from all over the world for new music His song cycles from this period were given their first performances by famous singers such as Peter Pears and Elisabeth Schwarzkopf

In his last years Walton found composition more and more difficult He tried to compose a third symphony for Andr Previn but later gave up His last works were mostly church music or reworkings of older pieces He had settled on the island of Ischia in Italy in 1949 with his Argentinian wife Susana Gil He died there in 1983 

Since his death Waltons music has been performed and recorded a lot People no longer think of him as old fashioned but as a composer who had a very strong personality which can be heard clearly in his music

An Arizona hurricane is a tropical cyclone forming in the eastern Pacific Ocean that affects the state of Arizona in the United States Usually the storm makes landfall in the Mexican states of Baja California or Sonora with the remaining moisture normally having mild rainfall effects on the state However a few storms have crossed into Arizona while they still had tropical storm strength

It is difficult for a hurricane to form in Arizona because the normal storms that form in the eastern Pacific Ocean move either parallel or away from the Pacific coast of northwestern Mexico As a result most storms that could affect Arizona are carried away from the United States and only 6 of all Pacific hurricanes enter US territory In average Arizona experiences the effects of tropical cyclones once every five years Many but not all of these systems also affected California

Tropical storms are one of Arizonas main sources of rainfall and they infuse the monsoon over the southwestern United States However all of the storms that have impacted Arizona have formed in the latter parts of the Pacific hurricane season and no storm has affected the state before August

Some of these tropical cyclones have caused deaths or a lot of property damage usually because of flooding created by rain

In August of 1935 the remnants of an unnamed tropical storm that landed on southern California causing heavy rains and flooding across Arizona especially along the Santa Cruz River and Rillito Creek on Southern Arizona The rainfall due to the storm still holds the record rainfall at the National Weather Service office in Tucson

In September of 1970 the remnants of Tropical Storm Norma became Arizonas deadliest storm when they contributed to the disaster known as the Labor Day storm of 1970 As Norma dissipated moisture from the cyclone was captured in a large extratropical low The resulting rainfall created deadly floods that killed 23 people and caused huge damages Two years later the remnants of Hurricane Joanne caused flooding that created damages up to 10 million and eight deaths

On September 11 1976 Hurricane Kathleen killed a man when a gust of wind blew a palm tree down onto his mobile home Strong flooding and hailstorms also resulted

A weather system including moisture from Tropical Storm Octave caused heavy rains over a ten day period Fourteen people drowned 975 were injured and roughly 10000 people were left homeless when the flooding ended The amount of damage from the disaster was put at 370 million USD

Chromatography is a way to separate single chemical compounds from mixed substances that depends on the speed at which they move through special media or chemical substances It consists of a stationary phase and a mobile phase The mobile phase flows through the stationary phase Chromatography is much used in biochemistry and analytical chemistry 

Column chromatography separates compounds using many chemical actions between the chemical being tested and the chromatography column The column is run using either gravity or a pump

The mixed substance to be tested is added in a small amount and is slowed by certain chemical or physical activity with the chemicals in the chromatography column The amount of slowing depends on the type of chemicals in the substance being tested and the different phases The time at which a certain chemical elutes is called the retention time and there is thought to be only one for one chemical 

The most common stationary phase for column chromatography is silica gel followed by alumina Cellulose powder has been much used in the past The mobile phase is either a pure solvent or a mixture of solvents It is chosen make the time and amount of solvent used as little as possible while still clearly separating the chemicals being tested

High performance liquid chromatography is also sometimes referred to as high pressure liquid chromatography It is column chromatography run under pressure to raise the speed of the process 

Common solvents used in HPLC are mixes of water or various organic liquids

The iPhone is a mobile phone made by Apple Inc It does many different things like a computer but is small enough to fit in someones hand It is a mobile phone it makes calls without wires It can access the Internet as well Like an iPod it plays music and videos that have been put on it from a big computer which is called syncing It also has a calendar and camera and can send text messages People use the iPhone by touching the screen with a finger or two This is done by tapping dragging and even typing on a keyboard shown on the screen

There have been four types of iPhone At first only people in the United States who paid CingularATT for their mobile phones could buy the iPhone starting on June 29 2007 In November 2007 Apple took the iPhone to a few new countries in Europe On July 11 2008 Apple said that they would sell a better iPhone called the iPhone 3G 3G means it talks to the Internet faster It also has GPS which lets it know where it is on a map Apple now sells the iPhone 3G in more than 75 countries On June 17 2009 Apple released the iPhone 3GS The iPhone 3GS is faster than the iPhone 3G It can be controlled by speaking to it It can also find directions with a compass On June 24 2010 a new version of iPhone was released It has a video chat feature and has an updated operating system that can make it do many tasks at once And it has more pixels on the screen which makes the screen look better The newest iPhone is the iPhone 4S released on October 14 It is almost the same as the iPhone 4 but the feature controlled by speaking to it is called Siri and it does more things than the old speaking control

In most places the iPhone is only allowed with carriers that Apple likes Someone who buys an iPhone also makes a contract with the carrier which is an agreement to pay for service A mobile phone contract usually lasts for two years and the person buying the phone pays the carrier every month At first they pay less than the iPhone is worth because they will pay the rest later because of the agreement The contract also says the iPhone may only be used on their network However some people do not like that so they unlock their iPhone so it can be used with other carriers Other people jailbreak their iPhones to allow it to do more things In hopes of discouraging this Apple voids the warranty when an iPhone is unlocked or jailbroken

Apple made a Software Development Kit for the iPhone which lets people make their own software for it But to sell the software Apple must give permission The software is sold at the App Store Many thousands of apps are available to buy

Apple sold 52 million iPhones in the third fiscal quarter of 2009

A concert hall is a place where concerts of classical music take place Concert hall can either mean the actual room where the concerts takes place or the whole building The hall where the concerts are held may have a stage and there will be an auditorium where the audience sits

Some concert halls are purpose built That means they were built to be concert halls Other concert halls may have been something else many years ago eg a Corn Exchange and the building has later been changed into a concert hall Purpose built concert halls started about the beginning of the 20th century At that time scientists began to understand the importance of good acoustics

Concert halls that are purpose built usually have fixed seating Some halls may have seats that can be moved either by stacking them in small piles or tiered seating that can fold up This allows the hall to be used for other things eg dancing

A concert hall is usually a big hall big enough for an orchestra to be on the stage A small concert hall designed for just a few performers may be called a recital hall

Some concert halls are especially famous In London there is the Royal Festival Hall on the banks of the river Thames the Barbican Centre in the City and the Royal Albert Hall in Kensington which is used for other events as well There is also a famous recital hall called the Wigmore Hall New York has the Carnegie Hall Vienna has the Vienna Musikverein with a beautiful hall called the Golden Hall where the famous New Years Day concerts are given In Germany there is the Berliner Philharmonie in Berlin and the Gewandhaus in Leipzig In Amsterdam there is the Concertgebouw

A madrigal is a special kind of song for a small group of people to sing Madrigals were popular in the 16th and 17th centuries This was the end of the Renaissance music and beginning of the Baroque periods They started in Italy and became very popular for a short time in England as well as in France The words of madrigals are always about secular things eg about love

When Italian composers started writing madrigals the kinds of songs they knew were the frottola the motet and the French chanson The first madrigals were for 2 or 3 voices but later many madrigals were written for 4 or 5 voices These voices might be single voices or several people Sometimes the lines would also be played by an instrument but the madrigal is usually sung unaccompanied

The madrigal was the most important secular form of music of its time In Italy it was very popular between about 1550 and 1630 In England the madrigal period was about 1588 to 1620 

In 1533 a book called Primo libro di Madrigali was collected and published by Philippe Verdelot in Venice It made madrigals very popular Arcadelt published several volumes of madrigals which were very important for their development In 1588 in England Nicholas Yonge published a collected called Musica Transalpina These were Italian madrigals with translated texts The madrigal suddenly became extremely popular in England and remained so until after 1620 when it gradually became less important

People liked madrigals because they were fun Whenever possible the composer made the music sound like the word being sung A word like smile would have quick music sigh would have a note followed by a short rest as if the singer were sighing rise so high would be sung to music which rose very high This kind of thing was called word painting It can be found in religious music as well but the way it was used in madrigals was new and exciting Very often there would be a verse and a refrain which was often just sung to words such as fa la la la la The songs were often about shepherds and shepherdesses falling in love

The most important composers of madrigals in Italy were Luca Marenzio Jacques Arcadelt Adrian Willaert Cipriano de Rore Carlo Gesualdo Giaches de Wert and Claudio Monteverdi In England they were William Byrd Thomas Morley John Wilbye Thomas Weelkes John Dowland Orlando Gibbons and Thomas Tomkins

In the Renaissance madrigals were performed either as entertainment at important feasts or for relaxed enjoyment by groups of amateurs in their homes

Nowadays madrigals are often sung by high school or college madrigal choirs often as an after dinner entertainment Sometimes the singers wear Renaissance costumes

The Duchy of Saxe Coburg Saalfeld was one of the Ernestine duchies Ernest who became elector of Saxony in 1464 divided his territory between his sons andover the years more and more small duchies existed

Saxe Coburg Saalfeld was reformed on 29 July 1735 although Coburg and Saalfeld had had the same ruler since 1699 As only men could be the rulers of the duchies Saxe Coburg Saalfeld ceased to exist in 1825 when the last male descendant of the dukes of Saxe Gotha Altenburg died The various dukes reorganised their territories Saalfeld went the dukes of Saxe Meiningen Altenburg went to the Duke of Saxe Hildburgausen who gave Hildburghausen to the Duke of Saxe Meiningen Gotha and Coburg were combined into the new duchy of Saxe Coburg and Gotha

Sonora is a Mexian state in the northwestern Mexico region Sonora borders the states of Chihuahua to the east Sinaloa to the south and Baja California to the northwest To the north Sonora accounts for a long stretch of the US Mexico border adjacent to the US states of Arizona and New Mexico to the west it borders the Gulf of California

There are various explanations as to the origin of the word Sonora Here we will tell you some of the most widely accepted versions One of these says that when the Spaniards arrived in the lands occupied by the Opata people they built a chapel and painted an image of the Virgin on a buffalo skin Over time when the Opatas began to worship the Virgin they used to call her Senora instead of the Spanish word Seora Finally it would seem that this word became Sonora as we know it today 

Another version has it that Sonora is derived from the Opata word sonotl which means corn leaf A legend speaks of an indigenous group that lived near the village of Hupac and who used corn leaves to cover the walls and roofs of their huts Yet another version insists that the word comes from the name of a tribe that lived on the banks of the Sonora River these people were known as the Sonora Indians This river crosses a large part of the state It is also useful to understand that just as Mexico has its national emblems so the state of Sonora has its own coat of arms 

A monsoon is a seasonal wind which lasts for several months The word was first used in English for the seasonal rains in the Indian subcontinent These rains blow in from the Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea in the southwest bringing heavy rainfall to the area 

Monsoons also occur in other regions such as in North America Sub Saharan Africa Brazil and East Asia

The mechanism is simple land heats up faster than water The temperature difference between the land and sea can be as much as 20C land temperatures in India can be hotter than 45C while the surrounding water in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea remains in the low 20s The heat absorbed by the land warms the air above it The hot air rises and cooler ocean air rushes inland to replace it As it moves it carries moisture with it releasing it over land as the summer monsoon 

The hot air over the land tends to rise creating an area of low pressure This creates a steady wind blowing toward the land bringing the moist near surface air over the oceans with it rainfall is increased by the moist ocean air being lifted upwards by mountains as with the Tibetan Plateau and by surface heating 

Baja California is a Mexican state located in the northern section of the Baja California Peninsula It borders the state Baja California Sur to the south and Sonora to the east It also borders the US state of California to the north It means Lower California

Mykolaiv is a major city in southern Ukraine 

The city is located 65 kilometers from the Black Sea along the estuary of the Southern Buh river at around coor dm4658N320EregionUAtypecity Population 514000

It is the administrative center of the Mykolaiv Oblast as well as of both the Mykolaivsky and Zhovtnevy raions within the oblast However Mykolaiv is a city of oblast subordinance thus being subject directly to the oblast authorities rather to the raion administration housed in the city itself

The town was founded in 1789 by the Russian Governor General of Novorossiya Knyaz Potemkin initially as a shipyard called simply a New Shipyard on the Ingul river Knyaz Potemkin signed an order to construct a shipyard on August 27 1789 which is considered to be a city birth date The shipyard was to serve for the repair of the Russian Navy ships in the Russo Turkish war Later Potemkin ordered the shipyard to be named Nikolaev to commemorate the date of fall of Ochakov to the Russian troops under his command on December 6 1788 close to the day of Saint Nicholas December 19 in the Russian Orthodox Church 

The history of the city has always been closely connected to the ship building

The only Russian Navy aircraft carrier currently in commission Admiral Flota Sovetskogo Soyuza Kuznetsov was built in Mykolaiv

Today Mykolaiv is a major ship building center of Ukraine and an important riverport The city has 3 major shipyards some of which are capable of building large navy ships Other important industries are mechanical engineering power engineering metallurgy and cosmetics

Akkad was an ancient city in Mesopotamia It was the centre of the Akkadian Empire The ruins have not been found but it is believed to be on the River Euphrates The empire comes after a long relationship with Sumer and before the ethnic Akkadian empires of Babylonia and Assyria 

According to the Sumerian king list Akkad was built by Sargon of Akkad 23th century BC and is often called the first empire in history Even so it is known from older cuneiform writings that the city was already there before Sargon in the time of the kings of Uruk According to the Bible it was one of the cities started by Nimrod Also in the earliest records when Mesopotamian kings started calling themselves lord of the four quarters around Sumer these were listed as Martu Shubar Elam and Uri ki 

As the capital city of the Akkadian Empire beginning with Sargon the city ruled from around 2300 to 2215 BC when it was destroyed by the Gutians who invaded from the mountains 

Sargon conquered many of the surrounding regions He created an empire which reached as far as the Mediterranean Sea and Anatolia and extended his rule to Elam and as far south as Oman He ruled over this area for 56 years Trade extended from the silver mines of Anatolia to the lapis lazuli mines in Afghanistan the cedars of Lebanon and the copper of Oman This consolidation of the city states of Sumer and Akkad reflected the growing economic and political power of Mesopotamia The empires breadbasket was the rain fed agricultural system of northern Mesopotamia and a chain of fortresses was built to control the imperial wheat production

Images of Sargon were erected on the shores of the Mediterranean in token of his victories and cities and palaces were built at home with the spoils of the conquered lands Elam and the northern part of Mesopotamia were also subjugated and rebellions in Sumer were put down Contract tablets have been found dated in the years of the campaigns against Canaan and against Sarlak king of Gutium

The Akkadian language was one of the Semitic languages and at the time of the Akkadian Empire it was made official in both Mesopotamia and Elam Akkadian remained the main diplomatic language of Mesopotamia for centuries

During the 3rd millennium BC an intimate cultural symbiosis developed between the Sumerians and the Akkadians which included widespread bilingualism Akkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as the spoken language of Mesopotamia somewhere around the turn of the 3rd and the 2nd millennium BC but Sumerian continued to be used as a sacred ceremonial literary and scientific language in Mesopotamia until the first century AD

The fall of the empire established by Sargon seems to have been as sudden as its rise and little is known about the Gutian period From the fall of Akkad ca 2083 BC until the Sumerian renaissance ca 2050 BC there is much that is still dark It has recently been suggested that the regional decline at the end of the Akkadian period was associated with rapidly increasing aridity and failing rainfall in the region of the Ancient Near East

A song cycle in classical music is a group of songs that belong together Although each song may be sung separately the composer really imagined that they would be performed together as one work Sometimes they tell a story but sometimes they just belong together because they are about the same idea They are often for solo voice and piano accompaniment but they can also be without accompaniment or with several instruments or even a whole orchestra The words of a cycle are often by the same poet but this is not always the case

Song cycles started to become popular with composers in the Romantic period Although there were examples of song cycles written before that it was the German composers of the 19th century who are most often thought of as writers of song cycles Their songs are called Lieder  

The great composer Franz Schubert wrote about 600 songs These include two long song cycles Winterreise and Die schne Mllerin Each of these song cycles is long enough for a whole concert Robert Schumann wrote song cycles including two which he simply called Liederkreise and his well known Dichterliebe and Frauenliebe und Leben Brahms wrote Vier ernste Gesnge and Gustav Mahler who became very interested in folk song wrote several song cycles with orchestra accompaniment including Das Lied von der Erde

French composers who wrote song cycles include Jules Massenet Gabriel Faur and Claude Debussy Russian composers include Modest Mussorgsky and Dmitri Shostakovich and English and American composers in the 20th century include Michael Tippett Benjamin Britten and Aaron Copland as well as the South American Alberto Ginastera Juan Mara Solare and Heitor Villa Lobos

The frottola was the most popular kind of secular song in Italy during the late 15th and early 16th centuries

Frottole were quite simple and fun They were often sung by small groups of singers They were not contrapuntal but they had a tune in the top part while the other singers sang chords to accompany the tune Sometimes they might have been sung by a solo voice with a lute accompaniment

The most famous composer of frottole was Bartolomeo Tromboncino The great composer Josquin also composed frottole although that is not what he called them For example there is a well known one called El Grillo in which the singers try to sound like the chirping of a cricket in the grass

About the year 1530 the frottola developed into the madrigal

Bartolomeo Tromboncino was an Italian composer He lived in the Renaissance period He is famous as a composer of songs called frottole He is also remembered because he murdered his wife

We know very little about his life He probably grew up in Mantua In a letter he says that he came from Verona Until around 1500 he lived and worked in Mantua but sometimes he went to other towns when he was in trouble In 1499 he found his wife with another man so he murdered her He may also have murdered the other man We cannot be sure about this He does not seem to have been punished This may be because a wealthy lady called Isabella dEste liked him

From 1502 Tromboncino was employed by a rich lady called Lucrezia Borgia She is remembered today because she was a very bad woman He wrote music for the court and for her wedding to Alfonso dEste Sometime before 1521 he moved to Venice where he probably spent the rest of his life

His frottole are very lively and full of fun He played the trombone This is how he got his name He also wrote some serious sacred music

Dogfights is a TV show on The History Channel It uses computer animation to show dogfights from wars and talks with the pilots

A dogfight is a close air fight between fighter planes It often involves turning climbing and swirling

Dogfights started during World War I and World War II when the fighter planes did not have many weapons Modern weapons such as homing missiles did not exist in that time and planes could only fight each other with machine guns Since the machine guns were only useful at close range the planes had to fly very close together to have combat Pilots had to fly with many maneuvers to try to not be shot and be able to shoot the enemy planes This new type of flying was named dogfighting Fighter planes made just for this type of flying were sometimes called dogfighters

In modern air combat there are many long range weapons that can be used before dogfighting Homing missiles can be fired much further away from the target than machine guns and will automatically try to follow the target These types of weapons make dogfighting less common but modern planes still have Gatling guns which are more advanced kinds of machine guns This is because dogfighting still happens sometimes

Second Life is a big online game Unlike most games Second Life does not have any single goal that players must achieve They are free to do anything they want They are also free to make up new things and add them to Second Life Players can make places clothes and other things Because of this some people think that Second Life is not a game at all They say that it is a platform

All players are free to do anything they want in Second Life Because of this in fact there are some things that cannot be done in Second Life that can be in other online games because other people will not let them be done when they have a free choice For example users can fight each other in Second Life but either person can stop fighting any time and they do not really lose anything by doing so

Elas Pia has Dajabn to the northwest Santiago Rodrguez to the northeast San Juan to the east by San Juan and the Independencia province to the south To the west Elas Pia borders the Republic of Haiti

Elas Pia was an officer of the Dominican army when the Dominican Haitian War He was born in a place near Comendador and died in 1845 in a battle near Bnica

Few people lived in the territory of Elas Pia during colonial times because it was on the border between two colonies the French Saint Domingue and the Spanish Santo Domingo After 1844 the region became part of the border between Haiti and Dominican Republic

The only town founded during the colony was Bnica in the eastern end of a region of many savannas that was called Oncano by the Spanish most of Oncano is now part of the Centre Department of Haiti Both Comendador and Hondo Valle were military posts on the border after de Dominican independence The rest of the present province had very few people until the end of the Restoration War in 1865 when families from other parts of the country came to live here

The second main road goes from south to north it starts in the Snchez National Road at Matayaya and goes through Bnica and Pedro Santana and then through the Dajabn and Monte Cristi provinces to end in San Fernando de Monte Cristi on the north coast This road for several kilometres north of Pedro Santana marks the border between the Dominican Republic and Haiti and for that reason is called International Road

There are other secondary roads One of them goes from Comendador to Hondo Valle and then to the Independencia province crossing the Sierra de Neiba mountain range

Two mountain ranges crosses the province from east to west and then into Haiti The Cordillera Central is in the northern part of the province and the Sierra de Neiba runs across the southern half The area between those two mountain ranges is composed of several valleys formed by the Artibonite River and its tributaries and low mountains

The main river is the Artibonite that in some places marks the Dominican Haitian border Other rivers are Macasas Tocino Joca and Vallecito all of them tributaries of the Artibonite river The Caa river is the most important in the southern part of the province going from south to north it is a tributary of the Macasas river

A Video CD or VCD is a CD that contains a movie instead of music or a computer program It is the little brother of the DVD

Since a DVD can store ten times as much information as a VCD the quality of a VCD is not as high as that of a DVD yet is ten times cheaper to make The quality of the picture is about as good as a normal TV with a simple antenna

VCDs were invented by Philips and Sony just like the CD but then never became very popular in the Western world which switched from VHS tapes directly to the DVD However in Asia and in other developing countries the VCD is popular since a DVD player is also much more expensive than a VCD player

A VCD movie is stored in the popular MPEG format that is also often used to download movies from the internet But if a VCD disk is put in a computer there is a file with a MPG after the name and many other files This is because the movie is actually in a file that has DAT after the name This file can be played with Windows Media Player one does not need special software because the file is actually just a MPG movie with a DAT end of the name instead of MPG There are also many programs that exist to make it possible to play a VCD on a PC

The Boston Red Sox are a baseball team from Boston Massachusetts and became the World Series Champions in 2007 The Red Sox are a member and are now champions of both the Major League Baseballs American League Eastern Division and of the American League itself The Red Sox have played at Fenway Park ever since 1912

One of the American Leagues eight charter franchises the club was founded in Boston in 1901 Then known as the Boston Americans they played at Huntington Avenue Grounds and met the Pittsburgh Pirates in the first World Series which the Red Sox won In 1918 the team won its fifth World Series and then went into one of the longest championship droughts in baseball history The Red Sox won the World Series in 1903 1912 1915 1916 1918 2004 and 2007 and won the pennant but lost the World Series in 1946 1967 1975 and 1986

Many thought their championship drought between 1918 and 2004 was caused by the Curse of the Bambino said to have been caused by the trade of Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees in 1920 The drought was ended and the curse reversed in 2004 when the team won their sixth World Series Championship 

To get to the 2004 World Series they beat the Yankees in the 2004 American League Championship Series they lost the first three ALCS games to the Yankees but then when one more loss would have eliminated the Red Sox and sent the Yankees to the World Series won the next four games and thereby won the ALCS That was and still is the only time a team has won a seven game playoff series after losing the first three games 

After the ALCS the Red Sox beat the St Louis Cardinals to win their first World Series since 1918 in 2004

The Court is located in Karlsruhe This was to show it was separate from the federal government first based in Bonn and other federal bodies such as the German intelligence based in Munich

Federal law helps to describe what the court can do and how it works Article 203 of the Grundgesetz says that each the three branches of the government the parliament the ministers and the courts can only do what the constitution allows The court can decide that acts of all three branches are not allowed by the constitution and prevent them from happening

There are different reasons the court may find something unconstitutional

Decisions of the court on material conflicts are applied through a federal law by the Federal Constitutional Court Act

The court only hear certain cases

The court has 16 judges They are divided into two groups called senates of eight judges The chairman of one senate is also the President of the Court The chairman of the other senate is the vice president Most cases are heard by a chamber which is three members of one senate All three judges of the chamber must agree on a decision A chamber has to use precedent If a chamber thinks a precedent should be changed they have to let the case be decided by the Senate as a whole Similarly if a Senate thinks a precedent set by the other Senate should be changed precedent of the must ask the Plenum

Decisions by a Senate need an absolute majority of 5 votes The BVerfGG decides which type of cases a senate hears

Four judges of each senate are elected by the Bundestag The others are elected by the Bundesrat Choosing a judge needs a two thirds majority

The judges have a 12 year term but they must retire when reaching the age of 68 A judge must be at least 40 years old and must be a well trained jurist Three out of eight members of each Senate must have been a judge of a Federal Supreme Court Of the other five members of each Senate most judges have been a professor of law at a university a public servant or a lawyer

At the end of their term most judges retire from public life One notable exception was Roman Herzog who was elected Federal President in 1994 shortly before the end of his term as President of the Court

ETA is one of Europes most notorious and long running terror groups It was founded in 1959 from what was left of EKIN another radical Basque separatist group Both EKIN and ETA were created because of discontent with the moderate nationalism of the main Basque party the Basque National Party Since its founding ETA has been responsible for hundreds of attacks in Spain and France It has also maintained ties with other terrorist groups both inside and outside the Basque region These ties included the Irish Republican Army and Venezuelas Red Flag

Most of ETAs attacks have targeted businesses and Spanish government officials especially members of the security services and the judiciary Its most common tactics are bombing and assassination Similar to the IRA ETA sometimes issues warnings before the attacks

The groups most notorious success was the assassination of Admiral Luis Carrero Blanco in December 1973 At the time Blanco was seen by many as the most likely successor to Spains dictator Francisco Franco He was killed when an underground bomb exploded beneath his car More than twenty years later ETA nearly assassinated Jose Maria Aznar an opposition politician who later became prime minister

The status of the Basque homeland changed significantly with the end of the Franco regime and the return of democracy in 1979 Franco tried to suppress Basque nationalism and separatism The new democratic government on the other hand offered significant autonomy to the Basque provinces In a deal struck in 1980 the Basque region acquired its own parliament It was also allowed to change taxes In addition the language Euskara became more prominent in public culture and education The new autonomy however did not deter the radical separatists that comprised ETA ETA has committed approximately 900 murders and dozens of kidnappings

ETAs level of activity has changed over the years The group has attempted several cease fires including a 14 month one that lasted until December 1999 While there have been a number of ETA attacks since 2000 the group has claimed fewer victims It is believed to be shrinking Spanish officials believe that recent crackdowns have led to a serious weakening of the group and sense that its future as a terrorist organization may be limited There are more than one hundred suspected ETA members in Spanish prisons today

In the past several years ETA has done sporadic attacks including strings of bombings in September 2004 December 2005 and early 2006 However these bombings were generally preceded by warnings and did not result in any deaths

Current Goals In March 2006 ETA declared a permanent cease fire and expressed a willingness to join the political process The decision may have been linked to the infamous Madrid train bombings of March 11th 2004 which killed nearly 200 people The attack was originally blamed on ETA though it was soon discovered to be the work of militant Islamists linked to al Qaeda Like the Irish Republican Army ETA leaders may have felt that the mass casualty terrorism practiced by some radical Islamist groups discredited its violent tacticsthough this is not known for certain ETA is famous for its secretive leadership structure

In June 2007 ETA declared its March 2006 cease fire null and void though many had seen ETAs December 2006 bombing of an airport parking garage as an indication that the truce would not hold An ETA spokesperson accused the Spanish government of interfering in Basque local elections as well as continuing with the prosecution and conviction of ETA members during the cease fire

It must be noted that ETA did not officially renounce violence or initiate steps to decommission its weapons as part of its cease fire declaration ETA cease fires have deteriorated into violence before

Petr Eben was a Czech composer and organist Many musicians think of him as the most important Czech composer of the late 20th century He was known world wide for his organ playing He was especially good at improvisation

Eben grew up in esk Krumlov in south Bohemia He learned to play the piano and later the cello and organ Because his father was a Jew he had to leave school in 1943 and spent the rest of the war years in concentration camp in Buchenwald In the camp he saw many terrible things including graves into which the Nazis were throwing lots of murdered Jews These terrible things influenced his music in later years He had a strong faith and this helped him to survive during 40 years of living in Czechoslovakia under communist rule

After the war he went to Prague Academy for Music where he studied the piano with Frantiek Rauch and composition with Pavel Bokovec In 1955 he got a job as lecturer at Charles University in Prague He stayed there until 1990 He was the countrys best composer and he should have had promotion but the communist politicians did not allow this He went to church every Sunday with his family This did not help his career in a communist state

After the Velvet Revolution in 1989 when his country became free from the Soviet Union he started to become a national hero He was made Professor of Composition and president of the Prague Spring Music Festival Many music festivals performed his compositions and he traveled to hear the concerts in spite of the fact that he was starting to become ill His music was often played in England where he had spent two years as professor of composition at the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester from 1978 to 1979 In March 2007 the BBC Symphony Orchestra under their Czech conductor Ji Blohlvek performed his Vox Clamantis a work he had written in 1968 which shows the Czech peoples longing to be free

Eben continued during his lifetime to develop the style of music in which he wrote He was interested in Czech folk music and he wrote down many folk songs that he heard in Moravia He listened to plainchant in church music All this helped him to develop his own style of composition He is best known abroad for his organ music especially works such as Musica Dominicalis which includes a popular piece called Moto Ostinato Other organ works include Faust Job and A Festive Voluntary which is a set of variations on the tune of Good King Wenceslas written for the reopening in 1986 of the organ at Chichester Cathedral which had just been restored He also wrote a lot of music for orchestra as well as chamber music He composed some beautiful music for childrens choir including church music called Liturgical Songs

Paul Ludwig Hans Anton von Beneckendorff und von Hindenburg He was a German field marshal and statesman

Hindenburg retired from the army in 1911 He rejoined the army at the start of the First World War He became famous when he won the Battle of Tannenberg in 1914

Hindenburg retired again in 1919 but returned to public life one more time in 1925 to be elected as the second President of Germany

He was 84 years old and in poor health but had to run for re election in 1932 as the only candidate who could defeat Adolf Hitler He tried to stop the Nazi Partys rise to power but had to appoint Hitler as Chancellor in January 1933 In March he signed the Enabling Act of 1933 which gave special powers to Hitlers government Hindenburg died the next year after which Hitler declared the office of President vacant and made himself Head of State

The famous zeppelin Hindenburg that was destroyed by fire in 1937 had been named in his honour as is the causeway joining the island of Sylt to mainland Schleswig Holstein the Hindenburgdamm built during his time in office

In 1925 Hindenburg had no interest in running for public office After the first round Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz one of the leaders of the DNVP visited Hindenburg and asked him to run

Hindenburg eventually agreed to run in the second round of the elections as a non party independent although he was a conservative Because he was Germanys greatest war hero Hindenburg won the election in the second round of voting held on 26 April 1925

He was helped when the Bavarian Peoples Party switched its support from Marx the SPD candidate and the Communist Party of Germany to did not withdraw its candidate Ernst Thlmann If they had their supporters would most likely have voted for the SPD and Hindenburg may not have won

Hindenburg tried to stay out of day to politics and be a ceremonial president He liked the monarchy but took his oath to the Weimar Constitution seriously

Hindenburg often complained that he missed the quiet of his retirement and that politics was full of ideas like economics that he did not understand

He advisers included his son Oskar his old army aide General Wilhelm Groener and General Kurt von Schleicher They did not like the democratic rules of the Weimar Republic and wanted a change The younger Hindenburg served as his fathers aide de camp and controlled politicians access to the President

Schleicher came up with the idea of Presidential government and the 254853 formula

Under a Presidential government the chancellor is responsible to the president and not the Reichstag The 254853 formula was the three articles of the Constitution that could make a Presidential government possible

Schleichers wanted to have Hindenburg appoint a chancellor that Schleicher chose If that chancellor needed any laws he could use article 48 If the Reichstag should threaten to cancel any of those laws Hindenburg could threaten a dissolution and call new elections Hindenburg did not like the idea but was pressured into going along with them by his son and his other advisors

The first try at presidential government in 19261927 failed for lack of political support During the winter of 19291930 Schleicher had a series of secret meetings with Heinrich Brning the leader of the Catholic Center Party

Schleicher then set about splitting the Grand Coalition government of the Social Democrats and the German Peoples Party As a result the government fell in March 1930 and Brning was named Chancellor by Hindenburg

Brnings first act was to introduce a budget calling for steep spending cuts and sharp tax increases When the budget was defeated in July Brning had Hindenburg sign the budget as an emergency law under Article 48 When the Reichstag voted to cancel the budget Brning had Hindenburg dissolve Reichstag only two years into its mandate and had the budget passed again by Article 48 The Nazis got 17 of the vote in the September 1930 elections The Communist Party of Germany also made gains

Brning ruled through Article 48 the Social Democrats never voted not to cancel his Article 48 bills in order not to have another election that could only benefit the Nazis and the Communists

In the first round of the election held in March 1932 Hindenburg was the frontrunner but did not have an absolute majority In the runoff election of April 1932 Hindenburg beat Hitler for the Presidency

After the presidential elections had ended Schleicher held a series of secret meetings with Hitler in May 1932 and thought that Hitler had agreed to support the new presidential government Schleicher was building

In May 1932 Schleicher had Hindenburg sack Groener as Defence Minister to humiliate both Groener and Brning On 31 May 1932 Hindenburg sacked Brning as Chancellor and replaced him with Schleichers suggestion Franz von Papen

von Papens government openly wanted to destroy German democracy Like Brnings government von Papens government was a presidential government that governed through the use of Article 48

As Schleicher wanted Hindenburg dissolved the Reichstag and set new elections for July 1932 Schleicher and von Papen both believed that the Nazis would win the majority of the seats and would support von Papens government

The Nazi party did became the largest party in the Reichstag and expected Hitler would be Chancellor When Hindenburg met Hitler on 13 August 1932 in Berlin Hindenburg rejected Hitlers demands for the Chancellorship

The minutes of the meeting were kept by Otto Meiner the Chief of the Presidential Chancellery According to the minutes

The Reich President in reply said firmly that he must answer this demand with a clear unyielding No He could not justify before God before his conscience or before the Fatherland the transfer of the whole authority of government to a single party especially to a party that was biased against people who had different views from their own There were a number of other reasons against it upon which he did not wish to enlarge in detail such as fear of increased unrest the effect on foreign countries etc

Herr Hitler repeated that any other solution was unacceptable to him

To this the Reich President replied So you will go into opposition

Hindenburg issued a press release about his meeting with Hitler that seemed to say that Hitler had demanded absolute power and that the President had refused Hitler was enraged by this press release

When the Reichstag met in September 1932 its first and only act was to pass a massive vote of no confidence in von Papens government In response von Papen had Hindenburg dissolve the Reichstag for elections in November 1932 In the 1949 constitution a vote of no confidence must be accompanied by the election of a new chancellor so this could not happen

In the second Reichstag elections of 1932 the Nazis lost some support but stayed the largest party in the Reichstag There ensued another round of talks between Hindenburg von Papen von Schleicher on the one hand and Hitler and the other Nazi leaders on the other

Hitler still demanded that Hindenburg give him the Chancellorship Hindenburg could not accept this so von Papen suggested Hindenburg declare martial law and do away with democracy

Von Papen got Oscar Hindenburg to support the plan and they persuaded the president to ignore his oath to the Constitution and go along with this plan Schleicher saw von Papen as a threat so he blocked the martial law plan by saying it would make the Nazi SA and the Communist Red Front Fighters rebel and that the Poles would invade and the Reichswehr would be unable to cope

Hindenburg hated the idea of Hitler as Chancellor but under pressure from Meiner von Papen and Oskar Hindenburg the President decided to appoint Hitler Chancellor On the morning of 30 January 1933 Hindenburg swore Hitler in as Chancellor at the Presidential Palace

Hindenburg played key role in the Nazi Machtergreifung in 1933 He was not involved in the planning but did not stop Hitler In the Government of National Concentration headed by Hitler the Nazis were in the minority Most of the ministers were from the von Papen and von Schleicher governments Besides Hitler the only other Nazi ministers were Hermann Gring and Wilhelm Frick

Hindenburg thought that the Nazis power was limited especially as his favourite politician von Papen was the Vice Chancellor and the Reich Commissioner for Prussia

Hitlers first act as Chancellor was to ask Hindenburg to dissolve the Reichstag so that the Nazis and DNVP could increase their number of seats Hindenburg agreed

In early February 1933 von Papen had an Article 48 bill signed into law that limited the freedom of press After the Reichstag fire Hindenburg signed into law the Reichstag Fire Decree

At the opening of the new Reichstag on 21 March 1933 at the Kroll Opera House the Nazis staged an elaborate ceremony in which Hindenburg played the leading part that was meant to mark the continuity between the Prussian German tradition and the new Nazi state

The ceremony at the Kroll Opera House had the effect of reassuring many Germans especially conservative Germans that life would be fine under the new regime On 23 March 1933 Hindenburg signed the Enabling Act into law

Hindenburg was still very popular but his health was getting worse The Nazis made sure that whenever Hindenburg did appear in public Hitler was with him and that Hitler was always very respectful to the President The nazi propagandists hooped people would think Hindenburg liked Hitler and nHitler would become more poular

The only time Hindenburg ever tried to stop a Nazi bill was in early April 1933 The Reichstag had passed a Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service This said that all Jewish civil servants working for the Reich the Lnder or the local districts should be sacked immediately

Hindenburg refused to sign this bill into law unless all Jewish veterans of World War I Jewish civil servants who served in the civil service during the war and those Jewish civil servants whose fathers were veterans were allowed to stay in office Hitler agreed in order to get the law signed even though he believed that the Jews had tried to undermine Germany during the Great War It was Hindenburg who said that Germany lost the First World War because of politicians and others stabbing the Army in the back Hindenburg did not believe the story He said it so that his wartime deputy Erich von Ludendorff would not write bad things in his memoirs But Hitler did believe the story and used it to gain power

Hindenburg stayed president until he died from lung cancer at his home in Neudeck East Prussia on 2 August 1934

One day before Hindenburgs death Hitler flew to Neudeck and visited him Hindenburg old and senile thought he was meeting Kaiser Wilhelm II and called Hitler Your Majesty

He would be Germanys last president until 1945 when Karl Dnitz was appointed president in Hitlers last will Following Hindenburgs death Hitler declared the office of President to be permanently vacant effectively merging it with the office of Chancellor under the title of Leader and Chancellor making himself Germanys Head of State and Head of government

Hindenburg was buried in the Tannenberg memorial near Tannenberg East Prussia But Hindenburg always said he wanted to be buried next to his wife In 1945 German troops removed his and his wifes coffins to save them from the approaching Soviet troops

Denton True Cy Young was an American baseball player who was a pitcher for five different professional baseball teams from 1890 to 1911 He set many pitching records during his 22 year career in Major League Baseball some of which have stood for 100 years When Young retired from baseball he had won a total of 511 games in his career the most in MLB history and 94 more wins than Walter Johnson who is second on the list

In 1956 the MLB created the Cy Young Award The award is given each year to the pitcher who is voted the most effective in each of the two leagues Young was voted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1939 During his professional career Young won 30 or more games in a season five times with ten other seasons of 20 wins He also pitched three no hitters including the first perfect game of baseballs modern era

In addition to wins Young holds the MLB records for most career innings pitched most career games started and most complete games He also retired with 316 losses the most in MLB history Young also had 76 career shutouts the fourth most in history

In 1999 88 years after his final Major League appearance and 44 years after his death editors at The Sporting News ranked Cy Young 14th on their list of Baseballs 100 Greatest Players That same year baseball fans named Young to the Major League Baseball All Century Team

Young was born in Gilmore Ohio a farming community located in eastern Ohio Young went by the name Dent Young in his early years He was raised on a farm and was sometimes called Farmer Young and Farmboy Young Young stopped going to school after he finished 6th grade 

Young began his professional career in 1889 with the Canton Ohio team of the Tri State League a professional minor league The catcher who warmed up Young gave him the nickname Cyclone because of the speed of his fastball Reporters then shortened the name to Cy Cy became the nickname he used the rest of his life

In 1890 Young signed for 500 with the Cleveland Spiders which had moved up from the American Association to the National League the previous year 

Two years later the National League moved the pitchers mound from fifty feet away from the home plate to sixty feet and six inches In the book The NeyerJames Guide to Pitchers sports journalist Rob Neyer wrote that the reason for the move was that pitchers like Cy Young Amos Rusie and Jouett Meekin threw too fast at the shorter distance

On September 18 1897 Young pitched the first no hitter of his career in a game against the Cincinnati Reds Although Young did not walk a batter the Spiders committed four errors while on defense

Before the 1899 season Frank Robison the owner of the Spiders bought the St Louis Browns thus owning two clubs at the same time Just weeks before the start of the season most of the better Spiders players were transferred to St Louis including three future Hall of Famers Young Jesse Burkett and Bobby Wallace Despite the changes in the team members St Louis finished fifth in both 1899 and 1900 The Spiders lost 134 games the most in MLB history before folding 

In 1901 Young left St Louis and joined the American Leagues Boston Americans for a 3500 contract Young stayed with the Boston team until 1909 

Young was traded back to Cleveland before the 1909 season this time to the Cleveland Naps of the American League He split 1911 his final year between the Naps and the Boston Rustlers 

On September 22 1911 Young shut out the Pittsburgh Pirates and their pitcher Babe Adams 1 0 for his last career win However two weeks later Youngs 906th and final game ended badly the last eight batters of Youngs career combined to hit a triple four singles and three doubles

Young retired after the 1911 season with 511 career wins His win total set the record for most career wins by a pitcher At the time Pud Galvin had the second most career wins with 364 Walter Johnson then in his fourth season finished his career with 417 wins and is now second on the list However Johnson broke Youngs career record for strikeouts

Cy Youngs career is seen as a bridge from baseballs earliest days to its modern era When Youngs career began pitchers delivered the baseball underhand and fouls were not counted as strikes The pitchers mound was not moved back to its present position of 60 feet six inches until Youngs fourth season He did not wear a glove until his sixth

Particularly after his fastball slowed Youngs success relied upon his great control Young said

By habit Young restricted his practice throws in spring training I figured the old arm had just so many throws in it said Young and there wasnt any use wasting them Young once described his approach before a game

Young also said that his offseason farming chores including wood chopping kept his pitching arm in good shape until he was 44 Even at the time of his retirement his arm was healthy but Young had gained weight and was unable to field his position anymore In three of his last four years he was the oldest player in the league

The first Cy Young Award was voted on in 1956 and was given to Brooklyns Don Newcombe Originally it was a single award covering the whole of baseball The honor was divided into two Cy Young Awards in 1967 one for each league

Young was saluted in the poem Lineup for Yesterday by Ogden Nash

Y is for Young

The Arabic alphabet is an alphabet that has been used to write the Arabic language Some other languages use a similar writing system examples are Persian and Urdu

There are 28 basic letters All of them are cursive both in handwriting and in print This means that inside a word a letter is usually directly connected to the letter following it Arabic is written from right to left Each letter can have up to 4 different forms Which of the forms is used depends on the letters before and after it The form for uppercase letters and lowercase letters is the same 

The alphabet can also be used to write numbers This was common in the Middle Ages Today it can be found more rarely Usually Latin alphabet numbers are used

Another usage that is rare today is to use the letters of the alphabet to stand for numbers That way the letter alif is 1 b is 2 m is 3 and so on until y 10 kf 20 lm 30  r 200  ayn 1000 This is sometimes used to produce chronograms

The Brandenburg Gate is one of the main symbols of Berlin Germany It is between the Platz des 18 Mrz and the Pariser Platz It is the only remaining gate through which people used to enter Berlin A little to the north is the Reichstag building During the Cold War the Reichstag was in West Berlin and the Brandenburger Tor in East Berlin It was built between 1788 and 1791

The Brandenburg Gate has twelve columns six on the entrance side and six on the exit The columns form five roadways citizens originally were allowed to use only the outer two This is rather like Admiralty Arch in London the central roadway is reserved so that royal and important traffic is not delayed On top of the gate is the Quadriga This is Viktoria the goddess of victory driving a Quadriga a type of horse drawn chariot

After 1806 when Prussia was defeated at the Battle of Jena Auerstedt Napoleon stole the Quadriga and took it to Paris When Napoleon was beaten in 1814 Prussian General Ernst von Pfuel occupied Pais and took the Quadriga back to Berlin the olive wreath was changed to an Iron Cross The Goddess Viktoria became Nike goddess of victory

When the Nazis came to power they used the Gate as their symbol The Gate was damaged but not destroyed during World War II The governments of East Berlin and West Berlin restored it but it was closed when the Berlin Wall was built in 1961 The gate was in the middle of the death strip

In 1963 US President John F Kennedy visited the Brandenburg Gate The Soviets hung large banners across it to prevent him looking into the East In the 1980s West Berlin mayor Richard von Weizscker said quoteThe German question will remain open as long as the Brandenburg Gate is closed

von Weizscker was the President of Germany at the reunification

The Gate then symbolized the freedom to unite the City of Berlin On the 22nd of December 1989 the Brandenburg Gate re opened when Helmut Kohl the West German Chancellor walked through to be greeted by Hans Modrow the East German Prime Minister

On December 21 2000 the Brandenburg Gate was privately refurbished at a cost of 3 million dollar cost

Lake Urmia is a salt lake in northwest of Iran It is in the provinces of East Azarbaijan and West Azarbaijan and is southwest of the close shaped Caspian Sea It is the largest lake inside Iran and the second biggest salt lake of the world It is the largest lake in the Middle East

The location of Lake Urmia is at coor dms37420N451860E It has a surface area of about 5200 km At its biggest extent it is about 140 km long and 55 km wide Its deepest point is approximately 16 m deep It receives water from thirteen rivers coming from the near mountains and it has no output

Lake Urmia lies between West Azarbaijan and East Azarbaijan provinces Tabriz is the biggest city to its east and Urmia is the biggest city to its west The shortest way between these cities is to go round the lake In 1970s a project was started to create a bridge across the lake This project was canceled when Islamic Revolution happened in 1979 However the project was started again in 2000s it is planned to be finished by the end of 2007

The lake has a very salty water The concentration of salt is different in each season of the year it may be 26 28 in the late Autumn

Lake Urmia is getting smaller and smaller each year This is because the rivers which bring water to it have become smaller

This lake was historically named Chaychast Later it was named Urmia by the Assyrian people The word Urmia consists of two parts ur means city and mia means water Urmia was the name given to the city of Urmia which is near this lake The lake was then named Lake Urmia after the name given to the city In the early years of the 20th century it was named Rezaiyeh Lake after the name of Reza Pahlavi the king of Iran After the Islamic Revolution its name was changed back to Urmia Lake

Different creatures live inside or near this lake including some species of shrimps amphibians and birds like flamingos and pelicans

Urmia Lake has shallow borders with lots of mud Different creatures live inside the mud including frogs snails and worms The mud is said to have good effects in treatment of some diseases of the joints

Lake Urmia has 102 islands Their names are as follows refislands

Gnathostomata is the group of vertebrates with jaws

The group was meant to include all jawed fish but in modern fashion it also includes all the tetrapods as well since they evolved from jawed fish It is the sister group of the Agnatha the jawless vertebrates

The Gnathostomata first appeared in the Ordovician period and became diverse in the Devonian period the Age of Fishes Land vertebrates appeared in the Carboniferous period

The Niger River is the main river of western Africa It is over 4180 km long It has a crescent shape and it goes through Guinea Mali Niger on the border with Benin and then through Nigeria Finally it reaches the sea at a large delta called the Niger Delta of the Oil Rivers This part of the Atlantic Ocean is called the Gulf of Guinea The Niger is the third longest river in Africa Only by the Nile and the Congo are longer Its main tributary is the Benue River

No one knows the origin of the name Niger Many people think that it comes from the Latin word for black niger but there is no evidence for this and Portuguese explorers would probably have used their own word on their maps Also the Niger is not a blackwater river

Therefore most people think the name is from the original people of the area in the middle of the river where early European maps used the name Quorra One possibility is the Tuareg phrase gher n gheren river of rivers shortened to ngher or niger from the middle of the river near Timbuktu

The Tabula Peutingeriana says Flumen Girin and Hoc flumen quidam Grin vocant alii Nilum appellant dicint enim sub terra Etyopium in Nilum ire Lacum which means This river which some are naming Grin is called Nile by others and is thought to flow under the ground of Ethiopia into the Nile Lake

Nigeria and Niger take their names from the river The people who live beside the river have many names for it such as Jeliba or Joliba Isa Ber Oya and Kworra or Quorra The last name was the name that Europeans used for the lower part of the river before they knew that the upper and lower parts were connected

The Niger River is quite a clear river It has only 10 as much sediment as the Nile because the Nigers source is in very old rocks that have little silt Like the Nile the Niger River has a flood every year this starts in September becomes strongest in November and finishes by May

An unusual feature of the river is the Niger Inland Delta This forms where the river suddenly becomes less steep This makes a region of connected streams marshes and lakes over an amount of land the same size as Belgium The yearly floods make the delta very good for fishing and farming

The Niger takes an unusual route It is a boomerang shape and this confused Europeans for 2000 years Its source is only 240 km from the Atlantic Ocean but the river flows away from the sea into the Sahara Desert then turns near the ancient city of Timbuktu From here it goes southeast to the Gulf of Guinea

Ancient Romans thought that the river near Timbuktu was part of the Nile River and Ibn Battuta had the same opinion Early 17th century European explorers thought that it flowed west and joined the Sngal River Many local people probably knew the real route but Europeans only knew it in the late 19th century when it was mentioned in the book Travels in the Interior of Africa by the Scottish explorer Mungo Park This unusual route happened because the Niger River is two ancient rivers which are joined together The upper Niger from the source past Timbuktu to the bend in the river used to empty into a lake but the lake has now gone However the lower Niger started in hills near the lake and flowed south into the Gulf of Guinea The Sahara Desert dried up in 4000 1000 BC and the two rivers changed their routes and they joined

The northern part of the river which is called the Niger bend is important because it is the Sahara Deserts closest big river Therefore trade across the west of the Sahara came here and it became the center of the Sahelian kingdoms of Mali and Gao

Pictures of the Niger River in Mali

The flag of Mali has three equal vertical stripes Starting from the flagpole the colours are green gold and red which are the pan African colours

The flag became official on March 1 1961 The original flag became official on April 4 1959 when Mali joined the Mali Federation This flag was the same but the golden stripe had a human stick figure called a kanaga in black with its arms pointing to the sky The figure was removed because of an Islamic belief against making pictures of humans

On 20 October 1973 the coat of arms of the Republic of Mali was made The motto of the Republic of Mali is Un Peuple Un But Une Foi

The coat of arms of the Republic of Mali is a circle There is a light blue background

Pour lAfrique et pour toi is the national song of Mali Seydou Badian Kouyate wrote the words and Banzoumana Sissoko wrote the music It became Malis national song in 1962 and it is a normal song of love of the country It is about how the people of Mali would sacrifice their lives for their nation and for freedom A common theme in the song is wanting to unite Africa The chorus is written below

French Sudan was a colony in French West Africa 

It existed at two separate times The first time was from 1890 to 1899 and the second was from 1920 to 1960 In 1960 it became the independent nation of Mali

It was created as a French territory on September 9 1880 and its name was Upper Senegal 

The name changed to the French Sudan Territory on August 18 1890 and its capital was Kayes On October 10 1899 French Sudan was broken into pieces 11 southern provinces became part of French Guinea Cte dIvoire and Dahomey However two provinces were returned in 1900

In 1902 the parts of the colony which were not organised into military districts became Senegambia and Niger then the name changed to Upper Senegal and Niger in 1904 Finally the old name of French Sudan returned in a reorganisation in 1920

In 1933 Upper Volta stopped existing and French Sudan gained some of its provinces

After the October 4 1958 French vote about the constitution the Rpublique Soudanaise joined the French Community again with the name French Sudan and it gained complete domestic control on 25 November 1958

On April 4 1959 French Sudan was joined with Senegal to form the Mali Federation This became fully independent but still inside the French Community on June 20 1960 This union finished on August 20 1960 when Senegal left On 22 September French Sudan changed its name to the Republic of Mali and left the French Community

Cunnilingus is the act of a man or another woman performing oral sex using the mouth lips teeth and tongue to stimulate the female sex organs The clitoris is the most sensitive part of the female genitalia The term comes from a Latin word for the vulva and from the Latin word for tongue Some women achieve orgasm from clitoral stimulation as part of cunnilingus

Agnatha is a class or superclass of jawless fish in the phylum Chordata subphylum Vertebrata The group excludes all vertebrates with jaws

The agnathans as a whole are paraphyletic This means it is a convenient holdall term which does not follow the rules of cladistics For example most extinct agnathans belong to the stem group of gnathostomes But according to the rules one sister group should not contain ancestors of another sister group

Recent molecular data both from rRNA and from mtDNA strongly supports the theory that living agnathans known as cyclostomes are monophyletic

The oldest fossil agnathans appeared in the Cambrian and two groups still survive today the lampreys and the hagfish with about 100 species in total Hagfish are not members of the subphylum Vertebrata as hagfish do not have vertebrae they are rather classified in the more inclusive group Craniata In addition to the absence of jaws modern agnathans are characterised by absence of paired fins the presence of a notochord both in larvae and adults and seven or more paired gill pouches There is a light sensitive pineal eye All living and most extinct Agnatha do not have an identifiable stomach or any appendages Fertilization and development are both external There is no parental care in the Agnatha class The Agnatha are exothermic with a cartilaginous skeleton and the heart contains 2 chambers

Agnatha have existed since the Cambrian and continue to live in modern times There are two extant group of jawless fish the lampreys and the hagfish with about 100 species between them In addition to the absence of jaws the Agnatha are characterised by absence of paired fins the presence notochord both in larvae and adults and seven or more paired gill pouches The bronchial arches supporting the gill pouches lie close to body surface There is a light sensitive pineal eye There is no identificable stomach The Agnatha are ectothermic with a cartilaginous skeleton and the heart contains 2 chambers

Many Ordovician Silurian and Devonian Agnathans were armored with heavy bony spiky plates The first armored agnathans were the Ostracoderms Not to be confused with the Osteichthyes who were ancestors of the bony fish and hence of tetrapods By the upper Silurian the Agnathans had reached the high point of their evolution Agnathans declined in the Devonian and never recovered

Henry Cavendish was a British scientist He is famous for discovering hydrogen

He measured the Earths mass and density with Cavendish Experiment He studied at Peterhouse which is part of the University of Cambridge but he could not graduate from there

He built a laboratory near London where he worked for nearly fifty years but he only published about 20 scientific papers Even so he is called one of the greatest scientists of his period

Cavendish claimed that the force between the two electrical objects gets smaller as they get further apart If the distance between them doubled the force would be one quarter what it was before This was based on the inverse square law He explained the concept of electric potential which was already known in Math but had been never used in electrical experiments until that day He developed the thought of all points on a goodconductors surface have the same potential energy beside a common reference point Because of no possibility to measure electric current he used his body as a machinewhich measures strength of electric current All Cavendishs explorations in his notebook was found and confirmed by James Clerk Maxwell

In music ornaments are notes which are added to the main notes of a piece of music in order to make it more interesting There are several types of ornaments including trills and slides Music of the Renaissance and Baroque periods have lots of ornaments The composer usually shows what ornaments are needed by little signs written above the notes In some pieces especially in slow movements the composers often did not show the ornaments that are needed they expected the performers to put them in themselves Understanding the correct way of ornamenting music used to be a very important part of the art of singing or playing a musical instrument

The correct way of ornamenting music varied a lot from one country to another and from century to another Ideas about how music should be performed kept changing It is important for musicians today who want to play music from these older periods to know as much as possible about historical musical styles Sometimes we have to make guesses about what a composer might have wanted Fortunately several composers and music theorists wrote books about how to play ornaments This enables us to understand the different performing styles Sometimes composers wrote a preface in their music to explain to the performer how to play the ornaments they had written

There are different kinds of ornaments A grace note is a note written in smaller print to show that its note value does not count as part of the total time value of the measure 

In Spain these ornaments were called diferenzias They were used as early as the 16th century when the first books with music for the guitar were produced In French music they were called agrments

Ornaments were still written in music from the Classical music period although they gradually became used less and less as composers started to write precisely all the notes that were to be played By the Romantic period they were hardly being used except for tr meaning trill

A trill is a quick alternation between the main note and the note above it It was also known as a shake Usually if the music was written before 1800 the trill is played by starting a note above the written note If the music was written after 1800 then the trill is usually played by starting on the note written and going up to the note above This was not of course a firm rule changes in performance style happened gradually 

The mordent is like a very short trill usually just the main note the note above and the main note again If the middle note is the note below this is called an inverted mordent or lower mordent 

The upper mordent is indicated by a short squiggle the lower mordent is the same with a short vertical line through it

As with the trill the exact speed with which the mordent is played will depend on the speed of the piece but at a moderate speed the above might be played like this

A short figure consisting of the note above the one indicated the note itself the note below the one indicated and the note itself again It is marked by a mirrored S shape lying on its side above the staff

The lower added note may or may not be chromatically raised

An inverted turn is usually indicated by putting a short vertical line through the normal turn sign though sometimes the sign itself is turned upside down

An Appoggiatura literally means a leaning note The word comes from the Italian word appoggiare to lean upon It is a note which wants to fall down to the next one which is part of the harmony  Composers often wrote an appoggiatura in small print This usually means it must be played by taking half the time value of the next note for example an appoggiatura in front of a quaver turns both notes into two semiquavers During the 18th century composers stopped writing them in small print and just wrote them as normal notes

An acciaccatura is a note which is played as fast as possible It means a crushed note It is normally written in small print but with a slash through it to show that it is not an appoggiatura Most performers play acciaccaturas exactly on the beat but sometimes it is better to play it just before the beat so that the main note is exactly on time on the beat

The endocrine system includes those organs of the body which produce hormones It helps to regulate metabolism growth and development tissue function and plays a part also in mood The field of medicine that deals with disorders of endocrine glands is endocrinology

In physiology the endocrine system is a system of glands each of which secretes a type of hormone directly into the bloodstream to regulate the body 

The endocrine system is in contrast to the exocrine system which secretes its chemicals using ducts The endocrine system is an information signal system like the nervous system yet its effects and mechanism are different 

The endocrine systems effects are slow to start and long lasting in their response The nervous system sends information quickly and responses are generally short lived Hormones are complex chemicals released from endocrine tissue into the bloodstream where they travel to target tissues and trigger a response 

Features of endocrine glands are in general they have no ducts they have a good blood supply and usually they have vacuoles or granules inside their cells storing their hormones 

A Sponge is a tool that is used for cleaning and washing The sponge is made of a special material with many holes By rubbing the sponge against dirty surfaces the dirt can be removed

Today there are also artificial sponges 

 ImageUrethane sponge1jpgAn artificial sponge made of polyurethane ImageUrethane sponge2jpgClose up of the artificial sponge ImageSchwamm1jpgA natural sponge This is the skeleton of a sponge from the Demosponges 

Most natural sponges used for cleaning today come from the Mediterranean and the Caribbean Today Izmir and Tripolis are the main markets where natural sponges are sold

Sponges have medicinal potential This is because of antimicrobial compounds in either the sponge itself or their microbial symbionts

Bottlenose dolphins have been seen using live sponges This was in Shark Bay Shark bay is in Western Australia The behaviour has only been observed in the bay Most likely adult dolphins teach it to their children The only other marine mammals that use tools are Sea otters

The Semef River and Bafing River meet in Bafoulab and this forms the Sngal River The Semef and Bafing rivers sources are in Guinea The Bafing River flows through Mali and the Semef is the Mali Senegal border

Near the rivers mouth the Sngal goes through Biffeche and there is an island in the river The city of Saint Louis is on this island The river then turns south There is a thin line of sand and this separates the river from the Atlantic Ocean The line of sand is called the Langue de Barbarie After this the river enters the Atlantic Ocean The river has two large dams the Manantali Dam in Mali and the Maka Diama Dam on the Mauritania Senegal border near the sea The Manantali Dam makes a reservoir The Maka Diama Dam stops salt water going deep into the countryside

The Sngal River takes its water from 483181 km of land About 8 000 000 km of water goes along the river every year The Faleme River Karakoro River and Gorgol River join the Sngal River

In 1972 Mali Mauritania and Senegal made the Organisation pour la mise en valeur du fleuve Sngal This organisation manages the land around the river Guinea joined this organisation in 2005

Kokore can be cooked in many ways One way is to cook it similar to Dner with a horizontal skewer The intestine parts are stacked together This sort can be found in street vendors mostly The most popular heating method is charcoal fire which gives it an extra rich flavour After it is cooked it is cut and put in a half or quarter portion of Turkish bread Tomatoes or spices can be added to it

Another way to cook is to cut it after cleaning mixing it with cut tomatoes and green peppers After that it is cooked on a big griddle in large quantities and then it is added hot red pepper and oregano It is constantly mixed and cut by the cooker using two spatulas in his hands during cooking When done the dish is kept warm

Kokore can be served in many ways It is usually served as a sandwich in form of Yarm Ekmek Kokore or eyrek Ekmek Kokore At the same time it could be served without bread on a plate as a normal meal Kokore is usually served with Ayran Beer or Cola 

Ubbe Ert Iwwerks better known as Ub Iwerks was an American animator He is best known for creating Mickey Mouse together with Walt Disney

Ub Iwerks was born in 1901 in Kansas City His father Eert Ubbe was a immigrant from Germany In 1919 he met Walt Disney the first time Some months later Disney founded his first studio Ub Iwerks was his first artist and at this time the only one Iwerks was called the fastest animator of Hollywood because he could drew more than 700 pictures a day In fact he finished the first Mickey Mouse cartoon which was produced in just two weeks

Disney the man with money and Iwerks the man with talent had often differences As a result of this differences Iwerks left Disney in 1930 and founded his own studio It closed in 1936 after that Iwerks worked some months for Columbia Pictures in 1940 he went back to Walt Disney He did not draw anymore but became the head of the Special Processes Department There he invented the Multiplane camera For this camera he was awarded in 1960 with a special Oscar

At the end of his life Ub Iwerks worked for popular directors like Alfred Hitchcock too In 1963 he was nominated for his work on The Birds for a second Oscar

Ub Iwerks died at age 70 in Burbank California His sons Don Iwerks and David Iwerks worked for Disney too Ubs great grandson Michael Iwerks works at Disney also

Endocrine glands are glands that broken wikt linksecretesecrete their product directly into the blood This group contains the glands of the Endocrine system 

The main Endocrine glands include the pituitary gland the pancreas the gonads the thyroid gland and the adrenal glands Other organs which are not so well known for their endocrine activity include the stomach which produces such hormones as ghrelin

The thyroid is one of the largest endocrine glands in the body This gland is found in the neck below the mouth The thyroid controls how quickly the body burns energy makes proteins and how sensitive the body should be to other hormones

Never Mind the Bollocks Heres the Sex Pistols is an album by English punk band the Sex Pistols It was released on 28 October 1977 in the UK and 10 November 1977 in the USA

Johann Christian Bach was a composer of the Classical period He was the eleventh and youngest son of the great composer Johann Sebastian Bach He is often called the London Bach or the English Bach because he spent many years living in London He became internationally famous both as a composer and as a performer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart liked his music and learned a lot about how to write good concertos by looking at the concertos of J C Bach

Johann Christian Bachs parents were Johann Sebastian Bach and Anna Magdalena Bach He was born in Leipzig Germany His famous father was one of the last composers of the Baroque period His father was already 50 when J C Bach was born so it is not surprising that by the time Johann Christian had grown up the style of music had changed a lot since Johann Sebastian had been writing his great works Johann Christian belonged to the Classical period He was 15 when his father died He moved to Berlin and his half brother Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach who was already a famous composer gave him more music lessons

Johann Christian lived in Italy for many years from 1756 first studying counterpoint with Padre Martini in Bologna and later with Giovanni Battista Sammartini He became an organist at the cathedral in Milan in 1760 However he soon started to become successful as an opera composer and he left his cathedral job so that he could work in the theatre and travel more in Italy

Johann Christian had been brought up in the Lutheran church but in Italy he became a Catholic He married the Italian soprano Cecilia Grassi She was about eight years older than Johann Christian and perhaps because of this they never had children

In 1762 he moved to London He was very successful there and earned plenty of money to live comfortably He knew the royal family and many important aristocratic people as well as famous people such as the painter Gainsborough and the musician and writer Charles Burney King George III and Queen Charlotte went to hear his first London opera Orione in 1763 He gave the Queen music lessons

He lived at a time when the piano was becoming a popular instrument and the harpsichord was becoming old fashioned J C Bach wrote a lot of music for the piano and gave the very first concert of piano music in London in 1768 He wrote 6 keyboard concertos and dedicated them to the Queen The last movement of Concerto no 6 was a set of variations on God Save the King This became a very popular piece of music at the time He wrote many songs that became popular in his time They were often performed in Vauxhall Gardens a park where many people went to be entertained

He gave many concerts together with Carl Friedrich Abel a well known player of the viola da gamba Abel and Bach may have known one another as children because both their fathers had worked together in Cthen in Germany In April 1764 J C Bach met the 8 year old Mozart who visited London with his father Leopold They played duets on the harpsichord together

He composed cantatas chamber music keyboard and orchestral works operas symphonies and songs He had many works published in London and Paris

During his last years he lost a lot of money The Bach Abel concert series lost money and one of Bachs servants stole 1000 from him which was a very large sum on those days His health started to become bad and when he died he left his wife with a lot of debt Queen Charlotte helped to pay a lot of the debt and his widow went back to Italy

He was buried in St Pancras churchyard London

Pelycosaur were the earliest synapsids They were not dinosaurs or reptiles 

These tetrapods appeared during the Pennsylvanian and went extinct during the Permian period 

They were the dominant land animals for some 40 million years and were almost wiped out by the PTr extinction event A few survived until the lower Triassic to form the therapsids a group which led to the mammals

Pelycosaur fossils have been found mainly in Europe and North America although some small late surviving forms are known from Russia and South Africa

At least two pelycosaur clades independently evolved a tall sail consisting of elongated vertebral spines the edaphosaurids and the sphenacodontids In life this would have been covered by skin and possibly functioned as a thermoregulatory device andor a mating display 

Unlike lepidosaurian reptiles pelycosaurs lacked epidermal scales Fossil evidence from some ophiacodonts shows that parts of the skin was naked but that the belly was covered in dermal scutes These scutes looked like the scutes present in reptile groups but they are of a different type of structure 

In 1940 the group was reviewed in detail and every species known at the time described in an important monograph

Well known pelycosaurs include the genera Dimetrodon Sphenacodon Edaphosaurus and Ophiacodon

Therapsids previously known as the mammal like reptiles are an order of Synapsids 

The clade includes the mammals which are descended from the cynodont therapsids

The jaws of therapsids had frontal incisors for nipping large lateral canines for puncturing and tearing and molars for shearing and tearing and molars for shearing and chopping food 

Therapsid legs were positioned more vertically beneath their bodies than were the sprawling legs of Sauropsids and Pelycosaurs

The therapsids were seriously affected by the PTr extinction event The successful gorgonopsians died out and the remaining groups were much reduced 

The dicynodonts now represented by a single family of large stocky herbivores the Kannemeyeridae and the medium sized cynodonts flourished worldwide throughout the early to middle Triassic They died out across much of Pangea before the end of the Upper Triassic although they continued for some time longer in the wet equatorial band and the south

At least three groups of eucynodonts survived They appeared in the Upper Triassic The extremely mammal like family the Tritylodonts survived into the Lower Cretaceous Another group Morganucodon and similar animals were mammaliformes or the stem mammals for the mammals

Toccata is the title that was often given to pieces of music for solo instruments from the Renaissance onwards The word comes from the Italian for to touch also meaning to play a musical instrument These pieces were often quite difficult with a lot of fast notes which showed off how well the person could play

The first toccatas were written in northern Italy by composers such as Claudio Monteverdi and Giovanni Gabrieli They are pieces for the keyboard with lots of running scales in the right hand and accompanying chords in the left hand 

Toccatas became popular in Germany with composers such as Hans Leo Hassler who had studied in Venice with Gabrieli Many German Baroque organ composers wrote toccatas Sweelinck Pachelbel Buxtehude and Johann Sebastian Bach Bachs Toccata and Fugue in d minor is one of the most famous pieces of Baroque organ music and perhaps the most famous toccata ever writen

After the Baroque period composers did not often write toccatas The toccata became popular again in the late 19th century with the French organ composers such as Charles Marie Widor whose Toccata from his Symphony No 5 is very popular today especially at weddings It has lots of quick notes in the right hand and a big tune in the pedals Another famous organ toccata is by Louis Vierne It is the last movement of his Symphony No 1

In the 20th century several composers wrote toccatas for piano including Prokofiev Khachaturian Ravel and Claude Debussy

Internal medicine is the branch and specialty of medicine concerning the diagnosis and nonsurgical treatment of diseases in adults especially of internal organs

Doctors of internal medicine also called internists are required to have included in their medical schooling and postgraduate training at least three years dedicated to learning how to prevent diagnose and treat diseases that affect adults 

Internists are trained to solve puzzling diagnostic problems and handle severe chronic illnesses and situations where several different illnesses may strike at the same time 

Internists can choose to focus their practice on general internal medicine or may take additional training to subspecialize in one of 13 areas of internal medicine generally organized by organ system Cardiologists for example are doctors of internal medicine who subspecialize in diseases of the heart The training an internist receives to subspecialize in a particular medical area is both broad and deep Subspecialty training usually requires an additional one to three years beyond the standard three year general internal medicine residency

In the United States there are two organizations responsible for certification of subspecialists within the field the American Board of Internal Medicine and the American Osteopathic Board of Internal Medicine 

The following are the subspecialties recognized by the American Board of Internal Medicine

The ABIM also recognizes additional qualifications in the following areas

Internists may also specialize in allergy and immunology The American Board of Allergy Asthma and Immunology is a conjoint board between internal medicine and pediatrics 

The American College of Osteopathic Internists recognizes the following subspecialties

City status in the United Kingdom is granted by the British monarch to some communities

Becoming a city is not automatic but many people think that any town that has a cathedral is a city  This is because Henry VIII built cathedrals in six English towns and also granted made them cities by letters patent

A city council does not have any more powers than a borough or district council Some city councils are only parish councils so have very little powers at all

Officially there are 66 cities in the United Kingdom Sunderland was made a city to mark Elizabeth IIs Ruby anniversary Eight others have been created in competitions to celebrate the new millennium and Queen Elizabeth IIs Golden Jubilee 

A city does not automatically have a Lord Mayor or Lord Provost in Scotland There are 66 cities in the UK but only 30 Lord Mayors

Of the 66 cities in the UK 

Rochester was a city from 1211 to 1998

On April 1 1974 the city council was abolished and new letters patent were issued to the new Medway Borough Council to carry on the city name in the old city area 

In 1979 Medway was renamed Rochester upon Medway and new letters patent made the whole of the new area a city

On April 1 1998 Rochester upon Medway and Gillingham joined together to became the new unitary authority of Medway Rochester upon Medway City Council did not appoint appoint Charter Trustees to maintain the existence of the city and the mayoralty so the city simply ceased to exist because the council forgot

The P 38 Lightning is a World War II fighter aircraft made by Lockheed It was mainly used by the United States Air Force It first flew in 1939 It was different from other fighters because it had two engines instead of one and was twice the size of other fighters The plane fought in the Pacific and in Europe It could carry 4 machine guns and a cannon By 1944 it was replaced by the faster P 51 Mustang in Europe The P 38 was the only American fighter being built at the beginning and the end of the war

The Bf 109 was a fighter aircraft made by Messerschmitt It first flew in 1935 and was mainly used by the Luftwaffe during the World War II It is the most made fighter airplane in history It was used in Germany

The Me 262 was a German fighter aircraft flown during late World War II It was the first jet to be used in war It began test flights in 1942 but was not used in combat by the German air force the Luftwaffe until 1945 Very few were built because Germanys enemies were bombing factories It saw little action because the war was nearly over The jet engines of the new machine often made problems thats why a lot of machines had deathly accidents

Osmosis is the movement of water through a plasma membrane from a region of low salt concentration to a region of high concentration It is a type of diffusion Osmosis is passive transport meaning it does not require energy to be applied What causes osmotic pressure is different concentrations of salt ions on the two sides of the membrane 

When osmosis happens water moves from the side of the membrane with a lower amount of osmotic pressure to the side of the membrane with the higher amount An important example of osmosis is the movement of liquid molecules across a cell membrane into a cell with a higher solute concentration Osmosis is a fundamental part of cell biochemistry but also has mechanical applications and usages

Hypotonic describes the less concentrated solution An isotonic solution is when the concentration is equal both sides of the membrane Hypertonic describes the more concentrated solution The usual cell biology situation is hypotonic solution outside the cell and hypertonic solution inside

The plasma membrane of a cell is semi permeable which means it lets small molecules pass through but blocks larger molecules However the membrane has special gateways which allow certain kinds of macromolecules to get though This is not passive transport but requires energy and is selective

The MiG 17 Fresco is a fighter aircraft made by Mikoyan a Russian company It first flew in 1950 and was supposed to replace the MiG 15 in the Korean War but it did not arrive fast enough It was used by the North Vietnamese in the Vietnam War It carried 3 guns on it and later versions carried missiles Today it is used as a trainer in other air forces

Mikoyan is a Russian company that designs fighter airplanes The company was first formed in December 1939 as a design office called Mikoyan Gurevich or MiG this was because its designers were Artem Mikoyan and Mikhail Gurevich Mikoyan will join other Russian airplane companies in a new compnay called United Aircraft Corporation

In 1939 Russia was part of the Soviet Union and was communist In the Soviet communist system there were two types of airplane companies companies that designed aircraft known as design offices or OKB and companies that made airplanes called zavods Artem Mikoyan and Mikhail Gurevich had been designers in another design office helping a designer called Nikolai Polikarpov One airplane design that Artem Mikoyan and Mikhail Gurevich worked on at Polikarpov was called the I 200 When Nikolai Polikarpov lost the trust of the Soviet leader Stalin Artem Mikoyan and Mikhail Gurevich were given the I 200 design to finish This airplane was given a new name and was called the Mikoyan Gurevich MiG 1 As it was being made ways to make the MiG 1 into a better airplane were found and airplanes with these changes became known as the MiG 3 and later the MiG 7 However even with changes the MiG fighter airplanes were not as good as the fighter airplanes designed by the design offices of Lavochkin or Yakovlev

After World War II Mikoyan Gurevich designed jet aircraft In the Soviet system the airplane designs of the design offices would compete to see which was the best When the best design had been found the design would be built by the second type of airplane company Even though Mikoyan Gurevich airplanes in World War II had not been as good as airplanes by Lavochkin or Yakovlev Mikoyan Gurevich jet aircraft won more of the competitions to be sent to the zavods and in the time of the Cold War Mikoyan Gurevich together with another design office called Sukhoi became one of the two most important design offices of fighter planes in the Soviet Union

In the Soviet system decisions were made to protect the government from its own soldiers In many countries there is only one airforce the Soviet Union had five airforces Two of these airforces were the main users of Soviet fighter airplanes One airforce was called PVO Strany this airforce was used to defend the cities and land of the Soviet Union One airforce was called Frontal Aviation this airforce was used to defend the Soviet Unions ground soldiers against enemy fighter airplanes and to attack enemy ground forces Mikoyan Gurevich became the main designer of aircraft for Frontal Aviation

Mikoyan has designed the following airplanes

Juno could mean

Neptune is the god of the sea in Roman mythology He was a relative of Ceres He is similar but not identical to the god Poseidon of Greek mythology The Roman conception of Neptune in influenced by the Etruscan god Nethuns very much

Neptune was associated as well with fresh water Oceanus was the god of the world ocean 

Like Poseidon Neptune was also worshipped by the Romans as a horse god under the name Neptune Equester patron of horse racing

Fortuna can mean

Sol Invictus or more fully Deus Sol Invictus was a religious title applied to at least three distinct deities during the later Roman Empire El Gabal Mithras and Sol

The earlier cult of Sol Indiges was agrarian The title Deus Sol Invictus was formed similar to the imperial titulature pius felix invictus

The Romans held a festival on December 25 called Dies Natalis Solis Invicti the birthday of the unconquered sun The use of the title Sol Invictus allowed several solar deities to be worshipped together including Elah Gabal a Syrian sun god Sol the patron god of Emperor Aurelian and Mithras a soldiers god of Persian origin Emperor Elagabalus introduced the festival and it reached the height of its popularity under Aurelian who promoted it as an empire wide holiday

Lares were ancient Roman deities who protected the house and the family  household gods See also Genius Larvae Di Penates Manes

Lares are presumed sons of Mercury and Lara and deeply venerated by ancient Romans through small statues usually put in higher places of the house far from the floor or even on the roof  In the early Roman times in every house there was at least one little statue Later a sort of confusion connected their figure with those of Manes deities of Hades Finally the confusion included the Penates as well 

Turan the Etruscan love goddess

Charter Trustees are the English district councillors for an area that used to be a city

They are allowed by the Charter Trustees Act 1985 so that some of the privileges and dignities of former city can be carried on

In Roman mythology Quirinus was an early god of the Roman state In Augustan Rome Quirinus was also a name of Janus as Janus Quirinus

Quirinus was originally most likely a Sabine god The Sabines had a settlement near the site of what was to become Rome and erected an altar to Quirinus on the Collis Quirinalis the Quirinal Hill one of the Seven Hills of Rome When the Romans settled there they absorbed the cult of Quirinus into their early belief system previous to direct Greek influence and he was said to be the deified Romulus 

In later times however Quirinus became far less important losing his place to 

The name kreisfreie Stadt is used for German towns that have their own government This town government is independent of the government of the next higher level of authority the Landkreis Today most of the cities that have this statute are big cities with 100000 people living there or more The concept grew historically That means that are big cities with more than 100000 people that do not have the statute There are also some cities who have only taken a part of the responsibilities of a Landkreis The smallest city with the statute is Zweibrcken About 35000 people live there The biggest of these cities is Munich with about 13 million people Hamburg and Berlin are bigger They are city states though The city state of Bremen is made of two kreisfreie Stdte the city of Bremen and the city of Bremerhaven about 60 km to the north About half a million people live in Bremen about 117000 people live in Bremerhaven

But not every big city with more than 100000 inhabitants is a kreisfreie Stadt Some of them for example Recklinghausen or Gttingen are part of a Landkreis

There are very few cities who only took part of the paperwork from the Landkreis Some of these are called Groe selbstndige Stadt They only seem to exist in Lower Saxony They are Celle Cuxhaven Goslar Hameln Hildesheim Lingen and Lneburg Things like hunting permits cannot be delegated to the cities Other things like what to do with the trash have sometimes been delegated

Similar concepts to that of the kreisfreie Stadt are Unitary authorities in the United Kingdom or that of independent city in the United States

Jet aircraft are aircraft with jet engines Unlike propeller powered aircraft jet aircraft normally fly at altitudes as high as 10000 to 15000 meters about 33000 to convert49000ftm 2 At these altitudes jet engines can achieve maximum efficiency over long distances  The engines in propeller powered aircraft achieve their maximum efficiency at much lower altitudes

Jets come in different sizes the biggest are used by airlines to move people and things while the smallest are called Fighters and are used in war like 2nd world war An example of each is the Boeing 747 and the F 22 Raptor

The Egypt Israel Peace Treaty was an innovative document saying that Egypt and Israel were friends It was the first treaty with Israel from a Middle Eastern Arabic nation After signing it Egypt was removed from the Arab League

Downtown is a word used in North America which refers to the main part of a city It is where most commercial areas are For example downtown Detroit Michigan is where most people would visit

Uptown refers to a wealthy area of a city

IEEE 80211 is the name for a series of protocols for wireless networking Often these are referred to as Wireless LAN WLAN or Wi Fi Such a protocol allows computers that are equipped with special cards to talk with each other without a cable

The first of these standards was made in 1997 It is called IEEE 80211 It allows communication with 1 2 MBit per second Today it is outdated and hardly used any more

Newer standards have a bandwidth of 54 MBits About 40 50 of this is usable in real life situations As of 2007 the standards most widely used are IEEE 80211g and IEEE 80211b They are compatible with each other

Currentlystandards exist and are labelled IEEE 8021180211a to IEEE 80211g hijnp and s are also there or are planned

Data communication is either done in the 24 GHz band or in the 5 GHz band The 24 GHz band is a general use band Microwave ovens and Bluetooth are examples of other things that emit radio waves in this band There are three usable channels there This means there is a maximum of 3 network in the same place The 5 GHz band can solve some of these problems but it introduces others That way there are 19 usable channels Overall the band is less used However there are more regulations Most devices need to be able to do Dynamic Frequency Selection Some channels require that those participating can do Transmitter Power Control Transmitter Power Control is a mechanism to adapt the strength of the signal to what is actually needed This also helps reduce the amount of interference between different networks

In computing Wireless LAN or Wireless Local Area Network is a term to refer to a Local Area Network that does not need cables to connect the different devices Instead radio waves are used to communicate Technologies that can be used to do that include IEEE 80211 and Bluetooth

Today most technologies used for WLANs use Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing This means that several frequencies are used at the same time Signals that are close to each other but that belong to different channels do not disturb each other as they use different coding schemes Depending on the material used it is possible to cover between 30 metres and 100 metres indoors outoors the range is about 100 300m if there are no obstacles 

Bluetooth is a protocol for wireless communication Devices such as mobile phones laptops PCs printers digital cameras and video game console can connect to each other and exchange information This is done using radio waves It can be done securely Originally Bluetooth was developed to reduce the number of cables needed to connect such devices to a PC Bluetooth is only used for relatively short distances like a few metres

There are different standards Data rates vary Currently they are at 1 3 MBit per second Typical bluetooth applications are to connect a headset to a mobile phone or to connect a computer mouse keyboard or printer

Bluetooth devices use the ISM Band around 24 GHz This can be used worldwide without the need to pay license fees but many other devices like DECT telephones smart tags with RFID baby phones use it too Bluetooth uses the same bands as some WLANs but the modulation technique is different Bluetooth uses Frequency hopping spread spectrum

There are many situations today where either Bluetooth or Wireless LANs can be used Examples include setting up networks printing or transferring files and data from a PDA to a computer Both are versions of unlicensed wireless technology WLANs can span bigger distances and offer higher throughput Bluetooth does not require expensive hardware It also needs less power to operate

Both use the same frequency range but their modulation techniques are different Both have been developed to replace cabling Bluetooth wanted to get rid of the printer cable WLANs wanted to get rid of the cables needed to set up a LAN

Bluetooth exists in many products such as telephones the Wii or PlayStation 3 It has recently been built into some high definition watches modems and headsets The technology is useful when transferring information between two or more devices that are near each other in low bandwidth situations Bluetooth is commonly used to transfer sound data with telephones or byte data with hand held computers

Bluetooth uses protocols that make it easy to discover devices that are nearby and to set up a connection between these devices Bluetooth devices can advertise all the services they offer Using services becomes easier a lot of the setup related to security networking or permissions is automatic

WLANs are more like traditional LANs More configuration is needed to setup the network and to make resources accessible by other devices in the network WLAN devices also consume more power than Bluetooth ones Sometimes WLANs are called wireless Ethernet WLAN needs more resources to be set up but it also offers faster transfer speeds The security is also better than that offered by Bluetooth

Noraduz is a site in the region of Gegharkunik in Armenia near Lake Sevan It was formed a church dedicated to Sainte mre de Dieu and an exceptional site of medieval tombs The tombstones are called Khachkars Noraduz is the most important place for Khachkars in Armenia

The hominids are members of the biological family Hominidae which includes humans chimpanzees gorillas and orangutans Great ape is a common name rather than a taxonomic label and there are differences in usage Subtly it may seem to exclude human beings or to include them Homo sapiens is not at any especial remove from other members of the biological family and humans are therefore described here as great apes

This constituted the Hominidae includes 4 genera and 5 species Its nonhuman members are restricted to equatorial Africa Sumatra and Borneo Hominid fossils date the Miocene and are known from Asia

Hominids range in weight from 48 kg to 270 kg Males are larger than females Hominids are the primates with robust bodies and well developed forearms Their pollex and hallux are opposa except in humans who have lost opposability of the big toe All digits have flattened nails No hominid has a tail and none has ischial callosties Numerous skeletal differences between hominids and other primates are related to their upright or semi upright stance

The classification also includes the ancestors of the currently living species

The Canadian Hurricane Centre is a Canadian agency that is responsible for monitoring and tracking tropical cyclones that come near or affects Canadian territory The agency warns people about on coming tropical cyclones and makes hurricane advisories when needed Its headquarters are located in Dartmouth Nova Scotia

CHC usually works together with its United States counterpart the National Hurricane Center in Miami to coordinate the tracks and positions of all storms that show a possible threat to Canada

While Atlantic hurricanes are normally uncommon in Canada they do approach or strike from time to time Among recent events are Hurricane Bob which struck New Brunswick in 1991 Hurricane Luis which struck Newfoundland in September 1995 Hurricane Hortense which struck Nova Scotia in September 1996 Hurricane Michael which struck Newfoundland in October 2000 and Hurricane Juan which struck Nova Scotia in September 2003

V type asteroids or Vestoids are asteroids that are similar to 4 Vesta by far the largest asteroid in this class

Vulcans are a humanoid species in the fictional Star Trek universe who hail from the planet Vulcan and are noted for their attempt to live by reason and logic with no interference from emotion They were the first extraterrestrial species encountered by Humans and later became one of the founding members of the United Federation of Planets Vulcans are featured in all six Star Trek series four of which featured a Vulcan as a main character

The W M Keck Observatory is a pair of two large ground based telescopes located at Mauna Kea Hawaii Sitting more than two miles above sea level the paired telescopes are used to examine light from distant stars in great detail The primary mirrors of each of the two telescopes are 10 meters across making them the second largest optical telescopes in the world the Gran Telescopio Canarias is slightly larger

The HED meteorites are a grouping of achondrite meteorite types the

These are all thought to have originated from the crust of the asteroid 4 Vesta their differences being due to different geologic histories of the parent rock Their crystallization ages have been determined to be between 443 and 455 billion years from radioisotope ratios

A metamorphic rock is a type of rock which has been changed by extreme heat and pressure Its name is derived from the word morph meaning change 

There is always more pressure and higher temperature under the Earths surface In the root of a mountain chain or near a volcano these forces will be enough to change shape of the strata and the minerals it is made of Sedimentary rock which has been near such forces often looks as if a giant had twisted it and heated it over a fire Examples of metamorphic rock

The recrystallisation of minerals after heating generally causes the destruction of any fossils the rocks might have contained 

Extrusive means to the mode of igneous volcanic rock formation in which hot magma from inside the Earth flows out onto the surface as lava or explodes violently into the atmosphere to fall back as pyroclastics or tuff This is opposed to intrusive rock formation in which magma does not reach the surface

Extruded when talking about an artificial material like soft metals like aluminium plastic or glass means that it is pushed out of a nozzle when the material is in a soft state The shape of the nozzle will vary depending on the shape required in the finished product

In geology an intrusion is a body of igneous rock that has crystallized from molten magma below the surface of the Earth Bodies of magma that solidify underground before they reach the surface of the earth are called plutons named for Pluto the Roman god of the underworld Correspondingly rocks of this kind are also referred to as igneous plutonic rocks or igneous intrusive rocks This is to be contrasted with extrusive rocks

Radiation pressure is the pressure exerted upon any surface exposed to electromagnetic radiation If absorbed the pressure is the energy flux density divided by the speed of light If the radiation is totally reflected the radiation pressure is doubled This happens because the waves that make up electromagnetic radiation carry momentum with them and pass that momentum on when they reach a surface

For example the radiation of the Sun at the Earth has an energy flux density of 1370 Wm2 so the radiation pressure is 46 Pa

Kirkwood gaps are gaps or dips in the asteroid belt with semi major axis as seen in the histogram on the right They correspond to the location of orbital resonances with Jupiter

Ca Al rich inclusions are centimeter sized light coloured calcium and aluminium rich inclusions found in carbonaceous chondrites CAIs contains high temperature minerals and are among the first solids which solidified from the cooling protoplanetary disk CAIs were formed at much higher temperatures than the associated chondrules and may have survived many high temperature events whereas most chondrules are the product of a single transient melting event

The isotopic anomalies of CAIs give valuable clues about the solar systems formation suggesting that the solar nebula collapsed shortly after a nearby supernova Radiometric dating shows that the CAIs formed about 2 million years before the chondrules formed

Eucrites are achondritic stony meteorites that originate from the surface of the asteroid 4 Vesta and as such are part of the HED meteorite group They are the most common achondrite group with well over 100 distinct finds at present

Eucrites consist of basaltic rock from the crust of 4 Vesta They are mostly made up of Ca poor pyroxene pigeonite and Ca rich plagioclase

Eucrites are named from a Greek word meaning easily distinguished

Comet 81PWild also known as Wild 2 is a comet named after Swiss astronomer Paul Wild who discovered it in 1978

It is believed that for most of its 45 billion year lifetime Wild 2 had a more distant and circular orbit In 1974 it passed within only about one million kilometers of the planet Jupiter whose strong gravitational pull altered the comets orbit and brought it into the inner solar system Its orbital period changed from 40 years to about 6 years and its perihelion is now about 159 AU

A barrel is a part of a gun It is a long metal tube that the bullet goes through after it is fired Guns can have many different sizes of barrels Usually longer barrels mean that the bullet will hit the target more often Barrels usually have spiral grooves on the inside of them called rifling Barrels with the grooves spin the bullet around fast as it exits so the bullet is even more stable and likely to hit the target

A shell is a type of projectile used in weapons It is filled with explosive or other substances Shells are usually large caliber projectiles fired by artillery armored fighting vehicles and warships

A pistol is a type of gun that is small and can be used with only one hand Many pistols are used for defending yourself They are usually smaller and lighter than most guns like rifles which makes them useful for hiding and carrying around They also have shorter barrels

Pistols usually only fire one shot every time you pull the trigger Some special pistols called machine pistols can fire more than one at a time Some famous pistols are the Colt M1911 and the Beretta 92 

Pistols were not commonly used in the western United States during the 1800s The first commercially successful pistol was the Borchardt C 93 Designed in 1893 and became available in 1894

A submachine gun is a type of gun that shoots many bullets usually pistol bullets when one holds down the trigger A submachine gun is smaller than a machine gun and can easily be carried by one person They are often used where people need to defend themselves in small areas or people need to fire many bullets quickly The first submachine guns were invented in the early 1900s They are often used by the police

In the early 20th century experiments were made by converting pistols from semi to fully automatic firearms Stocked automatic weapons firing pistol rounds were developed around the same time during World War I by Italy Germany and the United States The first dedicated designs were developed in the latter stages of World War I both as improvements on earlier stocked pistols and to offer an advantage in trench warfare

They were popularized in the 1920s and 30s as weapon of choice of American gangsters and police in the form of the famous Thompson submachine gun commonly referred to as the Tommy Gun Submachine guns rose to prominence as a frontline close quarters combat weapon and commando firearm during World War II They are now widely used by police SWAT military commando paramilitary and counter terror team members for a variety of situations Submachine guns are highly effective in close quarters their lower powered pistol cartridges make them generally more controllable in fully automatic fire compared to assault rifles while their small size and light weight grant maneuverability However pistol cartridges generally have low effectiveness against targets protected by body armor or cover and are short ranged compared to intermediate and rifle cartridges

The Deutsche Reichspartei was a nationalist political party in West Germany It was a merger of the German Conservative Party  Deutsche Right Party and the old Hessian Nationaldemokratischen Partei

Some of the DRPs founders were Alexander Andrae Oskar Lutz Hans Bernd von Grnberg Wilhelm Meinberg Otto He Hans Schikora Heinrich Kunstmann Adolf von Thadden

In 1949 the Sozialistische Reichspartei split away from the DRP This was because the Empire Party was not neo Nazi and did not want to be associated with Adolf Hitler Instead the party preferred to say how good the Second German Empire was 

The Deutsche Reichspartei did become more national socialist after 1952 This is when the Sozialistische Reichspartei was banned by the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany and a lot of its members re joined the Empire Party

The party was not very successful in the 1950s but seemed to be getting more popular after the state elections of 1959 But the success did not last and the party held its final conference in 1964 when it was dissolved It was quickly replaced by the new Nationaldemokratische Partei Deutschlands

Evening Prayer in the Anglican Church is the traditional service when people come to church to worship in the late afternoon or early evening In cathedrals in Britain and in some of the old university chapels it is a service that is sung by a choir nearly every day of the week In cathedrals it is usually just the choir and the priests who sing while the congregation listen There is sometimes one hymn at the end in which the congregation can join in Evensong in churches will have more singing for the congregation to join in

The form of Evensong used today was developed by Thomas Cranmer in the 16th century There were two kinds of services called vespers and compline that used to be sung every day by monks in monasteries Cranmer took some of the words that were used in both these services and made todays form of Evening Prayer

The main idea in Evensong is the celebration of the incarnation of Christ this is the story about Christ coming to the world in the form of a person and living among people The words of the Magnificat and the Nunc Dimittis are always used in the service The Magnificat is the song that Mary sang when she was told that she was going to have a baby who would be Gods son The Nunc Dimittis is the song that was sung by the priest Simeon who had been promised by God that he would live long enough to see Jesus Both these sets of words are from the New Testament

Many churches now use the words from Common Worship or some other modern prayer book for their services However when Evensong is sung by a choir the words used are usually from the old traditional Book of Common Prayer This is because for more than four centuries so much great music has been composed that uses these words

Because there is no communion at evensong the service can be led by a layperson

An evensong service will consist of the following

The organist usually plays some organ music before and after the service On Sundays there may be a sermon

In churches the Magnificat and the Nunc dimittis like the psalm are often sung to a chant This is a tune which repeats itself for every verse or every two verses and is sung to the natural rhythm in which it would be spoken In cathedrals or in churches with a good choir the two canticles are sung to special music composed by some well known composer There is usually an organ accompaniment 

Many composers especially Anglican church composers wrote settings for these two canticles Such composers include Edward Bairstow Herbert Brewer Orlando Gibbons Herbert Howells Henry Purcell Charles Stanford Herbert Sumsion Thomas Tallis Thomas Weelkes Samuel Wesley and many others Some of the composers wrote several settings This is why different settings are often identified by the key they are in eg Stanford in G Stanford in C etc Sometimes they can be identified by the cathedral for which they were written Herbert Howells for example wrote Mag and Nunc settings for several cathedrals and chapels These can be identified by calling them Howells Gloucester Service Collegium Regale etc

In a sung evensong the choir will also sing an introit which is a very short piece at the beginning of the service They will sing a psalm to a chant and there will also be an anthem

The Nutcracker is a fairy tale ballet by the Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky It was composed in 1891 1892 and based on a story written in 1816 by E T A Hoffmann called The Nutcracker and the Mouse King Tchaikovsky put some of the best music from the ballet together to make a suite for orchestra This selection of music called the The Nutcracker Suite has some of the best known tunes in classical music

Until the 1960s the full ballet was not often performed People just knew the music from the suite In the 1940s it was made particularly popular when it was used by Walt Disney in the animated film Fantasia Today the whole ballet is very popular indeed and often performed at Christmas time

In this ballet Tchaikovsky used an instrument called the celeste It was a new instrument that looked like a piano but sounded like bells Tchaikovsky heard one in Paris He used it first in a symphonic poem called The Voyevoda and then in The Nutcracker where it plays in the Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy together with the bass clarinet

The story is about a German girl called Clara Stahlbaum

Before the dancing starts we hear an orchestral introduction Only the high instruments play violins violas woodwind horns and triangle

When the curtain opens we see the house of the Stahlbaum family The family are having a Christmas Eve party The childrens godfather Herr Drosselmeyer comes in with presents for everyone including Claras brother Fritz Clara is still waiting for her present Herr Drosselmeyer then produces three life size dolls who each take a turn to dance Clara has still not had a present and starts to cry

Drosselmeyer then conjures up a toy Nutcracker that looks like a soldier Clara loves it Her brother Fritz is jealous and breaks it Drosselmeyer chases him off and mends the toy

The party ends and the Stahlbaum family go to bed but Clara is worried about her Nutcracker In the night she comes out to the Christmas tree to see it She falls asleep under the tree with the Nutcracker in her arms When the clock strikes midnight Clara hears the sound of mice She wakes up and tries to run away but the mice stop her Is this really happening or is it a dream The Christmas tree suddenly begins to grow to enormous size filling the room The Nutcracker comes to life he and his band of soldiers rise to defend Clara and the Mouse King leads his mice into battle

There is a fight and when Clara helps the Nutcracker by throwing her slipper at the Mouse King the Nutcracker stabs him The mouse dies The mice die as well and the soldiers dispose of them The Nutcracker then changes into a prince

Clara and the Prince travel to a world where dancing Snow Flakes greet them and fairies and queens dance welcoming Clara and the Prince into their world

Clara and the Prince arrive in the Land of the Sugar Plum Fairy The Sugar Plum Fairy and the people of the Land of Sweets dance for Clara and the Prince in the dances of Dew Drop Fairy the Spanish dancers the Chinese dancers the Arabian dancers the Russian dancers Mother Ginger and her Polichinelles the Reed Flutes the Sugar Plum Fairy and the Waltz of the Flowers The dances in the Land of the Sugar Plum Fairy are not always performed in this order These are the dances which are heard in the orchestral suite

After the feast Clara wakes up under the Christmas tree with the Nutcracker toy in her arms and the curtain closes It had all been a dream

In some productions the producer makes the end look as if it was not really a dream but had actually happened

Tchaikovsky was not well when he composed The Nutcracker He was nearly at the end of his life He wrote the music for the suite while he was working at the ballet because he urgently needed some music for an orchestral concert Then he worked hard at finishing the ballet When he had finished it he was exhausted He stopped all work and went to the zoo every day to relax He died the next year

Lady Katherine Grey was the sister to Lady Jane Grey and Lady Mary Grey Her mother was Lady Frances Brandon and Henry Grey who were Marquess and Marchioness of Dorset and later Duke and Duchess of Suffolk 

Katherine was born in 1540 to Lady Frances Brandon and Henry Grey Her parents were disappointed that she was a girl However Frances treated Katherine better than she treated her sister Lady Jane Grey Little is known about Katherines early life before 1550 Katherine was married at the age of twelve to Henry Herbert in May of 1553 It was the same day her elder sister Jane was married to Guildford Dudley Katherines sister Jane was queen of England for nine days before Mary became Queen Because of this Katherines marriage to Herbert was annulled

Katherine was considered even more beautiful than her sister Jane She was a little short but she had a delicate appearance She had shining red gold hair and her grandmother Mary Tudors blue eyes She also had white skin and no freckles unlike her sister Jane Unlike her sister Jane Katherine was not as smart and did not like her studies as much She preferred playing with her pet dogs and birds

Katherine said that her life at Queen Marys court was the best time of her life She met her future husband during these years and received money from Mary every year Marys sister Elizabeth did not like Katherine much She distrusted her and did not wish to see her married Katherine had other plans 

In December 1560 she married Edward Seymour Earl of Hertford without Elizabeth Is permission They planned to keep it a secret for a long time However Katherine became pregnant quickly and by July of the next year she could not hold her secret any longer She first tried to get help from Bess of Hardwick but Bess screamed at Katherine and made her go away Then she went to see Elizabeths great favorite Robert Dudley He listened to Katherine but promised nothing The next day he told Elizabeth everything Elizabeth was angry with this and put both Edward and Katherine in prison She gave birth to a son in the Tower of London The childs name was Edward 

Later she gave birth to another son also in the Tower of London This made Elizabeth even more angry since Katherine was not supposed to see Edward The couple would not see each other again after the birth Katherine soon got tuberculosis and died in January 1568 She is buried in Cockfield Chapel

George Boleyn had a very close relationship with his sister Anne he was close with his other sister as well but Mary concentrated more on her family with her husband Their downfall together was because the Henry VIII accused them of incest Mary Boleyn was not with them at the time of their exile She chose to hide for the sake of her children Or she too would have been beheaded It was probably a false charge by Henry VIII so he could get rid of Anne Boleyn Another reason why he died was because his wife claimed that George and Anne had an affair but on her own execution Lady Jane Rochford claimed that God has permitted me to suffer this shameful doom as punishment for having contributed to my husbands death I falsely accused him of loving in an incestuous manner his sister Queen Anne Boleyn For this I deserve to die

Mary Boleyn was the elder sister of Anne Boleyn the second wife of King Henry VIII They had a brother called George Boleyn

Mary was born around 1499 or 1500 as the daughter of Sir Thomas Boleyn and Lady Elizabeth Howard at Blinking Hall in Norfolk Her brother George and her sister Anne were brought up along with her by members of the Boleyn household in the courtyside at Hever Castle in Kent She had chestnut brown hair dark brown eyes and a creamy complexion Mary was considered to be the most beautiful of the Boleyn sisters but she lacked Annes brilliance and charismaShe was also demure easy tempered and obedient while Anne was lively opinionated and passionate 

During her childhood Marys academic education had been limited to arithmetic basic reading and writing her family genealogy grammar history religion and the Scriptures She had developed domestic skills such as dancingembrodiery good manners and morals household management music needlework and singing excelled at playing several musical instruments including the harp the lute the viol and the virginals and was fluent in French from learning it from her French governess Mademoiselle Semmonet Mary learned to play games such as cards chess and dice and outdoor pursuits such as archery falconry horseback riding and hunting Like her sister Anne Mary was also taught to have obedience to the men in her life which was first to her father and then to her husband once she was married Most of the time Mary would either be having constant lessons dress fittingsor etiquette lessons in order for her to learn to be a proper lady or playing childhood games with Anne and George in the manor grounds 

Mary was kept in England until 1514 when she was either fourteen or fifteen She was sent to be a maid of honor to Mary Tudor the sister of King Henry VIII Mary Tudor was going to be married to King Louis XII of France Only a few months after the wedding Louis died and Francis I became king It is thought that Mary Boleyn became Francis Is mistress for a while

Mary was sent back to England when her parents found out about her affair in France but she ended up being the lover of King Henry VIII Some people think that King Henry was the father of Marys children Catherine Carey and Henry Carey but it is more likely that her husband William Carey was the true father Mary married William Carey in 1520

After Marys husband died Marys luck ran out Her sister Anne took Marys place as King Henrys favourite lover and Henry divorced his wife in order to marry Anne After this Mary became really poor Her first husband died but she met another man William Stafford who was also poor They married for love and this upset Anne Boleyn who banished Mary from court Mary and William Stafford had two children but both of them died

After Anne Boleyn had been married to King Henry for a short time he grew tired of her She was accused of having had other lovers and was executed George Boleyn the brother of Anne and Mary was also executed but Mary and her husband William Stafford were not blamed for anything as they were not at the royal court They lived happily together until Mary died in 1543

The Kingdom of Saxony existed from 1806 until 1918 

From 1871 it was part of the German Empire and after World War I it became part of the Weimar Republic Its capital was the city of Dresden and its modern successor state is the Free State of Saxony

Before 1806 Saxony was the Electorate of Saxony in the Holy Roman Empire This meant that the princes who ruled Saxony were prince elector Kurfrst were some of the people who could elect a new Holy Roman Emperor

The Duchy of Saxe Meiningen was one of the Ernestine duchies

The dukes were never very important in forming the history of Europe and unlike their relative in the Duchy of Saxe Coburg and Gotha never set out to form a long lasting dynasty

Like all of the German monarchies the duchy became part of the Weimar Republic after World War I

In the reshuffle of Ernestine territories after the death of the Saxe Gothaducal line in 1825 Saxe Meiningen got the territories of Hildburghausen and Saalfeld The state of Saxe Meiningen was merged into the new state of Thuringia in 1920

The capital of Saxe Meiningen was Meiningen it had an area of 2468 km and a population of 269000 The summer residence was Altenstein

The present head of Head of the Ducal House of Saxe Meiningen is Prince Frederick Konrad

Dukedom abolished in 1918

Eilenburg is a town in the north of the state of Saxony The town lies on the banks of the river Mulde ca 20 kilometres northeastern the city of Leipzig It belongs to the Nordsachsen Rural District and is subdivided into the urban districts Mitte Ost and Berg and the villages Behlitz Hainichen Kospa Pressen Wedelwitz and Zschettgau

Eilenburg occupies convert4684km2sqmi1lkonabbron and has about 17000 inhabitants as of 31 December 2009

The castle of Eilenburg was first mentioned at 29 July 961 in a document by Otto I as civitas Ilburg The name has Slavic origin and means town in clay deposits Probably in the 11th century there has developed a settlement of purchase people in the advance of the castle that forms the origin of the todays town of Eilenburg

In the 16th century Eilenburg was a centre of the reformation events Even George Duke of Saxony called this town a nominated place Martin Luther was total seven times in Eilenburg and called it a blessed lard pit It is passed that he took it into consideration to set here in the old 

The Thirty Years War left hard mark in Eilenburg First the town was spared of fighting but it already suffered from the catastrophic economic effects of the war From the year 1631 the town was directly involved in the war In 1632 the body of Gustav II Adolf King of the Swedish was laid out in Red Deer Inn after he had been killed in the Battle of Ltzen the 16 November 1632 In 1639 Eilenburg was conquered by the troops of Georg von Derfflinger In 1646 peace negotiations between Saxony and Sweden began in Eilenburg to extend the expiring Armistice of Ktzschenbroda The 14 September 1648 the Treaty of Eilenburg was made and meant the end of the Thirty Years War for total Saxony Subsequently the town recovered 

The slow onset of economic recovery got a sudden end by the began of the Seven Years War Virtually each male in Eilenburg had to serve in the armed forces The city was occupied alternately by the Austrians and Prussians In the following Eilenburg turned into an impoverished and squandered town In the end of the 18th century the economy stagnated and Eilenburg became an insignificant town

In 1813 during the Napoleonic wars shortly before the Battle of Leipzig Napoleon was in Eilenburg and took the last view on his and the allies Saxon troops eastern Eilenburg After Napoleons defeat Saxony had to cede large territory to Prussia under the provisions of the Congress of Vienna Eilenburg now belonging to the very modern Prussian state Thereby the transition of Eilenburg to an industrial city was advanced significantly 

Because of the founding of numerous textile factories Eilenburg next to Berlin became most important centre of Prussian textile production The ascent to an important industrial city came mainly from the nearby Saxony Saxon industrialists settled in Eilenburg for having duty free access to the Prussian market Onset urbanization caused a rapid rising of the population The social tensions resulting from the industrialization and the huge growth of population promoted a strong labour movement In 1849 the health insurance support association was founded In 1850 the food association of Eilenburg as first food cooperative of Germany and Darlehnskassenverein as first Credit union in Germany were founded Carl Degenkolb owner of a factory in Eilenburg and member of Frankfurt Parliament instituted first German works councils voluntarily at his factory 

In 1872 Eilenburg received its first railway The 30 June Halle Eilenburg Falkenberg route was opened Two years later transport services started on the new built Eilenburg Leipzig route Industrial development continued rapidly by settlement of chemical wood and metal processing industry The German Celluliod Factory that settled in 1887 characterized the citys business for more than a hundred years

During World War I hundreds of Eilenburg people were called up for military service The 21 October 1917 Wilhelm Pieck the later President of GDR escaped from a military transport at Eilenburg station Total about 800 people from Eilenburg were killed during the war

About two weeks before the end of the World War II the city was almost completely destroyed 17 April 1945 the American troops reached Eilenburg It was ordered defense to extremes Three days and three nights the town was under heavy artillery fire that destroyed most of the buildings of the city The meaningless defense killed two hundred people 90 percent of the City Centre were destroyed while the American associations had nearly no losses Eilenburg was one of the hardest destroyed cities in Germany

The city centre was rebuilt in the 1950s In 1952 the city became the seat of the Eilenburg Rural District newly formed by the administrative reform in the GDR In the east part of Eilenburg large new housing areas emerged In autumn 1989 up to seven thousand inhabitants formed peaceful demonstrations reaching a change especially on political level After the German reunification some long established companies got out of business Dismantling of jobs could only be partially offset by new business settlements on newly created industrial areas outside the city In 1994 Eilenburg Rural District got merged with Delitzsch Rural District in the course of district reform So the city lost the seat of district

In 2002 Eilenburg was hit hard by flood of the river Mulde The thereby caused damages amounted to EUR 135 million The construction of flood protection facilities was intensified after the flood In 2008 the construction measures ended after investments amounting to EUR 35 million Eilenburg was the first city in Saxony that is completely protected against flood Since 1 August 2008 Eilenburg lies approximately in the middle of the newly formed Nordsachsen Rural District

The word Sunnah is an Arabic word meaning tradition or way For Muslims Sunnah means the way of the prophet The Sunnah is made up of the words and actions of Muhammad the prophet of Islam Muslims believe Muhammads life is a good model for them to follow in their own lives 

Muslim scholars learn about the Sunnah by studying thousands of stories about Muhammad his family and his first followers These stories are called Hadith 

Al Aqsa Mosque is a mosque or a place where Muslims go to worship and it is in Jerusalem Abdul Malik ibn Marwan asked for the mosque to be built but he died before they finished building it and it was finished by his son in 705 AD The Al Aqsa Mosque is a part of the Al Haram al Qudsi al Sharif or The Noble Sanctuary This area is known as the Temple Mount by Jews and it is believed to be the location where the Jewish Temple was built The mosque is the 3rd most important place in Islam Many Muslims believe that Muhammad went from the Sacred Mosque in Mecca to the Al Aqsa Mosque in the story of the Night Journey Also some Islamic traditions say Muhammad led prayers there before his ascension

People have planned to attack the mosque and some people have actually attacked it In 1969 Michael Dennis Rohan set the mosque on fire destroying a lot of the mosque Some members of the Gush Emunim Underground planned to blow up the mosque but they never blew it up 

In September of 2000 Ariel Sharon visited Al Aqsa and Palestinians who were at the mosque threw objects at the police force that was with Sharon In return the police shot rubber bullets at the group of Palestinians Palestinians said Sharon visited the mosque to make people angry but Sharon said he had gone there with a message of peace This visit is what some believe caused the Second Intifada

Al Aqsa Mosque means the farthest mosque The mosques name comes from a story in the Quran called The Night Journey In the story Muhammad goes from Mecca to Jerusalem where the Al Aqsa Mosque is Then he went up to Heaven on a flying horse

The mosque was first built in 705 AD The first mosque was destroyed in a earthquake in 748 AD and had to be built again We do not know when it was built again but it was probably in 771 AD and this mosque was destroyed soon after they finished building it The third mosque was built around 780 AD In 1033 AD there was another earthquake and the mosque had to be built again

Jerusalem was taken over by the Crusaders in 1099 Instead of taking down the mosque the crusaders used the mosque as a palace In 1119 it was changed into the headquarters for the Templar Knights

The surface gravity g of an astronomical or other object is the gravitational acceleration experienced at its surface The surface gravity may be thought of as the acceleration caused by the gravity experienced by a hypothetical test particle which is very close to the objects surface and which in order not to disturb the system has negligible mass

Surface gravity is measured in units of acceleration which in the SI system are meters per second squared It may also be described as a multiple of the Earths gravity g 980665 ms2 In astrophysics the surface gravity may be expressed as log g which is obtained by first expressing the gravity in cgs units where the unit of acceleration is centimeters per second squared and then taking the base 10 logarithm

In astronomy a rotation period is the time an astronomical object takes to complete one revolution around its rotation axis relative to the background stars For the Earth this is a sidereal day It is different from a solar day which is measured by the passage of the Sun across the local meridian

In astronomy absolute magnitude is the apparent magnitude m an object would have if it were at a standard luminosity distance away from us in the absence of interstellar extinction It allows the overall brightnesses of objects to be compared without regard to distance

Angular size is a measurement of how large or small something is using rotational measurement It is useful for measuring things that are so far away that they appear two dimensional

The albedo of an object is the extent to which it reflects light defined as the ratio of reflected to incident electromagnetic radiation It is a unitless measure indicative of a surfaces or bodys diffuse reflectivity The word is derived from albus a Latin word for white

The German speaking Community of Belgium is one of the three federal communities in Belgium It is the main part of the so called East Cantons of Belgium It has an area of convert854km2sqmi1abbronlkon and a population of over 73000 of which almost 100 are German speaking

Its capital is Eupen it is part of the province of Lige and borders on the Netherlands Germany and Luxembourg

The area was known as Eupen Malmedy and is now called the East Cantons It is made up of the German speaking Community and the municipalities of Malmedy and Waimes which belong to the French Speaking Community of Belgium

The East Cantons were part of the Rhine Province of Prussia in Germany until 1920 but were annexed by Belgium following Germanys defeat in World War I and the subsequent Treaty of Versailles Thus they also became known as the cantons rdims redeemed cantons The peace treaty of Versailles demanded the questioning of the local population about their political status

This was not a secret vote and anyone who did not want to become Belgian had to register their full name and address Many locals feared reprisals or even expulsion after enlisting

In the mid 1920s the kingdom of Belgium seemed to want to sell the region back to Germany The French government told the Belgians to stop the Belgian German talks about the deal

In 1940 the new cantons were retaken by Germany in World War II They had only been in Belgium for 20 years so the majority of people of the east cantons still thought of themselves as German Following the defeat of Germany in 1945 the cantons were once again taken over by Belgium

In the early 1960s Belgium was divided into four language areas the Dutch speaking Flemish area the French speaking area the bilingual capital of Brussels and the German speaking area of the east cantons In 1973 three communities and three regions were established and granted internal autonomy The legislative Parliament of the German speaking Community Rat der Deutschsprachigen Gemeinschaft was set up Today the German speaking Community has a degree of self government especially in language and cultural matters but it still part of French speaking Wallonia

Some people want the German speaking Community to be its own region One of these is the current Minister President Karl Heinz Lambertz

The German speaking Community has its own government which is appointed for five years by its parliament The Government is headed by a Minister President who acts as the prime minister of the Community and is assisted by the Ministry of the German speaking Community The government currently formed by four Ministers

County Durham is a county in north east England There are four different types of county

Its county town is Durham 

The form of the county name is unique in England Many counties are named after their principal town and the expected form here would be Durhamshire But County Durham did not become a ShireCounty until after the language of government was changed from Anglo Saxon to Norman French in 1066 Previous to that it was a semi independent Bishopric 

The historic county covered from the Pennines in the west the River Tees in the south the North Sea in the east and the Rivers Tyne and Derwent in the north 

The county several had a number of exclaves Bedlingtonshire Islandshire and Norhamshire within Northumberland and Craikshire within the North Riding of Yorkshire The historic boundaries were used for parliamentary purposes until 1832 and for law courts and local government until the Counties Act 1844 which merged most remaining exclaves with their surrounding county

In 1889 under the Local Government Act 1888 England and Wales was divided into administrative counties and county boroughs Administrative counties governed by an elected county council were based on the historic boundaries less larger towns which became self governing as county boroughs

In 1889 the administrative county of Durham consisted of the historic county less the county boroughs of Gateshead South Shields and Sunderland The boundary with the North Riding of Yorkshire was adjusted the part of the town of Barnard Castle that was in Yorkshire was added to County Durham but the part of the Borough of Stockton on Tees in Durham was given to the North Riding For all non administrative purposes such as lieutenancy the County of Durham comprised the administrative county and associated county boroughs

Over its existence the administrative county lost territory both to the existing county boroughs and also due to the creation of county boroughs at West Hartlepool in 1902 and Darlington in 1915 In 1967 the borough of Hartlepool was removed from the administrative county when it merged with West Hartlepool to form a new county borough of Hartlepool and in 1968 Billingham was included within the boundaries of the county borough of Teesside associated with the North Riding

The administrative county was abolished in 1974

In 1974 Durham was divided between three counties The boroughs of Hartlepool and Stockton on Tees became a part of the new non metropolitan county of Cleveland The metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear became responsible for Gateshead Sunderland and South Tyneside The new non metropolitan county of Durham also covered the former area of Startforth Rural District a part of the historic North Riding of Yorkshire and south of the historical boundary of the River Tees

The Department for Communities and Local Government has said that the seven district councils and the County Council will be abolished and a new unitary authority for the whole of the existing County Council area will be created The change will be on 1 April 2009 at the latest The successful Durham County Council bid referred to the new authority as County Durham Council

In 1997 the non metropolitan county together with that part of the former county of Cleveland north of the River Tees became a ceremonial county Lord lieutenants and high sheriffs are appointed to the ceremonial county of Durham they have no job in local government

This is a list of the main towns in County Durham The area covered is the entire ceremonial county hence the inclusion of towns which are no longer administered by Durham County Council 

The Balkan mountain range is an extension of the Carpathian mountain range separated from it by the Danube River

The Balkan range runs 560 km from eastern Serbia eastward through central Bulgaria to Cape Emine on the Black Sea

The highest peak on the Balkan peninsula is Musala in the Rila mountains near Sofia with 2925 m closely followed by Mount Olympus in Greece and Vihren

The highest peaks of the Stara planina itself are in central Bulgaria The highest peak is Botev located in the Central Balkan National Park

There are paved roads crossing Stara Planina at the following passes

The Carpathian Mountains are the eastern wing of the great Central Mountain System of Central Europe curving 1500 km along the borders of Romania the Czech Republic Slovakia Poland Ukraine Austria Serbia and northern Hungary

The Carpathians begin on the Danube near Bratislava They surround Transcarpathia and Transylvania in a large semicircle sweeping towards the south west and end on the Danube near Orova in Romania The total length of the Carpathians is over 1500 km and the mountain chains width varies between 12 and 500 km 

The Carpathians are separated from the Alps by the Danube

A major part of the western and northeastern Outer Carpathians in Poland Ukraine and Slovakia is traditionally called Beskids

What follows is a practical outline of the Carpathian subdivisions

Squamata is the order of reptiles which includes lizards and snakes 

Their skins have overlapping horny scales They also have movable quadrate bones which make it possible to move the upper jaw relative to the braincase This is particularly visible in snakes which are able to open their mouths very wide to accommodate comparatively large prey 

They are the most variably sized order of reptiles ranging from the 16 mm Dwarf gecko to the 8 m Green Anaconda

This is the only living reptile group which has both viviparous and ovoviviparous species as well as the usual oviparous reptiles

The Squamata does not include the Tuataras from New Zealand They are a sister group to the squamates The Crocodilia are much more distantly related

Squamates are a monophyletic group that is a sister group to the tuatara The squamates and tuatara together are a sister group to crocodiles and birds the living archosaurs 

Squamate fossils first appear in the early Jurassic but a mitochondrial phylogeny suggests that they evolved in the late Permian The evolutionary relationships within the squamates are not yet completely worked out with the relationship of snakes to other groups being most problematic 

From morphological data Iguanid lizards have been thought to have diverged from other squamates very early but recent molecular phylogenies both from mitochondrial and nuclear DNA do not support this early divergence Because snakes have a faster molecular clock than other squamates and there are few early snake and snake ancestor fossils it is difficult to resolve the relationship between snakes and other squamate groups

Recent research suggests that the evolutionary origin of venom lies deep in the squamate phylogeny 60 of squamates are venomous Toxicofera 

Venom in the families Caenophidia Anguimorpha and Iguania evolved once then the three families diverged All three lineages share nine common toxins The fossil record shows that the divergence between anguimorphs iguanians and advanced snakes dates back roughly 200 MYA to the Upper TriassicLower Jurassic

Snake venom evolved by the duplication of a gene encoding for a normal regulatory or bioactivity protein Then the copy was expressed in the venom gland 

Different toxins have been recruited from different proteins and are diverse as the functions themselves 

Natural selection has driven the diversification of the toxins to counter the defences of the prey Venom genes form large multigene families and evolve by protein evolution This leads to a diversification of toxins that let sit and wait predators attack a wide range of prey 

The rapid evolution and diversification is the result of a preypredator evolutionary arms race where each adapts to counter the other

Classically the order is divided into three suborders

Pingu is a cartoon series for children about a penguin called Pingu and his family that live in the South Pole It was made in Switzerland in 1986 The show was made by Otmar Gutmann

The Tatra Mountains Tatras or Tatra constitute a mountain range which forms a natural border between Slovakia and Poland They occupy an area of 750 km the major part of which lies in Slovakia The highest Tatra peak at 2655 m is Gerlachovsk tt located in Slovakia Rysy at 2499 m is the highest Polish peak

The Tatra Mountains are the highest mountain range in the Carpathian Mountains Although considerably smaller than the Alps they are classified as having an alpine landscape Their high mountain character combined with great accessibility makes them popular with tourists and scientists

The Bodhi Tree was a large and very old Sacred Fig tree It was at the Mahabodhi Temple at Bodh Gaya Siddhartha Gautama the spiritual teacher and founder of Buddhism later known as Gautama Buddha achieved Bodhi while sitting under this tree The Bodhi tree is easily recognised because of its heart shaped leaves

The word Bodhi tree is also widely applied to existing trees particularly the Sacred Fig growing at the Mahabodhi Temple which is probably a direct descendant of the original tree This tree is a frequent place for pilgrims to visit being the most important of the four holy sites for Buddhists 

The Bodhi tree at the Mahabodhi Temple is called the Sri MahaBodhi According to Buddhism after his Enlightenment the Buddha spent a whole week in front of the tree standing with unblinking eyes gazing at it with gratitude A shrine was later built where he had stood

The spot was used as a shrine even in the lifetime of the Buddha the only shrine that could be so used King Asoka held a festival every year in its honour in the month of Kattikarp17 His queen Tissarakkh was jealous of the Tree and three years after she became queen she caused the tree to be killed by means of mandu thornsrp20 The tree however grew again and a great monastery was attached to the Bodhimanda called the Bodhimanda Vihara Among those present at the foundation of the Mah Thpa are mentioned thirty thousand monks from the Bodhimanda Vihara led by Cittaguttarp29

While the Buddha was still alive so that people might make their offerings in the name of the Buddha when he was away on pilgrimage he approved the planting of a seed from the Bodhi tree in Bodhgaya in front of the gateway of Jetavana Monastery near Sravasti For this purpose Moggallana took a fruit from the tree as it dropped from its stalk before it reached the ground It was planted in a golden jar by Anathapindika with great pomp and ceremony A sapling immediately sprouted forth fifty cubits high and in order to consecrate it the Buddha spent one night under it rapt in meditation This tree because it was planted under the direction of Ananda came to be known as the Ananda Bodhi

The Sri Maha Bodhi in Sri Lanka was planted in 288 BC making it the oldest verified specimen of any angiosperm In this year the right branch of the Bodhi tree was brought by Sanghamitt to Anurdhapura and placed by Devnmpiyatissa in the Mahmeghavana The Buddha on his death bed had resolved five things one being that the branch which should be taken to Ceylon should detach itselfrp17 From Gay the branch was taken to Ptaliputta then to Tmalitt where it was placed in a ship and taken to Jambukola across the sea finally it arrived at Anuradhapura staying on the way at Tivakka Those who assisted the king at the ceremony of the planting of the Tree were the nobles of Kjaragma and of Candanagma and of Tivakka A sapling of this tree was planted in the Buddha Jayanti Park in New Delhi India in 1993

According to the Ceylon Chronicles branches from the Bodhi trees of all the Buddhas born during this kalpa were planted in Ceylon on the spot where the sacred Bodhi tree stands today in Anurdhapura The branch of Kakusandhas tree was brought by a nun called Rucnand Konagamanas by Kantaknand and Kassapas by Sudhamm

In geometry the term semi major axis is used to describe the dimensions of ellipses and hyperbolae

In astronomy an apsis plural apsides is the point of greatest or least distance of the elliptical orbit of an astronomical object from its center of attraction which is generally the center of mass of the system 

The point of closest approach is called the periapsis or pericentre and the point of farthest excursion is called the apoapsis apocentre or apapsis A straight line drawn through the periapsis and apoapsis is the line of apsides This is the major axis of the ellipse the line through the longest part of the ellipse

Similar words are used to identify the body being orbited The most common are perigee and apogee referring to orbits around the Earth and perihelion and aphelion referring to orbits around the Sun During the Apollo program the terms pericynthion and apocynthion were used when referring to the moon

eobj is the eccentricity ra is the apoapsis of the objects orbit rp is the periapsis of the objects orbit

The astronomical unit is a unit of length about the same as the mean distance from the center of the Earth to the center of the Sun The currently accepted value of the AU is 149597870691 meters

Astronomers usually measure distances within the Solar System in astronomical units Mars is about 14 AU from the Sun Jupiter lies at roughly 52 AU and Neptune is roughly 30 AU from the Sun

Astronomical unit is a term that is important to remember and consider when we try to understand the universe

Giga is a prefix in the SI system of units denoting 109 or 1000000000 The Oxford English Dictionary reports the earliest written use of giga in this sense to be in the Reports of the IUPAC 14th Conference in 1947 The following prefixes to abbreviations for the names of units should be used G giga 109 Giga comes from the Greek meaning giant

In mathematics a degree is 1360 part of a circle Imagine a round pie Cut it through the middle in two parts Now cut the halves in two equal parts Each of the four parts has a right angle where the middle of the pie was If each of these parts was in 90 equal slices they will all have an angle of one degree 180 degrees would be half of the pie 270 degrees would be three quarters of the pie 

Why ninety and not one hundred 

Ninety is easier to make calculations with mentally Ninety can be split into equal pieces in many different ways 

One hundred can only be split in less ways

In times when people made calculations in their head a lot they liked the numbers 360 90 and 12 better than 10 and 100 for this reason That is also why there are 24 hours in a day and why a troy pound is 12 ounces

In astronomy a Julian year is a unit of measurement of time defined as exactly 36525 days of 86400 SI seconds each totalling 31557600 seconds That is the average length of the year in the Julian calendar used in Western societies in previous centuries and for which the unit is named Nevertheless because a Julian year measures duration rather than designates date the Julian year does not correspond to years in the Julian calendar or any other calendar Nor does it correspond to the many other ways of defining a year

In astronomy an epoch is a moment in time for which the position or the orbital elements of a celestial body are specified

The position at other times can be measured by taking into account proper motion or orbital motion In the case of orbital elements for a solar system body these change due to perturbation by other bodies on our solar system

The Julian day or Julian day number is the number of days that have passed since the initial epoch defined as noon Universal Time Monday January 1 4713 BC in the Julian calendar That noon to noon day is counted as Julian day 0 Thus the multiples of 7 are Mondays Negative values can also be used although those predate all recorded history 

Now at CURRENTDATE the JDN is expr round 0 The remainder of this value divided by 7 is exprmod 7 an integer expression for the day of the week with 0 representing Monday

The Julian date is a continuous count of days and fractions elapsed since the same initial epoch Currently the JD is CURRENTJULIANDAY The integral part gives the Julian day number The fractional part gives the time of day since noon UT as a decimal fraction of one day or fractional day with 05 representing midnight UT Typically a 64 bit floating point variable can represent an epoch expressed as a Julian date to about 1 millisecond precision

A Julian date of 245411505486 means that the date and Universal Time is Sunday 14 January 2007 at 1318599 

The decimal parts of a Julian date

01 24 hours or 144 minutes or 8640 seconds

001 024 hours or 144 minutes or 864 seconds

0001 0024 hours or 144 minutes or 864 seconds

00001 00024 hours or 0144 minutes or 864 seconds

000001 000024 hours or 00144 minutes or 0864 seconds

Almost 25 million Julian days have elapsed since the initial epoch JDN 2400000 was November 16 1858 JD 25000000 will occur on August 31 2132 at noon UT

The Julian day number can be considered a very simple calendar where its calendar date is just an integer This is useful for reference computations and conversions It allows the time between any two dates in history to be computed by simple subtraction

The Julian day system was introduced by astronomers to provide a single system of dates that could be used when working with different calendars and to unify different historical chronologies Apart from the choice of the zero point and name this Julian day and Julian date are not directly related to the Julian calendar although it is possible to convert any date from one calendar to the other

A meatball is meat that is ground up mixed with other ingredients then shaped like a ball Most meatballs are made out of beef Meatballs can also be made out of chicken fish or other kinds of meat The other ingredients are usually bread onion and eggs Meatballs can be cooked by frying baking or steaming them Meatballs are sometimes served with pasta or in a sauce

Mand is a ethnic group of West Africa These people speak Mande languages and they live in Gambia Guinea Guinea Bissau Senegal Mali Sierra Leone Liberia Burkina Faso and Cte dIvoire The Mande languages are in the Niger Congo family These people made the largest west African empires Some people think that the Mand people are not a racial group but are a cultural group instead

The Ghana Empire was in what is now southeastern Mauritania Western Mali and Eastern Senegal It is also sometimes called the Wagadou Empire It started in about 750 and ended in about 1076

The Mali Empire was a west African country from 1235 to 1645 The Mandinka people lived there It is also called the Manding Empire or Manden Kurufa Sundiata Keita started the empire and the empire became famous because its rulers were very rich especially Mansa Musa I The Mali Empire had many important cultural effects on western Africa so the language laws and customs spread a lot along the Niger River

Timbuktu is a city in Tombouctou Region Mali Sankore University and other madrasas are in the city The city was important for thinking and for religion in the 15th and 16th centuries It was important in spreading Islam through Africa at that time There are three great mosques Djingareyber Sankore and Sidi Yahya They are reminders of Timbuktus golden age They are always being fixed but are threatened because the desert is spreading

Songhay Tuareg Fulani and Mand people live in Timbuktu It is about 15 km north of the Niger River There is a route across the Sahara Desert from east to west and this is used for trade There is another from north to south These two routes meet in Timbuktu It is an entrept for rock salt from Taoudenni This means that the salt is brought here and sold to other people to take it somewhere else but no tax is charged

Its location helped different people meet so local people Berbers and Arabs met here It has a long history of mixed African trade so it became famous in Europe for this reason Therefore western people often thought of Timbuktu as being exotic

Timbuktu has given a lot of research and study to Islam and to the world Important books were written and copied in Timbuktu in the 14th century This made the city become the center of writing in Africa

Jeanne Demessieux was a French organist and composer

She started to learn the piano when she was very young and was soon learning at the Paris Conservatory Her family moved to Paris so that she could continue to have music lessons there She became a student at the Conservatoire in 1933 In the same year she got a job as organist of the St Esprit church in Paris She had this job for 29 years 

Between 1936 and 1939 she studied organ privately with the famous organist Marcel Dupr and in 1939 she joined his organ class at the Conservatory After receiving a first prize in organ performance and improvisation in 1941 she studied five more years with Dupr in Meudon before she played her first recital at Salle Pleyel in Paris in 1946 This was the beginning of her career as an international recitalist She played more than 700 concerts in Europe and the United States

Gifted with an amazing musical memory she could play more than 2500 pieces from memory including all the organ works of Johann Sebastian Bach Csar Franck Franz Liszt Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy and Dupr 

She was also a remarkable improviser When she gave her first concert in London she was given four tunes by four different people and was asked to improvise a long piece of music on the organ using all those tunes She succeeded

A teacher of the organ at Nancy and Brussels she made several LP recordings She had plans to record all the organ works of Olivier Messiaen However she died young of cancer before she was able to finish this task

She wrote many compositions especially for the organ These include Nativit Six tudes Sept Mditations sur le Saint Esprit Triptyque Twelve Choral Preludes on Gregorian Chant Themes and Te Deum

House Mouse the common mouse is one of the most numerous species of the genus Mus Very often it is just called a mouse It is a small mammal and a rodent In most parts of the world they live very close to humans Laboratory mice are types of House Mice and are some of the most important organisms used for research in biology and medicine they are the most commonly used laboratory mammal for experiments

A small scaly tailed mouse with a distinct notch in the cutting surface of upper incisors hair short ears moderately large and naked upperparts ochraceous suffused with black belly buffy white or buffy usually without speckling and with slaty underfur yellowish flank line usually present tail brownish with black tip not distinctly bicolor but paler on underside ears pale brown feet drab or buffy tips of toes white Mammae in four or five pairs External measurements average total length 169 mm tail 93 mm hind foot 18 mm Weight of adults 17 25 g

Although not native to North America the house mouse since its early accidental introduction at most of our seaport towns has become widespread throughout the United States and occurs either as a commensal or feral animal in practically all parts of the United States As commensal animals house mice live in close association with man in his houses outbuildings stores and other structures Where conditions permit feral mice may be found in fields along watercourses and in other places where vegetation is dense enough to afford concealment They tend to hide in the winter as the climate is too cold to naturally survive in They will usually stay in cool dark places like garden sheds They will only stay up until the summer where they will find a new place to live

Scientology teaches that people are immortal spirits who have forgotten their true nature A system called auditing is used to help people remember In auditing people are able to re experience painful events in their past This helps people understand past painful moments 

There are a many organizations that are linked to Scientology These help people get away from illegal drugs or to get back into society after they served a prison term for example Scientology also thinks that psychiatry is bad and should be abolished

The Church of Scientology says that there are over 10 million people who are a part of the Church Critics disagree with that figure however They say the organisation probably does not have more than 100000 people and most of them in the United States They say that in 1960 there were probably 50000 to 100000 followers in the US In the 1990s a representative survey claimed there were only about 45000 followers left These figures seemed to have improved a bit by 2004 where there were an estimated 55000 followers

The Church of Scientology was started by the American writer and amateur philosopher L Ron Hubbard in the year 1954 It is not as well known as Christianity or Islam but it is newer Scientologists believe it is growing They claim it has thousands of churches some of which are very small The largest is in Clearwater Florida

L Ron Hubbard wrote about the aims of scientology saying

In a talk he gave to some Scientologists in 1972 Hubbard told them You are the people the planet obeys You are the people who own the planet

Scientologists say that the book Dianetics was the first self help book ever written It was written by L Ron Hubbard in the year 1950 Some key concepts in the book are

Another basic teaching of Scientology is the three parts that together are understanding These are affinity reality and communication Hubbard called this the ARC Triangle Scientologists use this as an idea in their lives It is based upon the idea that making one bit better makes the other two better

The tone scale is a way to rate an emotion as bad better or good The scale goes from 40 to 40 Positions on the tone scale started from the idea that one way of feeling is better than a worse way of feeling But Hubbard described many other things that go along with emotion such as health mating behavior survival potential and ability to deal with truth The tone scale is frequently used by Scientologists to understand people According to Scientology the lower the individual is on the tone scale the more complex his problems are

Many well known people are followers of Scientology They include

Other well known people are former members They include

The North German Confederation was a military alliance of 22 states of northern Germany It started in August 1866 and the Kingdom of Prussia was the leading state In July 1867 it became a political alliance too The Confederation was a federal state with a constitution which set out what the individual countries could do and what what be done by the federation

The North German Confederation was the basis of the German Empire which adopted most parts of the federations constitution and its flag It included the lands of the German Confederation north of the river Main plus Prussias eastern territories and the Duchy of Schleswig Austria and the southern states of Bavaria Wrttemberg Baden and the southern parts of the Grand Duchy of Hesse were not in the Confederation Bismarck thought Austria was too powerful at the time and wanted to set up a state Prussia could dominate

The federation was created after Prussia defeated Austria and the other remaining states of the German Confederation in the Austro Prussian War of 1866 Otto von Bismarck was its Chancellor and the King of Prussia William I was its President The states sent representatives to the Reichsrat The Federal Council had 43 members 17 were from Prussia seats The southern states were soon allowed to sent representatives if the joined a Customs Union

The Federation was dissolved after Prussia beat the Second French Empire in the Franco Prussian War of 1871 Bavaria Wrttemberg and Baden joined with the Federation to form the German Empire William I became German Emperor he was not called the Emperor of Germany because it was thought that title could only be used if Austria was included

The federation handled the mail and issued postage stamps after 1 January 1868 But the federation did not issue its own money so different stamps had to be issued Stamps valued in groschen were used in the north stamps in kreuzer in the Southern District All of these stamps were marked NORDDEUTSCHER POSTBEZIRK

A third set of stamps were printed for Hamburg These were also marked STADTPOSTBRIEF HAMBURG

Inclination in general is the angle between a reference plane and another plane or axis of direction The axial tilt is described as the angle made by the planets axis and a line drawn through the planets center perpendicular to the orbital plane

The argument of periapsis is the orbital element describing the angle of an orbiting bodys periapsis relative to its ascending node The angle is measured in the orbital plane and in the direction of motion

An argument of periapsis of 0 means that the orbiting body will be at its closest approach to the central body at the same moment that it crosses the plane of reference from south to north An argument of periapsis of 90 means that the orbiting body will reach periapsis at its northmost distance from the plane of reference

The longitude of the ascending node is one of the orbital elements used to specify the orbit of an object in space It is the angle from a reference direction called the origin of longitude to the direction of the ascending node measured in a reference plane

The orbital period is the time taken for a given object to make one complete orbit about another object

When mentioned without further qualification in astronomy this refers to the sidereal period of an astronomical object which is calculated with respect to the stars

The orbital speed of a body usually a planet a natural satellite an artificial satellite or a multiple star is the speed at which it orbits around the barycenter of a system usually around a more massive body It can be used to refer to either the mean orbital speed the average speed as it completes an orbit or instantaneous orbital speed the speed at a particular point in its orbit 

The orbital speed at any position in the orbit can be computed from the distance to the central body at that position and the specific orbital energy which is independent of position the kinetic energy is the total energy minus the potential energy

Continental drift is a historical theory The theory was first proposed by Abraham Ortelius in 1596 It was fully developed by the German geologist and meteorologist Alfred Wegener in 1915 

The theory said that parts of the Earths crust moves slowly on top of a liquid core The theory has now been included in the wider theory of plate tectonics

The theory was supported by finding the same rocks and fossils in western Europe and the eastern North America There are also similar fossils on the western coast of Africa and the eastern South America The shapes of these continents nearly fits together The theory was plausible but there was no known mechanism to drive these great movements This problem was later solved by plate tectonics

The pattern of volcanic action mountain building and earthquakes is explained by continental drift The existence of identical rocks widely apart supports the theory 

Examples

The basic machine driving continental movement is heat moving from the Earths mantle through the crust and out of the planet The effect of this it to cause convection and plate movement 

Two events in particular are of huge importance

1918 1920 eventstart Saxe Weimar partitioned datestart July 7 1602 event1 Personal union with

Saxe Altenburg was one of the Ernestine duchies of the House of Wettin Altenburg was independent for most of the 1600s until 1672 This is when the last male ruler died Because only men could rule the Ernestine duchies Altenburg began to be ruled by the Duke of Saxe Gotha who had married the last rulers daughter

In 1825 the ruler died and he also had no male heirs Saxe Gotha Altenburg was split up Gotha was given to the Duke of Saxe Coburg Saalfeld and Altenburg to the Duke of Saxe Hildburghausen who in exchange gave up Saalfeld and Hildburghausen to the Duke of Saxe Meiningen This family ruled in the duchy until the end of the monarchies in 1918 Saxe Altenburg became part of the new state of Thuringia in the Weimar Republic in 1920

Saxe Altenburg had an area of convert1323km2sqmi1abbronlkon and a population of 207000 Its capital was Altenburg

The Saxe Altenburg line became extinct following the death of Prince George Moritz in 1991

In 1991 the Saxe Altenburg line became extinct

Two branches descend from duke Ernest the Pious the father of the progenitor of this Saxe Altenburg branch Saxe Meiningen and Saxe Coburg Gotha according to old Wettin family law they would have divided the actual territories between them The senior male agnate descending from duke Ernest the Pious in 1991 was prince Frederick Alfred of Saxe Meiningen and thus technically succeeded then as titular duke of Saxe Altenburg and head of the whole branch but because he renounced all his succession rights in favor of his uncle Bernhard was him instead Frederick Alfred the general heir of the line of Saxe Meiningen His successor was Konrad Duke of Saxe Meiningen the present head of that branch

A porcupine is a rodent with a coat of sharp spines or quills that defend them from predators The porcupines include the third biggest rodent after the capybara and beaver and are not to be confused with hedgehogs Most porcupines are about 60 90 cm long with a 20 25 cm long tail Weighing between 12 35 pounds they are rounded large and slow Porcupines come in various shades of brown grey and the unusual white The name porcupine comes from Middle French porc dpine thorny pork hence the nickname quill pig for the animal

The animals quills or spines take on many forms depending on the type but all are hairs coated with thick plates of keratin and they are in the skin musculature Old World porcupines have quills in clusters whereas in New World porcupines single quills are mixed with bristles underfur and hair

Porcupine quills are as sharp as needles can be removed very easily and will remain stuck in an attacker Unlike needles however the quills of New World porcupines have microscopic backwards facing barbs on the tip that catch on the skin making them hard and painful to pull out Quills are about 75 mm long and 2 mm wide If a quill becomes put in the tissues of an attacker the barbs act to pull the quill farther into the tissues with the normal muscle movements of the attacker moving up to many millimeters in a day Animals who try to eat porcupines have been known to die because of quill penetration and infection Quills can still penetrate animals and humans even after death The ancient belief that porcupines can throw their quills at an enemy has long been proved to be incorrect

Porcupines can live in a wide range of places in tropical and mild parts of Asia Italy Africa and North and South America Porcupines live in forests deserts and grasslands Some live in trees others stay on the ground

Porcupines in search of salt sometimes live in human places eating plywood cured with sodium nitrate certain paints and tool handles footwear clothes and other items that have been coated in salty sweat Porcupines like going near roads in areas where rock salt is used to melt ice and snow and are known to gnaw on vehicle tires or wiring coated in road salt Salt licks placed nearby can stop porcupine damage

Natural sources of salt used by porcupines include different salt rich plants fresh animal bones outer tree bark and mud in salt rich soils

The Ernestine duchies are sometimes called the Saxon duchies were a changing number of small states in the present German state of Thuringia governed by dukes of the Ernestine line of the house of Wettin The Albertine duchies of Weissenfels Merseburg and Zeitz were are also sometime called Saxon duchies and border several Ernestine ones

The old Duchy of Saxon began to split up in the 15th Century because law said that all sons should inherit  All of the sons of a Saxon duke had the title of Duke sometimes brothers ruled the territory together and sometimes they divided it up between them Some of the Ernestine duchies stayed independent until 1918 The nearby royal houses of Reuss and Schwarzburg also divided up their territory so Thuringia was a tangle of little states exclaves and enclaves from the late 15th Century until the early 20th Century

Albert grandson of Albert the Bear inherited the Duchy of Saxony from his father  Alberts sons divided Saxony into the duchies of Saxe Lauenburg and Saxe Wittenberg When duke of Saxe Wittenberg died without an heir in 1422 the Emperor Sigismund gave the duchy to Frederick IV of the House of Wettin Frederick was already Margrave of Meien and Landgrave of Thuringia and then became Frederick I Elector of Saxony Frederick was followed as Elector by his son Frederick II and when Frederick II died in 1464 his sons Ernest and Albert took over Because he was the older Ernest became Elector of Saxony but the brothers shared ruling the lands until 1485 Then Ernest took northern Meien southern Thuringia and Wittenberg with Albert receiving northern Thuringia and southern Meien

Elector Ernest died in 1486 and was succeeded by his son Frederick III the Wise 

It was Frederick the Wise who set up the University of Wittenberg in 1502 This was because the only university in Saxony was in Leipzig was in the part of Saxony controlled by the descendants of his uncle Albert The University of Wittenberg was were Martin Luther posted his 95 Theses Frederick protected Luther and did not send him to Rome for trial Frederick allowed Lutheran reforms in his country

Frederick the Wise had three grandsons to share the territory John Frederick II set up his capitals in in Eisenach and Coburg the middle brother John William staying in Weimar and the youngest John Frederick III took Gotha 

John Frederick III of Gotha died unmarried and heirless in 1565 and John William of Weimar tried to claim Saxe Gotha but the sons of the imprisoned John Frederick II entered their own claim 

In 1572 the claimants agreed to the Division of Erfurt This treaty said John William of Saxe Weimar would also take the districts of Altenburg Gotha and Meiningen 

When John William died a year later

The older son of John Frederick II and John Ernest the younger son of John Frederick II received together the territory of Saxe Coburg Eisenach In 1596 the brothers agreed to split the duchy into Saxe Coburg and Saxe Eisenach

Johann II Duke of Saxe Weimar died young but left eight surviving sons who ruled together Three died and a will ordering them to rule jointly Only three survived by 1639 when the lands of the Coburg Eisenach dukes were divided between the Altenburgs and the Weimarsthe remaining brothers finally divided their lands which were twice the size of what they inherited

William kept Weimar Albert became Duke of Eisenach and Ernest the Pious became known as Duke of Gotha

Ernest I Duke of Saxe Gotha had married Elisabeth Sophie the only child of John Philip Duke of Altenburg Elisabeth Sophies cousin Frederick William III Duke of Altenburg died unmarried 1672 He was the last male descendant of the first Saxe Altenburg line

There was a big argument about who should get the Altenburg land In the end most went to Ernest and Elisabeth Sophies sons One quarter the original Altenburglands went to the Saxe Weimar branch 

These two lines Weimar and Gotha form the basis of future Ernestine lines and both have surviving male lineage up to today 

After the division of the first Altenburg lands line the senior Ernestine branch line held just under half of the Ernestine lands and the junior Gotha Altenburg line held more than half Gotha Altenburg line divided more each generation The Weimar line did not subdivide their land and by 1741 all of the land was controlled by the one branch of the Weimar family In 1815 they became Grand Dukes

Duke Ernest of Gotha and Duchess Elisabeth Sophies numerous sons divided the inheritance into seven parts Gotha Altenburg Coburg Meiningen Rmhild Eisenberg Hildburghausen and Saalfeld  The new dukes of Coburg Rmhild and Eisenberg had no children so their lands were quickly absorbed by the four remaining lines

Eventually primogeniture became the rule for inheritance in the Ernestine Duchies

In 1825 the Ernestine duchies were

In 1825 Ernest the Pious senior line the Gotha Altenburg went extinct and the land was redistributed for the last time

Altenburg went to the Duke of Saxe Hildburghausen but he gave Hildburghausen to the Duke of Saxe Meiningen Hildburghausen The duke of Saxe Coburg Saalfeld gave up Saalfeld in return for Gotha All of the Ernestine Duchies ended with the abolition of the monarchy and princely states in Germany shortly after the end of World War I

Five rulers of the Ernestine duchies 

had a vote in the Holy Roman Empires Reichstag In 1792 the Duke of Saxe Weimar was also the Duke of Saxe Eisenach and the Duke of Saxe Altenburg was also the Duke of Saxe Gotha so both had two votes and the Duke of Saxe Coburg had one vote

The other Ernestine duchies were never members of the Imperial Circle and were subordinate to the five duchies that did belong to the Imperial Circle Ultimately in the German Confederation all these became equally sovereign

The Sri Maha Bodhi is a Sacred Fig tree in Anuradhapura Sri Lanka It is said to be a tree grown from a seed from the famous Bodhi tree under which the first Buddha became enlightened It was planted in 288 BC and is the oldest living human planted tree in the world with a known planting date

It was planted on a high terrace about convert65mft1abbron above the ground and surrounded by railings and today it is one of the most sacred objects of the Buddhists in Sri Lanka and respected by Buddhists all over the world This wall was built during the reign of King Kirthi Sri Rajasingha to protect it from wild elephants which might have attacked the tree

The tree is said to be the southern branch of the Jaya Siri Maha Bodhi at Bodh Gaya in India under which the first Buddha attained Enlightenment

In the 3rd century BC the Buddhas fig tree was brought to Sri Lanka by the Their Sangamitta daughter of Emperor Asoka and founder of an order of Buddhist nuns in Sri Lanka 

In 249 BC Jaya Siri Maha Bodhi was planted in the Mahameghavana Park in Anuradhapura by King Devanampiyatissa

Capybara is a semi aquatic rodent of South America It weighs about a hundred pounds and is about two feet tall at the shoulder

The capybara is the worlds largest rodent It is closely related to guinea pigs and to chincillas When capybaras are full grown they weigh about 55 kg or 100 pounds The capybaras stocky body is about a meter or 3 feet long and its shoulder is about 60 centimeters or about two feet high off the ground Females are usually bigger and heavier than males Capybaras have brown or reddish brown fur When they are old their fur is thin their skin can get sunburned easily  Their eyes and ears and nostrils are high on their heads so they can easily be kept above water when the capybara is swimming

Capybaras live in grassy wetlands or close to rivers in many parts of South America  In the morning evening and at night they eat grass mostly on land They spend the hottest hours of the day in the water  They are good swimmers and divers  Webs between their toes help them swim They can only hold their breath under water for about five minutes at a time Sometimes they hide in water for much longer with only their noses sticking out to breathe  Many predators like to eat them They are a favorite food for jaguars eagles anaconda snakes and many other animals  

Capybaras eat plants mostly grass Their babies are usually born in litters of four at one time  They can start to eat grass once they are about a week old but they will also keep nursing from their mothers and even from other grown females until they are about four months old They live in large groups usually 10 30 capybaras together  Some groups have even had 100 capybaras They talk to each other using many sounds clicks grunts whistles and barks 

Capybaras are not endangered  Their population is stable not increasing or decreasing very much Sometimes humans eat capybaras They are hunted for meat and sometimes they are raised on farms Also their tough skin is sometimes used to make high quality leather especially for gloves Some capybaras are even raised as pets like guinea pigsif treated with respect they can become very loyal and rewarding pets

The term insectivore can still be used to describe lifestyle It explains the food habits of this and some other groups of mammals 

Although moles and shrews are not all strictly insectivorous insects and other small animal life make up the main food of most members of the group Some kinds the otter shrews of Africa and the star nosed mole of America for example feed also upon fish The Townsend mole of the Pacific Northwest often is a nuisance to bulb growers because of its fondness for the bulbs of many kinds of plants

Moles as a group are subterranean in habit They spend most of their lives in the darkness of underground tunnels which they dig for themselves The eyes of all moles are very small in some species actually not opening to the outside and of little value to them vestigial organs On the other hand their senses of touch and smell are highly developed

The following groups are now placed in other orders

Antnio de Oliveira Salazar GColIH GCTE GCSE was the Prime Minister and dictator of Portugal from 1932 to 1968 He was the President of the Republic in 1951 as interim He started and led the Estado Novo the authoritarian right wing government that ruled Portugal from 1932 to 1974 

Salazar was born in Vimieiro Santa Comba Do Portugal His father had been a farm worker who became the farm manager for the Perestrelos family His great grandfather had been a landowner and nobleman He studied at the Viseu Seminary from 1900 to 1914 with the hope of becoming a priest He changed his mind and studied Law at University of Coimbra

Following a military revolution in 1926 which overthrew a civilian government of squabbling politicians and a country close to penury Dr Salazar was invited to take control of the finances of the then failed state Dr Salazar was Finance Minister for 13 days resigned in disgust over interference by politicians and soldiers and went back to his university He was again persuaded to take over as Finance Minister in 1928 which he did conditionally on an assurance of greated powers for himself and minimal interference from the military Salazar continued as minister until 1932 and was widely credited with turning the flagging economy around

Dr Salazar was Prime Minister from 1932 until 1968

He ruled Portugal for almost 40 years managing to keep Portugal away from the Second World War and preventing also a Spanish invasion by keeping friends on both sides Salazar died in 1970 Often called a fascist by his opponents Dr Salazars regime was instrumental in issuing Portuguese travel documents to thousands of Jews fleeing though Europe and to Portugal a boarding point for the ultimate destination in North AmericaUnfortunately Dr Salazars contribution to this humanitarian cause was never acknowledged as this activity had to be toned down wound up in the later years of the war Instead Over zealous Consul to France Aristides de Sousa Mendes is often given credit despite the fact that it was he who recklessly endagered the operation by issuing a flood of travel documents in assembly line fashionTens of thousands of such documents were issued by him in the months of June and July of 1940Salazars telegrafic cease and desist orders to Mendes are often highlighted Incidently the USA had issued similar instructions to all its missions abroad many years earlier purportedly because of the fear that Germany would smuggle in spies amongst fleeing Jewish refugees President Hoover ordered US consuls to strictly interpret the LPC clause of the immigration law Franklin Roosevelt failed to push for a change in immigration laws and policy In this context Portugals and Salazars actions may be seen as almost heroic 

A little known fact is that Salazars Portugal was the only European nation at the time to have non white people at all levels of administration and judiciary Dark skinned people termed colonial subjects by other contemporary colonial powers very rarely qualified for rights similar to those enjoyed by the citizens of their colonial masters Portugal accorded its subjects full civil status It was the only State anywhere in the western world to have non European non white Members of Parliament This status was however not universally available to the Blacks of the African territories ie those who were not assimilados which meant those Africans who had not given up their tribal customs nor reached minimum educational standardsRoughly 4 of the African populace was considered assimilado whilst in the people native to the overseas colonies of Cape VerdeIndia and China were considered universally assimilados even though in the latter two territories people were not largely Roman Catholic nor did most speak the Portuguese language

In the mid sixties Portugal and its colonies found themselves in the front line of the Cold war with a proxy war which drained Portugal of its resources Salazar was blamed for a War he had no control over and the consequent impoverishment of his country Thousands from mainland Portugal fled into neighbouring European countries particularly France to avoid the military draft and the war in Africa Most took up menial jobs and were a convinient source of low cost labour to Europe This expatriate segment of society got increasingly empowered after a Military coup overthrew the government of Salazars successor Marcello Caetano in 1974 Many returned to Portugal to become next generation Politicians

The the term fascist regime probably stems from a attempt by this sizable group to demonize the fallen regime and justify their flight from a country at war

Salazar is still loved by some of the people of Portugal today and was voted the greatest Portuguese man of all time Apologists say that it was more as a way of showing frustration with the current political events and politicians in Portugal than actually a true devotionA great segment of the Portuguese people though may beg to differ

In 1945 Portugal had large colonial Empire including Cape Verde Islands So Tom e Principe Angola Portuguese Guinea and Mozambique in Africa Goa Damo and Diu in India Macau in China and Portuguese Timor in Southeast Asia Salazar was determined to keep control of Portugals territories After the war the colonies were in a mess The Indian nationalists in Goa wanted their country to join with the new independent state of India There strikes and protests by the local people against the Portuguese The Indian Armed Forces invaded and took over Goa Daman and Diu in 1961 Revolutions against the Portuguese were started in Mozambique Angola and Portuguese Guinea 

In 1968 Salazar suffered a major stroke reportedly caused by falling from his chair at his summer house President Amrico Thomaz was forced to replace him with Marcelo Caetano on September 27 1968 Salazar died in Lisbon on July 27 1970 Tens of thousands of people went to the funeral and the Requiem Mass and watched the journey of the special train that carried his coffin to his hometown of Santa Comba Do He was buried next to his ancestors and the farmers of the region in a plain ordinary graveDecades as a dictator and Salazars worldly possessions were almost the literal shirt on his back He died without ever having purchased a motor car the modest house he lived in in Lisbon belonged to the State and is reported as having had two pairs of suits in his wardrobe

The Plague of Athens was an epidemic which hit the city state of Athens in ancient Greece during the second year of the Peloponnesian War when an Athenian victory still seemed possible Many historians believe that it entered Athens through Piraeus the citys port and sole source of food and supplies The city state of Sparta and much of the eastern Mediterranean was also struck by the disease The plague returned twice more in 429 BC and in the winter of 4276 BC

The Peloponnesian War was an Ancient Greek military conflict fought by Athens and its allies against the Peloponnesian League led by Sparta 

Athens stood for democracy and Sparta for oligarchy though they fought as much for ecomomic reasons of trade and for the dominance of their respective leagues

Sparta eventually won the Pelopennesian War Athens was never the same again

Athens was the greatest sea power and Sparta the greatest land power in 5th century BC Greece

In the first phase the Archidamian War Sparta launched repeated invasions of Attica while Athens took advantage of its naval supremacy to raid the coast of the Peloponnese attempting to suppress signs of unrest in its empire 

This period of the war ended in 421 BC with the signing of the Peace of Nicias That treaty however was soon undermined by renewed fighting in the Peloponnese In 415 BC Athens dispatched a large force to attack Syracuse in Sicily The attack failed with the destruction of the entire force in 413 BC 

This ushered in the final phase of the war generally referred to either as the Decelean War or the Ionian War In this phase Sparta now receiving support from Persia supported rebellions in Athens subject states in the Aegean Sea and Ionia undermining Athens empire and eventually depriving the city of naval supremacy The destruction of Athens fleet at Aegospotami effectively ended the war and Athens surrendered in the following year 

The Peloponnesian War reshaped the Ancient Greek world Athens the strongest city state in Greece before the war started was reduced to a state of near complete subjection Sparta became the leading power of Greece 

The economic costs of the war were felt all across Greece poverty became widespread in the Peloponnese Athens was completely devastated and never regained its pre war prosperityp488 The war also wrought subtler changes to Greek society the conflict between democratic Athens and oligarchic Sparta each of which supported friendly political factions within other states made civil war a common occurrence in the Greek world 

Greek warfare originally a limited and formalized form of conflict was transformed into an all out struggle between city states complete with atrocities on a large scale Shattering religious and cultural taboos devastating vast swathes of countryside and destroying whole cities the Peloponnesian War marked the dramatic end to the fifth century BC Golden age of Greecexxiii xxiv

Saxe Gotha Altenburg was a country in what is today Thuringia Germany

It was formed in 1672 when Frederick Wilhelm III the last duke of Saxe Altenburg died and Ernest I Duke of Saxe Gotha inherited his possessions

The duchy was split up again after Ernests death in 1675 and the Duchy of Saxe Gotha Altenburg officially came into existence in 1680 when his eldest son Frederick took control of the parts of the country Gotha and Altenburg

When the royal house of Saxe Gotha and Altenburg became extinct in 1825 Saxe Gotha was given to Saxe Coburg Saalfeld and Saxe Altenburg passed to the Duke of Saxe Hildburghausen After the abolition of German monarchies at the end of the First World War both Saxe Gotha and Saxe Altenburg became part of the newly created state of Thuringia in 1920

Although it was very small Saxe Hildburghausen was an independent duchy from 1680 to 1826 In 1684 the duchy changed its capital from Heldburg to Hildburghausen and changed its name to Saxe Hildburghausen

In 1810 a Princess Therese of Saxe Hildburghausen married Crown Prince Ludwig of Bavaria who became king of Bavaria 15 years later The marriage is the reason for the Oktoberfest held annually in Munich

In 1826 the Ernestine duchies were reorganised after the last ruler of Saxe Gotha Altenburg died without an heir The duke of Saxe Hildburghausen gave up his duchy in return for becoming Duke of Saxe Altenburg Hildburghausen was given to Saxe Meiningen Hildburghausen was not one of the duchies in the Imperial circle Altenburg was so by swapping his land the duke gained in social rank even though the Holy Roman Empire no longer existed

In 1868 four districts were established in the duchy of Saxe Meiningen Hildburghausen was one of these districts with boundaries very similar to those of the former duchy It remained almost unchanged until 1993 when the former district of Suhl was dissolved and most of its municipalities joined the district

The House of Wettin was a dynasty of German counts dukes prince electors and kings that ruled in what is known today as the German states of Saxony and Thuringia for more than 800 years Members of the Wettin family were also kings of Poland as well as forming the ruling houses of Great Britain Portugal Bulgaria Poland Saxony and Belgium Today only the British and Belgian lines still rule their countries but the last Tsar of Bulgaria Simeon II was Prime Minister of Bulgaria between 2001 and 2005 Simeon Saxe Coburg Gotha is the only ex king who has ever returned to his country as an elected leader

The House split into two main branches the Ernestine and the Albertine The descendants of Ernest often subdivided their land and ended up with a lot of small duchies but one became very important Ernests younger brother was Albert His descendants became Electors of Saxony and in 1806 Kings of Saxony

Durham is a city in the North East of England It is within the County Durham local government district and is the county town of the larger ceremonial county It lies to the south of Newcastle Upon Tyne Chester le Street and Sunderland and to the north of Darlington

Durham is well known for its Norman Cathedral and 11th century castle and is home to Durham University HM Prison Durham is also close to the city centre Durham Castle and Cathedral is a UNESCO World Heritage Site

Archeological evidence shows settlement in the area since 2000 BC The present city can clearly be traced back to AD 995 when a group of monks from Lindisfarne chose to settle there with the body of Saint Cuthbert which had previously lain in Chester le Street

Before the Reformation the shrine of Saint Cuthbert behind the High Altar of Durham Cathedral was the most important religious site in England until the martyrdom of St Thomas Becket at Canterbury

Despite a brief translation back to Holy Island during the Norman Invasion the saints relics remain enshrined to the present day Saint Bedes bones are also entombed in the cathedral drawing the mediaeval pilgrim to the city

Durhams geographical position has always given it an important position in the defence of England against the Scots The city has played an important part in the defence of the north and Durham Castle is the only Norman castle keep never to have suffered a breach The Battle of Nevilles Cross which took place near the city on 17 October 1346 between the English and Scots was the most famous battle of its age

As the north east was so far from Westminster the bishops of Durham enjoyed extraordinary powers They had the ability to hold their own parliament raise their own armies appoint their own sheriffs and Justices administer their own laws levy taxes and customs duties create fairs and markets issue charters salvage shipwrecks collect revenue from mines administer the forests and mint their own coins 

Basically William the Conqueror delegated many powers to bishops in the furthest reaches of England They were his men and most had fought at the Battle of Hastings This style of delegation ran for many centuries afterwards This applied especially in the north and west of England which were several days ride from London

So far reaching were the bishops powers that the steward of Bishop Anthony Bek commented in 1299 AD 

All this activity was administrated from the castle and buildings surrounding the Palace Green 

Every Bishop of Durham from 1071 to 1836 was a Prince Bishop except for the first Norman appointed Bishop Walcher who was styled an Earl Bishop The last Prince Bishop of Durham Bishop William Van Mildert founded Durham University Henry VIII cut some of the Prince Bishops powers and in 1538 ordered the destruction of the shrine of Saint Cuthbert

The Prince Bishops also had their own court system most notably the Durham Court of Chancery The county also had its own attorney general whose authority to bring an indictment for criminal matters was tested by central government in the infamous case of Rex v Mary Ann Cotton The courts and judicial posts for the county were finally abolished in 1873

One of Thucydides major innovations was to use a strict standard of chronology recording events by year each year consisting of the summer campaigning season and a less active winter season As a result events that span several years are divided up and described in parts of the book that are sometimes quite distant from one another causing the impression that he is oscillating between the various theatres of conflict This method contrasts sharply with Herodotus earlier work The Histories which jumps around chronologically

Another feature of the work is that Thucydides writes dozens of speeches of the most important figures who were engaged in the war Thucydides heard some of these speeches himself but some of the speeches he wrote without knowing exactly what was really spoken

Thucydides wanted his writings to last for ever Therefore he tried to be as neutral as possible though as general of Athens that was difficult for him

The gods play no active role in Thucydides work This is very different to Herodotus who frequently mentions the role of the gods Instead Thucydides regards history as being caused by the choices and actions of human beings

The History concentrates on the military aspects of the Peloponnesian War but it uses these events as a medium to suggest several other themes as well for instance to show broken wikt linkdegenerativedegenerative effects of war on humanity itself For the most part the History does not discuss topics such as the art and architecture of Greece but speaks of the development of military technologies rather often 

The History explains that the cause of the Peloponnesian War was the growth in power of Athens and the alarm which this inspired in Sparta The Spartans represent a more traditional and less expansive power 

Thucydides almost never names his informants This is in contrast to Herodotus who frequently mentions multiple versions of his stories and allows the reader to decide which is true 

Thucydides History has been enormously influential in both ancient and modern historiography 

Historiography is about the writing of history and the use of historical methods Thus it looks at authors sources interpretation style bias and audience The word historiography can also refer to a body of historical work

Written history appeared first with the ancient Greeks whose historians greatly contributed to the development of historical methodology The very first historical works were The Histories composed by Herodotus of Halicarnassus who became later known as the father of history  Thucydides was the first to distinguish between cause and immediate origins of an event and his successor Xenophon introduced autobiographical elements and character studies in his Anabasis 

The Romans adopted the Greek tradition becoming the first people to write history in a non Greek language The most famous writers are Julius Caesars Bellum Gallicum Livy who records the rise of Rome from city state to world dominion Plutarch and Suetonius introduced biography as a branch of history Tacitus citicizes Roman immorality by praising German virtues

Writing history was popular among Christian monks and clergy in the Middle Ages They wrote about the history of Jesus Christ the Church and of their patrons the dynastic history of the local rulers In the Early Middles Ages historical writing often took the form of annals or chronicles recording events year by year but this style tended to hampered the analysis of events and causes An example of this type of writing are Anglo Saxon Chronicles which were the work of several different writers and start during the reign of Alfred the Great in the late 9th century and one copy of which was still being updated in 1154

History was written about states or nations during the Renaissance The study of history changed during the Enlightenment and Romanticism Voltaire described the history of certain ages that were important according to him instead of describing events in a chronological order History became an independent discipline It was not called philosophia historiae anymore but merely history

Modern historiography began with Leopold Ranke in the 19th century who was very critical on the sources used in history The French Annales School radically changed history during the 20th century Fernand Braudel wanted history to become more scientific by demanding more mathematical evidence in history in order to make the history discipline less subjective Furthermore he added a social economic and geographic framework to answer historical questions Other French historians like Philippe Aris and Michel Foucault described history of daily life topics such as death and sexuality They wanted history to be written about all topics and that all questions should be asked 

The idea of the historical journal a forum where academic historians could exchange ideas came into being in the nineteenth century The early journals were similar to those used in the physical sciences and were seen as a means by which history could be professionalised Journals also helped historians to establish various historiographical approaches the most notable example of which was Annales conomies Socits Civilisations a publication instrumental in establishing the Annales School

The question of how a historian approaches historical events is one of the most important questions within historiography It is commonly recognised by historians that in themselves individual historical facts are not particularly meaningful Such facts will only become useful when assembled with other historical evidence and the process of assembling this evidence is understood as a particular historiographical approach 

Some of the more common historigraphical approaches are

Determinism means that historians view history as being more caused by certain factors than other factors The two most common types of determinism are geographic determinism and economic determinism Geographic deteminism means that historians think history is mostly caused by geography Frederick Jackson Turner thought that Economic determinism means that historians think history is mostly caused by economics Charles Beard thought that Other historians believe that history is caused mostly by politics or mostly by a struggle for natural rights but these are not usually called determinism

The historical method are the techniques and guidelines by which historians use primary sources and other evidence to research and then to write history 

Following Garraghan puts six questions that should be answered as minimal standard for a sound historicakl method

In historiography and other areas of scholarship a primary source is a document recording or other source of information that was created at the time that is studied Usually it was produced by someone with direct personal knowledge of the events that are described 

It is used as an original source of information about the topic Primary sources are distinguished from secondary sources which often build upon primary sources

Source could mean

A secondary source is a document or recording that writes or speaks about information that was originally presented elsewhere This information is called primary source or original source of the information 

Secondary sources often involve generalization analysis synthesis interpretation or evaluation of the original information

In historiography a secondary source is a study written by a scholar about a topic and using primary sources and other secondary sources 

An example of a secondary source is the biography of a historical figure in which the author tells the story on the basis of many primary source documents such as letters diaries newspaper accounts photographs and official records A scholarly secondary source is familiar with the existing secondary literature and seeks to engage it in terms of arguments and evidence Most but not all secondary sources use extensive citation

Secondary sources are often used in common law to allow judges to determine what is actually meant by the language of a particular statute See legislative intent

Breinigerberg is a small village in the West of Germany the state of North Rhine Westphalia About 972 people live at the place It is close to the Naturpark Nordeifel a large forest area in Germany Belgium and the Netherlands

The road L12 passes through Breinigerberg splitting it into two parts 

In the last two centuries Breinigerberg was famous for mining Even the ancient Romans dug for ore in the area It was used for the production of brass in the city of Stolberg Today there is no more mining but the remains are still present Big holes in the Schlangenberg area prove what had been left from the past Today the Schlangenberg is a natural reserve protecting rare flowers and insects

A document is a piece of information that one can use for communicating something In most of the cases it is a paper that contains information in the form of ink marks But nowadays documents can be digital as well 

To document means to produce an object by collecting and representing information

What most people understand when they speak of a document one can see from the connotations and denotations that appear in a search for document From these usages one can infer the following typical connotations

Technology to manage documents has developed with documents themselves Of particular importances are practices concerning the preservation archival destruction and management of documents These together are called the document life cycle

Object could mean

The International Standard Book Number ISBN is a unique commercial book identifier barcode The ISBN system was created in the United Kingdom in 1966 by the booksellers and stationers WH Smith 

Originally it was the 9 digit Standard Book Numbering code and still was used in 1974 it was adopted as the international standard ISO 2108 in 1970 A similar numeric identifier the International Standard Serial Number identifies periodical publications such as magazines Since January 1 2007 ISBNs are of 13 digits like in Bookland EAN 13 The TC 46SC 9 is responsible for the standard

An ISBN is given to each edition and variation of a book The ISBN is 13 digits long if assigned after January 1 2007 and 10 digits long if assigned before 2007 An International Standard Book Number consists of 4 or 5 parts

The ISBN parts may be of different lengths and usually are separated with hyphens or spaces 

The group identifier code number is 0 or 1 for English speaking countries 2 for French speaking countries 3 for German speaking countries 4 for Japanese 5 for Russian et cetera The original standard book number had no group identifier but affixing a zero as prefix to a 9 digit SBN creates a valid 10 digit ISBN The group identifier may be up to 5 digits long eg 99936 is a group identifier for the country Bhutan

The national ISBN agency assigns the publisher number the publisher selects the item number Generally a book publisher is not required to assign an ISBN nor for a book to display its number however most book stores only handle ISBN bearing merchandise 

A listing of all the 628000 assigned publisher codes is published and can be ordered in book form but as of 2007 it costs US300 The web site of the international ISBN agency does not offer any free method of looking up publisher codes

Recording means to capture data to store it on a storage medium or record

Historical records of events have been made for thousands of years Amongst the earliest are cave painting runic alphabets and ideograms Technology continues to provide and expand means for human beings to record their thoughts feelings and experiences

A storage medium is a device for recording information Recording can be done using virtually any form of energy

A storage device may hold information process information or both A device that only holds information is a recording medium

Electronic data storage is storage which requires electrical power to store and get back that data Most storage devices that do not require visual optics to read data fall into this category Electronic data may be stored in either an analog or digital signal format

An organic brain may or may not be considered a data storage device 

All information is data However not all data is information

Any inputoutput equipment may be considered data storage equipment if it writes to and reads from a data storage medium Data storage equipment uses either

The following are examples of those methods

A recording medium is a physical material that holds data expressed in any of the existing recording formats With electronic media the data and the recording medium is sometimes referred to as software despite the more common use of the word to describe computer software

A typical way to classify data storage media is to consider its shape and type of movement relative to the readwrite device of the storage apparatus as listed

Pedro Santana is a municipality in the Dominican Republic in the Elas Pia Province on the border with Haiti It has a total area of 23990 km

The limits of the municipality are the Dajabn province to the northwest the Santiago Rodrguez province to the northeast the San Juan province to the east the municipality of Bnica to the south and Haiti to the west

The municipality had in 2002 a total population of 4043 2207 men and 1836 women The urban population was 2926 of the total population

The old small town of Los Cercadillos was elevated with the present name to the category of municipal district of Bnica on 16 September 1942 and to the category of municipality by the Law 3208 of 3 March 1952

The city and municipality was named after Pedro Santana general of the Independence wars and first president of the Dominican Republic He was born in Hincha now a Haitian city close to the border

The main economic activity of the municipality is agriculture

The visual system is the part of the nervous system which allows organisms to see It interprets the information from visible light to build a representation of the world surrounding the body The visual system has the complex task ofconstructing a three dimensional world from a two dimensional projection of that world The psychological manifestation of visual information is known as visual perception

This article mostly describes the visual system of mammals although other higher animals have similar visual systems In this case the visual system consists of

Different species are able to see different parts of the light spectrum for example bees can see into the ultraviolet while pit vipers can accurately target prey with their infrared imaging sensors

In psychology visual perception is the ability to interpret visible light information reaching the eyes which is then made available for planning and action 

The resulting perception is also known as eyesight sight or vision The components that are necessary for vision are known as the visual system

The major problem in visual perception is that what people see is not simply a translation of the image on the retina Therefore it was difficult to explain what visual processing does to create what we actually see 

The breakthrough came with Ibn al Haytham the father of optics In his Book of Optics in the 1000s he argued that vision occurs in the brain rather than the eyes He pointed out that personal experience has an effect on what people see and how they see and that vision and perception are subjective He explained possible errors in vision in detail and as an example describes how a small child with less experience may have more difficulty interpreting what heshe sees He also gives an example of an adult that can make mistakes in vision because of how ones experience suggests that heshe is seeing one thing when heshe is really seeing something else

Ibn al Haythams investigations and experiments on visual perception also included sensation variations in sensitivity sensation of touch perception of colours perception of darkness the psychological explanation of the moon illusion and binocular vision

An analog or analogue signal is any continuous signal 

The difference from a digital signal is that also very small fluctuations in the signal are meaningful When one speaks of analog one often means an electrical context however mechanical pneumatic hydraulic and other systems may also convey analog signals

An analog signal uses some property of the medium to convey the signals information Any information may be conveyed by an analog signal often such a signal is a measured change in physical phenomena such as sound light temperature position or pressure

For example in sound recording fluctuations in air pressure strike the diaphragm of a microphone which causes corresponding fluctuations in a voltage or the current in an electric circuit The voltage or the current is said to be an analog of the sound

See digital for a discussion of digital vs analog

A microphone sometimes referred to as a mike or mic converts sound into an electrical signal 

Microphones are used in many applications such as telephones tape recorders hearing aids motion picture production live and recorded audio engineering in radio and television broadcasting and in computers for recording voice

Sound passes through the air in waves and as was said above the microphone turns this into an electrical wave Different kinds of microphones will turn the sound waves into electricity in different ways

Dynamic Microphone  A Dynamic Microphone uses a round plastic or rubber disk connected to a wire coil in order to turn sound into electricity  Basically the sound wave will hit the disk which vibrates as a result This vibration will move the coil back and forth near a magnet very quickly in order to create an electrical current This is the exact opposite of a speaker which uses an electrical current to move the coil which moves the disk Then the disk makes sound

Condenser Microphone  A condenser microphone uses two small metal plates to create an electrical current Basically two small metal plates are placed right next to each other and electricity is run through the plates This creates an electric field in between the two plates When sound hits these plates the plates vibrate The vibration makes small changes in the electric field These changes create the electrical signal 

Ribbon Microphone  This is somewhat similar to a Dynamic microphone You take a thin small sheet of metal and place it in between two magnets When sound hits the thin piece of metal the metal vibrates That vibration creates an electrical signal in the metal

Digital signal can mean two different things discrete time signals that are digitized or to the waveform signals in a digital system

Digital signals are digital representations of discrete time signals which are often produced by changing an analog signal

An analog signal is a datum that changes over time A discrete time signal is a sampled version of an analog signal the value of the datum is noted at fixed intervals rather than continuously

In short a digital signal is a quantized discrete time signal a discrete time signal is a sampled analog signal

In the digital revolution the usage of digital signals has increased significantly Many modern media devices especially the ones that connect with computers use digital signals to represent signals that were traditionally represented as analog signals cell phones music and video players personal video recorders and digital cameras are examples

In most applications digital signals are represented as binary numbers so their precision of quantization is measured in bits

In computer architecture and other digital systems a waveform that switches between two voltage levels representing the two states of a Boolean value is referred to as a digital signal even though it is an analog voltage waveform since it is interpreted in terms of only two levels

The clock signal is a special digital signal that is used to synchronize digital circuits The image shown can be considered the waveform of a clock signal Logic changes are triggered either by the rising edge or the falling edge

Pneumatics is the use of pressurized air for mechanical motion  It is used in different contexts 

Pneumatic transfer systems are employed in many industries to move powders and devices Pneumatic devices are also used where electric motors cannot be used for safety reasons such as deep in a mine where explosive dust or gases may be present

electricity

Both pneumatics and hydraulics are applications of fluid power Pneumatics uses air which is compressible while hydraulics uses relatively incompressible liquid media such as oil or water 

It was created in 1640 for Duke Ernest I and ended in 1680 when his lands were divided after his death in 1675 The area around Gotha passed to Ernests eldest surviving son Frederick of Saxe Gotha Altenburg who also inherited Altenburg and became Duke of Saxe Gotha Altenburg

When the house of Saxe Gotha and Altenburg became extinct in 1825 Saxe Gotha Altenburg was split Saxe Gotha passed to the Duke of Saxe Coburg Saalfeld who in turn gave Saalfeld to Saxe Meiningen The Duke of Saxe Hildburghausen became Duke of Saxe Altenburg and gave Saxe Hildburghausen to Saxe Meiningen

After the abolition of German monarchies at the end of the First World War it became a part of the newly created state of Thuringia in 1920

Seafloor spreading happens at the bottom of an ocean as tectonic plates move apart The seafloor moves and carries continents with it At ridges in the middle of oceans new oceanic crust is created 

At the Mid Atlantic Ridge material from the upper mantle rises through the faults between oceanic plates to form new crust as the plates move away from each other The new crust then slowly moves away from the ridge Seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in plate tectonics

Earlier theories of continental drift were that continents plowed through the ocean The idea that the ocean floor itself moves and carries the continents with it as it expands from a central axis was by Harry Hess of Princeton University Today it is accepted The phenomenon is caused by convection in the weak upper mantle or asthenosphere

A mid ocean ridge is an underwater mountain system This consists of mountain chains with a rift valley running along its spine formed by plate tectonics A mid ocean ridge marks the boundary between two tectonic plates which are moving apart

The mid ocean ridges of the world are connected and form a single global mid oceanic ridge system that is part of every ocean The mid oceanic ridge system is the longest mountain range in the world The continuous mountain range is convert65000kmmi 2abbron long It is several times longer than the Andes the longest continental mountain range The total length of the oceanic ridge system is convert80000kmmi 2abbron long

Mid ocean ridges are geologically active with new magma constantly emerging onto the ocean floor and into the crust at and near rifts along the ridge axes The crystallized magma forms new crust of basalt and gabbro

The rocks making up the crust below the sea floor are youngest at the axis of the ridge and age with increasing distance from that axis New magma of basalt composition emerges at and near the axis because of decompression melting in the underlying Earths mantle

The oceanic crust is made up of rocks much younger than the Earth itself oceanic crust in the ocean basins is everywhere less than 200 million years old The crust is in a constant state of renewal at the ocean ridges Moving away from the mid ocean ridge ocean depth progressively increases the greatest depths are in ocean trenches As the oceanic crust moves away from the ridge axis the peridotite in the underlying mantle cools and becomes more rigid The crust and the relatively rigid peridotite below it make up the oceanic lithosphere

Slow spreading ridges like the Mid Atlantic Ridge have large wide rift valleys sometimes as big as 10 20 km wide and very rugged terrain at the ridge crest By contrast fast spreading ridges like the East Pacific Rise are narrow sharp incisions surrounded by generally flat topography that slopes away from the ridge over many hundreds of miles

The Dominican city of Comendador is the head municipality of the Elas Pia province on the border with Haiti

The municipality had in 2002 a total population of 25475 12574 men and 12901 women The urban population was 4471 of the total population In this numbers are included the population of the municipal districts Guayabo and Sabana Larga The population of Comendador without its municipal districts was 18936

The city was founded in 1868 and named after Nicols de Ovando the Comendador of Lares It was founded where there was a military post close to the border with Haiti The Tano name of the region was Duan

There was several fights between Haitian and Dominican soldiers during the Dominican Haitian War after 1844 The most important fight was the La Estrelleta Battle in a savanna near Comendador

The old military post was made a Cantn of the Azua province in 1907 The next year in 1908 it was elevated to the category of Municipality of the same province

Its name was changed to Villa Elas Pia on 29 November 1930 In 1972 its name was changed back to Comendador

Comendador is at 255 km to the west of Santo Domingo and 55 km of San Juan de la Maguana The average temperature in the city is 267C and the average rainfall is 18281 mm

The limits of the municipality are the municipality of Bnica to the north the San Juan province to the east the municipality of El Llano to the south and Haiti to the west

Comendador has two municipal districts these are Guayabo and Sabana Larga

The main economic activity of the municipality is agriculture Commerce with Haiti is also an important economic activity in the city

Antoni Lange was a Polish poet translator and mystic philosopher of the Symbolism and Parnassianism movements He was regarded as a great master of reflective poetry He spoke 15 languages His pen names were Antoni Wrzesie and Napierski Although Lange was not a particularly famed author many people call him a magican of lyrical form because of his unquestionable mastery in using rare poetic forms and innovations which makes him a pioneer of modern collage and even imagism movement 

As a religious thinker Lange was one of the first to make people interested in Indian philosophy and literature in Poland His existential reflection of universal pain unites Christian mysticism with traditions of Buddhism

Lange was also an uncle of the poet Bolesaw Lemian

He was born in 1861 or 1863 into a patriotic Jewish family who were heavily influenced by the messianic ideals of Romantic Polish poets especially Adam Mickiewicz In 1830 his father Henri Lange took part in the November Uprising

Langes own poems did not win him recognition and the last phase of his life was poisoned by feelings of bitterness He never married and had no children

The Lords Prayer is the best known prayer in the Christian religion It is also known as the Our Father and Pater noster It was not until the Protestant Reformation that it was called the Lords Prayer

The prayer is spoken in two places in the New Testament of the Bible Jesus disciples asked him how they should pray Jesus gave an example of how to pray to Father God 

The Bible has been translated into English several times Therefore there are slightly different versions that are used The traditional and one of the best known versions is the translation from the Book of Common Prayer 

The Latin version has been very important in Church history It is given below

The best know version of the text in found in Luke Its Greek original is given below

Many composers have written musical scores of the prayer Some of them are

Luigi Cherubini Martin Luther E Nomine Die Toten Hosen Charles Gounod Leo Janek Franz Liszt Giacomo Meyerbeer Otto Nicolai Bernardino Rizzi Igor Stravinsky Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky Leonard Bernstein and Giuseppe Verdi

Maybe the most modern version was done by Shne Mannheims in 2004

In Anglican church music a Service is a piece of music for the choir to sing during a service of worship  It uses the words which are a traditional part of the service The choir is usually accompanied by the organ but sometimes it can be just for choir without organ

  

In Morning Prayer the words which are set to music for the choir are the words of the Venite the Te Deum and the Jubilate or Benedictus

For a Holy Communion the set words will usually be the Gloria sometimes the Creed Sanctus Agnus Dei as well as responses

For Evening Prayer the words will be the Magnificat and the Nunc Dimittis Singers in the choir often call these Mag and Nunc for short Many composers have set these words They make them into a piece for choir which is like an anthem

In the Tudor and early Stuart periods services were described as Short Great or Verse services Short services were short the words were only sung once and it was often unaccompanied A Great service was longer some of the words were often sung many times William Byrd wrote a famous Great Service A Verse service was also long there were several verses which need to be sung by a solo choir member In between each verse there is some music for the whole choir to sing

A Van de Graaff generator is an electrostatic machine It uses a moving belt to accumulate very high voltages on a hollow metal globe The potential differences achieved in modern Van de Graaff generators can reach 5 megavolts Applications for these high voltage generators include driving X ray tubes accelerating electrons to sterilize food and process materials and accelerating protons for nuclear physics experiments The Van de Graaff generator can be thought of as a constant current source connected in parallel with a capacitor and a very large electrical resistance It is named after the United States American physicist Robert Jemison Van de Graaff who built the first generators of this style in 1929

A Time server is a special computer in a Computer network 

It is important that computer on a network have a common idea of time Time servers are computers with special software on them They either use an atomic clock or they ask other computers on the network about the time They then make this time available to all the other computers in the same network Common protocols used to do this are the DAYTIME protocol and the Network Time Protocol

NTP calls the quality of a time server its stratum Stratum can be anything form 0 to 255 and lower is better It is rare to see a network with a source worse than stratum 5

Every level you add of time servers getting information from a source close to the master clock and passing it farther away from the master clock increases the stratum level

Mafic is an adjective describing a silicate mineral or rock which is rich in magnesium and iron The term is a portmanteau made up from magnesium and ferric 

Mafic minerals are usually dark in color and have a specific gravity greater than 3 Common rock forming mafic minerals include olivine pyroxene amphibole biotite and other micas augite and the calcium rich plagioclase feldspars Common mafic rocks include basalt and gabbro

In terms of chemistry mafic rocks are on the other side of the rock spectrum from the so called felsic rocks The term roughly corresponds to the older basic rock class

Mafic lava before cooling has a lower viscosity than felsic lava due to its lower silica content Water and other volatiles can more easily and gradually escape from mafic lava so eruptions of volcanoes made of mafic lavas are less explosively violent than felsic lava eruptions Most mafic lava volcanoes are oceanic volcanoes like Hawaii

Specific Gravity is a special case of relative density

SG is by definition dimensionless and therefore not dependent on the system of units used insofar as the units are consistent Based on the SG value of a given substance the density of that substance can be calculated

The Rosetta Stone is a stone with carved writing on it that was discovered in Egypt in 1799 It helped people get a better understanding of the Ancient Egyptian writing system called hieroglyphics This stone helped historians who were trying to find out more about Ancient Egypt Its discovery led to the translation of Ancient Egyptian writing The stone is named after the city where it was found Rosetta Today that city is called Rashid The stone is now in the British Museum in London

Fluid mechanics is the study of how fluids move and the forces on them 

Fluid mechanics can be divided into fluid statics the study of fluids at rest and fluid dynamics the study of fluids in motion It is a branch of continuum mechanics a subject which models matter without using the information that it is made out of atoms 

The study of fluid mechanics goes back at least to the days of ancient Greece when Archimedes made a beginning on fluid statics However fluid mechanics especially fluid dynamics is an active field of research with many unsolved or partly solved problems Fluid mechanics can be mathematically complex Sometimes it can best be solved by numerical methods typically using computers A modern discipline called Computational Fluid Dynamics is devoted to this approach to solving fluid mechanics problems 

Fluid mechanics is a subdiscipline of continuum mechanics as illustrated in the following table

Fluid statics is the science of fluids at rest and is a sub field within fluid mechanics The term usually refers to the mathematical treatment of the subject It embraces the study of the conditions under which fluids are at rest in stable equilibrium The use of fluid to do work is called hydraulics and the science of fluids in motion is fluid dynamics

Saxe Eisenach changed again in 1672 Frederick William III of Saxe Altenburg died and his lands were split The line of Johann Georg I ruled Saxe Eisenach for 69 years until Duke Wilhelm Heinrich died heirless in 1741 Ernst August I of Saxe Weimar Wilhelms second cousin inherited Saxe Eisenach he and his successors ruled Saxe Weimar and Saxe Eisenach in a personal union until 1809 when the duchies were formally merged into the Duchy of Saxe Weimar Eisenach

A herbaceous plant is a plant that does not have much wood and its stems are green and soft These plants grow fast and produce flowers and many seeds in a short period of time

In Botany the word for a herbaceous plant is herb but it is common to use the word herb only for plants that are used in perfumes medicines and for cooking even if they are not herbaceous plants

Herbaceous plants may be annuals biennials or perennials but most are annuals and die at the end of their growing season leaving their seeds on the soil those seeds will produce new plants with good weather Wheat and pea are annual herbaceous plants

Biennial and perennial herbaceous plants will live for two or more years but the stems that are in the air will die every year the underground stems will form the new aerial stems Underground roots and stems can resist more the bad weather than leaves and stems that are above the ground Bulbs are biennal and peonies are perennial herbaceous plants

Most herbaceous plants are small and their stems are not thick because they do not have much wood but there are some cases of big herbaceous plants Bananas and papaya are herbaceous plants but they look like trees papaya has a thick stem but without much wood

Herbaceous plants are the first plants with flower that come to live in barren lands because they are small and produce many seed They are also found in places where the weather conditions are not good for most plants they can use the little rain that falls in deserts and they can get enough heat to grow where the soil is covered with snow and ice most of the year like in very high mountains

On August 28 2006 Nickel Creek announced on their website that they would not be together as a band anymore The message was

The Six Day War was a war that started on June 5 1967 and ended June 10 1967 The fight was between Israel and Egypt Jordan and Syria but many other countries helped out the different sides

The war began because Egypt planned to capture Israel seen by the Arab world as an illegitimate state and because they dreamed of liberating a Palestinian state led to the following war and because of fear of an attack from Israel as suggested by soviet intelligence and from internal pressure Egypt Syria and Jordan gathered troops and prepared for battle while Arab authorities made clear their intentions for the destruction of Israel Israel began the mounting precautionary troops against their borders with Syria Egypt and Jordan as their prime reason This was described as a preemptive or first strike against the Egyptians This attack was against the Egyptian airfields The Egyptians had 50 runways and about 960 attack craft but Israelis had 300 attack craft so Israel attacked while Egypts planes were still on the ground In three hours nearly the entire Egyptian air force was wiped out This surprised the Egyptians and Israel went on to attack on the ground and claim victory Israel was then attacked by Syria and Jordan and defeated them quickly The entire war took only six days from beginning to end which is how it got its name As a result Israel claimed lands which that had great strategical and historical importance for Israel Eventually Israel returned the Sinai to Egypt but kept the lands acquired from Jordan under military control and started building settlements The UN has requested Israel retreat to the pre 1967 borders and to help form an Arab Palestinian state and negotiations have been taken place for the planning of a future Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank although constant fighting has punctuated peace talks in that region
