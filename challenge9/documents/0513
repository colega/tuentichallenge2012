Sebastian Aguilera de Heredia was a Spanish organist and composer

We do not know much about his life He described himself once as a Saragossan priest so he may have meant that he was born in Saragossa or just that he worked there In 1585 he became organist at Huesca Cathedral In 1603 he became a priest and organist at the Cathedral of La Seo Saragossa He looked after the organ at the cathedral and often had work done to improve it All his compositions were for the church both his organ music and vocal music His organ works show that he learned from composers such as Antonio de Cabezn but he put new modern ideas in his music which later influenced younger composers such as Correa de Arauxo

A very important new technique which he used was the use of a divided keyboard which allowed different sounds in the upper half and the lower half of the keyboard He wrote 36 settings of the Magnificat His vocal work shows a skilful use of polyphony

Hunger is the feeling of wanting to eat The opposite of hunger is called satiety or fullness The feeling is started in the hypothalamus and hormones are released from the liver People who have eaten can survive weeks without eating but they will start to feel hungry after they have not eaten for a few hours Hunger is generally considered quite uncomfortable People who have eaten food usually will feel less hungry or not hungry at all People can live longer without food than without water

   Hunger is also used to refer to people who generally have little to eat and are therefore often hungry

Chanakya was an adviser and a prime minister to Chandragupta Maurya Chanakya helped Chandragupta create the Maurya Empire Chanakya is considered a pioneer in economics He wrote about economics a very long time before Ibn Khaldun

He is generally called Chanakya but in his capacity as author of the Arthahstra is generally referred to as Kautilya derived from his gotras name KOTIL He believed in four ways Treating with Equality Enticement Punishment or War and Sowing Dissension The Arthahstra identifies its author by the name Kautilya except for one verse which refers to him by the name Vishnugupta One of the earliest Sanskrit literatures to explicitly identify Chanakya with Vishnugupta was Vishnu Sarmas Panchatantra in the 3rd century BC

Junipers is the name for a number of species of coniferous plants in the genus Juniperus They are related to the family Cupressaceae There are between 50 and 67 species of juniper Junipers grow in the northern hemisphere 

Junipers are evergreen They vary in size from low shrubs to tall trees which grow to between twenty and forty metres tall The female trees have seed cones which form something resembling a berry These berries are called juniper berries They take from six to eighteen months to grow after pollination are often aromatic and can be used as a spice

The juniper berry is the female seed cone made by the different kinds of junipers It is not a true berry but its unusual fatness and scales make it like a berry Some of the cones are used as spices Juniper berries are also used to flavour gin According to a FAO document juniper berries are the only spice that comes from conifers However tar and bark from pine trees are sometimes thought of as spices too

Boeremusiek is a kind of South African instrumental folk music Its was made to go with social dancing at parties and festivals

Boeremusiek is from Europe It was brought to South Africa and changed into its own style It is thought to have got to South Africa by British Empire military bands

Every artist or band comes up with their own sound and style They make up their own style by playing different types of concertinas and using different instruments in the band 

A concertina is similar to an accordion and is the lead instrument in most Boeremusiek bands There are many different types of concertinas which is why Boeremusiek has so many sounds and styles and the construction the concertina is what makes the different sounds in the Boeremusiek band it depends on where the slots and holes are put makes the difference on the sound that the concertina makes 

Other instruments that might be in a Boeremusiek band are piano accordions button harmonicas accordions pianos harmoniums and the guitar Sometimes a cello or bass guitar may be seen 

Today there are many successful Boeremusiek bands that have recorded albums Some famous bands and individual artists today are Klipwerf Boereorkes Danie Grey Nico Carstens Taffie Kikkilus Brian Nieuwoudt Samuel Petzer Worsie Visser and Die Ghitaar Man

The Military Merit Cross was a decoration of the Empire of Austria and after the establishment of the Dual Monarchy in 1867 the Empire of Austria Hungary It was first established on 22 October 1849 and underwent several revisions to its design and award criteria over the years of its existence It became obsolete in 1918 with the fall of the Austro Hungarian Empire

The Boy Scouts of America or BSA is an organization for children and teens with over 5 million members across the United States They try to give young people life values

Boy Scouts are ages 11 17 and belong to troops groups of Scouts associated with a church school or post Cub Scouts are scouts ages 6 10 and belong to packs Cub Scouts include Tigers Wolfs Bears and Webelos Older Scouts can be Venturer Scouts

The Boy Scouts of America were founded by American writer W D Boyce in 1910 but were similar to Scouting groups in Great Britain and other early scout movements  James E West helped out the BSA in its early years but also made the BSA more religious than scouts were in Europe Scouting grew in the 1910s and 20s due to the rise of boys books devoted to Scouting and the First World War Scouting had many members during the 1960s but has declined since the 1970s despite an attempt to make scouting modern by changing requirements and adding more merit badges

Over the years the BSA has taken some stands that many Americans did not like These included being against unions in the 1920s requiring Scouts to believe in God and not allowing gays to join Scouting

When a scout joins a troop he gets the Scout Badge After that he can earn rank There are six ranks in the Boy Scouts Tenderfoot 2nd Class 1st Class Star Life and Eagle The first three focus on learning basic scout skills including camping cooking swimming first aid citizenship orienteering and pioneering The final three focus on earning merit badges serving the troop and serving the community Eagle Scouts must plan and finish a project that benefits something other than Scouting and earn 21 merit badges Only about 2 or 3 of Scouts earn Eagle but some of the ones that have include Gerald Ford and Neil Armstrong

A bowler is a person who bowls a ball to the batsman in the game of cricket This is similar to the pitcher in a game of baseball A bowler who can also bat well is called an all rounder There are different types of bowler and a cricket team will usually have a mix of different types

A fast bowler uses simple speed to defeat a batsman They can send the ball to the batsman at a speed of 145 kmh They take a long run up before bowling each ball to build speed Shoaib Akhtar of Pakistan was the first to bowl at a speed of 160 kmh Another famous fast bowler is Australian Brett Lee

A medium pace bowler bowls more slowly They often use other tricks to defeat the batsman They can get the ball able to curve in the air or change the speed or length to fool the batsman Some are very accurate so they can repeatedly send the ball to a place which forces the batsman to defend rather than scoring runs Others grip the ball so that it lands on its seam this makes the path of the ball unpredictable

A spin bowler usually bowls quite slowly and puts a lot of spin on the ball which makes it bounce at an angle off the ground This makes the batsman play each ball carefully Generally spin bowlers give up the most runs but they all have tricks that they use to fool the batsman and get him or her out These tricks are given names such as the arm ball googly flipper topspinner or doosra Spin bowling is very much about fooling the batsman rather than speed A fast Off Spin is the normal off spin action but with more pace Off spin is when the cricket ball spins towards a right handed batsmens bat With more pace there usually is less turn Off spin is also called an Off Break or Finger Spin A famous spin bowler was the Australian Shane Warne

In cricket a wicket is made up of three sticks stuck into the earth with two small sticks balanced on them

Dynamic and formal equivalence are concepts from linguistics When a language is translated into another one there is a problem the meaning of a word or a phrase in the first language is not the same as that of the word or phrase in the second language The first language may also have grammatical structures that do not exist in the second language This is a problem for translation

There are two possible ways to solve this problem

Kin selection or kin altruism is a form of natural selection Some animals cooperate with relatives even if this brings risk to themselves The classic example of this is seen in the family life of mammals or in colonial insects such as ants 

Many mammals and birds raise alarms to warn others of danger Others cooperate in tasks such as scrub jays help each other with to build nests In all these cases where animals cooperate the question is whether there is any biological benefit to themselves It is now clear that there is benefit if the animals are closely related This is because related organisms have a shared genetic inheritance

The first to write about the concept were by RA Fisher in 1930 and JBS Haldane in 1955 but it was WD Hamilton who truly formalized the concept The actual term kin selection was probably coined by John Maynard Smith when he wrote 

By cooperating relatives influence each others fitness Under natural selection a gene which improves the fitness of individuals will increase in frequency A gene which lowers the fitness of individuals will become rare 

However behaviour which enhances the fitness of relatives but lowers that of the actor may nonetheless increase in frequency Relatives do by definition carry many of the same genes This is the fundamental principle behind the theory of kin selection According to the theory the enhanced fitness of relatives may more than compensate for the fitness loss of the helpers 

This is a special case of a more general model called inclusive fitness

Foraging is the act of hunting or gathering food For example cattle forage grass to eat The idea of animals foraging is called forage theory and was first proposed in 1966

Humans that forage are often called hunter gatherers who find and eat animals and plants without domestication of them 

The Pacific Northwest is a region on the west coast of North America It refers to the northwestern corner of the United States and the southwestern part of Canada The US states of Washington Idaho western Montana Oregon and northern California are located in the southern part of the Pacific Northwest The Canadian province of British Columbia and the southeastern part of the US state of Alaska is in the northern part The entire region is bordered by the Pacific Ocean to the west

Historically the Pacific Northwest had many Native Americans Starting from about 15000 years ago Native Americans settled along the coastline and along the major rivers From the 1500s to the 1700s Europeans explored the region beginning with the discovery of Oregon and Washington In the early 1800s the famous Lewis and Clark expedition arrived in Washington State From the 19th century to present day the region began to become settled Today the largest cities in the Northwest include Vancouver Seattle and Portland

The rugged mountains of the Northwest consist of the Coast Range which is nearer the coast and the Cascade Range In northern Washington the Cascade Range is called the North Cascades In British Columbia it is called the Canadian Cascades The many rivers of the Northwest result from its wet climate  the mountains trap wet Pacific air leaving little rain for inland states like Idaho The rivers once supported large salmon runs but large power dams have been built on many rivers

The main language of the Pacific Northwest is English in the United States and French in Canada among the Native Americans Chinook Jargon is common Among the many Asian immigrants Chinese is receiving growing use in the Northwest The United States part of the Northwest is known for its low religious population

The Pacific Northwest basically extends from southeastern Alaska to Northern California Along this entire length is a large mountain range the Cascade Range that forms the geographic spine of the Pacific Northwest The highest mountain in the Northwest is Mount Rainier Rainier is convert14410ftm high Other notable mountains include Mount Shasta at convert14163ftm and Mount Baker at convert10781ftm East of the Cascades there is the Columbia Plateau a high area of land that stretches east to the Rocky Mountains in Idaho and Montana In the west the Coast Range borders the coast more closely The Olympic Mountains are on the Olympic Peninsula an extension of Washington State Puget Sound is a large system of bays and straits in northwestern Washington and southeastern British Columbia

The main rivers of the Pacific Northwest are the Fraser River the Columbia River and the Snake River The Fraser River is mainly in British Columbia it flows west to the Pacific Ocean near Vancouver The Fraser drains most of the southern Canadian Cascades The Columbia River begins in the Canadian Cascades and flows south then turns west where it meets the Snake River From there it flows on to the ocean near Portland The Snake River is mainly in inland Idaho After a journey west from the Rocky Mountains it meets the Columbia at Kennewick Washington

Other river of the Northwest include the Finlay the Skagit the Umpqua the Rogue and the Klamath The Finlay drains the northern Canadian Cascades and flows on to join the Mackenzie River which flows through Canada to Hudson Bay The Skagit also begins in the Canadian Cascades and crosses into Washington it turns west and flows into the sea north of Everett Washington The Umpqua River begins in the Southern Oregon Cascades and flows west to the Pacific Ocean near Reedsport Oregon The Rogue parallels the Umpqua and dumps into the sea at Gold Beach Oregon The Klamath flows south from a valley in inland Oregon then turns west through northern California cutting through the Cascade Range to its mouth near Klamath California

Adaptation is the evolutionary process where an organism becomes better suited to its habitat This process takes place over many generations It is one of the basic phenomena of biology

When people speak about adaptation they often mean a feature which helps an animal or plant survive An example is the adaptation of horses teeth to grinding grass Grass is their usual food it wears the teeth down but horses teeth continue to grow during life Horses also have adapted to run fast which helps them to escape their predators such as lions These features are the product of the process of adaptation

The better adapted animals are the most likely to survive and to reproduce successfully This process is known as natural selection it is the basic cause of evolutionary change 

Adaptation is first of all a process rather than a physical part of a body 

An internal parasite is a good example it has a very simple bodily structure but still the organism is highly adapted to its particular environment From this we see that adaptation is not just a matter of visible traits in such parasites critical adaptations take place in the life cycle which is often quite complex 

However as a practical term adaptation is often used for the product those features of a species which result from the process Many aspects of an animal or plant can be correctly called adaptations though there are always some features whose function is in doubt By using the term adaptation for the evolutionary process and adaptive trait for the bodily part or function the two senses of the word may be distinguished

Adaptation is one of the two main processes that explain the diverse species we see in biology The other is speciation A favourite example used today to study the interplay of adaptation and speciation is the evolution of cichlid fish in African lakes

An organism must be viable at all stages of its development and at all stages of its evolution This places constraints on the evolution of development behaviour and structure of organisms 

The general idea is that each genetic and phenotypic change during evolution should be relatively small because developmental systems are so complex and interlinked But polyploidy in plants is a fairly common large genetic change The origin of the eukaryota by the symbiosis of micro organisms is a more exotic example

All adaptations help organisms survive in their ecological niches This implies an increase in biological fitness

These adaptive traits may be structural behavioural or physiological Structural adaptations are physical features of an organism 

Behavioural adaptations are composed of inherited behaviour chains andor the ability to learn behaviours may be inherited in detail or a tendency for learning may be inherited Examples searching for food sex vocalizations 

Physiological adaptations permit the organism to perform special functions but also more general functions such as growth and development temperature regulation ionic balance and other aspects of homeostasis Adaptation then affects all aspects of the life of an organism

Not all features of an organism are adaptations It may need field investigations or experiments to find out what its function is in the life of the species 

Adaptations tend to reflect the past life of a species If a species has recently changed its life style a once valuable adaptation may become a dwindling vestige Animals which live in dark caves often lose over a long period their colours and eyesight 

The reasons for this may vary The loss of structure and function may be a positive adaptation which saves energy and materials But it may be simply a by product of genes selected for other functions Or the structure may be linked in development and affected by selection for another structure 

It is a general rule that any adaptations which are no longer useful either become vestigial organs or may be selected and adapted to other functions

It is a profound truth that Nature does not know best that genetical evolution is a story of waste makeshift compromise and blunder Peter Medawar

Adaptations are never perfect There are always tradeoffs between the various functions and structures in a body It is the organism as a whole which lives and reproduces therefore it is the complete set of adaptations which gets passed on to future generations

All adaptations have a downside horse legs are great for running on grass but they cannot scratch their backs mammals hair helps temperature but offers a niche for ectoparasites Compromise and make shift occur widely not perfection Selection pressures pull in different directions and the adaptation that results is some kind of compromise

Since the phenotype as a whole is the target of selection it is impossible to improve simultaneously all aspects of the phenotype to the same degree Ernst Mayr

Camouflage to avoid detection is destroyed when vivid colours are displayed at mating time Here the risk to life is counterbalanced by the necessity for reproduction The peacocks ornamental train is a famous adaptation It must reduce his maneuverability and flight and is hugely conspicuous also its growth costs food resources 

Darwins explanation of its advantage was in terms of sexual selection it depends on the advantage which certain individuals have over other individuals of the same sex and species in relation to reproduction The kind of sexual selection represented by the peacock is called mate choice meaning the process selects the more fit over the less fit and so has survival value In practice the blue peafowl Pavo cristatus is a pretty successful species with a big natural range in India so the overall outcome of their mating system is quite viable

The size of the human foetal brain at birth means the brain of a newborn child is quite immature The newborns brain cannot be larger than about 400ccs else it will not get through the mothers pelvis Yet the size needed for an adult brain is about 1400ccs

The most vital things in human life just have to wait while the brain grows and matures That is the result of the birth compromise Much of the problem comes from our upright bipedal stance without which our pelvis could be shaped more suitably for birth Neanderthals had a similar problem

The following definitions are mainly due to Theodosius Dobzhansky

Amaranth is a rose red color that is the color of the flower of the amaranth plant

The Dominican city of San Felipe de Puerto usually called just Puerto Plata is the head municipality of the Puerto Plata province on the north coast of the country

The municipality has the Atlantic Ocean to the north the municipalities of Villa Montellano and Sosa to the east the Santiago province to the south the municipality of Altamira to the southwest and the municipalities of Lupern and Imbert to the west

The name Puerto Plata came from the name given by Columbus to the mountain just to the south of the city Monte de Plata because the mountain always had clouds on its top and not because there was the metal silver that mountain now is called Isabel de Torres mountain Isabel de Torres was a lady who lived in Puerto in 1605 and had a lot of land in the mountain

The city was called first Puerto de Plata but later it was changed to just Puerto Plata the name that is still used

The municipality had in 2002 a total population of 146882 72295 men and 74587 women The urban population was 7628 of the total population In this numbers are included the population of the municipal districts of Maimn and Ysica Arriba

More persons live here than in any other municipality of the province In 2002 the population of the Puerto Plata municipality was 4697 of the total population of the province and the city of Puerto Plata had 3583 of the population of the province

The municipality of Puerto Plata has an area of 45971 km There are two municipal districts in the municipality Those municipal districts are

The Cordillera Septentrional runs along the southern half of the municipality There are only two roads that go through this mountain range It rains a lot in these mountains 

The mountain Loma Isabel de Torres is 5 km to the southeast of the city of Puerto Plata It stands alone even if it is part of the Cordillera Septentrional On top of the mountain there is rainforest because it gets a lot of rain there it rains almost every day That forest is now a national park

It is 799 m high and there are two ways for getting to the top by road or by a cable car

There are many rivers in the municipality but because the Cordillera Septentrional is close to the coast they are all very short The two most important rivers are Cam del Norte and Ysica Two small rivers that are close to the city are San Marcos and Muoz

There are some bays along the coast Two of them are the Puerto Plata Bay and Maimn Bay

Columbus visited the Puerto Plata Bay on 11 January 1493 The city was founded and built by Nicols de Ovando in 1502 Soon it became the most important port in the northern coast of the Hispaniola island and in 1508 the king of Spain gave a coat of arms to the city

Because there were many pirates and other British and French ships along the northern coast of the island a fort was built here by orders of Carlos I king of Spain its construction took several years and it was finished in 1577 Because at that moment the Spanishs king was Felipe II the fort was named Fuerte San Felipe

In 1606 those that were living in the towns of Puerto Plata and Monte Cristi were ordered by the Spanish king to move to the southeast of the island and to found a new town Monte Plata Puerto Plata and Monte Cristi were then destroyed They were founded again in the 18th century with families that came from the Canary Islands

The North Cascades are a name used for the mountains at the north end of the Cascade Range south of Canada The North Cascades are entirely in the United States in the state of Washington At the Canadian border the North Cascades are called the Canadian Cascades The highest point in the North Cascades is Mount Baker North Cascades National Park is located at the northernmost end of the North Cascades

Some of the primary rivers in the North Cascades are the Skagit Nooksack Stillaguamish and Stehekin Lake Chelan is the largest lake in the North Cascades Although now termed a reservoir it was originally a natural lake but enlarged by a dam The urban areas of Seattle Tacoma and Everett are all west of the North Cascades The Columbia River Washingtons largest river forms the east and south boundary

The Point is a 1971 animated cartoon movie written by singer songwriter Harry Nilsson and Carole Beers and directed by Fred Wolf It first appeared on ABC television in the United States It starred the voices of Mike Lookinland and actor Dustin Hoffman

The Point tells a story about a boy named Oblio who is the only round headed person in a land full of people and animals with pointed heads Banished to the Pointless Forest for not broken wikt linkconformconforming to what is normal Oblio and his dog Arrow meet many different people and come to learn that everything and everyone indeed has a point a purpose for being what they are Oblio and Arrow return home bringing back what they have learned to share with everyone

Nilsson said later the inspiration for The Point was an LSD experience Resting on the ground he noticed everything that reached into the sky from the ground came to a point leading Nilsson to believe that everything has a point and if it doesnt then theres a point to that Nilsson developed this idea into a story about tolerance and acceptance of broken wikt linkuniquenessuniqueness in others

Nilsson devoted a whole album to music from The Point alternating songs from the show with his own broken wikt linknarrationnarration of the story Me And My Arrow became the breakout hit from the album with a single reaching the Top 20 in the American music charts

Nilsson later adapted The Point into a musical stage play that featured more of his own songs A London production of the play reunited former Monkees Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones who were also friends of Nilssons

Darwinius masillae is a genus of primates from the Eocene epoch dated to 47 million years ago The genus Darwinius was named to celebrate Charles Darwin on his bicentenary and the species name masillae honors Messel where the specimen was found The creature appeared superficially similar to a modern lemur

The only known fossil dubbed Ida was discovered in 1983 at the Messel pit a disused shale quarry noted for its astonishing fossil preservation near the village of Messel about 35 km southeast of Frankfurt am Main in Germany The fossil divided into a slab and partial counterslab after the amateur excavation and sold separately was not reassembled until 2007

Buxton is a spa town in Derbyshire England It is the highest market town in England Buxton is near to Cheshire and Staffordshire Buxton is described as the gateway to the Peak District National Park Buxton is also close to Manchester

Pooles Cavern a limestone cavern and St Anns Well are in Buxton Also in the town is an Opera House

The Romans developed the town when it was called Aquae Arnemetiae Roman coins have been found in Buxton The town largely grew in importance in the late 18th century when it was developed by the Dukes of Devonshire with a second revival a hundred years later as the people visited to use the healing properties of the waters

The Dukes of Devonshire have been helping Buxton since 1780 when the Duke used his money from his copper mines to develop the town as a spa like Bath

Bess of Hardwick had taken one of her four husbands the Earl of Shrewsbury to take the waters at Buxton shortly after he became the jailer of Mary Queen of Scots in 1569

Dr Erasmus Darwin recommended the waters at Buxton to Josiah Wedgwood The Wedgwood family often went to Buxton on holiday Two of Charles Darwins half cousins Edward Levett Darwin and Reginald Darwin also settled there

Buxton is twinned with two other townsOignies in France and Bad Nauheim in Germany

Alices Adventures in Wonderland is a 1865 book written by English author and mathematics professor Charles Lutwidge Dodgson better known as Lewis Carroll The story was started out as an entertainment on a summer outing three years before the story was written and published Dodgson told these tales to three little girls and one day Alice asked Dodgson to write the Alice tales down as a storybook Dodgson accepted the task but the manuscript of story took two years to complete Finally Dodgson prepared the Alice story for publication adding more events such as the Mad Tea Party chapter more characters such as the Cheshire Cat and changing the title as Alices Adventures in Wonderland The story was so popular that Dodgson wrote a sequel called Through the Looking Glass and through out the years the classic story is popularized in music movies and plays

It begins with Alice being bored while sitting with her sister at a riverbank on a sleepy sunny afternoon Suddenly the White Rabbit rushes by Alice in a great hurry and looking at his watch Burning with curiosity Alice follows the White Rabbit down the rabbit hole to Wonderland a place where everyone is wacky trials and tea parties are improper and solving peculiar riddles without any answers Through out the story Alice changes sizes and encounter several Wonderland residents like the Cheshire Cat the Mad Hatter the March Hare and many more to get to the beautiful garden In the end Alices adventures turned out to be a dream as Alice wakes up to go home for tea

In a field called classical mechanics experts say that movement with higher velocities causes the radiation of gravitational waves Under this discipline the system cannot be considered conservative

Experts in another field called quantum mechanics say in addition at high speed the creation and annihilation of particles becomes possible so it is not possible to keep the number of particles constant 

The three body problem also happens in astronomy The problem consists in calculating the course of three bodies that influence each other with gravitation The first to state the problenm was Isaac Newton in Principia Usually two of the bodies are large and the third is small In the case where the two bodies have the same gravitational force and that the bodies all have the same mass can be solved exactly If this is not the case the problem is lsoved through iteration and approximation

Trophallaxis in biology refers the sharing of food by members of a community 

It is most highly developed in social insects such as ants termites wasps and bees The word was introduced by the entomologist William Morton Wheeler in 1918 The behaviour has been used to explain theories of how social behaviour developed in insects The French psychologist and entomologist August Forel also believed that food sharing was key to ant society He used an illustration of it as the frontispiece for his book The social world of the ants compared with that of man

Trophallaxis serves as a means of communication at least in bees and ants In some species of ants it may play a role in spreading the colony odour that identifies members

The Eel River is a river in the north part of the US state of California It flows north about 200 mi to the Pacific Ocean draining 3684 square miles Its largest tributary is the Middle Fork Eel River followed by the South Fork Van Duzen River and North Fork The river is dammed near its headwaters to divert water into the Russian River valley The two dams form Van Arsdale Reservoir and the larger Lake Pillsbury Most of the river is in the humid Coast Ranges of California Much of the river is isolated in steep and rugged terrain 

Towns along the Eel include Ferndale Rio Dell and Dos Rios Weott is near the South Fork confluence

US Highway 101 follows the river until the South Fork confluence and the Great Northern Railway also follows a portion of the river 37 bridges cross the Eel and 24 cross the South Fork The South Fork is the longest tributary The Middle Fork has the largest watershed

A cultivar is a plant that has been selected for planting and sale because it has certain characteristics It keeps its traits when it is propagated because they are inherited 

Usually cultivars are given a name which is not related to their biological taxon

Plant propagation is when a plant is distributed There are several ways to do this

Elettaria is commonly known as cardamom green cardamom or true cardamom It grows from India to Malaysia 

Amomum is usually called black cardamom or white cardamom It grows in Asia and Australia

Both forms of cardamom are used to add flavor to both food and drink as cooking spices and as a medicine Elettaria cardamomum is used as a spice and in medicine it is also smoked sometimes it is used as a food plant by the larva of the moth Endoclita hosei

Cardamom has a strong taste and an intense smell Black cardamom has coolness similar to that of mint It is commonly used in Indian cooking In Scandinavia it is often used for baking 

Green cardamom is one of the most expensive spices by weight but little is needed to give the flavor Cardamom is best stored in pod form Once the seeds are exposed or ground they quickly lose their flavor High quality ground cardamom powder can often be a substitute for the pods That way ten pods is about the same quantity as one and a half teaspoons of ground cardamom 

In the Middle East green cardamom powder is used as a spice for sweet dishes Traditionally it is also added as a flavoring to coffee and tea there In Arabic cardamom is called al Hayl In Persian it is called hel In Hebrew it is also called hel In Gujarati it is l ch In some Middle Eastern countries coffee and cardamom are often ground in a wooden mortar and cooked together in a mihbaz an oven using wood or gas to produce mixtures that are as much as forty percent cardamom

In South Asia green cardamom is often used in traditional Indian sweets and in Masala chai 

Black cardamom is sometimes used in garam masala for curries It is occasionally used as a garnish in basmati rice and other dishes It is often referred to as fat cardamom due its size Individual seeds are sometimes chewed in much the same way as chewing gum It has also been known to be used to make gin

In South Asia Green cardamom is often used to treat infections of the teeth and gums It is also used against troubles of the throat congestion of the lungs and pulmonary tuberculosis inflammation of eyelids and also digestive disorders It has been used to break up kidney and gall stones and as an antidote against the poison of certain snake bites 

Amomum is used as a spice and as an ingredient in traditional medicine in systems of the traditional Chinese medicine in China in Ayurveda in India Japan Korea and Vietnam

Among other species varieties and cultivars Amomum villosum cultivated in China Laos and Vietnam is used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat stomach aches constipation dysentery and other digestion problems Tsaoko cardamom Amomum tsao ko is cultivated in Yunnan China and northwest Vietnam both for medicinal purposes and as a spice

The demand for these herbs has increased since the 1980s Growing cardamom has become an important source of income for many poor farmers These people usually live in higher altitudes sometimes in remote areas in China Laos and Vietnam 

Until recently Nepal has been the worlds largest producer of large cardamom Guatemala has become the worlds largest producer and exporter of cardamom with an export total of US1372 million for 2007

Algorithmic information theory is a field of theoretical computer science It is concerned with how information and computation are related Most information can be represented as a String Algorithmic information theory studies the complexity of information represented that way Unlike regular information theory it uses Kolmogorov complexity to describe complexity and not the measure of complexity developed by Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver Kolmogorov complexity was developed independently by Andrey Kolmogorov and Gregory Chaitin 

According to Claude Shannon the following two binary strings have the same content in information

The first was generated with a random number generator for example by throwing a coin The second is easier to describe For this reason the first sequence has more algorithmic information because it is harder to shorten the description on how to generate it Shortening the description may not be possible at all The information value of a string is higher if it is more difficult to shorten its description Random strings and white noise do not contain patterns that occur again For this reason they cannot be compressed and have a higher information value 

Tawhid is the concept of God in Islam which says that only one God exists It says that God is unique and one and it has no equal Moreover it says that since the God is the only creator so there is no room for lesser Gods or deities and hence such conceptions are false Tawhid is an essential part of Islam To become a Muslim it is necessary to accept it The concept of Tawhid contains many implications Since God is the only power hence both good and bad flow from God Hence whatever good or bad occurs to an individual both are from God and both should be accepted by man Moreover since God is the only power worth worshiping reliance on any other source for help is not permissible

The Quran explains the nature of God thus in Chapter 112 Say He is God the Only God the Indivisible He gives not birth nor is He begotten and He is in Himself not dependent on anything 

Associating any other thing or person as being comparable to God is called shirk in Islam This is the only sin in Islam which cannot be forgiven by God unless a person turns repentent on Earth Muslims reject the three in one God concept in Christianity and say that Christ was a human being whom God chose as a prophet like other before him

Asperger syndrome affects the way in which a person understands other people talks with other people and acts with other people A person who has Asperger syndrome may not fit in well with other people and may be seen as strange Asperger syndrome is a developmental disorder not a mental illness Most adults with Asperger syndrome can learn how to make friends do useful work and live successful lives Asperger syndrome is considered to be at the highest functioning end of the Autism spectrum disorders Both sexes can have Asperger syndrome although it is more common in males

Asperger syndrome begins in early childhood No one knows exactly what causes it but it is thought to have a genetic cause The part of the brain which controls a persons social behavior may grow or function differently in a person with Asperger syndrome Another part of the brain that may be different is the part that controls some body movement such as balance A person with this condition may walk or act in a clumsy way and have trouble doing body actions such as sports They may also do physical actions repetitively such as rocking flapping their hands or tapping their feet The condition seems to run in families Parents who have Asperger syndrome often have children who have it or another kind of autism

Asperger syndrome cannot be found by testing blood or looking at someones body A medical doctor needs to talk with the person and other people who know him or her well to watch how the person moves and behaves and to learn about the persons past Sometimes a doctor believes by mistake that the person has schizophrenia ADHD or mental retardation instead Tourette syndrome with tics sometimes comes with Asperger syndrome Many people with Asperger syndrome also have ADHD

People who have Asperger syndrome have normal or high intelligence As children they may need special help at home and school to learn social behavior The syndrome cannot be made better by taking medicine

People with Asperger syndrome can have a hard time fitting in with other people Adults who have it usually learn enough coping skills to act in a way that seems normal but often with a few differences Most people with the syndrome can communicate clearly with friends and family They may have more difficulty in communicating with new people

A syndrome is a pattern of signs and symptoms that doctors can see in many different people Here is a list of symptoms of Asperger syndrome Not every person with Asperger syndrome has every symptom

People with Asperger syndrome 

When people talk to each other they use spoken words to communicate They also use the sound of their voice and non verbal communication such as facial expression hand movements and body language to give meaning to what they say This means that while people are talking they are also looking for signs in the other persons face and the movement of their body to tell how they are feeling and whether they mean exactly the same as their words are saying When people talk they use non verbal communication to add more information to their words People who have trouble with understanding non verbal communication like people with Asperger syndrome will miss this extra information

People with Asperger syndrome

Asperger syndrome is sometimes called wrong planet syndrome because people with Asperger syndrome often feel that they are quite normal but are living in a world full of aliens For a person with Asperger syndrome having Asperger syndrome is normal because they have had it all their life

People with Asperger syndrome often

In the 1940s a doctor named Hans Asperger studied some children that were different from most other children that he knew but were like each other He called them little professors because he thought that they were interesting and wrote a book about them Dr Asperger thought his little professors had a different sort of personality

In the 1980s Dr Lorna Wing made up the name Asperger syndrome for people with high functioning autism after research into Hans Aspergers work

In 1994 Asperger syndrome was added to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders

Dr Tony Attwood Dr Simon Baron Cohen and Dr Uta Frith are three of the current leading authorities on Asperger syndrome

notable people who are known to have or are suspected to have Asperger syndrome

Hydrogen deuteride is a diatomic molecule It is composed of the two isotopes of hydrogen 1H protium and 2H deuterium

The Bond albedo is the fraction of power in the total electromagnetic radiation incident on an astronomical body that is scattered back out into space It considers all wavelengths at all phase angles 

Geographical pole means either of two points on the surface of a rotating planet It is the place the axis meets the surface of the planet The north geographic pole of a body is 90 degrees north of the equator The south geographic pole lies 90 degrees south of the equator

A spheroid is a quadric surface It is obtained by rotating an ellipse about one of its principal axes This means it is an ellipsoid with two equal semi diameters

The invariable plane of a planetary system is the plane passing through its barycenter This is perpendicular to its angular momentum vector

In the solar system about 98 of this effect is contributed by the orbital angular momenta of the four gas giants The invariable plane is within 05 of the orbital plane of Jupiter It is the weighted average of all planetary orbital and rotational planes

The invariable plane is simply derived from the sum of angular momenta and is almost invariable over the entire system In contrast the Laplace plane may be different for different orbiting objects within a system 

The Sun forms a counterbalance to all of the planets so it is near the barycenter when Jupiter is on one side and the other three jovian planets are diametrically opposite on the other side but the Sun moves to 217 solar radii away from the barycenter when all jovian planets are in line on other side The orbital angular momenta of the Sun and all non jovian planets moons and minor solar system bodies as well as the axial rotation momenta of all bodies including the Sun total only about 2

For almost all purposes the plane can be considered invariable when working in Newtonian dynamics

The g force of an object is its acceleration relative to free fall

A sidereal day is the length of time it takes a planet to rotate from the perspective of a distant star For the planet Earth a sidereal day is approximately 23 hours 56 minutes and 4 seconds 

Astronomers use sidereal time to keep track of the direction to turn the telescopes to view a star in the night sky

By contrast solar time is reckoned by the movement of the Earth from the perspective of the Sun An average solar day is longer than a sidereal day because of the amount the Earth moves each day in its orbit around the Sun

A scale height is a term for a distance over which a quantity decreases by a factor of e It is usually denoted by the capital letter H

Several impacts have been seen on the face of Jupiter

A comet broke up into many pieces and then crashed into Jupiter over the course of many days in July of 1994 The comet was called Shoemaker Levy 9 The largest pieces left scars some larger than the Earth on the face of Jupiter

A large impact was observed with the Keck II telescope and its near infrared camera at Mauna Kea on July 20 1120 UT It occurred on the surface of Jupiter 

Ja zuster nee zuster was a very popular comedy series on Dutch television in the late 1960s It was set in a home for old people

The series was broadcast between 1966 and 1968 and consisted of 20 episodes 

The script was written by Annie MG Schmidt who was already very well known as a writer of books for children and scripts for television and radio programmes The songs were written by Harry Bannink

Dutch people today especially those who remember the original series are very disappointed that apart from one programme the whole series has been lost This is because it was recorded on Ampex tape which was very expensive so after the episodes had been shown on television other television programmes were recorded on the same tape over the top of it Some of the film that was shot outside has been preserved 15 of the songs from the series have also been preserved They were made into a gramophone record and later into a CD

The stories in the television series are about a group of people who live in Rusthuis Klivia The word rusthuis means resthouse It is usually used in Dutch to describe an old peoples home although some of the actors in the programme were not really old There was always chaos in the home The characters were very strange  One of them grew spinach in the garden one of them was an engineer who was always doing experiments in the cellar One of them was a burglar  The neighbour tries to get everyone evicted but he never succeeds 

Each episode had a guest actor who was often a well known Dutch television personality

There were many songs in the series The most popular ones include De kat van ome Willem Ja Zuster Nee Zuster Niet met de deuren slaan and Mn opa

In 1999 a book was published with reconstructions of the stories An exhibition was opened between November 2002 and March 2003 in Hoorn North Holland A musical is now being made which should be ready by 2009 It will be performed in many theatres throughout the Netherlands

The Bayreuth Festival is a music festival held every year in Bayreuth Germany at which performances of operas by the 19th century German composer Richard Wagner are performed It was Wagners own idea to start a festival for his operas in Bayreuth in a theatre which he designed himself because he was not satisfied with the way that theatres were usually designed

The theatre that he designed is called the Festspielhaus Wagner watched the theatre being built making sure that it was done the way he wanted it He had some new ideas about theatre design For example he wanted the orchestra pit to be so low that the orchestra would not be seen by the audience

When the theatre was opened in 1876 his cycle of operas called the Der Ring des Nibelungen was performed complete for the first time 

The festival immediately became internationally famous Almost every serious musician in Europe wanted to go to Bayreuth to hear Wagners music performed there Composers usually either loved it and were strongly influenced by it or they hated it and reacted against it

The festival still continues now Every August there is a festival of Wagners operas It is extremely difficult to get tickets because so many people want to go People often wait for ten years before they can get a ticket

The origins of the festival 

Wagner wanted the festival to be in a small town where people could just concentrate on his music Bayreuth already had a theatre the Markgrfliches Opernhaus but it was not suitable for modern opera The town did not have a cultural life that would be in competition with Wagners music Another reason for choosing Bayreuth was that it was outside the area where the rights to perform his operas were not under his control

King Ludwig II of Bavaria gave a lot of money to Wagner to built the new opera house Wagner also made tours across Germany to get money for it Societies were established to raise money

The architect who designed the opera house was Gottfried Semper 

The opening took place on August 13 1876 with a performance of Das Rheingold A lot of important people were there including Kaiser Wilhelm Dom Pedro II of Brazil King Ludwig and other members of the nobility as well as the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche and the composers Anton Bruckner Edvard Grieg Pyotr Tchaikovsky and Franz Liszt Hans Richter was the conductor

During Wagners life the festival just performed the Ring Cycle and later his opera Parsifal After Wagners death his widow Cosima continued to run the festival She gradually introduced the other operas Wagner had written so that all ten operas were in the repertoire The operas were always performed exactly as Wagner had done Nothing was allowed to be changed in any way 

After Cosima retired from running the festival in 1906 Wagners son Siegfried took over management of the festival He did some things differently introducing new staging and performance styles When he died in 1930 the festival was run by his widow Winifred

In the 1920s some years before the rise of the Nazi party Winifred Wagner became a close friend of Adolf Hitler Because of this Bayreuth was able to continue getting a lot of money during the Nazi period Wagners works were used by the Nazi as propaganda tools  It is strange that Hitler went to performances in Bayreuth that included Jewish and foreign singers long after they had been banned from performing in all other places in Germany Winifreds influence with Hitler was so strong that Hitler even wrote a letter to the anti fascist Italian conductor Arturo Toscanini begging him to lead the festival Toscanini refused

It was during this time that the festival made its first break from tradition They stopped using the 19th century scenery on the stage Many people disagreed with this including Toscanini and Richard Strauss and even some members of the Wagner family They thought it should stay exactly like Wagner had known it

During the war the Nazi party ran the festival Operas were performed for soldiers who had been hurt in the fighting These soldiers were forced to go to lectures on Wagner before the performances even if they were not interested in music

A lot of Bayreuth was destroyed by bombing in the last days of World War II though the theatre itself was undamaged After the war Winifred Wagner was sentenced to probation by a war court because she had supported the Nazi party Ironically it was because of Winifred that the theatre was not bombed She had not allowed it to be used for military purposes so it was not a military target After the war the theatre was used for other kinds of concerts for the next few years The festival started again in 1951 opening with a performance of Beethovens Symphony no 9 followed by a performance of Wagners opera Parsifal

Wieland Wagner the composers grandson had some very new ideas including very abstract scenery Some of the audience even booed What Wieland was trying to do was to make a big break from the past with its association with Hitler Wieland died in 1966 For a time people wondered whether the festival would continue There were a lot of arguments within the Wagner family Wielands brother Wolfgang Wagner remained in charge of running the festival for the next 42 years while the money was controlled by the Richard Wagner Foundation

Wieland Wagner started a workshop in Bayreuth in which directors could meet and discuss new ideas for presenting the operas This made it easier for new ideas to be accepted and gave new life to the festival

The centenary of the festival was celebrated in 1976 with a great production of the Ring directed by the French director Patrice Chereau His production concentrated on showing how the Ring was about the 19th century working class being used by the wealthy capitalists Some people thought it was the best opera performance they had ever seen others hated it

There has been a lot of uncertainty about what would happen after Wolfgang retired Many people wanted the festival to continue to be in the hands of the Wagner family On 1 September 2008 Wolfgang Wagners daughters Eva Wagner Pasquier and Katharina Wagner were named by Bavarias culture minister to take over the Festival They have said that they want to bring opera to the people In 2009 Wagners opera Tristan und Isolde will be live on the web It will only cost 1290 to watch online People will also be able to watch it for free on a big screen in the centre of Bayreuth

Ludwig II was king of Bavaria from 1864 until shortly before his death He is well known for his support for the composer Richard Wagner

He is often referred to as the Mad King Ludwig because his behaviour was very odd For example he would leave his castle by climbing out of the window instead of walking out of the door He is sometimes referred to as the Swan King in English and der Mrchenknig in German This is because he built several very expensive and fancy castles the most famous one being Neuschwanstein

It is not clear whether his death by drowning was suicide or whether he was murdered

Today tourists from all over the world visit the castles that he built They also visit the Bayreuth Festspielhaus for which he gave a lot of money towards the building

Regen began to study insects in great detail He was one of the first Slovenian scientists to work in another country after World War I He was the first scientist to study the grasshopper in a lot of detail He studied katydid and cricket sounds he proved that insects did react to sounds from each other He was able to make crickets react to artificial sounds using a loudspeaker In one experiment he used a telephone to send sounds from one cricket to another in different rooms Later he showed that insects hear with their ear drum He was the first person to work out what the ear drum does He is the person who started the study of bioacoustics He also studied the insects breathing their hibernation coloring and how they shed their skin

Regens largest project was his geobiological laboratory a large glass cage called a terrarium He used this to study the way crickets could find other crickets using sounds this is called phonotaxis Using up to 1600 females with normal or damaged hearing he was able to work out how they did this

He worked for himself after 1911 but he supported several groups and organizations in Slovenia He started using Slovene terminology in his areas of study In 1921 he was asked to be a professor at the University of Ljubljana but did not take it In 1940 he became a member of Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts and was also a member of Slovenian Society of Natural History

Different people have tried to classify countries into different groups This is usually done either by looking at how rich people are on average in different countries or how well developed the political system is Most of the time there are two groups namely developing countries and developed ones Sometimes there are three groups in which case the third group is between developing and developed countries and is usually called emerging countries

These definitions are problematic because a high standard of living doesnt just mean that people make a lot of money The main problem is that things cost different amounts in different countries Just because people earn more money in one country does not necessarily mean they are better off they might earn more simply because the cost of living is higher This means they need to spend more money just to buy those things they need every day

For this reason there are different definitions of developing countries The level of economic development also changes a lot from one developing countries to another There are developing countries that have a high standard of living

Many of these countries have a lot of natural resources but not the industries that would use them so the resources are sold to the countries which can use them

There have been many other names used to describe these countries including

Less Developed Countries or LDCs is often used now because it seems less insulting

Malden Island is an island in the Pacific Ocean Today the island belongs to Kiribati It is one of the Line Islands In the 19th century the island used to be called Independence Island at times The island is uninhabited today it has been made into a nature reserve for breeding seabirds

Malden Island is located 242 nautical miles south of the equator 150 nmi south of Honolulu Hawaii The coast of South America is more than 4000 nautical miles to the east

The nearest land is uninhabited Starbuck Island 110 nmi to the southwest The closest inhabited place is Tongareva243 nmi to the southwest The nearest airport is on Kiritimati 365 nmi to the northwest There are other uninhabited islands nearby They include Jarvis Island 373 nmi to the northwest Vostok Island 385 nmi to the south southeast and Caroline Island 460 nmi to the southeast

The island has roughly the shape of an equilateral triangle with convert8kmmi0abbron on a side aligned with the southwest side running northwest to southeast The west and south corners are slightly truncated shortening the north east and southwest coasts to about convert7kmmi0abbron and adding shorter west and south coasts about 1 to 2 km in length 

There is a large lagoon with many small islets in the east central part of the island The lagoon is completely sourrounded by land It is connected to the sea by underground channels and is quite salty Most of the land area of the island lies to the south and west of the lagoon The total area of the island is about 392 square kilometers 

The island is very low no more than convert10mft0 above sea level at its highest point The highest elevations are found along a rim that closely follows the coastline The inside forms a depression that is only a few meters above sea level in the western part and is below sea level in the east central part Because of this topography the ocean cannot be seen from much of Maldens interior

There is no standing fresh water on Malden Island though a fresh water lens may exist

The ancient stone structures are located around the beach ridges Most of them are on the north and south sides Overall twenty one sites are known Three of them are larger than the others They can be found on the northwest side of the island The sites are either temples houses or graves The temple ruins are referred to as marae Similar marae have also been found on other islands such as Raivavae one of the Austral Islands

The inhabitants had also made wells but later settlers found them to be dry or too salty

In 1828 guano was discovered on the island In 1856 the United States wanted to get the Island but Australian firms had already started to mine the guano deposits Guano mining stopped about 1927 In 1956 and 1957 Great Britain tested H bombs on the island The tests were called Operation Grapple

Grape shot is a hollow ball packed with small grape sized metal balls which can be fired by a gun or a cannon The hollow balls are fired as a single round that breaks apart upon leaving the muzzle of a black powder cannon which were common common to the 1700 and 1800s Grape shot is quite different from a shell or shrapnel rounds

A shell is a hollow ball packed with explosive and a fuse The fuse is lit by the explosive charge that sends the shell towards its target It is designed to explode when it reaches its target Grape shot begins to spread as soon as it leaves the gun or cannon Shrapnel while similar to both is different and more deadly Invented by a British officer during the Napoleonic Wars it is a fused explosive shell filled with many small balls or ironlead bits When the shell bursts the small bits scatter in a more or less spherical pattern with usually fatal force 

All three of these rounds grape shot shell and shrapnel are extremely effective against troops horses and other livestock They can also destroy wooden structures from their intense fragmentation impact Shells have historically been particularly effective as incendiaries against wooden targets which they ignite from the heat of their explosive blast Grape shot sends out mini missiles across a wide pattern This is best for people targets but it may be quite damaging against nearby wooden structures

A Banzai charge was a tactic used by Japanese soldiers against American soldiers when they were losing World War II Banzai charges were usually suicide charges This was so they would have an honourable death without surrender Also the charges were a final attempt to gain success against the Allied forces which usually had more troops

The Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion is a musical composition by the Hungarian composer Bla Bartk It was written for a very unusual combination of players Four players are needed to perform this sonata two pianists and two percussion players The two pianists each have a piano and the two percussion players play seven instruments between them three timpani xylophone one side drum with snares and one without a suspended cymbal a pair of cymbals a bass drum a triangle and a tam tam

In the introduction to the score Bartk gave very precise instructions about how the different percussion instruments should be played the kinds of beaters to be used and a plan of how they were to be grouped on stage

There are three movements a fast movement a slow movement and a fast movement The first movement starts with a slow introduction

There are many interesting and unusual things to listen out for in the music For example in the first movement the timpani sometimes play glissandos This means that the pitch of the notes slides up or down The player needs to have timpani with pedals to do this This movement is in sonata form

The second movement sounds very creepy Bartk quite often wrote music which sounded like insects at night This is one of his night pieces In the climax to this exciting music Piano One plays lots of glissandos

The last movement is a big contrast to the atmosphere in the slow movement It is like a lively dance

The sonata was first performed in Basle in 1938 with the composer playing one piano and his wife Ditta playing the other one Fritz Schiesser and Philipp Rhlig played the percussion  It immediately became very popular and has since been one of his best known works Bartk also made a version for the two pianos to play with an orchestra but it is not normally performed like that

Concerto for Orchestra is the title of a work for orchestra by the Hungarian composer Bla Bartk It is one of the most famous orchestral pieces of the mid 20th century

Several composers have written works to which they gave the title Concerto for Orchestra It is an unusual title because a concerto is normally a work for one solo instrument and an orchestra The soloist is given a lot of opportunity to show off his talent In a Concerto for Orchestra there is no soloist but the composer thinks it is different from a symphony because a lot of the instruments in the orchestra are treated like soloists during the piece This is what happens in Bla Bartks concerto

The work was written in 1943 and it was first performed on 1 December 1944 in the Boston Symphony Hall by the Boston Symphony Orchestra with the conductor Serge Koussevitzky It was immediately a great success Koussevitszky asked Bartk to write this piece Bartk had just arrived in United States from Hungary He had to flee because of the World War II Bartk had no money and so he was glad to get some work

Bartk often uses ideas from the Classical music period in this work He also uses ideas from folk music from central Europe especially Hungarian music Quite often the music is not in a major or minor key He uses folk scales which have different kinds of scales called modes Sometimes tunes sound like folk music At other times there are drones in the horns and strings

The orchestra needs 3 flutes 3 oboes 3 clarinets 3 bassoons 4 horns 3 trumpets 3 trombones tuba timpani side drum bass drum cymbals triangle tamtam 2 harps and strings

The first movement called Introduzione by Bartk is a slow introduction which sounds like music describing the night This is something Bartk did several times in his works It is in sonata form

The second movement is called Giuoco delle coppie which means Game of pairs Pairs of instruments take it in turns to play a tune each pair playing music which is separated by a different interval 

The third movement called Elegia by Bartk is another slow movement typical of Bartks night music

The fourth movement called Intermezzo interrotto by Bartk has a flowing melody with a time signature which keeps changing There is also a theme which pokes fun at the march tune in Dmitri Shostakovichs Leningrad Symphony There is a very difficult bit for the timpani where the player has to play lots of different pitches in a very short section

The fifth movement called Finale is a very fast movement with lots of energy and plenty of folk tunes

Bluebird K7 is a boat built for Donald Campbell to break the World Water Speed Record Bluebird was a special kind of boat called a hydroplane that skims over the top of the water instead of pushing through it like a normal boat Bluebird was powered by a jet engine It set new world water speed records seven times the fastest was 276 mph Bluebird was destroyed when Campbell tried to set an eighth record by going faster than 300 mph on Coniston Water in 1967

Campbell had been using his fathers boat Bluebird K4 to try and set new records Bluebird K4 was destroyed when its structure broke After this Donald had the idea for a jet powered hydroplane to take the world water speed record from the American propeller hydroplane Slo mo shun Ken and Lewis Norris designed and built K7 based on Donalds ideas

K7 was a three point hydroplane meaning that when going quickly the boat only touched the water in three places one point near the back of the boat and one point at the back of the two sponsons It was built of aluminium on top of a steel frame and was at first powered by a small turbojet 

The name K7 came from the rating given to the boat by Lloyds of London

Campbell set seven world water speed records in K7 between 1955 and 1964

In 1966 Campbell decided he wanted to make Bluebird go faster than 300 mph 

Bluebirds old engine was not strong enough to make it go this fast so it was replaced with a more powerful Bristol Siddeley Orpheus engine taken from an old fighter jet Many other changes were made the tail fin from the fighter was attached to Bluebirds rear the cover over the cockpit was changed to push through the air more easily and the floats at the front were also changed Bluebird was taken to Coniston Water to be tested in 1966 The tests did not go well the weather was too bad to test the boat while moving so it was tied down and tested without moving instead When testing the engine it sucked in too much air and caused parts of the boat to break The engine was broken when the broken parts were sucked into it This meant that the entire engine had to be replaced 

At the end of November the weather was good enough for some test runs but the speed was a lot lower than Bluebirds old records The fuel pumps couldnt pump enough fuel to the engine so it couldnt run at full speed The problem was fixed by fitting two fuel pumps instead of one 

On 4 January 1967 the problems had all been fixed the weather was good and Campbell decided he wanted to try and break the speed record For a world record to be official a boat trying to set a record has to make two runs at full speed that are timed by people who are not part of the record breaking team The official speed is the average speed of the two runs On the first run Bluebirds speed was 2976 mph which was fast enough to be a new record but not quite as fast as Campbell wanted to go To set a record of more than 300 mph the second run would have to be 3025 mph or faster 

The plan for the world record attempt was for Bluebird to stop at the far end of the lake and refuel from another boat that had been put there for that purpose Taking time to refuel would also give the lake which had been disturbed by the first run time to settle down again On the actual record attempt Campbell decided not to refuel and instead started on his second run straight away Why he did this is unknown 

At the start of the second run Bluebird was going faster than 320 mph and would have easily broken the 300 mph target but as the boat travelled along the lake it started tramping Bluebird hit a wave made on the lake from its own first run and the boat spun out of the water When it hit the water again it broke into pieces and sank Donald Campbell was killed in the crash His teddy bear mascot was found floating in the lake later on but Campbells body could not be found

In 2001 a diver called Bill Smith led a salvage team which found Bluebird on the bottom of Coniston Water and later lifted the wreck back to dry land The wreck was taken apart carefully to keep it from rusting and is now being put back together again There was a lot of damage caused in the crash but it can all be repaired Bill Smith also got a new engine for Bluebird and hopes to return the boat to full working order 

In 2009 Bill Smith got permission to run Bluebird on Coniston at high speed to prove that it has been fixed properly This will happen when his team has finished putting the boat back together again 

Donald Campbells body was also found in 2001 He was buried on 12th September 2001 in Coniston cemetery

51 Pegasi is a star that is like our Sun and can be found 154 parsecs away from the Earth in the constellation Pegasus It was the first Sun like star other than the Sun found to have a planet orbiting it this discovery was first made public in 1995

The exoplanets discovery was made public on October 6 1995 by Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz The discovery was made using the radial velocity method at the Observatoire de Haute Provence using a tool called the ELODIE spectrograph that is used to find planets that are outside our Solar System 

The star itself has an apparent brightness of 549 and because of this it is able to be seen from the Earth with binoculars or with the naked eye if it is dark outside 51 Pegasi is a yellow dwarf star that is thought to be around 75 billion years old which is somewhat older than our Sun 51 Pegasi is also 4 6 more massive than our Sun with more metal content However it is running low on hydrogen 

In 1996 astronomers Baliunas Sokoloff and Soon calculated that it takes 51 Pegasi b 37 days to orbit 51 Pegasi

After the announcement on October 12 1995 more proof that this star did exist came from Dr Geoffrey Marcy from San Francisco State University and Dr R Paul Butler from the University of California Berkeley using the Hamilton Spectrograph at the Lick Observatory near San Jose in California

51 Pegasi b is the first discovered planet of its parent star 51 Pegasi If any more are discovered they will be named 51 Pegasi c 51 Pegasi d and so on The planet has been informally named Bellerophon After its discovery many teams proved its existence and continued to find out more about its properties including the fact that it orbits very close to the star has estimated temperatures around 1200 Celsius and has a minimum mass about half that of Jupiter

70 Virginis b is an extrasolar planet that is around 60 light years away from the Earth in the constellation of Virgo The finding of this planet was announced in 1996 by astronomers Geoffrey Marcy and R Paul Butler 70 Virginis was one of the first stars that was known to have planets orbiting it When first announced 70 Virginis b was thought to be inside its stars habitable zone but proof was later found that the planet has an eccentric orbit closer to its parent

70 Virginis b is a Jupiter type extrasolar planet that orbits around 70 Virginis every 116 days It has 75 times the mass of Jupiter Its surface gravity is thought to be about two to three times that of Jupiters At the time that it was found in January 1996 it was thought that the star was only 29 light years away from the Earth This could explain why the star was less bright based on its apparent magnitude As a result the planets orbit was thought to be in the habitable zone and the planet was given the nickname Goldilocks The Hipparcos satellite later showed that the star was farther away from 70 Virginis and therefore its brightness was a result of the planet being too hot to be in the habitable zone

Scholasticism is a way of thinking and teaching knowledge It was developed in the Middle Ages It started when people wanted to bring together what is called classical philosophy with the teachings of Christian theology Classical philosophy is the philosophy developed in Ancient Greece Scholasticism is not a philosophy or a theology but rather a way of teaching and learning Scholasticism emphasises dialectical reasoning The main purpose of Scholasticism is to find an answer to a question or to show that a contradiction can be resolved 

Scholasticism was started by people like St Ambrose and St Augustine They tried to use philosophy to help explain the doctrine and mysteries of the church Ambrose and Augustine were among the first Church fathers who brought Christian ideas and Greek philosophy together 

The main figures of scholasticism were Peter Abelard Albertus Magnus Duns Scotus William of Ockham Bonaventure and most importantly Thomas Aquinas Summa Theologica is an ambitious synthesis of Greek philosophy and Christian doctrine In the 13th century the teachings of Aristotle were considered more important than those of Plato With this change science as a whole started to change Beforehand it used deductive and a priori reasoning Modern science uses inductive resoning

Clay animation is one of many ways to make a stop motion animation Each animated piece either character or background can be formed and reformed into different shapes People making a clay animation usually use something soft like Plasticine clay 

Most animation is made the same way whether it is cel animation or stop motion Each frame or still picture is recorded on film or digital media and then played back quickly When played back at a frame rate of more than 1012 frames per second the human mind sees the series of slightly changing rapidly playing images as movement To us it seems as if the object is moving by itself This way of tricking the mind into seeing movement is the way that all moving images work from zoetrope to movies to videogames The way CGI animations are made is different from the frame by frame method

In clay animation each object is made in clay usually around a wire skeleton called an armature The object is put on the set and a still picture is taken The object or character is then moved slightly by hand Another picture is taken and the object is moved slightly again This is repeated over and over To get the best results special care is taken to make sure that each frame is the same as the one before For example the lighting has to be the same and the object has to be put back in exactly the right place The only thing that should be different is the slight change the animator makes to the object

Making a stop motion animation using clay is hard work Normal movies use 24 frames per second Animation usually uses doubles or twos that is using two frames for each shot This means that 12 changes are made for one second of movie For a 30 minute movie there would be about 21600 stops to change the objects for the next frame For a full length movie there would be about 64800 stops IF some of the parts were done with only a single not double frame there would be even more stops Great care must be taken to make sure that the object is not moved by accident For full length movies animators now use rubber silicone and resin cast objects One foam rubber method has been called Foamation by Will Vinton

Some famous clay animation movies have been made Examples include

The word Claymation is a registered trademark in the United States It was registered by Will Vinton in 1978 to describe his clay animation films The word is often used incorrectly to describe any clay animation movie

The Space Race was a competition of space exploration between the Soviet Union and the United States which lasted from 1957 to 1969 It had to do with the efforts to explore outer space with artificial satellites to send humans into space and to land them on the Moon

The Space Race began after the Soviet launch of Sputnik 1 on 4 October 1957 The term Space Race started as a comparison to the arms race The Space Race became an important part of the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War Space technology became an extra important area in this rivalry because of possible military uses

On October the 4th 1961 the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1 the first artificial satellite to enter orbit This started the Space Race

One part of the space race was the race to put a man into space This first was won by the Soviet Union when Major Yuri Gagarin orbited the earth on April the 12th 1961

On May the 25th 1961 in a speech to a joint sitting of congress President John F Kennedy of the United States of America set the impossible sounding goal of landing a man on the Moon by the end of the decade This also implied a challenge to the Russians to try to do it first The Americans won this part of the race in 1969 when Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin Jr landed on the moon and returned safely to the earth

An Oligotroph is an organism that can survive with relatively few nutrients Because there are few nutrients such organisms grow slower Their metabolism usually runs at a slower rate The population density is generally low 

Environments where Oligotrophs can be found include the deep oceans

When talking about chemical solutions the term supersaturated means that a solution contains more of a substance that could be solved in it 

Carbonated water is a supersaturated solution of carbon dioxide gas in water At the start the pressure in the bottle is very high This means that more Carbon dioxide gas can be put into the water than at normal pressure When the bottle is opened the pressure falls to the normal level and the carbon dioxide gas escapes very slowly Certain things such as small bubbles in the bottle can make this process faster Such bubbles can be caused by shaking the bottle Another solute such as sugar powder or a widget

A Diet Coke and Mentos eruption is a more extreme example Some drinks such as ales and stouts eg Guinness rely on this effect to produce the head on the surface of the poured product 

Dyspnea or dyspnoea is shortness of breath Some research says that about 27 of people suffer it 

There are many different causes of dyspnea Some include

Epiglottitis is inflammation of the epiglottis which is the flap that sits at the base of the tongue which keeps food from going into the trachea Due to its place in the airway swelling of this can interfere with breathing and can set up a medical emergency

Epiglottitis usually happens in children It can be accompanied with fever problems swallowing drooling and stridor In children it must always be considered a medical emergency requiring urgent treatment in an emergency room at a hospital

Lyme disease or borreliosis is an infectious disease It is the most common tick borne infection in the United States Although Allen Steere realized in 1978 that Lyme disease was a tick borne disease the cause of the disease remained a mystery until 1982 It can cause joint swelling rashes and neurological disorders

Carbonated water also known as sparkling water fizzy water seltzer and water with gas is plain water into which carbon dioxide gas has been dissolved Most soft drinks have carbonated water as a base The process of dissolving carbon dioxide gas is called carbonation It results in the formation of carbonic acid

There are special machines that allow to make soda water at home

The process of carbonation can also occur naturally to produce carbonated mineral water

African Sanctus is a musical composition for choir soloists orchestra and prerecorded tape by David Fanshawe It was composed in 1972

African Sanctus is the best known of Fanshawes works It was composed after Fanshawe had made journeys to Africa up the river Nile between 1969 and 1973 The shape of his journey forms the shape of a cross This had a religious meaning for Fanshawe He made recordings on tape of the people he met singing their traditional music A lot of this music had never been recorded before When he returned home to Britain he composed the African Sanctus Some of the recordings he had made in Africa are played as part of the performance The choir who sing live at the concert are singing some of the words of the traditional Christian Latin Mass

The recordings are from Egypt the Sudan Uganda and Kenya

At first it was called African Revelations but then the title was changed to African Sanctus It was first performed in London by the Saltarello Choir in July 1972 and was later played on BBC Radio on United Nations Day A documentary film was made three years later showing how the work had been composed

The work has been performed in many places in Britain and all round the world Fanshawe comes to many of these concerts personally

In 1994 David Fanshawe composed an extra movement for a new recording of the work the Dona Nobis Pacem  A Hymn for World Peace which completed the Agnus Dei Based on this new recording the BBC commissioned the maker of the 1975 documentary Herbert Chappell to make a new programme African Sanctus Revisited

David Fanshawe was an English composer and explorer He wrote a large amount of music especially for television programmes His best known composition is a choral work called African Sanctus

Fanshawe went to school at St Georges School Windsor Castle and Stowe School  He started his career as a musician and producer for documentary films He studied composition at the Royal College of Music He became known for the music he wrote for films and TV In 1970 he performed Salaams in the Queen Elizabeth Hall London This was a work based on the rhythms of pearl divers in Bahrain

He spent several years travelling to many parts of the world collecting recordings of people singing their own traditional music He travelled to the Middle East then to Africa and to islands of the Pacific Ocean In all these places he had to get to know the people and get them to trust him so that they would let him record their music

His African Sanctus was a result of his trip down the Nile It combines recordings he made there with a choir and orchestra singing It has been performed thousands of times all over the world

Fanshawe died on 5 July 2010

Kota Kinabalu formerly Jesselton is the capital of Sabah state in Malaysia It is also the capital of the West Coast Division of Sabah The city is on the northwest coast of Borneo facing the South China Sea The Tunku Abdul Rahman National Park is on one side and Mount Kinabalu which gave the city its name is nearby Kota Kinabalu proper has a population of 579304 while the larger urban area has an estimated population of 700000 It is the largest urban centre in Sabah and the sixth largest in Malaysia

Kota Kinabalu is often known as KK within Malaysia and internationally It is a major tourist destination and a popular gateway for travellers visiting Sabah and Borneo Kinabalu National Park is about 90 kilometres from the city and there are many tourist attractions in and around the city Kota Kinabalu is also one of the major industrial and commercial centres of East Malaysia These two factors combine to make Kota Kinabalu one of the fastest growing cities in Malaysia

In the late 1800s the British North Borneo Company began to establish colonies throughout North Borneo In 1882 the Company founded a small settlement on Gaya Island which was already inhabited by the Bajau people In 1897 this first settlement was burned and destroyed by Bajau rebels led by Mat Salleh

After the rebellion the Company decided to relocate the settlement to the more easily defended mainland opposite Pulau Gaya A nearby fishing village named Api Api was the next settlement of the Company This new location was then designated as the main harbour and port as well as the terminus for the North Borneo Railway It was expanded and renamed Jesselton named after Sir Charles Jessel the then Vice Chairman of the Company

Eventually Jesselton became a major trading post of North Borneo dealing in rubber rattan honey and wax The new railway was used to transport goods to Jesselton harbour Bajau uprisings during these times were not uncommon and the Company worked to quell the long standing threat of piracy in the region

Jesselton was razed by the retreating British early in World War II to prevent it from falling into the hands of the Japanese After the Japanese takeover of Borneo it was again renamed Api Rebellions against the Japanese military administration have taken place in Api One major rebellion occurred in 1943 by the group called Kinabalu Guerrillas consisting of local inhabitants The rebellion was however quelled by the Japanese forces after their leader Albert Kwok was arrested and executed in 1944 At the later stages of the war what remained of the town was destroyed again by Allied bombings as part of the Borneo Campaign in 1945 leaving only three buildings standing The war in North Borneo ended with the official surrender of the Japanese 37th Army by Lieutenant General Baba Masao in Labuan on September 10 1945

After the war the British North Borneo Company returned to administer Jesselton but was unable to finance the huge costs of reconstruction They gave control of North Borneo to the British Crown in 1946 The new colonial government elected to rebuild Jesselton as the capital of North Borneo instead of Sandakan which had also been destroyed by the war

When North Borneo together with Sarawak Singapore Federation of Malaya formed the Federation of Malaysia in 1963 the state became known as Sabah and Jesselton remained its capital Jesselton was renamed Kota Kinabalu on September 30 1968 and received official city status from the Malaysian government on February 2 2000

Kota Kinabalu is named after Mount Kinabalu about 90 kilometres east northeast of the city The meaning and origin of the name Kinabalu is uncertain One theory suggests it means Chinese widow where Kina meaning Chinese in Kadazandusun language and balu meaning widow in Malay language This theory derives from a folk tale about a Chinese prince who came to the mountain in search of a giant pearl which was guarded by a dragon at the top of the mountain While he was here he married a local woman but later returned to China and left the woman heartbroken Alternatively it is also argued that Kinabalu or Akinabalu is the name of the dragon which guards the giant pearl itself Another theory suggests that the term is derived from the name Aki Nabalu meaning the revered place of the dead in which Aki means ancestors or grandfather and Nabalu being a name for the mountain in the Dusun language Finally there is also a source claiming that the term originated from Ki Nabalu where Ki meaning have or exist and Nabalu meaning spirit of the dead

Kota is a Malay word for a fort town or a city It is also used formally in a few other Malaysian towns and cities for example Kota Bahru Kota Tinggi and Kota Kemuning It could also be used informally to refer to any towns or cities Henceforth a direct translation of the name Kota Kinabalu into English would be City of Kinabalu or Kinabalu City

Besides Jesselton there has been a number of other claims as to the original name for Kota Kinabalu The most popular as mentioned above is Api Api or sometimes simply Api which is a Malay word meaning Fire It was apparently named as such by the mainly Bajau locals to denote the blazing of the British administrative office in Pulau Gaya instigated by Mat Salleh as well as other blazing incidents normally perpetrated by pirates There were claims however that it was actually named after a nearby river called Sungai Api Api Another theory states that Api Api is the local name of the common Avicennia tree that grows in abundance around the area Transliterated into the formal Chinese name of Ya Bi the Hakkas here too adopted this name and some still use this name to this day Besides Api Api another suggested historical name was Deasoka which roughly means below the coconut tree in the Bajau language The Bajau locals purportedly used this name to refer to a village on the southern part of the city which was filled with coconut trees Another name was Singgah Mata which literally mean transit eye but can be loosely translated as meaning pleasing to the eye It is a name purportedly given by fishermen from Pulau Gaya referring to the strip of land of what is today Kota Kinabalu city center Today all these names have been immortalised into names of streets or buildings around the city Some examples are Lintasan Deasoka Api Api Centre Jalan Singgah Mata and Jesselton Point

Being the capital city of Sabah Kota Kinabalu plays an important role in the political and economic welfare of the population in the entire state It is the seat of the state government where almost all of their ministries and agencies are based Most of the Malaysian federal government agencies and departments are also in Kota Kinabalu The Sabah State Legislative Assembly is at nearby Likas Bay There are four Members of Parliament representing four parliamentary constituencies in the city Sepanggar Kota Kinabalu Putatan and Penampang The city also elects 9 representatives to the state legislature from the state assembly districts of Karambunai Inanam Likas Api Api Luyang Tanjung Aru Petagas Kepayan and Moyog

Kota Kinabalu currently has seven sister cities

The Temple of Jupiter Capitolium or Temple of the Capitoline Triad was a temple in the Roman city of Pompeii in Italy At the beginning this temple was dedicated to Jupiter alone it was built in the mid 2nd century BC at the same time as the temple of Apollo was being worked on  this was the era at which Roman influence over Pompeii was at its height and so Roman Jupiter beat out the Greek Apollo as the towns highest god Jupiter was the ruler of the gods and the protector of Rome where his temple was the center of Roman Religion and of the cult of state

As the most important god in Ancient Rome many temples were built to honor Jupiter or the entire Capitoline Triad in towns newly taken over by the Romans This was also true for Pompeii where the Temple of Jupiter that was already there was enlarged and made more Roman when the Romans took over

Pompeii was taken over by the Romans beginning in 310 BC It was still allowed to mostly run itself however until the Italic Revolt against Rome at the beginning of the 1st century BC

The building style of the town was largely borrowed from the Greeks but Roman rule would soon lead to changes in this style As opposed to the previous Samnite rulers of Pompeii the Romans thought that the building style was very important in religious as well as everyday life Pompeii was changed into a much more public and open place Public buildings and spaces would eventually be able to be found all over the city 

The temple had been built in 150 BC to be a very noticeable part of the forum and it became Pompeiis main temple after Rome took over The inside of the temple housed the main room of the temple which held the statues of Jupiter Juno and Minerva and which only the priests were allowed to enter

In 62 an earthquake shook the city of Pompeii destroying much of the Temple of Jupiter After this the much smaller Temple of Jupiter Meilichios became the main place of worship to Jupiter and his group of three The first Temple of Jupiter was still waiting to be fixed when Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 burying the town of Pompeii under lava and ash The hollow temple can still be seen in Pompeii today 

Milang is small town that is found on the shores of Lake Alexandrina just over 20 kms from Strathalbyn South Australia

Gilberts Potoroo is an Australian marsupial sometimes called a rat kangaroo It has a pointed face and it is about the size of a rabbit Once thought to be extinct it is listed as being critically endangered There are only about 40 of the animals left in the world Gilberts Potoroo is one of the worlds rarest mammals

They live in a small area about convert1000haacre0lkonabbron on the southwest coast near Albany Western Australia This area is in the Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve Gilberts Potoroos have been released on nearby Bald Island and are breeding successfully 

Gilberts potoroo was first discovered in 1840 and named in 1841 after the English naturalist and explorer John Gilbert Gilbert had collected several animals at King George Sound in Australia including this potoroo Gilberts potoroo was not seen again for many years even though many people had searched for them in the 1970s The species was believed to be extinct for 120 years before it was re discovered in 1994 in Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve Liz Sinclair had been studying wallabies and caught the potoroo in one of her traps 

Potoroos live under thick bushes and shrubs They have made tunnels and paths through the bush so they can get around easily When moving slowly they use all four legs but to move quickly they can hop like a kangaroo Potoroos are nocturnal and they spend their days hiding They only come out into the open very often They live in small groups of between three to five animals They eat different kinds of truffles and fungi Australia has many different kinds of truffles and potoroos like to eat many of them Potoroos have sharp three toed claws that help them dig into the ground to find the truffles growing in the soil After eating them the potoroos help spread the seeds of the truffles through their wastes 

The female potoroos can have two babies in a year but only carry one at a time They can keep a second embryo in a state of diapause while the first embryo is growing If the first baby does not survive the second baby can start growing right away It is not known how long gestation is for Gilberts potoroo but it is thought to be the same as the Long nosed Potoroo about 38 days

When Gilberts potoroo was rediscovered more animals were captured to start a breeding program This would help increase the numbers of potoroos A few young were born in the first couple of years but then breeding just stopped Many studies have looked at what they eat and how they live but they are still can not get the potoroos to breed in captivity

In 2001 a group was formed called the Gilberts Potoroo Action Group This group helps educate and tell people about the potoroo It also helps with raising money for more study and captive breeding programs for Gilberts potoroo

Three potoroos one male and two females were moved to Bald Island in August 2005 This island is free from other animals like cats and foxes that would eat the potoroos Since then four more potoroos have been sent to start a breeding colony

There is a lot of danger for the survival of Gilberts Potoroo Because of the small area where they live they could be lost in a bushfire Foxes and cats could easily kill all the potoroos There may not be enough potoroos to give them enough genetic differences to survive a virus There is not enough natural bushland at Two Peoples Bay and there is too much cleared land next to the nature reserve





In astronomy a G V star is a main sequence star of spectral type G and luminosity class V on the Hertzsprung Russell Diagram Such a star which can also be called a yellow dwarf is small and has a surface temperature of between 5300 and 6000 K Tables VII VIII Like other main sequence stars a G V star turns hydrogen to helium in its core by means of nuclear fusion

Our Sun is the most commonly known example of a G V star Each second it combines around 600 million tons of hydrogen to helium changing about 4 million tons of matter to energy Other G V stars include Alpha Centauri A Tau Ceti and 51 Pegasi

The term yellow dwarf is actually an incorrect name as G stars can be any color from white for early types like the Sun to only slightly yellow for the older types See Spectral Classification for a chart of star color by light type Our own Sun is in fact white but looks yellow through the Earths atmosphere due to what is called Rayleigh scattering Even though the name dwarf is used to compare yellow main sequence stars from giant stars yellow dwarfs like the Sun are 90 brighter than all of the stars in the Galaxy

A G V star will combine hydrogen and helium togther to make energy for around 10 billion years until there are no more gases left to combine inside the center of the star When this happens the star will grow to many times its earlier size and become a red giant like the star that is named Aldebaran Eventually the red giant will lose its outer layers of gas which will become a planetary nebula while the inside of the star will cool and shrink into a small very heavy white dwarf

Les Noces is a musical composition by Igor Stravinsky The title means The Wedding but it is usually known by the French title Les Noces 

It was originally written for a ballet but it is often performed as a concert piece without the dancing It is for the unusual combination of singers percussion instruments and four pianos It is often described as a dance cantata

History Stravinsky first thought of the idea of this ballet in 1913 At first he wanted it to be for a large orchestra like The Rite of Spring but then he changed his mind and experimented with other unusual instruments including a pianola Then he realized that it would be difficult for the other instruments and the dancers to be together with the pianola Finally he decided to write it for soprano mezzo soprano tenor and bass soloists choir and a large group of percussion instruments and four pianos 

The 1919 version of Les Noces with cimbaloms harmonium and pianola was never heard at the time and only first performed in 1981 in Paris conducted by Pierre Boulez

The ballet as we know it now was first performed on 13 June 1923 by the Ballets Russes with choreography by Bronislava Nijinska The orchestra was conducted by Ernest Ansermet 

Stravinsky wrote the words himself using some traditional Russian wedding lyrics Today the work is usually sung in the original Russian although sometimes French or English translations are used 

The music sounded very modern at the time it was written It often sounds like Russian folk song but Stravinsky also uses lots of irregular rhythms which makes it very lively but also very difficult to perform and to dance to

The works lasts about 35 minutes

At the beginning the bride Nastasia is having her hair done She seems to be complaining that it hurts when her hair is pulled The choir sing to her about how lovely her life will be with her husband Ftis and the nightingales will sing to them in the garden They sing to the Virgin Mary asking her to be with them on their wedding day They sing about the bridegrooms fair locks They ask for a blessing for the young couple The actual wedding ceremony is not described In the last of the four scenes we see the wedding feast The people get very merry and start to get drunk The bridal couple are finally led to the bridal chamber

John Gilbert was an English naturalist and explorer He collected animal specimens for English naturalist John Gould Australias rarest animal Gilberts Potoroo Potorous gilberti and the Gilbert Einasleigh River were named after him

Gilbert was born on 14 March but the exact year is not known It must have been between 1810 and 1815 and so most books use 1812 Gilbert was a taxidermist for the Zoological Society of London He met English naturalist John Gould and went to Australia in 1838 with Gould Gould paid him 100 a year to collect and preserve animals and birds for him

The Cornish self government movement is a social movement which seeks greater autonomy for the distinctive area of Cornwall The movements advocates argue that Cornwall is not merely a county of England but a duchy and a distinctive British nation which has never been formally incorporated into England via an Act of Union of 1707 Supporters of Cornish self government who assert that Cornwall is or ought to be a separate legal entity from England do not necessarily mean to advocate full independence from the United Kingdom but rather seek official recognition for Cornwall as one of the constituent countries or home nations of the UK

Some supporters of Cornish self government question the legitimacy of English rule in Cornwall due to the failure of the former Parliament of England to ever pass an Act of Union although their claims are not generally recognised within the United Kingdom However many see some degree of autonomy as a stepping stone towards this and are supportive of the Cornish Assembly Campaign

A calculator is a machine which allows people to do math operations more easily For example a normal calculator will add subtract multiply and divide Some also do square roots and more complex calculators can help with calculus and draw function graphs Calculators are found everywhere A computer can act as a calculator 

Some calculators like the abacus will work without batteries Others like the electronic calculator most of the time require batteries There are two types of electronic calculators simple calculators which can only add subtract multiply and divide and sometimes take square roots and scientific calculators which can do many other things such as calculate factorials sines and cosines

There are different ways to write mathematics on a calculator For example after pressing 3 and then and then 2 and then the number 5 will be displayed on the screen This is called infix notation Many more advanced calculators use postfix notation that is 3 4 instead of 3 4 The third way of noting things 3 4 called prefix notation is rarely found on calculators

A pocket calculator is a small calculator that helps people do mathematics It is so small that it can be put in a pocket Its most common use is for addition subtraction multiplication and division Pocket calculators are often powered by solar cells with a technology known as photovoltaics They are commonly seen in schools and businesses around the world and can be used quickly and efficiently for simple mathematical problems Another name for them is miniature calculator or mini calculator

A scientific calculator can do more things It can often use exponents pi trigonometric ratios and the order of operations Scientific calculators can also use bigger numbers They tend to cost more than pocket calculators

Plurality voting is the most common method for electing representatives in the United States Voters vote for one candidate and the candidate with the most votes wins 

Political parties often use a primary in order to avoid splitting their party vote in the general election For example if 60 of the voters are Republican and 40 Democrat but two Republicans run for the same office and each get 30 of the vote the Democrat would win with 40 since that is the most votes even if 60 of voters least preferred the Democrat 

If more than two candidates are on the general election ballot voters often compromise vote an acceptable candidate whom the media told them has a chance of winning 

Opponents of plurality voting argue that the media has too much power since they tell people which of the two has a chance and that voting for a third candidate is in effect voting for the worse of the two strong candidates It is theoretically possible that the two front runner candidates not to be not centrist and not to represent the people if the media are controlled by those candidates

Proponents of plurality voting argue that it is very simple and that it forces voters to elect a centrist candidate through compromise voting

Instant runoff voting is a method of electing one political candidate to office from a list of more than two but it can also be used for other group decisions Voters rank the candidates from favorite to least favorite with only their top choices being counted each time Ballots are counted and a series of simulated rounds is conducted If no candidate has a majority of the votes in any round the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated and those voters next choice votes are then counted This is repeated until a candidate has a majority

Instant runoff voting has been used in Australias lower house for more than 80 years That house is strongly dominated by two parties It has also been used to elect mayors in some cities in the United States Voter turn out is typically the same as with plurality voting

Proponents believe instant runoff voting allows them to vote for their first choice candidate and still help the lessor of evils if the first choice is eliminated They believe Instant Runoff Voting to be the only way let voters vote their true intentions and undermine the two party system By having more candidates on the ballot incumbents are more likely to be kicked out of office

Opponents argue that if at least three candidates have a chance of winning voting for ones favorite could cause a compromise candidate to lose in the first round Their favorite might then lose against the least preferred candidate in the second round Voters votes cannot be transferred to their second choice if their second choice is eliminated before their first choice is Voters often use their first choice vote for a compromise vote the same as with plurality

While theoretically simple instant runoff voting often requires computers because the rankings on each ballot matter for determining the elimination order and can ot be counted in aggregate Opponents of Instant runoff voting often oppose computer counting of ballots since it is difficult for ordinary citizens to count the ballots by hand and catch any fraud The fact that a candidate has fewer votes does not mean the candidate is less popular but that the candidate was squeezed out on both sides of the political spectrum Instant runoff voting can eliminate centrists in the last elimination

Between 1969 and 2003 824 Harrier variants were delivered Manufacture of new Harriers ended in 1997 The last remanufactured aircraft was delivered in December 2003 This ended the Harrier production line

The Harrier is used by many military forces The United States Marine Corps and the Royal Air Force use versions which are specially designed for taking off and landing on aircraft carriers Other countries which use the Harrier include Thailand and India

In 2006 the RAF introduced a new version of the Harrier the GR9 This is an updated version of the previous version the GR7 It has a top speed of 574 knots

The Harrier was used a lot during the Falklands War Harriers flew a total of 1561 sorties shot down 20 enemy planes with 10 Harriers lost Of the ten lost only six were shot down the others were damaged in accidents on the carrier The Sea Harriers made the Argentine Air Force much less effective than they hoped to be

When talking about file systems a folder is a way to organize computer files A folder is a storage space that many files can be placed into to group them together and organize the computer A folder can also contain other folders For many computer software applications there is a current working directory This is the folder that the application runs in In Unix and Linux a directory is a special type of file

Folders can be put together to make a filesystem and are laid out like a tree The folders inside folders are like branches and sub branches off the tree trunk This idea is used by the software to allow the user to navigate the folders On some operating systems shortcuts or links can be made from one folder to another to make it appear that one folder is contained in two different parent folders On Unix systems this is called a symbolic link and is similar in function to a hyperlink

An icon when talked about in computing is a picture which usually stands for a computer program computer file folder or an action for a program to do Icons are usually small pictures but not always Sometimes the user can change what size an icon is

Icons are used in many places on a computer The desktop contains icons as shortcuts  clicking on these icons opens up the file folder or application that they stand for For example in Microsoft Windows the desktop will often have an icon for the Recycle Bin and the icon usually looks like a trash can

Shortcut icons also show up in other places such as folders and the start menu These icons work the same as on the desktop

Many computer programs use icons on buttons When the user clicks on the button something happens For example a button with an icon of a printer will usually help the user print what is currently open While a button with a magnifying glass will let the user search for something

Peter Grimes is an opera by Benjamin Britten It was first performed in 1945 It is generally thought to be the most important British opera of the 20th century It is about a community in a small fishing village in the east of England in the 1820s Peter Grimes is a fisherman who feels that the people do not want to have anything to do with him He wants to make lots of money so that he can marry and get peoples respect In his obsession with catching as much fish as possible he is cruel to the boys who help him and they die At the end of the opera Grimes drowns himself

Britten wrote the main part for his lifelong friend Peter Pears to sing

There are three acts and the opera starts with a prologue and ends with an epilogue Some of the scenes are joined by continuous music and some of this is often played separately in concerts This music is known as the Four Sea Interludes

When World War II started Britten and Pears went to America to avoid the war In 1941 Britten started to feel homesick because he read an article by EMForster about George Crabbe a poet who had lived in the same part of England that Britten came from Britten started to realize that in order to compose well he had to go back to his own country Britten and Pears returned to England in 1942 

The conductor Sergei Koussevitzky asked Britten to write an opera based on a poem by George Crabbe The poem called The Borough was about the story of Peter Grimes The village in the poem was fictitious but it was very much like Aldeburgh where Britten later made his home Britten asked Montagu Slater to write the libretto based on the story of Crabbes poem

The opera was first performed at Sadlers Wells Theatre in London on 7 June 1945 by the company which later became English National Opera The conductor was Reginald Goodall  Pears sang the title role 

The first American performance was in 1946 at Tanglewood conducted by Koussevitzkys pupil Leonard Bernstein Britten dedicated it to Koussevitskys wife

The first young boy who was an apprentice to Peter Grimes has already been killed He was at sea for three days without water to drink An inquest is being held to decide whether Grimes is guilty of the boys death The people all seem to think he is guilty The judge decides that the boys death was an accident However he says to Grimes that he should not get another apprentice Grimes is very angry at being told this Ellen Orford a school teacher comforts him In their beautiful duet Ellen and Peter sing at first in different keys but finally sing together in the same key

The scenery shows the Moot Hall the Boar Inn and the church People are saying Good morning to one another especially the Rector who says it many times The fishermen start work mending their nets Keene tells Grimes that he has found another apprentice for him He is a poor boy who lives in the workhouse Nobody wants Grimes to have another apprentice Hobson the cart man refuses to fetch him But Ellen supports Peter She sings to the crowd Let her among you without fault cast the first stone Hobson goes off to get the boy A terrible storm is coming 

The scene now changes to The Boar Inn It is very noisy inside Bob Boles gets drunk and wants to make love to the landladys nieces The storm is still raging outside Grimes comes in People are shocked but Grimes does not notice He sings and song about human fate Now the Great Bear and Pleiades The tune is in the orchestra in canon while Grimes sings very simple lines of music People are embarrassed so they start to sing a round Old Joe has gone fishing It has three tunes and has seven counts in a bar The boy is brought in and Grimes takes him off in spite of the storm

The opening of the next act is peaceful It is Sunday morning People are in church and now again we hear the singing coming from the church Ellen talks to the boy She is horrified to see he has a bruise on his neck Grimes says it was an accident He gets annoyed that Ellen is worried about the boy and runs off with him The people of the village have noticed and march up to Grimess hut The scene ends with a peaceful contrast a duet sung by the two nieces

The orchestra play a beautiful passacaglia which links to the next scene Grimes is accusing the boy of telling stories Then he starts to feels guilty about the first boys death He hears the villagers coming and tells the boy they have to go fishing He pushes him out onto the rocks and the boy falls to his death When the villagers arrive at the hut they find it empty

Act 3 opens with music describing moonlight at night People are dancing in the Moot Hall People are very merry  Mrs Sedley tries to tell people that Grimes is a murderer but they do not listen People then start to leave saying Goodnight to one another Balstrode is walking with Ellen He tells her that Grimess boat is in but Grimes cannot be found A boys jersey has been washed up on the shore Ellen sings an aria Embroidery in childhood was a luxury of idleness It is a moment of stillness in the drama

A short interlude based on one chord leads to the next scene in which people are looking for Grimes Grimes drags himself onto the shore He seems to have gone mad We hear a foghorn as he sings Balstrode tells Grimes that he should go out to sea in his boat and sink it

The opera ends with an epilogue in which the scene is the same as the beginning of the opera Someone says that a boat has been seen sinking out to sea but no one is interested The people have forgotten Grimes and continue their lives without him

The Essjay controversy is about a well known Wikipedia administrator and salaried Wikia worker Essjay who later said he was Ryan Jordan

In February 2007 Essjay was discovered to have made false claims about his school certificates and job experiences on his Wikipedia user page and to news reporter Stacy Schiff during a report for The New Yorker

Many people reacted in many ways to the controversy Many articles and comments were made electronic print and broadcast media the Wikipedia community checked Essjays article changes to check for errors and debated proposals to improve the projects handling of personal identification In his activities as an editor Essjay had spent less time changing the content of articles and more time addressing vandalism and resolving editorial disputes

Wikipedia co founder Jimmy Wales supported Essjays use of an identity saying I regard it as a pseudonym and I dont really have a problem with it Later Wales changed his opinion and asked for Essjay to quit from his jobs with Wikipedia and Wikia Wales stated that he withdrew his support when he learned that EssJaysic used his false credentials in content disputes on Wikipedia

Stacy Schiff a Pulitzer Prize winning reporter writing for The New Yorker interviewed Essjay as a source for an article about Wikipedia He was suggested for this to her by a member of the Wikimedia Foundation The New Yorker said Essjay was willing to describe his work as a Wikipedia administrator but would not identify himself other than by confirming the biographical details that appeared on his user page

During the interview Jordan told The New Yorker and had said on his Wikipedia user page that he had doctoral degrees in theology and canon law He also said he worked as a tenured professor at a private university It was later found that he was 24 years old and had quit community college with no qualifications The New Yorker published a correction in February 2007 which brought the issue to broader public attention

The article said that Essjay was on Wikipedia some 14 hours or more a day The article also said he was careful to keep his online life a secret from his co workers and friends Essjay was pictured as taking his laptop to class so he could be available to other Wikipedians while giving a quiz He said that he needed anonymity to avoid cyberstalking

Essjay said that he had sent an email to a college professor using his false personas credentials telling for Wikipedias accuracy In the message he wrote in part I am an administrator of the online encyclopedia project Wikipedia I am also a tenured professor of theology feel free to have a look at my Wikipedia userpage to gain an idea of my background and credentials

When Essjay was hired by Wikia in January 2007 he made changes to his Wikia profile and came clean on who he really was showing himself as Ryan Jordan Other Wikipedia editors asked Essjay questions on his Wikipedia talk page about the difference between his new Wikia profile and his previously claimed credentials Essjay posted a reason in response to the first question saying that

He later said on his Wikipedia user page about having fooled Schiff by doing a good job playing the part

Social activist and Wikipedia critic Daniel Brandt then told The New Yorker about the difference in profiles In late February 2007 the magazine updated its article with a change saying that Essjay now says that his real name is Ryan Jordan that he is twenty four and holds no advanced degrees and that he has never taught

On March 3 2007 Andrew Lih Assistant Professor and Director of Technology Journalism and of the Media Studies Centre at the University of Hong Kong said on his blog that a part of Essjays comments on the incident entered the dangerous domain of defamation and libel against Stacy Schiff Lih quoted Essjay as writing on his Wikipedia talk page Further she Schiff made several offers to compensate me for my time and my response was that if she truly felt the need to do so she should donate to the Foundation instead Lih noted

Lih wrote that he contacted Schiff for comment about whether she had offered to pay Essjay for his time and quoted her return email In it Schiff said that Essjays statement was complete nonsense

Talking about Jordan Wales said Mr Ryansic was a friend and still is a friend He is a young man and he has offered me a heartfelt personal apology which I have accepted I hope the world will let him go in peace to build an honorable life and reputation Essjay had said in reply at the time with a statement on his Wikipedia page in part saying

Reaction from inside the Wikipedia community to the EssjayJordan identity difference was pointed There were many comments  While most editors opposed at least some of his actions responses ranged from offering complete support to accusing Jordan of fraud

As the controversy went further the Wikipedia community began looking at Essjays previous changes Some felt he had relied upon his false professorship to prove he was right about his changes People have gone through his edits and found places where he was basically cashing in on his fake credentials to bolster his arguments said Michael Snow a Wikipedia administrator and founder of the Wikipedia community newspaper The Wikipedia Signpost Those will get looked at again For instance Essjay had recommended sources such as Catholicism for Dummies a book granted the nihil obstat and imprimatur by the Roman Catholic Church Essjay defended his use of the book by telling fellow Wikipedia editors in a disagreement over the editing of the article Imprimatur This is a text I often require for my students and I would hang my own PhD on its sic credibility

Wales was reported to be considering broken wikt linkvetvetting all persons who broken wikt linkadjudicateadjudicate on factual disputes I dont think this incident exposes any inherent weakness in Wikipedia but it does expose a weakness that we will be working to address Wales added He insisted that Wikipedia editors still would be able to remain anonymous if they wished We always prefer to give a positive incentive rather than absolute prohibition so that people can contribute without a lot of hassle Wales commented However he also warned that Its always inappropriate to try to win an argument by flashing your credentials and even more so if those credentials are inaccurate Wales argued contributors to the site who claim certain credentials will soon have to prove they really have them However Florence Devouard chair of the Wikimedia Foundation was not supportive of his credential suggestion saying I think what matters is the quality of the content which we can improve by enforcing policies such as cite your source not the quality of credentials showed by an editor A formal suggestion that users saying to have qualification would have to give something to prove they really do have them before using them was rejected by the Wikipedia community like all previous such suggestions

As a follow up to his first comments to The New Yorker Wales wrote this apology to the magazine which showed in its March 19 2007 issue

Wales stated his regret that Essjay had made a series of very bad judgments He said he hopes the Wkipedia would be better off from the controversy

Andrew Orlowski a Wikipedia critic and writer for The Registera British technology news and opinion websitecriticized Jimmy Wales for hiring Essjay at the venture capital funded Wikia and for making him a member on the Wikipedia Arbitration Committee Essjay had admitted his stated academic and professional credentials were false before he was made a member Orlowski added that Essjays actions showed a harmful community way of thinking inside Wikipedia

Others to comment negatively included ZDNet writer Mitch Ratcliffe Ratcliffe asked why lying about ones background qualifies a person to work for a company like Wikia which proposes to help communities to record accurate information and asked for additional details such as when he fired Jordan and the reasons for the firing as well as when he endorsed Jordan in public statements

Larry Sanger editor in chief of online encyclopedia Citizendium and a co founder of Wikipedia who quit the project in 2002 called Essjays response a defiant non apology and elsewhere stated Essjays actions as identity fraud Showing comments by Essjay on his Wikipedia talk pages Sanger stated that other members of Wikipedia management including Angela Beesley and Brad Patrick had worked in hiring Jordan when they knew of the identity difference Sanger also made note that Jordans dismissal was the result of public response That Only after these sad facts were publicly made aware only after there was a response did Jimmy Wales decide to ask for Essjays to quit

Other comments

Following the media broadcast of the Essjay controversy a number of people noted the damage to the credibility of Wikipedia On March 2 2007 a report in The Chronicle of Higher Education commented the incident is clearly damaging to Wikipedias credibilityespecially with professors who will now note that one of the sites most visible academics has turned out to be a fraud Ross Brann a professor of Judeo Islamic classes at Cornell University in Ithaca stated that Wikipedia is without a way to expertly review saying They could make up your life if they wanted to Brann also said that Wikipedia has no place in the University and he believed the Essjay incident would do nothing to change the negative opinion that academics generally hold about the online encyclopedia Students at Cornell stated that they may continue to use Wikipedia as a quick source of information though they would not cite it in scholarly work

The gameplay of the Pokmon series of role playing video games involves the capture and training of a variety of fictional creatures called Pokmon and using them to battle other trainers Each successive generation of games builds upon this concept by introducing new Pokmon items and gameplay concepts Some of the general concepts were featured elsewhere before being introduced in the games double battles appeared in the anime long before appearing in the games and Pokmon abilities are similar to the Pokmon Powers introduced in the Pokmon Trading Card Game

Battling is a large part of the games Pokmon can be found in the wild in dark grass caves forests ponds the ocean and even underwater Also whenever the player walks in front of another trainer they must battle Hundreds of trainers are in each of the main series Pokmon games

Pokmon have six statistics which all affect how they perform in battles Statistics can be raised by using items and by training the Pokmon

Before Pokmon Gold and Silver were released the Special Attack and Special Defense stats were combined into one statistic Special This later became too complicated so it was divided into Special Attack and Special Defense

Starting in Pokmon Ruby and Sapphire Pokmon have abilities which affect them in various ways These can be abilities that work while in battle or when the player is just walking around An example is the ability Oblivious which prevents the Pokmon from becoming attracted to Pokmon of the opposite gender that use the move Attract

Each Pokmon has either one or two types Which types it has affect how it performs when it battles other Pokmon of other types For example a Fire type Pokmon is at a disadvantage to a Water type but has a large advantage against a Grass type It could be compared to a more complex game of rock paper scissors

This is a list of the types

And two more were added when Pokmon Gold and Silver were released

Pokmon Gyms are buildings where the player faces a Gym Leader who focuses one of the 17 types of Pokmon There are also trainers in the Gym that the player can battle and they also use mostly that type Beating the Gym Leader earns you a Badge which increases your skills

Pokmon evolve to turn into different Pokmon from the same evolutionary line Doing so they become stronger and can learn more powerful moves but learn moves at higher levels

This is the most common of the ways that Pokmon evolve Pokmon in this category evolve when they reach a certain level 

Some Pokemon can only evolve by level in a certain place

This is another way that Pokmon evolve Some Pokmon can only evolve if they are given certain evolution stones

This is another way that Pokmon evolve Some Pokmon only evolve if they are traded to a friend 

Some Pokmon only evolve if traded to a friend while holding an item

Another way Pokmon evolve is through happiness Whenever the player character in the game walks 1000 steps gives their Pokmon a vitamin such as Protein Iron Carbos Calcium or Zinc training it until it gains a level or when the character does something else to make it happy it will gain happiness points The item Soothe Bell multiplies this amount Once a Pokmon has reached a certain happiness level it will evolve after it is leveled once sometimes depending on the time of day

Example Eevee evolves into either Espeon or Umbreon if its happiness rating is maxed out into Espeon if this happens during the day or Umbreon if it happens during the night However such day and night distinction exists only in the second and fourth generation games

Pokmon can evolve after learning certain moves and leveling up

A large number of different items exist They are used to help the player or their Pokmon

A Pok Ball is a red and white sphere that is used to catch Pokmon Many different forms of it exist like the Great Ball the Ultra Ball the Heavy Ball the Net Ball the Dive Ball the Friend Ball and the Master Ball Each of these are different colors

The Pokdex is a tool used by Pokmon trainers all around the Pokmon world in different regions These regions include the Unova region the Sinnoh region the Hoenn region the Johto region and the Kanto region The Pokdex makes records of information about each of the different Pokmon There are 649 different species of Pokmon recorded in the world today Different Pokmon are caught in different regions and some Pokmon can only be caught in certain regions such as Dialga in the Sinnoh Region 

Legendary Pokmon are Pokmon that are very rare and there is usually only one in each game Examples of legendaries are Articuno Mewtwo Mew Lugia Groudon and Dialga They are hard to catch and are stronger than most Pokmon Some roam around while others can be found in one spot until you KO or capture them If you KO a legendary it will usually leave and will never be found again unless the game is restarted Because of this players usually save before engaging the Pokmon

Shiny Pokmon are a different color than that Pokmon normal for their species An example would be a yellow Bulbasaur They are extremely rare there is only a 1 in 8192 chance of an encountered Pokmon being shiny

A quickie may not always mean copulation It may be only be oral sex or mutual masturbation According to some a quickie between a heterosexual couple generally satisfies only the mans desire Others claim that quickies can be a major turn on for a woman too but still may not give a woman enough time to lubricate naturally and so require the use of a water based lubricant Some consider quickies a solution to unequal sexual desire in a relationship but if they become the only form of sex the relationship may suffer For gay men a quickie sometimes means casual sex like a hand job It does not usually happen with lesbians however

The position of both partners is important in performing deep throat For deep throating the giving partners mouth and throat will need to be aligned into a straight line and he or she will need to respiration through the nose It is important for the giving partner to be in a position to control any pelvic thrust during deep throating to be able to pull the penis out if needed and for the receiving partner not to thrust as during irrumatio

Over the edge is a common position for deep throating In this position the giving partner lays on hisher back with the head hanging off the edge of the bed and the receiving partner stands or places himself on his knees in front of the giving partner with his penis at the giving partners mouth

The Hertzsprung Russell diagram is a graph of many stars It shows the relation between stars luminosity and their temperature These diagrams are not pictures or maps of the locations of the stars Rather Hertzsprung Russell diagrams plot each star on a graph measuring the stars brightness versus its temperature Hertzsprung Russell diagrams are also called H R diagrams or HRDs

You can see an example of a Hertzsprung Russell diagram to the right This diagram is based on measurements from 23000 stars in our Milky Way galaxy The Hertzsprung Russell diagram is named after its creators astronomers Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell

The vertical axis of a Hertzsprung Russell diagram shows the luminosity or brightness of the stars as if they were all measured from the same distance Another term for this is absolute magnitude The brighter a star is the higher its plot will be on this chart

The horizontal axis shows the surface temperature of the stars However the temperatures go down not up as you move to the right That is the left of the diagram contains stars with the highest temperature plots while the right shows stars with temperatures of only 3000K

In general the temperature of a star relates to its color At the top of the chart along with the temperatures are the Spectral Classes The hottest stars are blue white those in the middle temperatures are yellow and the coolest ones are red

As a matter of fact when Hertzsprung Russell diagrams were developed in the early 1900s astronomers did not know how to find out the temperature of a star The first diagrams plotted stars absolute magnitude against color represented by the spectral classes from blue white to red 

As you can see stars tend to fall only into certain regions of the diagram when graphed in this way All stars in a given area of a Hertzsprung Russell diagram share similar luminosities and temperatures The main region where stars appear is the diagonal curved line going from the upper left to the lower right This is called the Main Sequence Above the main sequence is another region containing the red giants Below is a curved line representing the white dwarfs

These collections of stars by brightness and temperature are important when talking about stellar evolution In general stars are created in the main sequence After billions of years they expand into red giants Then after another one or two billion years they shrink into white dwarfs

It was only in the 1930s and 1940s that scientists began to understand the role of nuclear fusion in creating and keeping stars like our sun These days Hertzsprung Russell diagrams are used to present stellar evolution in pictures to students Theyre not used much any more for developing new scientific theories

On a Hertzsprung Russell diagram our Sun is plotted very close to the middle of the main sequence at the intersection of luminosity 1 and temperature 5780K Therefore the sun is class G or a yellow star

Tropical Depression One was the first tropical cyclone of the 2009 Atlantic hurricane season It was also the third tropical cyclone since 2007 to form before June 1 The storm formed on May 28 and moved across the Atlantic Ocean Later that day the storm started to weaken and fall apart On May 29 the storm died and became a remnant low

Before the storm became a depression some parts of the storm brought light rainfall to the eastern tip of North Carolina However there were no damages or deaths reported Also the National Hurricane Center did not give out any tropical storm watches or warnings for the storm

During mid May a disorganized low pressure area formed in the Atlantic Ocean about 290 miles south southwest of Wilmington North Carolina The low pressure moved north and started to become more organized On May 27 the storm was 120 miles south of Cape Hatteras North Carolina when the National Hurricane Center decided to start monitoring the storm A high pressure area that was located southeast of the storm pushed it into a northeast direction Then on 8 pm EDT the NHC stopped monitoring the storm as the low was not expected to strengthen anymore 

On May 28 the NHC started to monitor the storm again and on 1100 am EDT they declared the storm to be a tropical cyclone and named it Tropical Depression One At that time the storms location was about 310 mi south of Providence Rhode Island After it was named as a depression the storm showed deep convection and the center of circulation was at the northwestern part of the storm The reason why the depression restrengthened was because of lower wind shear and warmer ocean waters from the Gulf Stream Later that day the depression started to weaken when it moved into an area with higher wind shear and colder ocean waters Around 730 pm EDT a QuikSCAT satellite flew over the depression and found tropical storm force winds But the NHC thought the depression didnt strengthen and that winds were affected by rain After the satellite passed over the depression the center of circulation moved closer to the northwest edge of the storm and convection started to decrease

On May 29 the depression almost became a tropical storm when the storms strength was measured at T25 or 40 mph using the Dvorak technique But some of the measurements were also low as T15 which was the reason why the NHC didnt call it a tropical storm After a quick burst of convection during the night thunderstorm clouds inside the depression started to disappear by 300 am EDT By then the tropical depression was no longer expected to strength anymore and was forecasted to weaken A few hours later the center of circulation was ripped apart by strong wind shear while a nearby trough also started to absorb the rest of the storm With no convection around the center of the storm it became a remnant low during the afternoon At 500 pm EDT the NHC gave out its last advisory on Tropical Depression One The remains of the storm were later taken in by a warm front around 2 am EDT

On May 27 the cyclone brought some light rainfall to parts of coastal North Carolina before it was called Tropical Depression One Hatteras North Carolina saw 01 in of rainfall and wind speeds up to 15 mph with gusts to 23 mph The lowest atmospheric pressure recorded from the storm was 1009 mbar

When the storm became Tropical Depression One on May 28 it was the third time since 1851 that an Atlantic tropical cyclone formed before June 1 the official start of an Atlantic hurricane season The depression followed Subtropical Storm Andrea of May 2007 and Tropical Storm Arthur of May 2008 The first time this event happened was in 1932 1933 and 1934 the second time it happened was in 1951 1952 and 1953 The National Hurricane Center also reported that Tropical Depression One was also the farthest north a May tropical cyclone has ever formed

A projectile is something that is sent flying through the air usually as a weapon Any solid object that is thrown or fired out of something is a projectile For example an arrow fired from a bow a bullet or even a rock from a slingshot are all projectiles

Nadezhda Filaretovna von Meck was a rich Russian businesswoman She is remembered today for her strange relationship with the famous composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky For many years she paid him a lot of money each month so that he could compose They wrote passionate love letters to one another yet they never actually met one another

She also gave financial support to other people in the arts and music especially to the composers Nikolai Rubinstein and Claude Debussy

She was born Nadezhda Filaretovna Frolovskaya Her family owned a lot of land Her father loved music Her mother was a very determined business woman

Nadezhda learned to play the piano and she read many books learned foreign languages and learned about paintings

When she was 16 it was arranged for her to marry Karl von Meck a 28 year old engineer Together they had 18 children of whom 11 grew up to be adults

Her husband worked for the government He did not earn much money and the family was growing quickly Nadezhda wanted her husband to be rich At this time the steam engine had recently been invented and railways were just starting to be built in Russia Nadezhda thought her husband could earn a lot of money building railways She was right As an engineer he became responsible for buildings thousands of miles of railroad tracks The new railways allowed grain to be transported from Central Russia to places like Moscow He soon became a multi millionaire

Karl died suddenly in 1873 Nadezhda took over his business matters She sold one railway and controlled the other one with the help of her brother She kept away from other people living a solitary life with her children She was very strict indeed with them telling them exactly what to do all the time She did not like the idea of marriage but realized her children would need to marry She tried to get them to marry quickly probably for financial reasons 

Nadezhda von Meck was very rich and loved music so she became an important person in Russian performing arts Several musicians were employed by her in her house Claude Debussy lived with the family for a time as a music teacher to her daughters Debussy was a young man at the time and not yet famous 

The only concerts she went to were those given by the Russian Musical Society in Moscow She sat alone where nobody would notice her She met Nikolai Rubinstein She thought he had great talent but she disagreed with him a lot of the time 

In 1877 she came into contact with Tchaikovsky although she never met him She asked him to compose some pieces for violin and piano to play at her home Tchaikovsky knew she was a rich lady who paid well so he quickly composed some music They wrote letters to one another exchanged photographs of one another but they came to an agreement that they would never meet She paid him 6000 rubles a year This was a lot of money about twenty times the salary of an ordinary government worker He was able to stop teaching at the Moscow Conservatory and spend his time composing Between 1877 and 1890 they wrote about 1200 letters to one another Her encouragement was very important to him and helped him to keep happy when he felt depressed

In 1876 Tchaikovsky had decided to marry He was then a composer aged 36 He was gay and this was something terrible in Russia at that time He was very frightened that people would find out and that he would be bullied So he decided to marry He did not care who it was he married so long as it would make him look respectable  The next year he found a young girl called Antonina to marry He told Nadezhda She wrote to congratulate him and told him she hoped he would be happy A week later Tchaikovsky wrote to Nadezhda to ask for more money because the marriage had put him into debt A few weeks later he was writing again to her saying that he hated his wife He soon separated from her Writing to Nadezhda was a great support to him at this time It is impossible to know whether Nadezhda knew he was gay or whether that would have made a difference to her feelings At any rate she continued to write that she loved him She increased the amount she was paying him to 6000 roubles a year This was a lot of money about twenty times the salary of an ordinary government worker He was able to stop teaching at the Moscow Conservatory and spend his time composing Between 1877 and 1890 they wrote about 1200 letters to one another Her encouragement was very important to him and helped him to keep happy when he felt depressed

Her relationship with Tchaikovsky was also a good thing for her She hated anything to do with sex so it was good that she could express her emotions to someone whom she did not have to face in person Tchaikovsky dedicated his Fourth Symphony to her

On one occasion they met one another by accident Nadezhda had invited Tchaikovsky to stay at her home This was a huge house in enormous grounds so it was easy to arrange that they should not meet They agreed that they would not go out at the same time However one day he came home late and she went out early She was in a horse carriage and he was walking When they saw one another they looked away quickly

In October 1890 von Meck sent Tchaikovsky a years money in advance saying that it was the last time she would be able to send him money She said she was bankrupt She may have worried that she probably would be bankrupt in a years time

Some people think that she did this because she found out about Tchaikovskys homosexuality Others disagree with this After all in her last letter to him she asked him never to forget her

Nadezhda von Meck died from tuberculosis on 13 January 1894 in Nice France two months after Tchaikovsky had died

A sovereign state is a place with borders where people live and where a government makes laws and talks to other sovereign states The people have to follow the laws that the government makes and only the government is allowed to hurt people or put them in jail The government can do whatever it wants and doesnt have to do what other governments tell it to do Most sovereign states are recognized which means other sovereign states agree that its really a sovereign state Being recognized makes it easier for a sovereign state to talk to and make agreements with other sovereign states There are hundreds of recognized sovereign states today  see List of sovereign states

There is no rule to say what exactly makes a state Usually the things a state must have are mainly political not legal The Czechs and the Poles were seen as separate states during World War I even though they did not exist as states yet LC Green explained this by saying that recognition of statehood is a matter of discretion it is open to any existing state to accept as a state any entity it wishes regardless of the existence of territory or an established government 

This means that it is up to any state that already exists to treat any other group as a state This recognition can be direct or implied When a state does this it usually means that the group will also be treated as a state for things that happened in the past It does not need to mean that the state wants to have a broken wikt linkdiplomaticdiplomatic relationship with the other group

Sovereignty is a word that is often used wrongly Lassa Oppenheim said that there is no idea whose meaning is more broken wikt linkcontroversialcontroversial than sovereignty No one argues the fact that from the time the idea of sovereignty was first used in political science until now there has never been one meaning that everyone agreed on Justice Evatt of the High Court of Australia says that sovereignty is neither a question of fact nor a question of law but a question that does not arise at all 

Although the word sovereignty often includes all types of government ancient and modern the modern state has some links to the type of government first seen in the 15th century when the term state also first meant what it does today Because of this the word is often used to refer only to modern political systems

We often use the words country nation and state as if they mean the same thing but there is actually a difference

Because the meaning of the words has changed over time and past writers often used the word state in a different ways it is difficult to say exactly what a state is Mikhail Bakunin used the word simply to mean a governing organization Other writers used the word state to mean any law making or law enforcement agency Karl Marx said that the state was what was used by the ruling class of a country to control the rule According to Max Weber the state is an organization who are the only people allowed to use violence in a particular area

In 1815 at the Congress of Vienna the Final Act only recognized 39 sovereign states in Europe Because of this they said that in future new states would have to be recognized by other states In practice this meant recognition by one or more of the most powerful countries

This constitutive theory was developed in the 19th century to describe what is and is not a state With this theory the need to follow international law depends on whether other sovereign governments recognize the group Because of this new states could not become part of the international community or be bound by international law straight away so recognized nations did not have to respect international law in their dealings with them 

One of the major criticisms of this law is the confusion that happens when some states recognize a new group but other states do not Hersch Lauterpacht one of the main people who supported the theory suggested that it is a states job to grant recognition as a possible solution However a state may use any set of rules when judging if they should give recognition Many states may only recognize another state if it will help them

One of the criteria most commonly used by micronations is the Montevideo Convention The Montevideo Convention was signed on December 26 1933 by the United States Honduras El Salvador Dominican Republic Haiti Argentina Venezuela Uruguay Paraguay Mexico Panama Bolivia Guatemala Brazil Ecuador Nicaragua Colombia Chile Peru and Cuba but it never received international consensus The Montevideo Convention has four conditions that a group should meet to become a state

According to this the existence of a state does not depend upon recognition by other states Whether or not an group meets the conditions is decided by other states when they decide if they are going to treat that group as a state Usually new states are formally recognized by at least a few other states

Most sovereign states are states de jure and de facto This means they exist both in law and in real life However sometimes states are only de jure states This means that other states see a group as the true government of a place where they have no actual control Many European states had governments in exile during the Second World War which still had relations with the Allies even though their countries were under Nazi occupation An example today is the Sovereign Military Order of Malta which is a United Nations observer has broken wikt linkbi lateral diplomatic relationsbi lateral diplomatic relations with 104 states It has no land of its own only embassies and consulates Other states may have sovereignty over a place but are not recognized by other states these are de facto states only Many people agree that Somaliland is such a state

Bisexual pornography is a genre of pornography which generally shows one woman and two men all perform sex acts with each other Bisexual pornography is separate from threesome pornography which shows one man and two women

As most pornography is marketed to men most bisexual porn is advertised to straight or bisexual men Very few customers of bi porn say they are gay Producers who use the term bisexual porn are usually showing what a bisexual or bi curious man might wish to see Sex acts between a man and a woman as well as between two men A common way that these are shown in a single scene is with one woman and two men performing together 

Images and videos showing male bisexuality have been more popular since the start of internet pornography However the area is still a very small grouping of the pornographic DVD market For example at porn seller HotMoviescom there are only 655 bisexual movies out of a showing of more than 90000 films Bisexual DVDs sell much better online than in adult video stores This may be because customers in stores feel embarrassed to buy them Most bisexual porn is made by small companies rather than the major studios Actors are mostly new at porn Any well known actors in bisexual porn usually are from the gay pornography industry although they may not be gay or even bisexual in their personal life

Heterosexual actors and actresses who have appeared in bisexual porn for example Kurt Lockwood have had their sexual orientation doubted and have been accused by the gay community of being in denial about their homosexuality

Bisexual pornography may include any of the following

During World War II it was believed by many people that soap was being made from the bodies of Jewish concentration camp victims The Yad Vashem Memorial has said that the Nazis did not make soap from Jewish bodies on an large scale saying that rumors that soap from human bodies was being made and given out were used by the Nazis to frighten camp inmates Evidence does exist however which shows that research facilities had come up with a way for the large scale making of soap from human bodies  

The claim that Germans used the fat from human bodies to make products had already been made by the British during World War I with The Times reporting in April 1917 that the Germans were rendering down the bodies of their own dead soldiers for fat to make soap and other products It was not until 1925 that the British Foreign Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain officially said that the corpse factory story had been an error

Stories that the Nazis produced soap from the bodies of concentration camp victims were widely known during the war Germany had a shortage of fats during World War II and the production of soap was put under government control The human soap stories may have started with the bars of soap being marked with the initials RIF which was interpreted by some as Reichs Juden Fett in German acronyms i and j were often used for either letter RIF in fact stood for Reichsstelle fr Industrielle Fettversorgung RIF soap was a poor quality product that contained no fat at all human or any other kind

Raul Hilberg reports such stories as being told in Lublin as early as October 1942 The Germans themselves were aware of the stories as SS chief Heinrich Himmler had received a letter describing the Poles belief that Jewish people were being boiled into soap and which said that the Poles feared they would also be used to make soap The stories were so widely known that some parts of the Polish population actually refused to buy soap Himmler was so worried by the rumors and the thought of poor security at the camps that he said that all bodies should be burnt or buried as quickly as possible

Soviet propagandist Ilya Ehrenburg reported a common version of the story as fact in his The Complete Black Book of Russian Jewry

During the Nuremberg Trials Sigmund Mazur a laboratory worker at the Danzig Anatomical Institute broken wikt linktestimonytestified that soap had been made from the bodies of dead people at the camp and claimed that 70 to 80 kg of fat collected from 40 bodies could produce more than 25 kg of soap and that the finished soap was retained by Professor Rudolf Spanner Eyewitnesses included British POWs who were part of the forced labor that built the camp and Dr Stanisaw Byczkowski head of the Department of Toxicology at the Gdask School of Medicine Holocaust survivor Thomas Blatt who did research of the subject found little evidence of mass production of soap from human fat but said that there was evidence of experimental soap making Danzig was the German name of the now Polish city of Gdask

The recipe given by Mazur read 5 kilos of human fat are mixed with 10 liters of water and 500 or 1000 grams of caustic soda All this is boiled 2 or 3 hours and then cooled The soap floats to the surface while the water and other sediment remain at the bottom A bit of salt and soda is added to this mixture Then fresh water is added and the mixture again boiled 2 or 3 hours After having cooled the soap is poured into molds 

Testimony was given both by Nazis and by British prisoners of war about the development of an industrial process for producing soap from human bodies the production of such soap on a small scale basis and the actual use of this soap by Nazi workers at the Danzig Anatomic Institute  

Evidence does exists of small scale soap production possibly experimental in the camp at Stutthof concentration camp near DanzigGdansk 

Holocaust historian Robert Melvin Spector says that the Nazis did indeed use human fat for the making of soap at Stutthof but in limited quantity

In his book Russia at War 1941 to 1945 Alexander Werth said that while visiting GdanskDanzig in 1945 shortly after its liberation by the Red Army he saw an experimental factory outside the city for making soap from human bodies Werth said that it had been run by a German professor called Spanner and was a nightmarish sight with its vats full of human heads and torsoes pickled in some liquid and its broken wikt linkpailpails full of a flakey substance  human soap

The idea that human soap was made on an large scale by the Nazis was published after the war by Alain Resnais who treated the testimony of Holocaust survivors as fact in his 1955 holocaust documentary movie Nuit et brouillard Some postwar Israelis also spoke about Jewish victims of Nazism with the Hebrew word 

Mainstream scholars of the Holocaust think that the idea that the Nazis made soap on an large scale to be part of WWII folklore Among others this view was held by the reputable Jewish historians Walter Laqueur Gitta Sereny and Deborah Lipstadt The same view was held by Professor Yehuda Bauer of Israels Hebrew University and by Shmuel Krakowski archives director of Israels Yad Vashem Holocaust center  However historian Yisrael Gutman is very specific stating that it was never done on a mass scale And Holocaust historian Robert Melvin Spector says that the Nazis did indeed use human fat for the making of soap at Stutthof but in small amounts

Today Holocaust deniers use this story to make people doubt the Nazi genocide

WarGames is a 1985 movie starring Matthew Broderick and Ally Sheedy and directed by John Badham The movie follows a computer hacker named David Lightman who breaks into a NORAD war games simulation computer that he thinks is really the computer for a computer game company Lightman begins a series of events that could start World War III The movie was nominated for three Academy Awards and was a big hit It continues to be popular

The movie begins with two air force officers in a nuclear missile silo who are ordered to fire the missiles in the silo The officers believe the order to be real and begin to fire the missiles One of the officers decides not to fire and so the US government replaces all the men in the missile silos with computer control 

David Lightman is a smart high school student and computer hacker that at first limits himself to changing his and a girl whom he likes a lot Jennifers grades from failing to passing grades Lightman being smart but not motivated at school A little while later David uses his IMSAI 8080 computer to dial many phone numbers and finds a backdoor into a NORAD war games simulation computer called WOPR At first David is looking for new computer games to download and play and believes that the WOPR is actually the computer of a company that makes new computer games After finding a list of games on the computer decides to play a game WOPR asks David for a password and after doing some research on the computers creator Professor Steven Falken he guesses that the password is named after the creators dead son Joshua After logging in using the correct password WOPR believes David to actually be Dr Falken whom the computer had believed to be dead The computer asks him if he would like to play a game David selects the game Global Thermonuclear War Doing so starts off a series of events that will end up taking the World into World War III unless it is stopped 

The television news later reports that the USA went on high alert due to a computer error leading David and Jennifer to wonder if they had caused the problem David throws away the evidence of his calling Joshua but the computer calls David back David then asks Joshua if the game it is playing is real or not Joshua relies what is the difference At this point David learns that Joshua is not a computer game companies computer but a government one and is actually is playing the game for real He hangs up but Joshua calls him back leading David to remove the cord from the back of his telephone David is then arrested by the FBI and taken to NORAD to answer charges of espionage David tries to explain that he was not trying to be a spy but he is not believed Using things found in the medical office in which he is locked David escapes from NORAD on a bus load of visitors to the facility After David escapes he telephones Jennifer to ask her to buy him an airplane ticket so he can go and see Falken and get his help in stopping Joshua Joshua meets him and together then both go off to convince Falken to help them stop World War III

Professor Falken has in fact resigned from NORAD because he believes war will happen no matter what any one does Jennifer and David try to convince him to help them explain to NORAD that this is just a game that Joshua is playing Falken tells them that it is not worth it as it may only buy them a few years but war will still happen He explains that they are lucky because he lives only a few miles from a primary target and that they will die in a instant David and Jennifer decide to try to stop the game anyway and try to leave the island Finding no way off the island since the last ferry has left Jennifer says that they should swim for it David admits he cannot swim Professor Falken shows up with a helicopter and together they all go to NORAD 

Inside NORAD Falken tells them it is all a game and they decide to allow the missiles that the Soviet Union has reportedly fired to land to see if it is real or a game The computer screens show the missiles landing but no missiles actually land This convinces NORAD that the whole thing was not real Joshua however decides to crack the launch codes and fire the USAs missiles for real David and Falken try to get Joshua to stop the firing and eventually succeed when Jennifer mentions the word games After many tries they get Joshua to play tic tac toe against itself in an effort to teach it the meaning of broken wikt linkfutilityfutility Joshua tries every game of tic tac toe possible and then tries the same thing with every scenario within the Global Thermonuclear War game Joshua then learns that war can not be won and stops the game ending the threat of World War III

The movie was a hit It was nominated for three Academy Awards The movie had a production budget of 12 million and had gross revenues of over 120 million making it a high earning movie

The IMSAI 8080 was an early microcomputer begun in late 1975 based on the Intel 8080 and later 8085 and the S 100 bus It was compatible with its main competitor the earlier MITS Altair 8800 by which it was inspired The IMSAI is largely thought of as the first clone computer The IMSAI machine used a highly modified version of the CPM operating system called IMDOS It was designed made and sold by IMS Associates Inc In total between 17000 and 20000 units were produced from 1975 until 1978

In May 1972 William Millard began business as IMS Associates in the area of computer consultancy and engineering using his home as an office By 1973 Millard began IMS Associates Inc Millard soon found capital for his business and received several contracts all for software 

In 1974 IMS was contacted by a client which wanted a workstation system that could do jobs for any General Motors new car dealership IMS planned a system including a terminal small computer printer and special software Five of these work stations were to have common access to a hard disk which would be controlled by a small computer Eventually product development was stopped Millard and his chief engineer Joe Killian turned to the microprocessor Intel had broken wikt linkannoucementannounced the 8080 chip and compared to the 4004 to which IMS Associates had first used the 8080 looked like a better idea Full scale development of the IMSAI 8080 was begun and by October 1975 an advertisement was placed in the magazine Popular Electronics receiving positive reactions 

IMS shipped the first IMSAI 8080 kits on December 16 1975 In 1976 IMS was renamed to IMSAI Manufacturing Corporation because by then they were a manufacturing company not a consultancy one By October 1979 the IMSAI corporation had gone bankrupt and the IMSAI trademark was acquired by Thomas Todd Fischer and Nancy Freitas who continued manufacturing the computers under the IMSAI name as a division of Fischer Freitas Co Support for early IMSAI systems continues to this day

An asylum seeker is a person who fled from its country but is not accepted yet as refugee

The decision whether a person is a refugee or not is most often left to certain government agencies within the host country This can lead to a situation where the country will see a asylum seeker neither as refugee nor as legitimate migrant Then he will be treated as illegal alien even if his life was endangered in the Country he fled from 

As long as a country does not see a person as refugee this person will not have the rights and the country will not have the obligations that the legislation of the receiving country and the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees gives to refugee 

The United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees is an international agreement that defines who is a refugee and makes clear what are the rights of individuals who are granted asylum and the responsibilities of nations that grant asylum It also makes clear which people are not seen as refugees such as war criminals 

The convention was approved at a special United Nations conference on 28 July 1951 It was initially limited to protecting European refugees after World War II but a 1967 protocol removed the geographical and time limits Because the convention was approved in Geneva it is often referred to as the Geneva Convention though it is not one of the Geneva Conventions specifically dealing with allowable behavior in time of war

The Human Development Index is a number used to compare different countries published by United Nations Development Programme It is used to rank countries into different groups like developed developing and underdeveloped countries 

The Human Development Index uses different measurements of a population namely

The Human Development Index has been criticized for a number of reasons

Two authors claimed that the human development reports have lost touch with their original vision and the index fails to capture the essence of the world it seeks to portray The index has also been criticized as redundant and a reinvention of the wheel measuring aspects of development that have already been exhaustively studied The index has further been criticized for having an inappropriate treatment of income lacking year to year comparability and assessing development differently in different groups of countries

Some authors have proposed alternative indices to address some of the indexs shortcomings

Economist Bryan Caplan has criticized the way scores in each of the three components are bounded between zero and one so rich countries effectively cannot improve their ranking in certain categories even though there is a lot of scope for economic growth and longevity left This effectively means that a country of immortals with infinite per capita GDP would get a score of 666 if its population were illiterate and never went to school Scandinavian countries consistently come out top on the list he argues because the HDI is basically a measure of how Scandinavian your country is

The HDI has been criticized as a redundant measure that adds little to the value of the individual measures composing it as a means to provide legitimacy to arbitrary weightings of a few aspects of social development as a number producing a relative ranking which is useless for inter temporal comparisons and difficult to compare a countrys progress or regression because the HDI for a country in a given year depends on the levels of say life expectancy or GDP per capita of other countries in that year However each year UN member states are listed and ranked according to the computed HDI If high the rank in the list can be easily used as a means of national aggrandizement alternatively if low it can be used to highlight national insufficiencies Using the HDI as an absolute index of social welfare some authors have used panel HDI data to measure the impact of economic policies on quality of life

The Dominican city of Azua de Compostela or simply Azua is the head municipality of the Azua province on the south of the country about 5 km north of the Caribbean coast It is also called sometimes Compostela de Azua

Azua is the Tano name of the region where the old city was founded In this place Pedro Gallego a Spanish colonist developed a farm and he gave it the name of Compostela after Santiago de Compostela in Galicia nortwestern Spain

The municipality had in 2002 a total population of 87024 44178 men and 42846 women The urban population was 6487 of the total population In this numbers are included the population of the municipal districts that are part the municipality The population of Azua de Compostela without those municipal districts was 56453

The town was founded in 1504 by Diego Velzquez who later went to conquest the island of Cuba the Spanish governor of the Hispaniola island at that time was Nicols de Ovando The town was in the original region of Azua where there was a Tano town and Pedro Gallego had a farm This place is called now Pueblo Viejo at about 8 km to the soutwest of the modern city

The first secretary of the town was Hernn Corts He lived in Azua from 1504 to 1511 when he left to Cuba and later to conquest Mxico

In 1751 there was a strong earthquake that destroyed the old town and a new one was founded on the right side of the River Va where the modern city is now

Because Azua is on the road that goes from the western part of the island to Santo Domingo the city was destroyed several times during the Dominican Haitian War Two important battles were fought in the city the first was on 19 March 1844 and the second on 1849

Tropical Storm Ana was the first tropical storm of the 2009 Atlantic hurricane season It was also the first tropical cyclone to affect the Caribbean during 2009 The storm formed on August 11 but strong wind shear weakened it on August 13 Ana later reformed and became a tropical storm on August 15 before wind shear tore apart the storm again The storm finally died on August 17

Between August 15 and 17 the National Hurricane Center gave out tropical storm watches to some Caribbean islands like the Lesser Antilles Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic Some people took a few precautions Most of the damage from Ana was in the form of rain

A tropical wave formed over the Cape Verde islands on August 9 The NHC started watching the storm to see if it would turn into a tropical cyclone It became a tropical depression on August 11 By then the storm had a lot of thunderstorm activity near its center On August 12 the NHC said that the storm was close to tropical storm stength While the storm was still alive it was not called a tropical storm However it was later found that the storm had actually reached tropical storm strength winds The next day the storm began to weaken and fall apart because of wind shear and dry air The remains of the storm moved west across the Atlantic Ocean

On August 14 the NHC saw that the storm was reforming Later that day a Hurricane Hunter airplane flew into the storm and the NHC started to follow the storm again On August 15 the storm was given the name Ana after it reached tropical storm strength Soon wind shear started to affect Ana again The next day the storm moved into an area of dry air over the Caribbean Sea Ana weakened into a depression after another Hurricane Hunter airplane found no tropical storm winds The storms circulation fell apart and Ana finally died on August 17

On August 15 a tropical storm watch was given to the islands of St Maarten Saba St Eustatius Antigua Barbuda the British Virgin Islands Montserrat St Kitts and Nevis Anguilla and the United States Virgin Islands Later on August 17 Puerto Rico Dominica Guadeloupe St Martin and St Barthelemy were also put on tropical storm watch When Ana weakened into a remnant low later that day all watches were stopped

In St Thomas wind speeds from Ana were recorded at 28 mph and gusts peaked at 40 mph Also a lot of rainfall created flooding in Puerto Rico But there was only little damage done At most 4 in of rain fell on the island Some streets had to be shut down because of the flooding About 6000 people lost electricity from the storm Tree branches broke down power lines People also reported tornadoes and waterspouts created by Ana in Puerto Rico The remains of Ana brought rainfall to parts of Hispaniola But no damage was reported

A suppressor often called a silencer is a device used to make a gun less loud Suppressors are most often added to the gun barrel many times by screwing the silencer onto the end of the barrel However some guns have a built in suppressor

Even though many people use the name silencer when talking about a suppressor it does not really make the gun silent Most guns are still very loud even with a suppressor added It is important to wear ear protection even with a suppressor

In many places suppressors are illegal to own except for the military and police This is because suppressors make guns quieter and people worry this could help criminals commit crime

I bring to your attention the closures of Majorlys and Barras RfOs by NonvocalScream

These elections have in my opinion been closed inappropriately for three reasons Firstly the closure of RfXs should not be undertaken by anyone but an elected Bureaucrat  this is after all what we appointed them to do  regardless of whether it is vote counting or not Secondly NVS has a clear COI with the elections being involved with them and so should not have closed them Finally the votes should be left to run for the specified time period and not closed early  there is no SNOW pass

I request that until this is resolved neither Majorly nor Barras use their Oversight tools and instead continue to request actions from the Stewards

Regards

Goblin 1100 15 August 2009 I Nifky

Two incorrect points there were still about two weeks to run  no RFO dont have an ending date they only end once consensus or otherwise is reached the closure of RfXs should not be undertaken by anyone but an elected Bureaucrat  no bureaucrats close RFAs and RFBs Checkuser and oversight are a totally different set of tools Additionally if I see something that needs oversighting I will be oversighting it myself Enough of this dramamongering nonsense Majorly talk 1244 15 August 2009

To Chenzw I know the last consensus was to have no more than 3 oversighters But is there a meta policy that prevents a wiki from having more than 3 oversighters Snake311 1459 15 August 2009

I dont knowrecall if the consensus was to elect exactly three or at least two If we agree on exactly three it is probably a bad idea to give the spot to the next person who reaches 25 support Rather we should look who the best candidate for the spot is At the moment we have two which is workable Can we postpone the closing until either times up or there is visibly no more movemement in the process  This also gives us time to agree on what we want  Eptalon 1513 15 August 2009

I propose to add a new user rights that would enable non admins to delete articles labeled tlQD which is an administrative function granted to trusted users Trusted users with the deletion rights would be allowed to delete vandalism or test articles from anon IPs Essentially the user right would be similiar to rollbackers The tool would be used solely to fight vandalism Admins should be allowed to grant and revoke the deleting rights Abuse of the tool can be quickly solved by having an admin remove the abuser from his rights and a possible block Snake311 1807 15 August 2009

article a now has the history of both b and c AND it is over 5000 revisions this means that the article cannot be delete to clean up the history That case would require developer intervention to fix  Chris 0143 16 August 2009

I think that weve now reached the point where anonymous editing is not providing us with any benefits In the past few hours for instance we have had to deal with a massive flurry of personal attacks and heavy amount of vandalism I think that useful anon edits probably stand at less than 2 of all anon edits Id like to encourage the community to consider turning off the ability of anons to edit at all Thanks fr33kman talk 0526 16 August 2009

Today is an example of why we should ban anonymous editing though I dont know if we have the authority to do so Mythdon 0614 16 August 2009

Banning IP editing is like saying anyone who is not an admin in this wiki is not welcome Its true that the majority of vandalism comes from IPs but almost everyone here who has an account and is a regular editor is also an admin or former admin If we made a requirement to have a user account just to edit here we would be more of a failure in the eyes of WMF meta and ENWP Snake311 0804 16 August 2009Its the whole thing about Wikipedia Anyone can edit it Maybe some people dont want to create an account It does happen Look at RC on ENWP Youll see that there are some constructive edits from IPs there You could create an account and make a load of PAs same thing Yotcmdr talk to the commander 0930 16 August 2009

No If this is that much of a problem disable anon page creation or enable the abusefilter This is not the solution  Chris 0936 16 August 2009

Sorry I disagree Not all anonymous editors are bad and not all registered users are good I dont think it will do anything to protect vandalism just like with IPs all you have to do is sign up for an account and after its blocked you use another proxy and start all over again As said Wikipedia is for anyone to edit  S3CR3T s you 1739 16 August 2009

No way I disagree as I am an anon myseldf I cant create an account because I would just get blocked in just about two days 78144101149 1831 16 August 2009

2 is an incredibly low number I think that about 50 of IP edits are productive Yes there are problems created but there are a lot of articles created by IPs a lot of vandalism reverted by IPs and a lot of expansion by IPs Yes it is as easy as creating an account but some IPs do not want to I had over 100 edits with my IP before I decided I like WP enough and decided to create an account Because our WP focuses on children or ESL people it should be kept open Griffinofwales 2132 16 August 2009

I think people misunderstand anyone can edit Disabling anon editing will not prevent anyone from editing They would just have to take the extremely minor effort to create an account to do so Instead of a load of meaningless numbers these contributors will have a recognisable name and this silly anyone can edit business still works all the same Majorly talk 0035 17 August 2009

Also if this has been sparked by the amount of IP vandalism which has need oversighting this is definitely not the solution They will simply start creating accounts and then editing  this will in fact hinder our efforts to stop them because then only checkusers will be able to see their IP addresses Also I think vandals will regard this as a victory against Wikipedia and it may encourage them to continue The only kind of vandals this will stop are driveby vandals  there is no evidence to support the theory that this will stop more persistent and long term vandals  Chris 0826 17 August 2009

Hello all

I think we need to seriously need to discuss who closes what kind of requests after what time this is in the context of assigning privilegesflags My take on this may be too simple but Ill state it here anyway

Please express your opinion so we can find a way to get a guideline on this matter Note that I simply started the discussion by the end consensus on something is hopefully evident  Eptalon 1858 17 August 2009

I believe that only bureaucrats should be closing RfAs and RfBs RfOS and RfCUs should be left to stewards to make the ultimate decision and then closed by a bureaucrat here RfDs GAVs and VGAVs could be closed by administrators This is my opinion that non administrators really dont have any real right to close any requests unless it is a clearcut WPSNOW case Cheers Razorflame 1902 17 August 2009

Frankly I dont see why we have to come up with our own rules on this EN wiki seems to have hammered this out pretty well imo So lets just copy their rules for it here and avoid the drama  Philosopher Let us reason together 0446 18 August 2009

You know we keep trying and failing miserably Recently there was the thread about what should we do with stubs We seem to have forgotten about that Well you all know were going through hard times the drama level is high but we all know that wikipedia is an encyclopedia built to make it better so people can benefit from it and we arent here to argue This is why I want this to reach a conclusion

We have to concentrate on getting articles to GAVGA status or just writting articles that are good without having the little star or plus sign These will be the things thatl most likely attract new editors We have the List of articles all languages should have so why not build those articles first 

There are different stages to building a GA Writting the article simplifying reviewing the article and fixing the points the reviewer found What we need is to determine what each person is good at doingwants to do So Im asking you what do you think youre good at doing or what do you want to do Once we get things going it should work easily We take every article in the List one by one and we all do what weve selected The people that write the article start then come the simplifying team then the reviewers come and review it and the fixing teams is last Once weve done one things should work like a chain Its no more complicated than that

Please only choose the one thing youd like to do

Thanks you for your time Remember we are here to build a wiki and if you dont want to go and write articles that help others well you obvisouly dont really care that much for it Yotcmdr talk to the commander 2214 17 August 2009

How about more focus being put on the Simple Wiktionary trying to find easy ways to simplify phrasing complex terms then applying that to English WP Articles that are forked here instead of people just starting articles by scratch Also maybe it should be said that taking longer and more convoluted summaries to get across a concept then with the English Wiki is fine as long as it does so with Simple English Occono 1822 20 August 2009

Hi there folks

I see one Its above and to the right of your comments Griffinofwales 2107 22 August 2009 In science related topics i have always found it useful to focus on applications rather than throw loads of formulae at the reader That way i am quite sure a child is able to understand articles like Poisson distribution or exponential distribution if they grasp the concepts behind it It would also be possible to use formulas which would probably frighten away the children That way I left the formulas for later they can of course be included in a more complete article The real difficulty of Simple English is to put the concepts into simple words and explain them with those words  Eptalon 1613 23 August 2009

Im pro abusefilter  however if we enable it we have to get it right or else well mess everything up  Chris 0345 22 August 2009

Currently we have a bot that detects and reverts vandalism I think the question to ask is not whether we want the abuse filter or not but which of the two anti vandalism options is better Also I know that GoblinBot4 doesnt typically revert more than once on the same article but I dont know how to abuse filter functions I think the question should ideally be given the choice between the Abuse Filter or GoblinBot4 which is better EhJJTALK 1036 24 August 2009

No state has recognized the sovereignty of the Republic of India over across the Line of Controls with Pakistan and China which the following UN states The Security Council would not be able to invite parties to negotiate about Jammu and Kashmir autonomy under Indian sovereignty for such wording would imply recognition of Indian sovereignty over Jammu and Kashmir which was out of the question as long as no States Member of the United Nations had recognized that sovereignty The UK was considered as the administrative power until 1950 but it was transfered to the Republic of India however is the de facto administrating power since it controls most of the territory

Some UN member states most notably the Muslim nations have said that they support Pakistans territorial integrity in reference to Kashmir as Pakistani regions but only India has made a public declaration of sovereignty over the disputed region

Here are a few examples supporting Pakistans integrity

First documented by Nintendo in the May 1999 issue of Nintendo Power encountering MissingNo results in messed up graphics and item duplication of the players sixth item in their item It has an unique effect upon the Pokmon community unlike anything else

There are two reasons why the player encounters MissingNo both as a result of programming bugs The first is caused by the way the game stores battle information and the second is caused by the Old Man script in Viridian City When traveling from one area to another the game assigns numbers for Pokmon that the player encounters to a data buffer read by the game when they encounter a wild Pokmon However on the right side of the Cinnabar and Seafoam Islands no data was actually assigned to this buffer and the information from the previous area is used instead

Once encountered players can fight flee or capture MissingNo just like any other wild Pokmon in the game After encountering the MissingNo the sixth item in the players item menu will be copied to 128 and the games Hall of Fame gallery will become scrambled forever Other display problems may happen though these can be fixed by viewing a Pokdex entry or resetting the Game Boy It commonly appears as a scrambled d shaped rectangle though sometimes it will look like a Ghost or two fossils

Even though it has only appeared in only two games in Pokmon MissingNo has had a lot of impact Nintendo says it a programming quirk and doesnt want players to encounter it and later removing the glitch in the next game Pokmon Yellow However information on how to encounter MissingNo was printed in a lot of magazines and players guides due to its effect while some Pokemon players tried to sell real and fake tips for capturing MissingNo for up to 200 In 2009 IGN put MissingNo in their Top 10 Easter Eggs in games list describing it as a glitchimon and saying it was useful for making copies of items In another article they said It really says something about Pokemon fans that they took what is a potentially game ruining glitch and used it as a shortcut to level up their Pokemon

Reactions by players to MissingNo has been studied by sociological studies regarding individuals and games Sociologist William Sims Bainbridge said in a study that Game Freak spawned one of the most popular glitches ever in game history due to the good and bad results of it and players interesting use of it The book Playing with Videogames studied the effect of MissingNo deeply studying players curious actions as a result of its appearance and examining their own notes along with individual sightings reports studying and criticizing other peoples findings The book further describes the extent to which gaming communities revolving around Pokmon have attempted to make it a real aspect of the games world through elements such as fan fiction and fan art adding that this in turn inspires creativity It also says that people were celebrating and publicizing glitches in the game while trying to make it canon and adds that MissingNo popularity was an unusual case

The Scottish National Party Prtaidh Niseanta na h Alba Scottish is a centre left political party in Scotland It campaigns mostly for Scotland to leave the United Kingdom and become an independent country It is a social democratic party and is currently the largest party in the Scottish Parliament with 69 out of 129 seats and its party leader Alex Salmond is First Minister of Scotland

Most SNP supporters believe in the following things

The Scottish National Party was founded in 1934 During World War II its leader Douglas Young told Scottish people not to join the war effort and as a result he was widely disliked The first SNP Member of Parliament was Robert McIntyre who entered parliament in a by election for Motherwell in 1945 but he lost the seat at the general election of that year The party struggled in the 1950s but achieved greater success in the 1960s and in 1967 Winnie Ewing was elected as an MP for the party at a by election in Hamilton Only 1 seat was won by the SNP at the 1970 general election but at the February 1974 general election it won 7 seats Following the discovery of oil in the North Sea the SNP ran a campaign called Its Scotlands oil meaning that they thought it should benefit only the Scots and the party won 11 seats and 30 of the vote in Scotland at the October 1974 general election

When the Labour government of James Callaghan started losing its majority in parliament it made deals with the smaller parties including the Liberal Party the SNP and the Welsh nationalists The SNP only agreed to support this if a referendum was given to the Scottish people on the creation of a devolved assembely The referendum gained support from 51 of Scots but the Labour government decided that not enough people had voted in the referendum and because of this the SNP refused to support the Labour government The general election of 1979 saw the SNP reduced to only 2 seats in parliament

The party did poorly at the general elections of 1983 1987 and 1992 Alex Salmond became party leader in 1990 and in 1997 the party won 6 seats in parliament The Labour government of Tony Blair established a Scottish Parliament in 1999 and at the elections held for the new parliament the SNP came in second place behind Labour with 35 out of 128 seats It wasnt until the 2007 Scottish Parliament election that the SNP made another major breakthrough and at this election the party won the most seats with 47 out of 128 seats and a minority government was then formed with Alex Salmond made First Minister

The party tried to give Scotland a referendum on independence in 2010 but the other major parties in the Scottish Parliament stopped them

Myware is the term given to applications that use spyware technologies but are designed to enable users to spy on themselves rather than others The term was first coined by Seth Goldstein in 2005 to apply to his short lived Attention Trust system 

The term myware has mainly been applied to software applications in three areas social networking marketing and time tracking

The first application to be described as myware was the Attention Trust system which was launched in 2005 and allowed users to record their web clickstream and upload that information to Attention Trust Since then the term has been championed by the music social networking site Lastfm They positioned themselves as Musical Myware to describe their process by which a users music listening habits were automatically recorded and uploaded Lastfm use the data they gather for personalised music recommendations Other uses of the term include time tracking application companies that describe themselves as myware to explain the automatic recording of PC activities for billing 

Data collected by myware products typically includes keystrokes internet browsing patterns web sites visited and the use of certain applications such as music players for Lastfm In each case the user must choose to install the myware application and derive some benefit from the data recorded This distinguishes myware from the more traditional spyware However there remains controversy over whether individual myware applications are really to the benefit of the user particularly in cases where the user does not have editing access to the data recorded about themselves

The exogenetic processes are the processes that shape the land by forces coming on or above the Earths surface 

Many of these forces are as a result of other bodies in space For example the Moon causes tides in the Earths oceans and other big bodies of water Impacts from comets and meteoroids change the surface of the Earth When they strike the Earth they create craters which are holes which can be very big or small in the ground Radiation from the Sun can cause aurorae which are lights that can be seen at night near the poles

An example of an exogenetic process that is not as a result of bodies in space is erosion Erosion happens as a result of wind water ice or people animals or plants digging in the earth

Exogenetic processes are differ from endogenetic ones in that endogenetic forces come from within the Earth

An oblate spheroid is like a sphere but the distance from pole to pole is less than than the distance around the equator This gives it a slightly flattened shape An example would be a Skittles or a MM sweet

Many planets including the Earth and Saturn are oblate spheroids

Mathematicians define an oblate spheroid as a rotationally symmetric ellipsoid having a polar axis shorter than the diameter of the equatorial circle whose plane bisects it In contrast prolate spheroids have a polar axis longer than the distance around the equator Both oblate and prolate spheroids are examples of ellipsoids

Venice and Dalmatia were an Italian city state and an eastern adriatic region very much related from the Middle Ages until the 19th century

Venice influenced Dalmatia commercially since the times of Charlemagne But only at the end of the first millennium the Republic of Venice started to conquest Dalmatia

Indeed after the fall of the Western Roman Empire Illyrian towns on the dalmatian coast continued to speak Latin and their language evolved relatively independent from other Romance languages progressing toward a regional variant and finally to a distinct language called Dalmatian language

The earliest reference on the language dates from the 10th century and it is estimated that about 50000 people spoke it at that time

The Dalmatian language is an extinct Romance language that was spoken along the eastern Adriatic in the Dalmatian coast from Fiume as far south as Kotor in Montenegro

The Dalmatian speakers lived mainly in the coastal towns of Zadar Trogir Split Dubrovnik and Kotor each of these cities having a local dialect and also on the islands of Krk Cres and Rab

Almost every city developed its own dialect but the most important dialects we have information on are the Vegliot a northern dialect spoken on the island of Krk and the Ragusan a southern dialect spoken at Dubrovnik

The dialect of Zara disappeared because of the strong Venetian influence while the two other dialects due even to the assimilation by Slavic language speakers

We know about the dalmatian dialect of Ragusa from two letters from 1325 and 1397 and other medieval texts which show a language influenced heavily by Venetian The available sources include hardly 260 Ragusan words Surviving words include pen teta chesa and fachir which were quoted by an Italian Fillipo Diversi the head of school of Ragusa in the 1430s

The Republic of Ragusa had at one time an important fleet but its influence decreased We know that the language was in trouble in the face of Croatian expansion as the Ragusan Senate decided that all debates had to be held in lingua veteri ragusea and the use of the lingua sclava was forbidden Nevertheless in the 16th century Ragusan fell out of use and became extinct

Other languages influenced the Ddalmatian language but without erasing its Latin roots the Slavs then the Republic of Venice Several cities of the regions have Italian names and other mostly the romanized Illyrian ones

The oldest preserved documents written in Dalmatian are some 13th century inventories in the Ragusan dialect A letter of the 14th century from Zara shows strong Venetian influence which was also the cause of its extinction soon after

The Christian schism was an important factor in the history of Dalmatia While the Croatian held branch of the Catholic Church in Nin was under Popes jurisdiction they still used the Slavic liturgy Both the Latin population of the cities and the Holy See preferred the Latin liturgy which created tensions between different dioceses 

The great schism between Eastern and Western Christianity of 1054 further intensified the rift between the coastal cities and the hinterland with many of the Slavs in the hinterland preferring the Eastern Orthodoxy Areas of todays Bosnia and Herzegovina also had an indigenous Bosnian Church which was often mistaken for Bogomils

The Latin influence in Dalmatia was increased and the Byzantine practices were further suppressed on the general synods of 1059 1060 1066 1075 1076 and on other local synods notably by demoting the bishopric of Nin installing the archbishoprics of Spalatum and Dioclea and explicitly forbidding use of any liturgy other than Greek or Latin

Dalmatia never attained a political or racial unity and never formed as a nation but it achieved a remarkable development of art science and literature Politically the neolatin Dalmatian city states were often isolated and compelled to either fall back on the Venetian Republic for support or tried to make it on their own

The geographical position of the Dalmatian city states suffices to explain the relatively small influence exercised by Byzantine culture throughout the six centuries during which Dalmatia was part of the Eastern empire Towards the close of this period Byzantine rule tended more and more to become merely nominal while the influence of the Republic of Venice increased

The medieval Dalmatia had still included much of the hinterland covered by the old Roman province of Dalmatia However the toponym of Dalmatia started to shift more towards including only the coastal Adriatic areas rather than the mountains inland By the 15th century the word Herzegovina would be introduced marking the shrink of the borders of Dalmatia to the narrow littoral area where was spoken the Dalmatian language

In the thirteenth century the Republic of Venice took definitive control of the Montenegro coast and created the Albania Veneta

As the city states gradually lost all protection by Byzantium being unable to unite in a defensive league hindered by their internal dissensions they had to turn to either Venice or Hungary for support Each of the two political factions had support within the Dalmatian city states based mostly on economic reasons

The Venetians to whom the Dalmatians were already bound by language and culture could afford to concede liberal terms as its main goal was to prevent the development of any dangerous political or commercial competitor on the eastern Adriatic The seafaring community in Dalmatia looked to Venice as mistress of the Adriatic In return for protection the cities often furnished a contingent to the army or navy of their suzerain and sometimes paid tribute either in money or in kind Arbe for example annually paid ten pounds of silk or five pounds of gold to Venice

Hungary on the other hand defeated the last Croat king in 1097 and laid claim on all lands of the Croatian noblemen since the treaty of 1102 King Coloman of Hungary proceeded to conquer Dalmatia in 1102 1105 The farmers and the merchants who traded in the interior favoured Hungary as their most powerful neighbour on land that affirmed their municipal privileges Subject to the royal assent they might elect their own chief magistrate bishop and judges Their Roman law remained valid They were even permitted to conclude separate alliances No alien not even a Hungarian could reside in a city where he was unwelcome and the man who disliked Hungarian dominion could emigrate with all his household and property In lieu of tribute the revenue from customs was in some cases shared equally by the king chief magistrate bishop and municipality

These rights and the analogous privileges granted by Venice were however too frequently infringed Hungarian garrisons were being quartered on unwilling towns while Venice interfered with trade the appointment of bishops or the tenure of communal domains Consequently the Dalmatians remained loyal only while it suited their interests and insurrections frequently occurred Even in Zara four outbreaks are recorded between 1180 and 1345 although Zadar was treated with special consideration by its Venetian masters who regarded its possession as essential to their maritime ascendancy

The once rival Romanic and Slavic population eventually started contributing to a common civilization and Ragusa was the primary example of this By the 13th century the councilmen from ragusan names were mixed and in the 15th century the ragusan literature was even written in the Slavic language and the city was often called by its Slavic name Dubrovnik Only in 1918 Ragusa was called officially Dubrovnik with the creation of Yugoslavia

The doubtful allegiance of the Dalmatians tended to protract the struggle between Venice and Hungary which was further complicated by internal discord due largely to the spread of the Bogomil heresy and by many outside influences

The cities of Zara Spalato Trau and Ragusa and the surrounding territories each changed hands several times between Venice Hungary and the Byzantium during the 12th century

In 1202 the armies of the Fourth Crusade rendered assistance to Venice by occupying Zadar for it In 1204 the same army conquered Byzantium and finally eliminated the Eastern Empire from the list of contenders on Dalmatian territory

The early 13th century was marked by a decline in external hostilities The Dalmatian cities started accepting foreign sovereignty but eventually they reverted to their previous desire for independence The Mongol invasion severely impaired Hungary so much that in 1241 the king Bela IV had to take refuge in Dalmatia The Mongols attacked the Dalmatian cities for the next few years but eventually withdrew

The Croats were no longer regarded by the city folk as a hostile people in fact the power of certain Croatian magnates notably the counts ubi of Bribir was from time to time supreme in the northern districts

In 1346 Dalmatia was struck by the Black Death The economic situation was also poor and the cities became more and more dependent on Venice

Stephen Tvrtko the founder of the Bosnian kingdom was able in 1389 to annex the Adriatic littoral between Cattaro and Sebenico and even claimed control over the northern coast up to Fiume except for the Venetian ruled Zara and his own independent ally Ragusa This was only temporary as the Hungarians and the Venetians continued their struggle over Dalmatia as soon as Tvrtko died in 1391

An internal struggle of Hungary between King Sigismund and the Neapolitan house of Anjou also reflected on Dalmatia in the early 15th century all Dalmatian cities welcomed the Neapolitan fleet except for Dubrovnik The Bosnian duke Hrvoje controlled Dalmatia for the Angevins but later switched loyalty to Sigismund

Over the period of twenty years this struggle weakened the Hungarian influence In 1409 Ladislaus of Naples sold his rights over Dalmatia to Venice for 100000 Ducats Venice gradually took over most of Dalmatia by 1420 In 1437 Sigismund recognized Venetian rule over Dalmatia in return for 100000 Ducats The city of Omi yielded to Venice in 1444 and only Ragusa preserved temporarily its freedom 

The rule of Venice on most of Dalmatia will last nearly four centuries

During the Venetian rule in Dalmatia from 1420 to 1797 the number of Orthodox Serbs in Dalmatia was increased by numerous migrations

An interval of peace ensued but meanwhile the Ottoman advance continued 

Hungary was itself assailed by the Turks and could no longer afford to try to control Dalmatia Christian kingdoms and regions in the east fell one by one Constantinople in 1453 Serbia in 1459 neighbouring Bosnia in 1463 and Herzegovina in 1483 Thus the Venetian and Ottoman frontiers met and border wars were incessant

Dubrovnik sought safety in friendship with the invaders and in one particular instance actually sold two small strips of its territory to the Ottomans in order to prevent land access from the Venetian territory

In 1508 the hostile League of Cambrai compelled Venice to withdraw its garrison for home service and after the overthrow of Hungary in 1526 the Turks were able easily to conquer the greater part of Dalmatia by 1537 The peace of 1540 left only the maritime cities to Venice the interior forming a Turkish province governed from the fortress of Klis by a Sanjakbeg

Christian Croats from the neighbouring lands now thronged to the towns outnumbering the Romanic population even more and making their language the primary one The pirate community of the Uskoks had originally been a band of these fugitives especially near Segna its exploits contributed to a renewal of war between Venice and Turkey An extremely curious picture of contemporary manners is presented by the Venetian agents whose reports on this war resemble some knightly chronicle of the Middle Ages full of single combats tournaments and other chivalrous adventures They also show clearly that the Dalmatian levies far surpassed the Italian mercenaries in skill and courage Many of these troops served abroad at the Battle of Lepanto for example in 1571 a Dalmatian squadron assisted the allied fleets of Spain Venice Austria and the Papal States to crush the Turkish navy

The continental bits of Dalmatia were under Ottoman rule parts of the Viyalet of Bosnia or the Klis Sanjak The desolated areas of the Knin Frontier and Bukovica were inhabited by Orthodox Serbs from Bosnia while the Albania veneta received constant Serb migrations from Herzegovina and Montenegro The Serbs formed one quarter of Dalmatias population in the 16th century They had absolute majority in the Knin Frontier Bukovica and the Cattaro area The Ottomans have resettled this populace to create a living defence towards the territories of the Venetian Republic A great portion of this population fled to Venetian land and gladly fought against the Ottomans The number of Serbs in Venetian Dalmatia rapidly increased during the War of Crete in 1645  1669 and the Great Viennese War in 1683  1699 after which the Peace of Karlowitz gave the whole of Dalmatia and coastal Montenegro to the Venetian Republic After the Venetian Turkish war of 1714 1718 Venetian territorial gains were confirmed by the 1718 Treaty of Passarowitz The number of Dalmatian Serbs remained between 20 and 25 by the end of Venetian rule while the venetian speaking population in the Dalmatian cities and islands increased with colonists from north east Italy 

The Serbian peasant population of infertile Upper Dalmatia was freed of Feudal bonds according that they fight wars for the Venetian Republic The Serbs living in urban area of cities in Dalmatia were much wealthier The Serbs in Dalmatia with Boka have had strong national and religious determination through numerous old monasteries as beacons of culture and faith Such were the early 14th century Krupa Krka and Dragovi monasteries in the Knin Frontier and Bukovica The Serbs in the area of Cattaro had much more cultural advancement due to the nearby Cetinje capital area and the Venetians had to fall back from influencing the religious life of people there 

Dalmatia was the largest Europes concentration of Roman Catholic Bishops Priesthood Churches Monasteries and religious institutions The Catholic Bishops controlled the Orthodox Episcopy in Dalmatia by naming the Eastern Othodox Christian Episcopes themselves 

Dalmatia experienced a period of intense economic and cultural growth in the 18th century given how trade routes with the hinterland were reestablished in peace Christians that noticeably migrated from the Ottoman held territory into the Dalmatian cities converted from Orthodoxy to Catholicism 

Because the Venetians were able to reclaim some of the inland territories in the north during the Turkish wars the region of Dalmatia was no longer restricted to the coastline and the islands However the Venetian influence wasnt as strong in the former southern Dalmatia meaning that the toponym did not extend inland into areas of Herzegovina or Montenegro 

This period was abruptly interrupted with the fall of the Venetian republic in 1797

Napoleon united for the last time Dalmatia and Venice in his Kingdom of Italy in 1805 After his fall Venice followed the history of Italy with the Risorgimento while Dalmatia was aggregated to the Austro hungarian Empire

Viscosity index or VI is measure of the temperature at which a lubricating oil works properly The VI scale goes from 0 to 100 with 0 being the worst and 100 being the best New products are now better than when the scale was first made so some new products have scores as high as 400

Lubricating oil is meant to reduce friction between two surfaces If it is too viscous the oil will be thick and sticky and need too much energy to keep the parts moving If the oil is too thin then the parts will rub together and create friction What is needed is an oil that has just the right amount of viscosity to keep the two surfaces apart Oil becomes less viscous as the temperature goes up In an automobile engine the oil needs to be viscous at a range of temperatures It needs to work when the engine is first started and is cold and keep working when the engine gets very hot perhaps as much as 200 C The best oils with a high viscosity index score will keep their viscosity the same across the temperature range

The scale was made up by the Society of Automotive Engineers

Albania Veneta was the name for the possessions of the Republic of Venice in southern Dalmatia from 1420 to 1797 

It originally covered the coastal area of what is now northern Albania and the coast of Montenegro but the Albanian and southern Montenegrin parts were lost to the Ottomans in 1571  

The word Veneta in Albania Veneta was used to differentiate the area from the Ottoman Albania an area stretching from Kosovo to southern Albania 

These Venetian possessions stretched from the southern borders of the Republic of Ragusa to Durazzo in coastal Albania The Venetian territories never reached more than 20 km from the Adriatic Sea After 1573 the southern limit was moved to the village of Confin near Budua because of the Ottoman conquests of Antivari and Dulcigno in the Balkans

The Dominions of Venice were centered around the Bocche di Cattaro and included the small cities of Cattaro Risano Perasto Teodo Castelnuovo Budua and Spizza

Venice started to take control of the small southern Dalmatian villages around the 10th century assimilating quickly the neolatin Dalmatian language of the coastal areas into the Venetian language But only in the 14th century was the Republic of Venice able to create a territorial continuity around the Bay of Kotor These Venetian dominions around Cattaro lasted from 1420 to 1797 and were called Albania Veneta a historical province of the Republic of Venice 

When the Turks started to conquer the Balkans in 15th century many Christian Slavs took refuge inside Venetian Dalmatia and so even the Albania Veneta started to have a huge Serb and Albanian population By the end of 17th century the Romance speaking population of the historical Albania Veneta was already a minority according to Oscar Randi in his book Dalmazia etnica incontri e fusioni 

After the Napoleonic armies conquered and put an end to the Republic of Venice in 1797 the area of the Albania veneta changed control many times in 1805 was annexed to the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy then in 1809 was part of French Illyrian Provinces and finally in 1815 was put under Habsburg control in the Dalmatia of the Austrian Empire

Under the Habsburg domination Albania Veneta was part of Austrian Dalmatia and in 1878 another 40 km around Sutomore were added to this territory

The borders of the former Venetian province of Albania Veneta changed again in 1918 when was created the Kingdom of Yugoslavia but were reinstated from 1941 to 1943 during World War II when Mussolini annexed the territories around Cattaro to the Kingdom of Italy The area was part of the Italian Governatorato di Dalmazia and was called Provincia di Cattaro 

After World War II any political entity related to the historical presence of Venice in southern Dalmatia ceased to exist and the area was definitely incorporated into Yugoslavia The old Albania Veneta is currently a coastal region of the newly independent Montenegro

According to the Dalmatian historian Luigi Paulucci the population of the Albania Veneta during the centuries of the Republic of Venice was mainly Venetian speaking in the urban areas around the Bocche di Cattaro 

But in the inland areas more than half of the population was Serbo Croatian speaking after the first years of the eighteenth century Paulucci wrote even that near the border with Albania there were big communities of Albanian speaking people Dulcigno was half Albanian one quarter Venetian and one quarter Slavic speaking 

During the French rule of the area of Cattaro the schools were in Italian when the former Albania Veneta was part of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy 

The Slovenian Marko Trogrli in his essay The French school system in French Dalmatia wrote that Vincenzo Dandolo the French governor of Dalmatia as well as Bartolomeo Benincasa an official from the local Education Department published in May 1807 a plan for the provinces public education which had to be consistent with the education system throughout the Napoleonic Kingdom of ItalyInstruction was to be in Italian 

During the nineteenth century according to the historian Scaglioni Marzio the wars of independence of Italy from the Austro Hungarian empire created a situation of harassment against the Italian communities in the Austrian southern Dalmatia  

The result was that in 1880 there were in Cattaro according to the Austrian census only 930 ethnic Italians 

Furthermore in the Austrian census of 1910 the Italians were reduced to only 136 in that city according to Diego De Castro in his book Dalmazia popolazione e composizione etnica Cenno storico sul rapporto etnico tra Italiani e Slavi nella Dalmazia 

There are currently 500 Italian speakers in Montenegro mainly in the area of Cattaro and Perasto who constitute the Comunit Nazionale Italiana del Montenegro

The disappearance of the Italian speaking populations in Dalmatia was nearly complete after World War II The linguist Matteo Bartoli calculated that the Italians were 33 of the Dalmatian population during the Napoleonic wars while currently there are only 300 Italians in Croatian Dalmatia and 500 Italians in coastal Montenegro

Heliantheae is the most well known tribe of the sunflower family The name comes from the Greek word for sun flower The Heliantheae is the third largest tribe in the sunflower family which has 190 genera and about 2500 species Only the tribes Senecioneae and Astereae are larger Most Heliantheae come from North America and South America and Mexico A few genera come from tropical areas

Most Heliantheae are herbs or shrubs but there are some that grow to the size of small trees Leaves are usually hairy and arranged in opposite pairs The anthers are usually black

Heliantheae can be grown on farms These include sunflowers and jerusalem artichokes Many garden flowers are also in this group such as Coreopsis Cosmos Echinacea Rudbeckia and Zinnia

There are also some weeds in the family Species of Ambrosia produce lots of pollen Each plant can produce about a billion grains of pollen over a season and the plant is wind pollinated It is one of the main causes of hayfever 

In 1981 Harold Ernest Robinson came up with a new way to describe the tribe He divided Heliantheae into 35 subtribes

Las Meninas is a very famous painting by the Spanish painter Diego Velzquez The painting hangs in the Museo del Prado in Madrid the capital of Spain It was painted in 1656

The word Menina means lady in waiting or Maid of Honour ie a girl who serves in a royal court There is a lot of detail in the painting and more has been written about it than about almost any other Western painting because it is quite complicated For example people do not always agree about who is looking at whom and why they are standing there

Las Meninas shows a large room in the Madrid palace of King Philip IV of Spain Several people are in the painting and we know who they are Some are looking at one another and others are looking out from the painting at the viewer

The person who stands in the middle is the Infanta Margarita She has two maids of honour one on each side of her a chaperone a bodyguard two dwarfs and a dog Velzquez has also painted himself standing just behind the princess and her companions He is standing at the artists easel He has stopped painting for a moment and looks straight out at the viewer At the back of the room is a mirror in which we can see the top halves of the bodies of the king and queen This means that the king and queen are the viewers who are looking at the painting The king and queen are probably being painted by Velzquez but not everybody agrees with this

Velzquez was very famous in his lifetime He painted portraits of several royal people at the Spanish court Philip himself did not like being painted when he was old but he allowed Velzquez to include him in Las Meninas He had given Velzquez a special room where he could paint and he often sat and watched the painter at work in his studio

The painting was damaged a bit by a fire in 1734 and some of it was repainted including the left cheek of the Infanta In recent years it lost some of its colour partly due to the pollution caused by so many visitors to the gallery It was cleaned in 1984 Some people thought it made the picture look different

The people in Las Meninas are in Velzquezs studio in the royal palace The Infanta Margarita in the middle of the picture is five years old She later married the Roman Emperor Leopold She has two ladies in waiting doa Isabel de Velasco who is about to curtsy to the princess and doa Mara Agustina Sarmiento de Sotomayor who kneels in front of Margarita offering her a drink from a red cup or bucaro that she holds on a golden tray To the right of the Infanta are two dwarfs Maribarbola who was German and Nicolas Pertusato who was Italian He is trying to wake up a dog by his feet Behind them stands doa Marcela de Ulloa the princesss chaperone dressed in mourning and talking to a bodyguard We do not know the name of the bodyguard

At the back on the right stands Don Jos Nieto Velzquezthe queens chamberlain during the 1650s and the head of the royal tapestry workswho may have been a relative of the artist Nieto is shown pausing with his right knee bent and his feet on different steps We are not sure what he is doing None of the people in the picture can see him Only the viewer can

Velzquez himself stands to the left of the scene looking outward past a large canvas supported by an easel On his chest is the red cross of the Order of Santiago which he did not receive until 1659 three years after the painting was completed He later added the cross to the painting

The mirror on the back wall reflects the upper bodies and heads of the King Philip IV and his queen Mariana Most people think that they are being painted by Velzquez and that their daughter the Infanta is watching them

He died at the age of 49 after collapsing at his sisters house in Thunder Bay The cause of death was heart attack

The moon landing conspiracy theory is the belief that men did not land on the Moon in 19691972 during the Apollo program and that NASA faked the evidence Some conspiracy theorists believe the Skylab space station is also a hoax

This belief is considered by the scientific community and historians to be irrational But on the internet the debate can occur since it is easy for anyone to publish their ideas There are entire subcultures within the USA and substantial cultures around the world that believe that the Moon landings were faked This view is taught in Cuban schools and wherever else Cuban teachers are sent It is also shared by the Taliban and by the International Society for Krishna Consciousness

On 12 April 1961 the USSR sent the first man into spaceYuri Gagarin Six weeks later US President John Kennedy promised a manned Moon landing by 1969 to win the battle of systems and impress the world with technical superiority

Moon conspiracy theorists say that NASA had too many technical problems to meet the eight year deadline for going to the moon But the USA could not afford to appear lose the race to the moon to the Soviet Union and so the moon landings were faked In 2004 President George Bush gave not eight but sixteen years for a manned return to the Moon even though the technologies for it should have already been developed forty years earlier In 2010 President Barack Obama canceled this plan which seemed to the moon conspiracy theorists to be an admission that the USA still does not have the technology to go to the moon

Doubts about the authenticity of the Apollo Moon landings appeared first in December 1968 when Apollo 8 was launched The almost perfectly executed odyssey of Apollo 11 amazed many around the world and some people doubted it was real

The first book on the subject was issued in Texas by the mathematician James J Cranny in 1970

NASA commented on some of the conspiracy theories in June 1977 But in August 1997 their Director of Media Services Brian Welch said in an interview with Sky TV News

When Fox TV aired Bruce Nashs film Conspiracy theory Did we land on the Moon in 2001 NASA released hoax theory rebuttal materials on their web and FTP sites They also wrote suggestions for science teachers on how to refute the hoax claims using the Lunar Sample Disk Kits

In 2002 NASA hired James Edward Oberg to write a book intended to challenge those who claim the Apollo Moon landings were a hoax Oberg was a former rocket scientist MSNBC News space consultant and analyst and journalist and it was later discovered a moon landing conspiracy theorist But NASA soon cancelled the project declining to give the reasons for this NASA spokesman Bob Jacobs said criticism that NASA was displaying poor judgement and a lack of confidence in commissioning the book caused the agency to abort it For example then NASA Administrator Sean OKeefe said

In 2006 some of the recordings of the Apollo era were declared missing The question of what happened to the recordings was seen by conspiracy theorists as confirmation of their beliefs and in 2009 NASA revealed that the tapes were erased

The claims and counterclaims surrounding the moon conspiracy theories are extremely detailed and complex Some of the major points and counterpoints are listed below

Moon conspiracy theorists think that NASA faked the Apollo mission with a secret program According to James Longuski the complexity of the conspiracy theory scenarios make them impossible More than 400000 people worked on the Apollo project for almost ten years and 12 men who walked on the Moon returned to Earth to talk about their experiences Hundreds of thousands of people would have had to keep the secret Longuski says that it would have been a lot easier to actually land on the Moon than to create such a large conspiracy to fake it

Moon conspiracy theorists say that telescopes like the Hubble should be able to take pictures of the moon where Apollo landed and if people really did land on the moon then the pictures should show the scars on the moons surface and equipment it left behind They believe that our major observatories will not take pictures of the landing sites because it would expose the cover up 

NASA has said that images have been taken of these landing sites but the pictures taken by Hubble are too low quality to see very much detail In 2009 NASA released pictures from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter showing the Apollo landing sites in more detail These photographs have not convinced the moon landing conspiracy theorists because the pictures were taken by NASA and they think NASA is behind the cover up

Blueprints and drawings of the machines used in the Apollo project are missing Some Apollo 11 tapes containing telemetry and high quality video of the first moonwalk are also missing Moon landing conspiracy theorists believe that this is because they never existed since the mission was faked

Dr David Williams and Apollo 11 flight director Eugene F Kranz acknowledged that some of the Apollo 11 tapes are missing When the recordings were sent back to Earth to be shown on TV they were converted to a different format which was lower quality Now the lower quality tapes are available but the original high quality videos received in Australia are missing Some pictures of the original high quality image are still available and videos have been released from other missions too like the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package

Some people at NASA are looking for the tapes to help them plan for future missions They believe the Apollo 11 tapes were sent for storage at the US National Archives in 1970 but by 1984 all the Apollo 11 tapes had been returned to the Goddard Space Flight Center The tapes may have been stored rather than re used and efforts to determine where they were stored are ongoing Goddard was storing 35000 new tapes per year in 1967 even before the lunar landings

On November 1 2006 Cosmos Magazine reported that 100 data tapes recorded in Australia during the Apollo 11 mission had been found in the basement of the Curtain University of Technology in Perth Australia One of the old tapes was sent to NASA for analysis 

On July 16 2009 NASA said that it must have erased the original Apollo 11 Moon footage years ago so that it could reuse the tape On December 22 2009 NASA issued a final report on the tapes Senior engineer Dick Nafzger concluded that approximately 45 tapes of Apollo 11 video were erased and reused For the 40th anniversary of the Apollo moon landing Lowry Digital of Burbank California restored the low quality videos Some pieces of the restored footage are available on the NASA website

Bart Sibrel says that the Soviet Union had much more time in space than the United States before the Apollo Program The Soviet Union put the first satellite in orbit in October 1957 named Sputnik 1 They also put the first animal in space in Sputnik 2 and were the first country to safely bring back an animal from space in Sputnik 5 Yuri Gagrin was the first man to orbit the Earth in Vostok 1 who was also from the Soviet Union Sibrel believes that since the Soviet Union was so far ahead of the United States in the Moon race the United States had to fake the landings to win

On January 27 1967 Apollo 1 caught fire and killed 3 astronauts Two years later NASA said that the problems which caused the fire were fixed Bart Sibrel believes that the problems could not be fixed so NASA decided to fake the landings to win the Moon race 

NASA says that the Soviet Unions achievements were not as impressive as the United States Before Apollo 7 the USSR made 9 spaceflights while the US had made 16 Between 1961 and 1967 the US had 7 more spaceflights than the USSR and 600 more hours in space Apollo 7 launched in October 1968 21 months after the Apollo 1 fire with an astronaut on board By Apollo 11 the Uninted States lead was even bigger

Both the United States and the USSR had many problems during the Moon race The USSR had the first in flight death in 1967 only 3 months after the Apollo 1 fire According to NASA most of the accomplishments first made by the USSR were also made by the US within a year By 1965 the US started to beat the USSR to a few important steps The USSR never developed a rocket which could land on the Moon and they never tested landing on the Moon with an astronaut on board 

Some conspiracy theorists say that the Moon rocks collected by the Apollo Program are actually meteorites from Antarctica Wernher von Braun the Marshall Space Flight Center Director and three others traveled to Antarctica in 1967 to explore for future space missions Some conspiracy theorists believe that Braun collected meteorites during this trip to use as fake moon rocks 

The Apollo Program collected Convert382kg of moon rocks during the Apollo 11 12 14 15 16 and 17 missions According to scientists around the world these rocks are very different from meteorites and other rocks found on Earth The rocks are also 200000000 years older than any rock found on Earth and are similar to moon rocks later brought back by the USSR

Some moon rocks could have been collected without landing on the moon but the first moon rock was found on Earth in 1979 and it was only discovered in 1982 that it came from the moon Also moon rocks are very rare on Earth and only 30 kilograms have ever been discovered while the Apollo missions brought back 382 kilograms

In 2004 Martin Hendry and Ken Skeldon from the University of Glasgow investigated the Moon Hoax In November 2004 they spoke at the Glasgow Science Centre and examined the top ten lines of evidence that a hoax had taken place 

In a television program about the hoax Fox Entertainment Group listed 10 astronauts and 2 others who had possibly been killed as part of a cover up

All the deaths except for Irwins were related to their job with NASA or the Air Force Mike Adams and Robert Lawrence were not involved with the civilian space program James Irwin already had several heart attacks before his death All except two of the deaths happened at least one or two years before Apollo 11 Also Brian Welch was speaking out against the moon hoax so he would not have been a good target to be killed

In April 2010 nine of the twelve astronauts who landed on the Moon are still alive including Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin

The Whig Party was a political party of the United States It was famous during the years of Jacksonian democracy It is thought to be important to the Second Party System Operating from 1833 to 1856 the party was formed opposing the policies of President Andrew Jackson and the Democratic Party The Whigs supported the importance of Congress over the importance of the executive branch They favored a program of modernization Their name was chosen to tell people about the American Whigs of 1776 who fought for independence Whig was then a widely recognized label of choice for people who saw themselves as opposing autocratic rule The Whig Party had national leaders as Daniel Webster William Henry Harrison Henry Clay of Kentucky The Whig Party also had four war heroes among them such as Generals Zachary Taylor and Winfield Scott Abraham Lincoln was a Whig leader in frontier Illinois

In its over two decades of existence the Whig Party saw two of its candidates Harrison and Taylor elected president Both died in office John Tyler became president after Harrisons death but was thrown out from the party Millard Fillmore who became president after Taylors death was the last Whig to hold the nations highest office

The party was ultimately destroyed by the question of whether to allow the expansion of slavery to the territories The anti slavery faction successfully prevented the nomination of its own incumbent President Fillmore in the 1852 presidential election Instead the party nominated General Winfield Scott who was defeated Its leaders quit politics or changed parties The voter base defected to the Republican Party various coalition parties in some states and to the Democratic Party By the 1856 presidential election the party had lost its ability to maintain a national coalition of effective state parties and endorsed Millard Fillmore now of the American Party at its last national convention Party could win

The Samlesbury witches were three women who were said to be witches murderers and cannibals They were tried in the village of Samlesbury in Lancashire Their trial on 19 August 1612 was one of a series of witch trials held over two days It is among the most famous in English history The trials were unusual for England at that time for two reasons First Thomas Potts the clerk to the court wrote about it in his The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster Secondly the number of people found guilty and hanged was high ten at Lancaster and another at York However the three Samlesbury women were found not guilty of witchcraftsome of the accused were burned alive and hung

The three women were Jane Southworth Jennet Bierley and Ellen Bierley A 14 year old girl Grace Sowerbutts had said they used witchcraft The women were accused of murdering children and of cannibalism amongst other things In contrast other people tried at the same time were accused of maleficium that is causing harm by witchcraft This included the Pendle witches The case against the three women collapsed spectacularly when the main witness Grace Sowerbutts was shown by the trial judge to be the perjuring tool of a Catholic priest

Many historians notably Hugh Trevor Roper have said that the witch trials of the 16th and 17th century were a result of the religious struggles of the period During this time both the Catholic and Protestant Churches wanted to stamp out what they saw as heresy The trial of the Samlesbury witches is perhaps one clear example of that trend it has been described as largely a piece of anti Catholic propaganda A trial would show that Lancashire a wild and lawless area was being cleared not only of witches but also of popish plotters that is Catholics

King James I came to the English throne in 1603 James was influenced by the strict Scottish Reformation very much He was very interested in in witchcraft By the early 1590s he was convinced that Scottish witches plotted against him His 1597 book Daemonologie he told his followers that they must report and prosecute any supporters or practitioners of witchcraft In 1604 a new witchcraft law was made called An Act against Conjuration Witchcraft and dealing with evil and wicked spirits Anyone who caused harm by the use of magic or the exhumation of corpses for magical purposes would be given the death penalty James was did not believe some of the evidence presented in witch trials he even personally showed discrepancies in the testimonies presented against some accused witches

The accused witches lived in Lancashire At the end of the 16th century the government thought this county was a wild and lawless area fabled for its theft violence and sexual laxity where the church was honoured without much understanding of its doctrines by the common people Since the death of Queen Mary and the coming to the throne of her half sister Elizabeth in 1558 Catholic priests had been forced to hide but in remote areas like Lancashire they were still able to celebrate mass in secret In early 1612 the year of the trials each justice of the peace in Lancashire was ordered to make a list of the recusants in their areathose who refused to attend the services of the Church of England which was a criminal offence at that time

During the 16th century English Reformation the Church of England broke away from the rule of the pope and the Catholic Church This event split up the Southworth family of Samlesbury Hall Sir John Southworth head of the family until his death in 1595 was a leading recusant He had been arrested many times for not giving up his Catholic faith His eldest son also called John did join the Church of England for which his father disinherited him The rest of the family stayed strictly Catholic

One of the accused witches Jane Southworth was the widow of the disinherited son John Relations father and son were not polite John Singleton said that the father would not even go passed his sons house if he could keep clear of it and believed that Jane would probably kill her husband Jane Southworth and John were married in about 1598 and the couple lived in Samlesbury Lower Hall John had died only a few months before her trial for witchcraft in 1612 and she had seven children

On 21 March 1612 Alizon Device who lived just outside the Lancashire village of Fence near Pendle Hill met John Law a pedlar from Halifax She asked him for some pins which he refused to give to her and a few minutes later Law suffered a stroke for which he blamed Alizon Along with her mother Elizabeth and her brother James Alizon had to appear before local magistrate Roger Nowell on 30 March 1612 Based on the evidence and confessions he obtained Nowell sent Alizon and ten others to Lancaster Gaol to be tried for maleficiumcausing harm by witchcraft

Other Lancashire magistrates learned of Nowells discovery of witchcraft in the county On 15 April 1612 JP Robert Holden began investigations in his own area of Samlesbury As a result eight individuals were sent to trial including Jane Southworth Jennet Bierley and Ellen Bierley They were said to have used witchcraft on Grace Sowerbutts Jennets grand daughter and Ellens niece

The trial was held on 19 August 1612 before Sir Edward Bromley a judge seeking promotion to a circuit nearer London He may have wanted to impress King James the head of the judiciary Before the trial Bromley ordered the release of five of the eight defendants from Samlesbury with a warning about their future conduct Jane Southworth Jennet Bierley and Ellen Bierley were said to have used diverse devillish and wicked Arts called Witchcrafts Inchauntments Charmes and Sorceries in and upon one Grace Sowerbutts to which they pleaded not guilty Fourteen year old Grace was the chief prosecution witness

Grace was the first to give evidence She said that both her grandmother and aunt Jennet and Ellen Bierley were able to change themselves into dogs and that they had haunted and vexed her for years She also said that they had transported her to the top of a hayrick by her hair They had also tried to make her drown herself Grace said the women had taken her to the house of Thomas Walshman and his wife from whom they had stolen a baby to suck its blood Grace said the child died the next night and after its burial at Samlesbury Church Ellen and Jennet dug up the body and took it home The women then cooked and ate some of it and used the rest to make an ointment that let them change themselves into other shapes

Grace also said that her grandmother and aunt with Jane Southworth went to sabbats held every Thursday and Sunday night at Red Bank on the north shore of the River Ribble At those secret meetings they met with foure black things going upright and yet not like men in the face with whom they ate danced and had sex

Thomas Walshman the father of the baby allegedly killed and eaten by the accused was the next to give evidence He confirmed that his child had died of unknown causes at about one year old He added that Grace Sowerbutts was discovered lying as if dead in his fathers barn on about 15 April and did not recover until the following day Two other witnesses John Singleton and William Alker confirmed that Sir John Southworth Jane Southworths father in law had been reluctant to pass the house where his son lived as he believed Jane to be an evil woman and a Witch

Thomas Potts the clerk wrote that after hearing the evidence many of those in court were persuaded of the accuseds guilt On being asked by the judge what answer they could make to the charges laid against them Potts reports that they humbly fell upon their knees with weeping teares and desired him Bromley for Gods cause to examine Grace Sowerbutts Immediately the countenance of this Grace Sowerbutts changed the witnesses began to quarrel and accuse one another and eventually admitted that Grace had been coached in her story by a Catholic priest they called Thompson Bromley then committed the girl to be examined by two JPs William Leigh and Edward Chisnal Under questioning Grace readily admitted that her story was untrue and said she had been told what to say by Jane Southworths uncle Christopher Southworth aka Thompson a Jesuit priest who was in hiding in the Samlesbury area Southworth was the chaplain at Samlesbury Hall and Jane Southworths uncle by marriage Leigh and Chisnal questioned the three accused women in an attempt to discover why Southworth might have fabricated evidence against them but none could offer any reason other than that each of them goeth to the Anglican Church

After the statements had been read out in court Bromley ordered the jury to find the defendants not guilty stating that

Potts finished his book with the words Thus were these poore Innocent creatures by the great care and paines of this honourable Judge delivered from the danger of this Conspiracie this bloudie practise of the Priest laid open

Almost everything that is known about the trials comes from a report of the proceedings written by Thomas Potts the clerk to the Lancaster Assizes Potts was told to write his account by the trial judges and had completed the work by 16 November 1612 Bromley revised and corrected the manuscript before its publication in 1613 and said it was truly reported and fit and worthie to be published Although written as an apparently verbatim account the book is not a report of what was actually said at the trial but instead a reflection on what happened Nevertheless Potts seems to give a generally trustworthy although not comprehensive account of an Assize witchcraft trial provided that the reader is constantly aware of his use of written material instead of verbatim reports

In his introduction to the trial Potts writes Thus have we for a time left the Graund Witches of the Forrest of Pendle to the good consideration of a very sufficient jury Bromley had by then heard the cases against the three Pendle witches who had confessed to their guilt but he had yet to deal with the others who maintained their innocence He knew that the only testimony against them would come from a nine year old girl and that King James had cautioned judges to examine carefully the evidence presented against accused witches warning against credulity In his conclusion to the account of the trial Potts says that it was interposed in the expected sequence by special order and commandment presumably of the trial judges After having convicted and sentenced to death three witches Bromley may have been keen to avoid any suspicion of credulity by presenting his masterful exposure of the evidence presented by Grace Sowerbutts before turning his attention back to the remainder of the Pendle witches

Potts declares that this Countie of Lancashire now may lawfully bee said to abound asmuch in Witches of divers kinds as Seminaries Jesuites and Papists and describes the three accused women as having once been obstinate Papists and now came to Church The judges would certainly have been keen to be regarded by King James the head of the judiciary as having dealt resolutely with Catholic recusants as well as with witchcraft the two big threats to Jacobean order in Lancashire Samlesbury Hall the family home of the Southworths was suspected by the authorities of being a refuge for Catholic priests and it was under secret government surveillance for some considerable time before the trial of 1612 It may be that JP Robert Holden was at least partially motivated in his investigations by a desire to smoke out its Jesuit chaplain Christopher Southworth

The English experience of witchcraft was somewhat different from the European one with only one really mass witchhunt that of Matthew Hopkins in East Anglia during 1645 That one incident accounted for more than 20 of the number of witches it is estimated were executed in England between the early 15th and mid 18th century fewer than 500 The English legal system also differed significantly from the inquisitorial model used in Europe requiring members of the public to accuse their neighbours of some crime and for the case to be decided by a jury of their peers English witch trials of the period revolved around popular beliefs according to which the crime of witchcraft was one of evil doing for which tangible evidence had to be provided

Potts devotes several pages to a fairly detailed criticism of the evidence presented in Grace Sowerbutts statement giving an insight into the discrepancies which existed during the early 17th century between the Protestant establishments view of witchcraft and the beliefs of the common people who may have been influenced by the more continental views of Catholic priests such as Christopher Southworth Unlike their European counterparts the English Protestant elite believed that witches kept familiars or companion animals and so it was not considered credible that the Samlesbury witches had none Graces story of the sabbat too was unfamiliar to the English at that time although belief in such secret gatherings of witches was widespread in Europe Most demonologists of the period including King James held that only God could perform miracles and that he had not given the power to go against the laws of nature to those in league with the Devil Hence Potts dismisses Sowerbutts claim that Jennet Bierley transformed herself into a black dog with the comment I would know by what means any Priest can maintaine this point of Evidence He equally lightly dismisses Graces account of the sabbat she claimed to have attended where she met with foure black things not like men in the face with the comment that The Seminarie priest mistakes the face for the feete For Chattox one of the Pendle witches and all her fellow witches agree the Devill is cloven footed but Fancie Chattoxs familiar had a very good face and was a proper man

It is perhaps unlikely that the accused women would have failed to draw the examining magistrates attention to their suspicions concerning Grace Sowerbutts motivations when first examined only to do so at the very end of their trial when asked by the judge if they had anything to say in their defence The trial of the Samlesbury witches in 1612 may have been largely a piece of anti Catholic propaganda or even a show trial the purpose of which was to demonstrate that Lancashire was being purged not only of witches but also of popish plotters

Bromley achieved his desired promotion to the Midlands Circuit in 1616 Potts was given the keepership of Skalme Park by King James in 1615 to breed and train the kings hounds In 1618 he was given responsibility for collecting the forfeitures on the laws concerning sewers for twenty one years Jane Southworths eldest son Thomas eventually inherited his grandfathers estate of Samlesbury Hall

There are some differences between the film and the novel it was made from In the novel Idgie and Ruth are a lesbian couple In the film they seem to be just friends The director John Avnet said that he wanted viewers to make up their own minds In one part of the film Idgie and Ruth have a food fight Avnet said that the food fight is symbolic of love making When it was released some critics and LGBT activists were angry that the lesbian part of the story had been glossed over Even though the lesbian content had been hidden the film won an award from the Gay Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation for best feature film with lesbian content

Another difference is that at the end of the film it seems possible that Ninny is really Idgie In the novel they are completely separate characters and are sisters in law

A Race condition is a problem with the design of a system With a race condition the result of a calculation or the behaviour of the system as a whole is dependent on how long a certain calculation takes or when it is started Race conditions occur is logic circuits and computer software especially with multi threaded or distributed systems

It is often difficult to explain what a race condition is but the metaphor of a horse race can be used as an explanation

A computer program is like a horse race It does different things at the same time in a horse race there are several horses that are running the race Each horse represents what is usually called a thread of execution That way one such thread may handle network communication another one may be responsible for redrawing the user interface In the case of a race condition the application requires that a given horse wins the race The application may work if horse number five wins but it will crash if any other horse wins the race One solution to the problem is to use synchronization This is like several jockeys teaming up to make sure horse number five is ahead 

On different computers or in different situations the application will vary in speed Sometimes it will be faster other times slower This may mean that on some systems the race condition will never show even though it may be easy to show it on others Race conditions can be difficult to find Bugs caused by race conditions are a frequent source of frustration within the profession of software development

Don Carlos is an opera composed by Giuseppe Verdi It was composed to a libretto in the French language by Camille du Locle and Joseph Mry It was based on a famous German play called Don Carlos Infante of Spain by Friedrich Schiller Schillers story is based on the true story of the life of Carlos Prince of Asturias who was promised that he could marry Elisabeth of Valois but then his fatherPhilip II of Spain changed his mind and married her himself It was part of the peace treaty ending the Italian War of 1551 1559 between the Houses of Habsburg and Valois 

The opera was first performed at the Thtre Imprial de lOpra in Paris on 11 March 1867 It has five acts 

Don Carlos was written for performance in Paris This has made a problem for the reputation of the opera because it was tradition in France to write very long operas They always included a lot of ballet music as well as the singing Verdis opera was in five acts and when it was performed in other countries it was too long for peoples tastes so many cuts were made including at first the whole of Act I This is a great pity because a lot of the music in Act One is very important with tunes which also come later in the opera Since the beginning of the 20th century most of the music of Act I is usually performed There have been many different versions performed with different parts of the opera cut When the opera is sung in Italian it is called Don Carlo

The story takes place at a time when Spain is just coming to the end of a war with France It has been agreed between the two countries that Don Carlos heir to the Spanish throne will marry Elisabeth the daughter of the King of France

Don Carlos wants to see the girl he is to marry He goes to France and secretly joins a royal hunt in which Elisabeth is taking part Elisabeth and her page are separated from the others Carlos speaks to her and offers to take her home The princess asks him about the prince she is to marry Carlos says that she need not worry because the prince is kind and in love with her He then shows Elisabeth a photo of the prince and then Elisabeth of course realizes that it is the prince she is talking to They sing a love duet

Some Spanish officials then come and tell Elisabeth that it has been decided that she is not to marry the prince she is to marry his father the king of Spain The two lovers are dismayed at this news The crowd of people beg Elisabeth to agree to marrying the King of Spain so that the war will stop In the end she agrees

When the Queen leaves the church she goes to the garden where her ladies are waiting for her A messenger gives her a letter from her mother in Paris but at the same time he secretly gives her a letter from Carlos Rodrigue quietly talks to Eboli the queens lady in waiting while the queen reads the letters Rodrigue asks the Queen to try to persuade the king to let Carlos talk to him Eboli is in love with Carlos She has noticed how Carlos has been agitated when he has been in the presence of the Queen and thinks it is because Carlos loves her

Carlos is given a chance to meet Elisabeth privately He calmly asks her whether she could persuade the King to send him to Flanders However he is not really calm and soon he starts to be angry with her for not showing any love feelings towards him She tells him that it is her duty now that she is Queen Carlos understands but is still in love with her He falls at her feet He grabs her and declares his love for her but the Queen tears herself from him and he rushes off in despair

The Kings comes out of church He is very cross that his wife has been left on her own He tells the lady in waiting to go away The Queen comforts her Then she and her ladies go

The second scene of the act takes place in a square in Madrid An auto da f is being prepared During the time of the Spanish Inquisition this was a ceremony in which anyone who did not agree with the Roman Catholic church was burnt to death Monks enter followed by the unfortunate people who are going to be burnt The people sing about the glories of Spain King Philippe appears and repeats how he will fight against anyone who is an enemy of the Roman Catholic church Six people including Carlos appear and fling themselves at his feet begging him to stop his troops from killing the Flemish people The King will not hear of it Some of the crowd support the king but others are begging him to have mercy Carlos then asks his father to allow him to rule Flanders for him The King does not allow this because he realizes that this could be an opportunity for Carlos and the Flemish people to rise against him Carlos is desperate He draws his sword and says that he will save Flanders The crowd are terrified to see him behave like this in front of the King The King commands his soldiers to take the sword away from Carlos but no one obeys him In the end Rodrigue saves the situation by calmly asking Carlos for the sword He hands it over and Rodrigue gives it to the King The monks process farther and a voice from heaven promises peace in the world to come

The King is alone in church In a wonderful aria he sings of his sadness that his wife does not seem to love him The Grand Inquisitor comes in He is very old and blind The King tells him about his son and asks the Inquisitor whether Carlos should be forgiven or sentenced to death The Inquisitor answers that it is Rodrigue who should be killed The king dares to disagree The Inquisitor tells the King that he is not giving his heart to God The Inquisitor goes

The second scene of the act shows Carlos in prison Rodrigue comes to him He knows that Flemish letters addressed to Carlos have been found in his possession Someone comes in and kills Rodrigue As he dies he tells Carlos that the Queen will wait for him the next day outside the nunnery and will see him for the last time He dies

Elisabeth kneels before the tomb of Charles V She sings of her lost youth in France She prays for peace Elisabeth and Carlos then meet for the last time and wish for happier times The King and the Inquisitor have been hiding They now appear and grab Carlos The guards are told to grab him but Carlos defends himself Suddenly the voice of Charles V is heard He takes his grandson into the safety of the cloister

Don Carlos is a great opera It has some of Verdis greatest music especially the music of Act IV scene i in which the events of the previous acts are all brought together There are some wonderful duets and some great bass arias However the opera is very long but it is difficult to cut any of the singing without spoiling the drama

Some people feel that the end of the opera is weak In Schillers play there is a different ending Carlos is handed over to the Inquisition and put to death

Biofuel is fuel cn that is obtained from recently lifeless or living biological material It is different to fossil fuels which are obtained from long dead biological material Biofuel can be in forms of solid liquid or gas 

Biofuels are usually used to power cars heat homes and for cooking Biofuel companies are mainly from Europe Asia and the Americas Recent technologies developed at the Los Alamos National Lab even allows pollution to be converted into renewable biofuel Argofuels are biofuels that are produced from specific crops rather than from waste processes such as landfill or recycled vegetable oil 

There are two common ways of producing the liquid and gas version of argofuels One is to grow crops that are high in sugar or starch and then use yeast to produce ethyl alcohol The second is to grow plants that contain high amounts of vegetable oil such as oil palm soybean and algae When these oils are heated their viscosity is reduced and they can be burned directly in a diesel engine or they can be chemically processed to produce fuels such as biodiesel Wood and its by products can also be converted into biofuels such as charcoal woodgas methanol or ethanol fuel It is also possible to make cellulosic ethanol from non edible plant parts but this can be difficult to accomplish economically

Solid biomass is also used Many materials such as wood and grasses can be dried and pelletised and burnt and this can be used to produce power

Ella Jane Fitzgerald was an American jazz singer People also called her Lady Ella the Queen of Jazz and the First Lady of Song

Her voice had a large vocal range which meant that she could sing very high notes and very low notes She was famous for her scat singing She is one of the most famous singers of the Great American Songbook

Fitzgeralds career lasted 59 years She won 14 Grammy Awards She was awarded the National Medal of Art by Ronald Reagan and the Presidential Medal of Freedom by George H W Bush

Ella Fitzgerald was born in 1917 in Newport News Virginia United States Her parents were called William and Temperance Tempie Fitzgerald Soon after Fitzgerald was born her parents separated and she went to live in Yonkers New York with her mother and her mothers boyfriend Joseph Da Silva In 1923 Fitzgeralds half sister Frances Da Silva was born When she was a child Fitzgerald was made to live in the Colored Orphan Asylum in Riverdale the Bronx

When she was young Fitzgerald wanted to be a dancer and she loved listening to jazz music by Louis Armstrong Bing Crosby and The Boswell Sisters She especially liked the lead singer Connee Boswell later saying My mother brought home one of her records and I fell in love with itI tried so hard to sound just like her

In 1932 Fitzgeralds mother died from a heart attack and she began to do badly at school At one time she had a job as a lookout at a bordello and also with some people to do with the Mafia She got into trouble with the police and was sent to a reform school She escaped from the reformatory and for a time was homeless

Fitzgerald had her first job as a singer when she was 17 on November 21 1934 at the Harlem Opera House in Harlem New York She became popular with the audience at the Apollo and she was able to compete in one of its famous Amateur Nights At first she was going to go on stage and dance but intimidated by some local dancers she decided to sing instead She sang Connee Boswells songs Judy and The Object of My Affection She won the first prize of US2500

In January 1935 Fitzgerald won the chance to perform for a week with the Tiny Bradshaw band at the Harlem Opera House She met a drummer and bandleader called Chick Webb here Webb had already hired a singer called Charlie Linton to work with the band According to The New York Times Webb was reluctant to sign herbecause she was gawky and unkempt a diamond in the rough Webb let her try singing with his band when they played a dance at Yale University

Fitzgerald began singing often with Webbs Orchestra during 1935 at Harlems Savoy Ballroom She recorded several hit songs with them including Love and Kisses and Youll Have to Swing It In 1938 she co wrote and sang a version of the nursery rhyme A Tisket A Tasket After this she started getting famous

Chick Webb died on June 16 1939 and his band was renamed Ella Fitzgerald and her Famous Orchestra Fitzgerald became the bandleader She recorded nearly 150 sides during her time with the orchestra

In 1942 Fitzgerald left the band and began to work as a solo singer She was signed to the Decca label and she had several popular hit songs She recording with other musicians like the Ink Spots Louis Jordan and the Delta Rhythm Boys

Deccas Milt Gabler became her manager and she began working often for the jazz producer Norman Granz She often sang in his Jazz at the Philharmonic concerts Then Granz became her manager but he did not record her on any of his record labels for nearly a decade

In the mid 1940s after the Swing era and the end of the great touring big bands jazz music became quite different A new kind of jazz called bebop became popular and Fitzgerald changed her style of singing She worked with Dizzy Gillespies big band and started including scat singing as a big part of her performances About singing with Gillespie Fitzgerald said I just tried to do with my voice what I heard the horns in the band doing

Her 1945 scat recording of Flying Home was later described by The New York Times as one of the most influential vocal jazz records of the decadeWhere other singers most notably Louis Armstrong had tried similar improvisation no one before Miss Fitzgerald employed the technique with such dazzling inventiveness Her be bop recording of Oh Lady be Good was also very popular and made people think of her as one of the most important jazz singers

Granz did not like some of the music Fitzgerald was given at this time so during her last years on the Decca label she recorded some duets with pianist Ellis Larkins released in 1950 as Ella Sings Gershwin

In 1955 Fitzgerald left Decca and joined Granzs new record label Verve Records She said later I had gotten to the point where I was only singing be bop I thought be bop was it and that all I had to do was go some place and sing bop But it finally got to the point where I had no place to sing I realized then that there was more to music than bop Normanfelt that I should do other things so he produced The Cole Porter Songbook with me It was a turning point in my life

A new album Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Cole Porter Songbook was released in 1956 It was the first of eight multi album Songbook sets that she would record for Verve between 1956 and 1964 Many of the songs were standards and Fitzgerald tried to cross over into a non jazz audience

Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Duke Ellington Songbook was the only Songbook on which the composer of the songs also played with her Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn who had worked together for a long time both played on half the sets 38 tracks and wrote two new pieces of music for the album The E and D Blues and a musical piece about Fitzgerald

The Songbook series became the Fitzgeralds most critically acclaimed and popular work The New York Times wrote in 1996 These albums were among the first pop records to devote such serious attention to individual songwriters and they were instrumental in establishing the pop album as a vehicle for serious musical exploration

Ella Fitzgerald also recorded albums of the songs of Cole Porter and George Gershwin in 1972 and 1983 The albums were called Ella Loves Cole and Nice Work If You Can Get It A later album of songs by a single composer was released when she was with Pablo Records Ella Abraa Jobim with songs by Antonio Carlos Jobim

While she was recording the Songbooks and the occasional studio album Fitzgerald toured 40 to 45 weeks per year in the United States and internationally with Norman Granz Granz helped her to become one of the most important live jazz performers

In the mid 1950s Fitzgerald became the first African American to perform at the Mocambo after Marilyn Monroe had persuaded the owner to make the booking This was very important in Fitzgeralds career The event was turned into a play by Bonnie Greer which is to receive a production in Londons West End from November 2009

Some live albums on Verve that she recorded are well thought of by critics Ella at the Opera House Ella in Rome and Ella in Berlin

Verve Records was sold to MGM in 1963 for 3 million and in 1967 MGM did not give Fitzgerald another contract Over the next five years she recorded with different labels like Atlantic Capitol and Reprise Her music at this time is different from her earlier jazz music for Capitol she recorded Brighten the Corner an album of hymns Ella Fitzgeralds Christmas an album of traditional Christmas carols Misty Blue a country and western album and 30 by Ella a series of six medleys

During this time she had her last US chart single with a cover of Smokey Robinsons Get Ready which had already been a hit for The Temptations After she recorded it it was also a hit for Rare Earth

In 1972 she recorded an album called Jazz at Santa Monica Civic 72 which was successful Granz started a new record label called Pablo Records Fitzgerald recorded 20 albums for the label While she was working with Pablo Records her voice stopped sounding as good as it used to She had health problems and she made her last recording in 1991 and her last public performances in 1993

Fitzgerald married at least twice and people think that she may have married three times In 1941 she married Benny Kornegay a convicted drug dealer The marriage was annulled after two years

In December 1947 she married the famous bass player Ray Brown She had met him while on tour with Dizzy Gillespies band a year before Together they adopted a child of Fitzgeralds half sister Frances They named him Ray Brown Jr Fitzgerald and Brown were both often busy touring and recording Ray was mostly looked after by Fitzgeralds aunt Virginia Fitzgerald and Brown divorced in 1953 but they continued to perform together

In July 1957 Reuters reported that Fitzgerald had secretly married Thor Einar Larsen a young Norwegian in Oslo She had even furnished an apartment in Oslo but the affair was quickly forgotten when Larsen was sentenced to five months hard labor in Sweden for stealing money from a young woman

Fitzgerald was also known for being shy Trumpet player Mario Bauza who played behind Fitzgerald when she sang with Chick Webb remembered that She didnt hang out much When she got into the band she was dedicated to her musicShe was a lonely girl around New York just kept herself to herself for the gig Later in her career Fitzgerald said I dont want to say the wrong thing which I always do I think I do better when I sing

Fitzgerald had diabetes which caused her to go blind and she had to have both her legs amputated in 1993 In 1996 she died of diabetes in Beverly Hills California at the age of 79 She was buried in the Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood California Several of Fitzgeralds awards significant personal possessions and documents were given to the Smithsonian Institution the library of Boston University the Library of Congress and the Schoenberg Library at UCLA

Bessie Smith was an American blues singer She was sometimes called The Empress of the Blues and was very popular in the 1920s and 1930s A lot of people think that she was one of the best singers of her time and along with Louis Armstrong she was an important influence on later jazz singers

In the 1900 American census Bessie Smiths mother Laura Smith said that Bessie was born in Chattanooga Tennessee in July 1892 In the census in 1910 her sister Viola Smith said that Bessies birthday was April 15 1894 That is the date that is on all later documents and was the one that Smith used

She was the daughter of Laura and William Smith William Smith was a laborer and part time Baptist preacher who died before his daughter was old enough to remember him By the time she was nine her mother had died as well and her older sister Viola had to look after for her sisters and brothers 

To earn money for their poor family Smith and her brother Andrew began Busking on the streets of Chattanooga as a duo She sang and danced and he accompanied her on guitar They liked to perform in front of the White Elephant Saloon in the middle of Chattanoogas African American community

In 1904 Smiths oldest brother Clarence ran away from home and joined small traveling troupe owned by Moses Stokes If Bessie had been old enough she would have gone with him said Clarences widow Maud Thats why he left without telling her but Clarence told me she was ready even then Of course she was only a child

In 1912 Clarence came back to Chattanooga with the Stokes troupe and helped Smith get an audition She got a job as a dancer not a singer because the company already had a singer called Ma Rainey

By the early 1920s Smith starred a musical called How Come with Sidney Bechet The musical went to Broadway Smith had an argument with the producer of How Come and she was replaced by Alberta Hunter Smith went back to Philadelphia where she now lived She met and fell in love with a security guard called Jack Gee They got married on June 7 1923 At this time Smith made her first song recordings with Columbia Records Her marriage was difficult and both of them had affairs

Smith became the biggest headliner on the black Theater Owners Booking Association circuit She ran a show that sometimes had as many as 40 people and made her the highest paid black entertainer of her day Gee liked the money she was earning but did not like her show business life In particular he did not like the fact that Smith was bisexual In 1929 Smith found out that Gee was having an affair with another performer called Gertrude Saunders Smith separated from Gee but they never got divorced Smith went to live with a man called Richard Morgan as is they were husband and wife He was an old friend and the uncle of a jazz musician called Lionel Hampton Smith and Morgan stayed together for the rest of her life

Ma Rainey helped Smith to get better as a performer but she did not teach her to sing Smith began started her own act around 1913 at Atlantas 81 Theatre By 1920 she had got a good reputation in the South and along the Eastern Seaboard

In 1920 a singer called Mamie Smith recorded a song called Crazy Blues This was one of the first blues songs recorded by an African American singer and was very popular The recording industry realised that there were lots of black people who would buy blues records Smith was signed by Columbia Records in 1923 when the label decided to make a race records series

Her first recording a coupling of Gulf Coast Blues and Downhearted Blues was very popular Smith became a headliner on the black TOBA circuit and was its top attraction in the 1920s She worked very hard in theatres during the winter and touring for the rest of the year She became the highest paid black entertainer of her day Somebody from Columbia Records gave her a nickname Queen of the Blues Soon the press were calling her the Empress of the Blues 

She made about 160 recordings for Columbia often accompanied by other popular musicians like Louis Armstrong James P Johnson Joe Smith Charlie Green and Fletcher Henderson

On September 26 1937 Smith was seriously injured in a car accident while traveling between Memphis Tennessee and Clarksdale Mississippi Her boyfriend Richard Morgan was driving People think he might have fallen asleep at the wheel or that he could not tell what speed a slow moving truck was driving in front of him Tire marks at the scene showed that Morgan tried not to hit the truck by driving around its left side but he hit the back of the truck side on very fast Smith who was in the passenger seat was hit worst in the crash Morgan did not have any major injuries One of the first people to see her after the crash was a doctor He said that she had a bad injury to her arm which made her lose a lot of blood She also had bad injuries to the side of her body and was in shock

An ambulance took Smith to Clarksdales Afro American Hospital and her right arm was amputated She did not wake up and died that morning After she died some people said that it was because a hospital for white people would not treat her but in those days an amubulance driver would never have taken a black person to a Whites only hospital at all

The SR 71 Blackbird is a supersonic reconnaissance aircraft It was built by Lockheeds Skunk Works in the 1960s for the United States Air Force 

The Blackbird was designed to fly at more than Mach 3 three times the speed of sound This meant it would become very hot during flight To help with this most of the aircraft was made of titanium Radar absorbing material was also used to make the aircraft more difficult to broken wikt linkdetectiondetect

SR 71 Blackbird used a special fuel called JP 7 Before the flight the fuel tanks used to leak This is because at ground altitude the tolerances were larger than at the planes cruising altitude Once in the air because of the speed and air resistance the parts became very hot Because of this heat the distance between the parts shrank stopping the loss of fuel

The aircraft also had cameras and radars fitted to take photographs of targets

The first Blackbird flight happened on 22 December 1964 in Palmdale California In January 1966 the first aircraft entered service with the USAF No aircraft were lost in war but one crashed in an accident in 1969 Only 32 aircraft were built Its final flight was on 6 March 1990 Blackbird SN 61 7972 The SR 71 program was retired from service in 1998

The aircraft flew at an altitude of over 80000 feet and at speeds over 2190 miles per hour It held the world record for the jet powered flight flying at Mach 32 The record was broken in March 2004 by NASAs X 43A aircraft

The SR 71 Blackbird had two crew members It could carry 3500 lb of equipment

The main sequence is a region on a Hertzsprung Russell Diagram where most stars appear Any star that is plotted within that area is a main sequence star The Sun is a main sequence star Most of the stars in the Milky Way galaxy and most other galaxies are also main sequence stars

Hertzsprung Russell diagrams are graphs that measure each stars brightness against its temperature or color The main sequence appears as a band going from the upper left to the lower right You can see an example of the band of main sequence stars to the right

Stars are created from nebula and first appear on the main sequence They stay on the main sequence for millions or billions of years When a star begins to run out of fuel it gets much bigger and colder and turns into a red giant After this happens the star is no longer on the main sequence

In general the hottest and brightest stars also have the most mass The main sequence is sometimes divided into two parts Any star that has a mass greater than 15 times the Suns mass is grouped into the upper main sequence any star with a mass lower than 15 solar masses belongs to the lower main sequence

Stars get the energy they produce through nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium The upper main sequence produces energy by one type of nuclear fusion involving only hydrogen and helium The lower main sequence produces energy by another type of nuclear fusion This type uses other elements with higher atomic numbers as nuclear catalysts

Because of these different types of fusion stars on the lower main sequence last much longer than stars on the upper main sequence Our Sun is located on the lower main sequence and is predicted to last between 10 and 12 billion years A star located on the upper main sequence may only last a few million years

Nowadays a new star may be classified as main sequence strictly by its color A main sequence star of a particular color would have a narrow band of brightness when seen from a standard distance An astronomer could compute the distance to this newly discovered star by comparing its brightness as seen from Earth against the brightness for a certain color on the main sequence

Astrometry is a part of astronomy that has to do with measuring the motion of objects in space such as stars Two main ways to measure these objects are proper motion and parallax

Proper motion is an objects change in position over time when seen from the Earth Just like anything else that moves a stars proper motion is measured by looking towards the same place at different times and seeing how far the star has moved The difference with stars is that from Earth they seem to move very slowly so we have to measure in arcseconds per year When a star has a large proper motion it usually means that it is nearby Barnards Star the star with the largest proper motion only moves 1 degree across the sky in 348 years

Parallax is the apparent difference in position of an object when seen from two or more different places When an object is seen from a new place there is a new line of sight going from the viewer to the object showing a different background in the distance Parallax is measured using the angle between two lines of sight

Parallax can also be used to measure distances to the nearest few thousand stars These distances are measured in parsecs which are equal to about 326 light years

With the sixth season Misiano and Graves were promoted to executive producers Redford and Junge left the production team and Dylan K Massin became a co producer Cahn was promoted to executive story editor and Singer replaced her as story editor Lauren Schmidt filled the staff writer role The fourth episode saw the departure of original crew member Llewellyn Wells Debora Cahn was promoted to co producer with the fourteenth episode

The seventh season saw Noah and ODonnell promoted again this time becoming additional executive producers Attie became a supervising producer Hissrich returned to his role as producer for the final season

The West Wing employed a broad ensemble cast to portray the many positions involved in the daily work of the federal government The President the First Lady and the Presidents senior staff and advisors form the core cast Numerous secondary characters appearing intermittently complement storylines that generally revolve around this core group

Each of the main actors made about 75000 an episode with Sheens most recently confirmed salary being 300000 Rob Lowe also had a six figure salary reported to be 100000 because his character originally was supposed to have a more central role Disparities in cast salaries led to very public contract disputes particularly by Janney Schiff Spencer and Whitford During contract negotiations in 2001 the four were threatened with breach of contract suits by Warner Bros However by banding together they were able to persuade the studio to more than double their salaries Two years later the four again demanded a doubling of their salaries a few months after Warner Bros had signed new licensing deals with NBC and Bravo

John Spencer who played Leo McGarry died from a heart attack on December 16 2005 about a year after his character experienced a nearly fatal heart attack on the show A brief memorial message from Martin Sheen ran before Running Mates the first new episode that aired after Spencers death The loss of Spencers character was addressed by the series beginning with the episode Election Day which aired on April 2 2006

Different performers had been originally considered for many of the roles Bradley Whitford states in an interview on the Season 1 DVD that he was originally cast as Sam though the character of Josh was the role Whitford had wanted and for which he had auditioned In addition Joshs character had been written specifically for him by Aaron Sorkin In the same interview Janel Moloney states that she had originally auditioned for the role of CJ and that the role she eventually received Donna was not meant to be a recurring character Other actors who were seriously considered included Alan Alda and Sidney Poitier for the President Judd Hirsch for Leo Eugene Levy for Toby and CCH Pounder for CJ

The West Wing like many serial dramas stretches storylines over several episodes or entire seasons In addition to these larger storylines each episode also contains smaller arcs which usually begin and end within an episode

Most episodes follow President Bartlet and his staff through particular legislative or political issues Plots can range from behind closed doors negotiating with Congress to personal issues like sex and personal drug use The typical episode loosely follows the president and his staff through their day generally following several plots connected by some idea or theme A large fully connected set of the White House allows the producers to create shots with very few cuts and long continuous master shots of staff members walking and talking through the hallways These walk and talks became a trademark of the show The final two seasons presented a narrative change with the focus of the show divided between plots in the West Wing with President Bartlet and his remaining senior staffers and plots revolving around the rest of the main cast on the campaign trail for the 2006 election

The campaign for the Democratic nomination is extensively addressed In the episodes In the Shadow of Two Gunmen and Bartlet for America flashbacks are used to tell how Bartlet defeated Texas Senator John Hoynes and Washington Senator William Wiley for the Democratic nomination The flashbacks also reveal how Leo McGarry persuaded Bartlet who was then governor of New Hampshire to run for president and how Bartlet ultimately selected John Hoynes as his choice as running mate

The West Wings 2002 presidential election pits Bartlet and Vice President John Hoynes against Florida Governor Robert Ritchie and his running mate Jeff Heston Bartlet faces no known opposition for renomination though Democratic Senator Stackhouse does launch a brief independent campaign for the presidency Ritchie not originally expected to contend for the nomination emerges from a field of seven other Republican candidates by appealing to the partys conservative base with simple homey sound bites

Bartlets staff contemplates replacing Vice President John Hoynes on the ticket with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Percy Fitzwallace among others After it is clear that Ritchie will be the Republican nominee Bartlet dismisses the idea declaring that he wants Hoynes in the number two spot because of four words which he writes down and hands to his staffers to read Because I could die

Throughout the season it is anticipated that the race will be close but a stellar performance by Bartlet in the sole debate between the candidates helps give Bartlet a landslide victory in both the popular and electoral vote

A speed up in The West Wings timeline in part due to the expiration of many cast members contracts and a desire to continue the program with lower production costs resulted in the omission of the 2004 midterm elections and an election during the seventh season The sixth season extensively details the Democratic and Republican primaries The seventh season covers the lead up to the general election the election and the transition to a new administration The timeline slows down to concentrate on the general election race The election normally held in November takes place across two episodes originally broadcast on April 2 and April 9 2006

Congressman Matt Santos is nominated on the fourth ballot at the Democratic National Convention during the sixth season finale Santos was planning to leave Congress before being recruited to run for the presidency by Josh Lyman Santos polled in the low single digits in the Iowa caucus and was virtually out of the running in the New Hampshire primary before a last ditch direct television appeal vaults him to a third place finish with 19 of the vote Josh Lyman Santoss campaign manager convinces Leo McGarry to become Santos running mate

Senator Arnold Vinick secures the Republican nomination defeating Glen Allen Walken and the Reverend Don Butler among others Initially Vinick wants Butler to become his running mate However Butler does not want to be considered because of Vinicks stance on abortion Instead West Virginia Governor Ray Sullivan is chosen as Vinicks running mate Vinick is portrayed throughout the sixth season as virtually unbeatable because of his popularity in California a typically Democratic state his moderate views and his wide crossover appeal Vinick however faces difficulty with the pro life members of his party as a pro choice candidate and criticism for his support of nuclear power following a serious accident at a Californian nuclear power station

On the evening of the election Leo McGarry suffers a massive heart attack and is pronounced dead at the hospital with the polls still open on the West Coast The Santos campaign releases the information immediately while Arnold Vinick refuses to use Leos death as a stepstool to the presidency Santos emerges as the winner in his home state of Texas while Vinick wins his home state of California The election comes down to Nevada where both candidates need a victory to secure the presidency Vinick tells his staff repeatedly that he will not allow his campaign to demand a recount of the votes if Santos is declared the winner Josh Lyman is seen giving Santos the same advice although the Santos campaign does send a team of lawyers down to Nevada Santos is pronounced the winner of the election having won Nevada by 30000 votes with an electoral margin of 272266

Lichens are a symbiosis of at least two quite different organisms The partnership always involves a fungus which lives with one or more partners which can do photosynthesis The photobiont partner may be a green alga andor a cyanobacteriump56 13 

The algae or bacteria live inside the fungus and exchange nutrients with it The lichen is different in shape and mode of life from any of the partners It is a distinct form of life Botanists did not know this until about 1875

Lichens pose a problem for biological classification because the three types of organism concerned come from three different kingdoms After long debate lichen are now classified as fungi under the genus and species of the host fungusp4748 This allows specimens to be put into boxes and labelled By having specific names researchers know what they are working on that is one of the basic functions of taxonomy The system still has its problems In those fungi which may associate either with an alga or with a cyanobacterium the resulting forms may look quite different yet are now referred to by the same namep13

20 of fungal species live in lichens Lichen fungi belong to several different groups of fungi Most common are Ascomycetes which produce spores in a sac shaped container the ascus Only a few types of alga occur within lichens these algae also have their own names Algae may be sometimes the dominant partner in so called jelly lichens Collema and Leptogium but this is rare More usually the algae are the green alga Trebouxia Other species are the orange Trentepohli and the cyanobacterium Nostocp910

Lichens can occur anywhere on land and some can live in aquatic environments The nearest rock wall or roof probably has lichen on it Often the lichen is mat like and clings to the surface Some are like little bushes see the photos Lichens are famous for not needing a regular supply of water their metabolism can go into suspension and later revive When growing on mineral surfaces some lichens slowly break down the substrate and extract tiny amounts of mineral nutrient Fungi form the main part of the thallus with the photobiont contributing 20 or lessp17 The photobiont is usually on the inside of the thallus

Lichen thalli may grow together and fuse and this may happen between different species and generap23 These are called mechanical hybrids and may be seen when the two forms are differently coloured 

Lichen do survive extreme conditions They are found in some of the most extreme places on Earth the frozen north hot deserts rocky coasts They are common as epiphytes on leaves and branches in rain forests and temperate woods They can live on bare rock walls and gravestones and on exposed soil surfacesp19 There are about 200 different kinds of lichens in Antarctica In the Horlick Mountains at 86 degrees south there are six different kinds of lichen In the Himalayas they grow at altitudes up to 18000 feetp216 

The European Space Agency discovered that lichen can survive unprotected in space Two species of lichen were sealed in a capsule and launched on a Russian Soyuz rocket Once in orbit the capsules were opened Two species of lichen were exposed to the vacuum of space to cosmic radiation and huge swings of temperature After 15 days the lichens were retrieved and were found to be in full health no damage was found

There are a huge number of lichen species in rainforests far outnumbering flowering plants The lichen are mostly epiphytes living on trees A single site in Costa Rica yielded about 300 species of lichen on leaves in the understory of the rain forest a single fallen Elaeocarpus tree in New Guinea held 173 species the evergreen laurel Ocotea atirrensis was found with 5080 lichen species on a single leafp6061

When partnerships are very close it is difficult to assign benefits to either partner Their success is as a pair Sometimes the partners can exist as separate organisms certainly their close relatives can Probably most of the algae and all of the cyanobacteria can survive though in more restricted habitats The details vary according to the specific species or strains involved The man who first realised the nature of lichen Simon Schwedener thought of the partnership as one of controlled parasitism Obviously the photobiont provides photosynthetic products carbohydrates as sugar alcohols or glucose The bacteria also convert atmospheric nitrogen to ammonium ions which the fungus can use in amino acids for proteinsp26 

The alga certainly benefits from a supply of water There is also general mechanical protection Algae get protection from ultraviolet light which in some environments is quite significant Probably algae get access to the minute amounts of minerals which the fungus gets from the substrate or from dust settling on the thallus Algal cells are sometimes destroyed in the course of nutrient exchange though the algal cells divide and replace them Above all the partnership is a resounding success and gets to places where few other plants can survive

Many lichens reproduce without sex They make small groups of algal cells surrounded by fungal filaments These soridia can be blown by wind Some lichens just break up into fragments when they dry Wind carries the pieces which grow when moisture returns Also lichen fungi can reproduce sexually by forming fruiting bodies containing spores These fruiting bodies are usually perennial and may be long lasing some in the Swiss Alps have lived for over 50 years After dispersal by wind such fungal spores must meet with an algal partner to form a lichenp1922

The fossil record for lichen dates back 400 million year for certain and the signs are that earlier forms existed 600 million years ago They must have been one of the earliest life forms on land It is thought from the number of fungal and algal species involved that the symbiosis must have taken place many times between different speciesp46

It has been suggested that some or all of the Ediacaran biota might be lichen The proposal has been received with some skepticism

Many lichen are sensitive to changes around them For this reason they are used by scientists to show changes in the environment such as air pollution ozone depletion and metal contamination Lichens have also been used to make dyes perfumes and herbal medicines

Some lichen produce natural antibiotics that kill bacteria Humans have used these compounds as natural antibiotics Extracts from many Usnea species were used to treat wounds in Russia in the mid twentieth century

The map lichen Rhizocarpon geographicum grows extremely slowly and can reach an age of over 1000 years It may be used for dating the diameter of the largest lichen of a species on a rock surface shows the time that the rock has been exposed

Lichen are the main winter food for reindeer The deer can get at shrubby lichen under the snow In summer they have much more choice of food Some lichen are edible by humans too A kind of lichen which is called Iwatake in Japanese and Seogi in Korean language is collected from cliffs and used in various Korean and Japanese foods Lichen have a high level of acid Care must be taken as there are at least two kinds of lichen that are toxic

The bacterial or algal partners produce pigments that absorb sunlight in photosynthesis There are reports dating back almost 2000 years of purple and red colours being extracted from lichens Lichens of the family Roccellaceae are commonly called orchella weed or orchil They have been important in history because they could supply Orcein a dye Today dyes based on lichens have largely been replaced by synthetic ones The pH indicator litmus is a dye extracted from the lichen genus Rocella tinctoria by boiling

The history of the Earth describes the most important events and fundamental stages in the development of the planet Earth from its formation to the present day 

The age of the Earth is about 456 billion years Nearly all branches of science have helped us understand the main events of the Earths past The Earth is about one third the age of the universe

The formation of Earth occurred as part of the formation of the Solar System It started as a large rotating cloud of dust and gas This cloud the solar nebula was composed of hydrogen and helium produced in the Big Bang as well as heavier elements produced in supernovas Then about 468109 years ago the solar nebula began to contract rotate and gain angular momentum This may have been triggered by a star in the region exploding as a supernova and sending a shock wave through the solar nebula 

As the cloud rotated it became a flat disc perpendicular to its axis of rotation Most of the mass concentrated in the middle and began to heat up Meanwhile the rest of the disc began to break up into rings with gravity causing matter to condense around dust particles Small fragments collided to become larger fragments including one collection about 150 million kilometers from the center this would become the Earth As the Sun condensed and heated nuclear fusion started and the solar wind cleared out most of the material in the disc which had not yet condensed into larger bodies

The Earths relatively large natural satellite the Moon is unique During the Apollo program rocks from the Moons surface were brought to Earth Radiometric dating of these rocks has shown the Moon to be 4527 10 million years old about 30 to 55 million years younger than other bodies in the solar system New evidence suggests the Moon formed even later 448002Ga or 70110Ma after the start of the Solar System Another notable feature is the relatively low density of the Moon which must mean it does not have a large metallic core like all other terrestrial bodies in the solar system The Moon has a bulk composition closely resembling the Earths mantle and crust together without the Earths core This has led to the giant impact hypothesis the idea that the Moon was formed during a giant impact of the proto Earth with another protoplanet

The impactor sometimes named Theia is thought to have been a little smaller than the current planet Mars Theia finally collided with Earth about 4533 Ga Models reveal that when an impactor this size struck the proto Earth at a low angle and relatively low speed much material from the mantles of the proto Earth and the impactor was ejected into space where much of it stayed in orbit around the Earth This material would eventually form the Moon However the metallic cores of the impactor would have sunk through the Earths mantle to fuse with the Earths core depleting the Moon of metallic material The giant impact hypothesis thus explains the Moons abnormal composition The ejecta in orbit around the Earth could have condensed into a single body within a couple of weeks Under the influence of its own gravity the ejected material became a more spherical body the Moon

The radiometric ages show the Earth existed already for at least 10 million years before the impact enough time to allow for differentiation of the Earths primitive mantle and core Then when the impact occurred only material from the mantle was ejected leaving the Earths core of heavy elements untouched

The impact had some important consequences for the young Earth It released a enormous amount of energy causing both the Earth and Moon to be completely molten Immediately after the impact the Earths mantle was vigorously convecting the surface was a large magma ocean The planets first atmosphere must have been completely blown away by the enormous amount of energy released The impact is also thought to have changed Earths axis to produce the large 235 axial tilt that is responsible for Earths seasons It may also have sped up Earths rotation

At the beginning of the Archean the Earths heat flow was nearly three times higher than it is today and was still twice the current level by the beginning of the Proterozoic Thus tectonic and volcanic activity were considerably more active than they are today the Earths crust was not only thinner than is today but probably broken up into many more tectonic plates with numerous hot spots rift valleys and transform faults The existence of plate tectonics in this eon is disputed it is an active area of modern researchp297 302

There were no large continents until late in the Archean small protocontinents were the norm prevented from coalescing into larger units by the high rate of geologic activity These felsic protocontinents probably formed at hot spots rather than subduction zones from a variety of sources mafic magma melting more felsic rocks partial melting of mafic rock and from the metamorphic alteration of felsic sedimentary rocksp297 301 

The Archean atmosphere apparently lacked free oxygen Temperatures appear to have been near modern levels although astronomers think that the sun was about one third dimmer This is thought to reflect larger amounts of greenhouse gases than later in Earth history

Archean geology The oldest rock formations exposed on the surface of the Earth are Archean or slightly older Archean rocks are known from Greenland the Canadian Shield western Australia and southern Africa Although the first continents formed during this eon rock this age makes up only 7 of the worlds current cratons even allowing for erosion and destruction of past formations evidence suggests that only 5 40 of the present continental crust formed during the Archeanp301

In contrast to the Proterozoic Archean rocks are often heavily metamorphized deep water sediments such as greywackes mudstones volcanic sediments and banded iron formations Greenstone belts are typical Archean formations consisting of alternating high and low grade metamorphic rocks The high grade rocks were derived from volcanic island arcs while the low grade metamorphic rocks represent deep sea sediments eroded from from the neighboring island arcs and deposited in a forearc basin In short greenstone belts represent sutured protocontinentsp302 3

Fossils of cyanobacterial mats are found throughout the Archeanbecoming especially common late in the eonwhile a few other probable bacterial fossils are known from chert bedsp307 In addition to bacteria microfossils of the extremophilic archaea have also been identified 

There are no known eukaryote fossilsp306 323 No fossil evidence yet exists for viruses

The geologic record of the Proterozoic is much better than that for the preceding Archean In contrast to the deep water deposits of the Archean the Proterozoic features many strata that were laid down in extensive shallow epicontinental seas furthermore many of these rocks are less metamorphosed than Archean age ones and plenty are in fact unalteredp315 Study of these rocks show that the eon featured rapid continental accretion supercontinent cycles and wholly modern orogenic activityp3158 32932

The first known glaciations occurred during the Proterozoic One ice age began shortly after the beginning of the eon There were at least four during the Neoproterozoic climaxing with the Snowball Earth of the Varangian glaciationp320 325

One of the most important events of the Proterozoic was the accumulation of oxygen in the Earths atmosphere Though oxygen was undoubtedly released by photosynthesis well back in Archean times it could not build up to any significant degree until chemical sinks unoxidized sulfur and iron had been filled until roughly 23 billion years ago oxygen was probably only 1 to 2 of its current level Banded iron formations which provide most of the worlds iron ore were also a prominent chemical sink most accumulation ceased after 19 billion years ago either due to an increase in oxygen or a more thorough mixing of the oceanic water columnp324

Red beds which are coloured by haematite indicate an increase in atmospheric oxygen after 2 billion years ago they are not found in older rocks The oxygen build up was probably due to two factors a filling of the chemical sinks and an increase in carbon burial which stored organic compounds which would have otherwise been oxidized by the atmospherep325

The first advanced single celled and multi cellular life roughly coincides with the oxygen accumulation this may have been due to an increase in the oxidized nitrates that eukaryotes use as opposed to cyanobacteria It was also during the Proterozoic that the first symbiotic relationship between mitochondria and chloroplasts and their hosts evolvedp321 2

Eukaryotes such as acritarchs blossomed as did cyanobacteria in fact stromatolites reached their greatest abundance and diversity during the Proterozoic peaking roughly 12 billion years ago321 3

Classically the boundary between the Proterozoic and the Paleozoic was set at the base of the Cambrian period when the first fossils of animals known as trilobites appeared In the second half of the 20th century a number of fossil forms have been found in Proterozoic rocks but the boundary of the Proterozoic has remained fixed at the base of the Cambrian  currently placed at 542 Ma

The Paleozoic covers the time from the first appearance of abundant hard shelled fossils to the time when the continents were beginning to be dominated by large relatively sophisticated reptiles and relatively modern plants 

The upper boundary is set at a major extinction event 250 million years later known as the PermianTriassic extinction event Modern practice sets the older boundary at the first appearance of a distinctive trace fossil called Phycodes pedum

Geologically the Paleozoic starts shortly after the breakup of a supercontinent called Rodinia and at the end of a global ice age Throughout the early Palaeozoic the Earths landmass was broken up into a substantial number of relatively small continents Toward the end of the era the continents gathered together into a supercontinent called Pangaea which included most of the Earths land area

At the start of the era life was confined to bacteria algae sponges and a variety of somewhat enigmatic forms known collectively as the Ediacaran fauna A large number of body plans appeared nearly simultaneously at the start of the eraa phenomenon known as the Cambrian Explosion 

There is some evidence that simple life may already have invaded the land at the start of the Palaeozoic but substantial plants and animals did not take to the land until the Silurian and did not thrive until the Devonian Although primitive vertebrates are known near the start of the Palaeozoic animal forms were dominated by invertebrates until the mid Palaeozoic Fish populations exploded in the Devonian During the late Palaeozoic great forests of primitive plants thrived on land forming the great coal beds of Europe and eastern North America By the end of the era the first large sophisticated reptiles and the first modern plants had developed

The Mesozoic covers the time when life was dominated by large sophisticated reptiles The lower boundary is set by the PTr extinction event The upper boundary is set at the KT extinction event

Geologically the Mesozoic starts with almost all the Earths land collected into a supercontinent called Pangaea During the era Pangaea split into the northern continent Laurasia and the southern continent Gondwana Laurasia then split into North America and Eurasia Gondwana broke up progressively into continents South America Africa Madagascar India Australia and Antarctica

The Mesozoic is known as the Age of Dinosaurs It also saw the development of early birds and mammals and of flowering plants At the end of the Mesozoic all the major body plans of modern life were in place although in some casesnotably the mammalsthe forms that existed at the end of the Cretaceous were relatively primitive

The Cainozoic is the age of mammals During the Cainozoic mammals diverged from a few small simple generalized forms into a diverse collection of terrestrial marine and flying animals Flowering plants and birds also evolved substantially in the Cainozoic 

Geologically the Cainozoic is the era when continents moved into their current positions Africa and Australasia split from Gondwana to drift north and India collided with Southeast Asia Antarctica moved into its current position over the South Pole the Atlantic Ocean widened and late in the era South America became attached to North America

Ja vi elsker dette landet in English Yes we love this country is the Norwegian national anthem 

It is commonly referred to as only Ja vi elsker Yes we love The lyrics were written by Bjrnstjerne Bjrnson and melody by his cousin Rikard Nordraak

The first verse goes like this

 Ja vi elsker dette landet som det stiger frem furet vrbitt over vannet med de tusen hjem elsker elsker det og tenker p vr far og mor p den saganatt som senker  drmmer p vr jord p den saganatt som senker senker drmmer p vr jord 

Roughly translated to English

 Yes we love this country as it rises forth wrinkled weather beaten over the water with the thousand homes loving it loving it and thinking of our father and mother of the saga night that lowers dreams upon our earth of the saga night that lowers lowers dreams upon our earth 

Atoms are made up of one or more small mass particles called Nucleons However the weight of an atom is not just a simple multiple number equal to the number of nucleons but rather a number related to the number of nucleons plus a second quantity related to the numerical value of the amount of free energy that the free neutron kept after it dropped into the energy sink made by the gradual build up of the atoms other nucleons And since we are using the value of 12 for the mass of an atom of 6C12 and since that number also has an amount of remaining free energy The mass number of the atoms of the other elements varies around the nucleon number and can be more or less than that value

Atomic mass numbers are important values used to measure the relative stability and capability of atomic change of atoms in nuclear physics considerations The CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics lists these numbers as do other publications The mass number is also the amount of protons and neutrons added together

Waltzing Matilda is one of Australias best known songs The bush ballad a country folk song has been called the unofficial national anthem of Australia The title Waltzing Matilda is Australian slang for walking through the country looking for work with ones goods in a Matilda carried over ones back

The song tells the story of a traveling farm worker making a drink of tea at a bush camp and capturing a sheep to eat When the sheeps owner arrives with three policemen to arrest the worker for taking the sheep the worker drowns himself in a small watering hole The workers ghost stays to haunt the site

The words to the song were written in 1895 by a poet and nationalist Banjo Paterson It was first printed as sheet music in 1903 There are many stories about the song and how it was written The song has its own museum the Waltzing Matilda Centre in Winton Queensland

The music based on a folk song was written by Christina Macpherson Paterson wrote the words while staying at the Dagworth Homestead farm in Queensland While he was there the owners played him an old Celtic folk tune called The Craigeelee Paterson decided that it would be a good tune to write words for and completed during his stay at the farm

The tune is probably the Scottish song Thou Bonnie Wood Of Craigielea which Macpherson heard played by a band at the Warrnambool steeplechase Robert Tannahill wrote the words in 1805 and James Barr wrote the music in 1818 In 1893 it was arranged for brass band by Thomas Bulch The tune may have been based on the melody of Go to the Devil and Shake Yourself written by John Field sometime before 1812 It is sometimes also called When Sick Is It Tea You Want or The Penniless Traveller

There is also an idea that tune may be similar to The Bold Fusilier a song sung to the same tune and dated by some back to the eighteenth century but first printed in 1900

A bold fusilier came marching back through Rochester Off from the wars in the north country And he sang as he marched Through the crowded streets of Rochester Wholl be a soldier for Marlboro and me

Waltzing Matilda Waltzing Matilda Youll come a Waltzing Matilda with me And he sang as he shoved that jumbuck in his tucker bag Youll come a Waltzing Matilda with me

Just to keep the other admins informed Ive made some adjustments for the placement of VGA stubs and the mainpage per the discussion on ST on the misplaced stubs subpages in the article space Best NonvocalScream 1919 12 September 2009

Just a general note to all my fellow administrators if Im online and Ive done something and you disagree with me please do stop by my talk page I think you might find me willing to explain why Ive done what Ive done or I can undo myself I will do you the same respect  Please dont revert me cause it means Ive no trust I thank you for your thought and consideration on this matter Very respectfully NonvocalScream 0057 13 September 2009

Per the recent recreation of my user page as an attack could a sysop please salt it Thanks Javert 0729 13 September 2009

Many of you know weve had a user who edits via IPs and makes typically POV edits about Pakistan In particular articles in the form of Pakistan Other nation relations are common unsourced and often not simple Could we form consensus on how to approach this editor I can think of essentially two options 1 we review all edits individually as we have done before and keepdelete appropriately or 2 we agree to community ban this editor and nuke all contribs on sight The second option is extreme but we have enough work making good articles about Apples and the colour Orange without needing to sift through these In particular see the edits by user92311190 for an example of what I am referring to Comments appreciated EhJJTALK 1548 12 September 2009 Ok I know Im fairly new here so obviously have a slightly quieter voice but reading this thread just raised my blood pressure a bit I was about to offer to go through all of the contributions to see what needed to be deleted and what could just be brought into compliance Doing this would also allow us to try and figure out if we could work with the guy or if that was improbable He appears to be working with good faith and I believe anyone who is doing so should be treated with respect If they are doing things we dont like and see as a problem for the project then I feel we have an obligation to try and work with them and help them to understand our concerns In the end even if we decide that we will be unable to work them because of unresolvable issues then a Ban is the worst we should do unless at some point the user goes from a good faith vandal to a bad one SpecialNuke should only be used as a last resort option for obvious and unquestionable vandals I believe it is inappropriate for anyone who even COULD be offering legitimate content

That being said I do not believe there was any form of consensus in the discussion above There were 2 people who wanted to work with the individual and 3 people who wanted to get rid of them It was also a discussion that has been open for less then 3 hours before it was marked done When we are discussing a total ban of a user from the project I can not think of any appropriate time to close a discussion within 3 hours even if a consensus HAD been formed I had just found this thread and was going to respond when I noticed the 2nd part of the discussion and just ended up confused 

Is there an UnNuke feature If there is I would like to ask another admin to reverse NonvocalScreams actions until we are able to finish the discussion I would also really like to here why Scream felt this was important enough to act so quickly on Jamesofur 2252 12 September 2009Ok very basically

That being said there are also some positive points

So in very short If you want to try to establish communication please go ahead Also note that blocking the editor so far has shown little effect he has been back after the block expired If we could establish communication I could see the a GA on a Pakistan related topic on the horizon I cannot help with history and knowledge but I am prepared to review articles to point out what they still need and to some extent help fix the issues involved Anyway in the last discussions I have always shown some bias to one side so I think it would probably be good to get uninvolved perspectives  Eptalon 1012 13 September 2009

Ok this was made easier because I have less desire to provide a lot of links since Eptalon was great and provided them while I was writing I totally understand why people are frustrated by this editor but to be honest Im torn As a project we want as much of the best content we can get Preferably we have a wide variety of topics from around the globe We also are the encyclopedia that anyone can edit though of course anyone is going to be understandably limited when it comes to people who are being disruptive 

The honest fact is that even after going through all the discussions and most if not all of the guys contributions spread out over an amazing amount of IPs I am STILL not comfortable just labeling him as a vandal Looking through the articles on Pakistan there is some very good material that has been added by what appears to be the same person Adding images like is a great example of something that added to the encyclopedia and likely wouldnt have been done in any timely fashion by someone else pictures like that are great for Simple

While Im still not totally sure about his faith with everything it is clear that YES he hasis causedcausing disruption within the project It is quite clear he pushes one POV over and over again I am fairly certain that the editor is the same editor who corrects thing across a broad spectrum of wikis that I have seen in the past couple weeks doing SWMT work Unfortunately that makes it quite likely that it is a DRIVING force behind his edits which makes me sad because it makes it much less likely that we will get him to change The amount of discussion about the problem with no conclusion outreach to the IPs without resolution and warnings regarding the conduct without change concern me especially given my disbelief that he does not understand at least some of what is said to him given his location I also agree that it appears to be one person or at the very least interrelated people given that every single ip geolocates to similar locations within the UK 

I think its high time this was resolved as much as possibleI absolutely abhor the idea of protecting all of the pages under a long standing belief that IPs should be able to edit as freely as possible That doesnt mean I dont understand the desire to do it since it is much easier then blocking every new IP that pops up I do think that if you wanted to do this correctly it would be an enormous amount of protections and filter changes It is also quite clear that the user changes IPs frequently and those IPs are all over the spectrum it would be futile to try and range block them all The other issue is that despite what we chose to do we need to cull through basically every article that mentions PakistanKashmir and decide what is notable enough to keep as an article and cull out POV crap that is everywhere Hopefully this can be done by multiple people because it will not be a short task

Obviously anyone can make additional proposals but these are the options I see

1 Ignore it completely let them edit  obviously not really an option

2 Let them edit but cull through everything they add and make sure it works in the project  I think would quickly result in burn out by those involved in the editing and would likely result in the user getting angry and becoming more of a normal vandal

3 Revert vandalism and warn user as we see it  basically what I see as the status quo weve seen that this lets a lot fall through the cracks that isnt seen by the vandalism patrollers Agree to the terms of a ban preferably terms that we think will be as easy as possible for admins to enforce 

b Agree on terms to offer to the IP to allow them to continue

c Agree on concrete triggers that repeal the offer and begin the full Ban immediately

d Offer the terms on the currently banned IPs talk page along with hopefully a link to talk on IRC since most of us are there

e follow through if we make contact follow through with that and try to work with them If we dont make contact or they dont listen then regrettably a ban it is A ban agreed upon by the community and enforced until the community agrees to remove it

Ok enough rambling on this topic for now Please let me know what you think in the end thats what matters Im just one outspoken and verbose wikipedian Jamesofur 1628 13 September 2009

May I have uninvolved administrators to please look into the problematic editing on laPeter Ham Im not speaking of the content dispute but the content itself and the editing history of user2CalUpswing with regards to referencing POV and singular purpose Thank you for your time NonvocalScream 1227 15 September 2009

Hi all I want to request an indef semi protection of laAdolf Hitler The article is from time to time the victim of vandalism I think it is not needed that IPs edit this topic All recent IP and newbie edits are vandalism I dont want to set the protection due to my COI Thanks Barras 0919 10 September 2009

I wandered by this site the other day and it seems that hard banned user Bambifan101 aka The Disney Anon and The Disney Vandal has been hard at work here over the last several months adding and editing articles via his shifting BellSouth IP in Mobile Alabama He is literally all over this site re Disney films and features and Ive been spending the last ten minutes or so tagging some of his creations for speedy deletion I have admin rights on English but not here or Id handle these myself He also knows better than to show his face over there because I and several other users are on the lookout May I impose on someone to please please just delete this idiots entries Perhaps hell get the message and leave Otherwise hes just laughing in our faces Thanks for letting me rant  PMDrive1061 1911 25 September 2009

If they come back as BellSouth in Mobile its him without question Ive blocked him more times than I can count over at the other site and virtually all of the anon IPs come back as BellSouth Those which do not render back to BellSouth at least render back to the general geographic area En wiki basically states that any creation by a hard banned user whether its useful or not may be deleted In all honesty there have been edits to most of the articles I tagged which on English generally means they become keepers This person is a special case having spent more than three years trashing this site and English as well Im not for a de facto deletion of a good article but I am in favor of sending this nut a clear message I honestly believe hes autistic given his dogged single minded edit habits Add to that a dynamic IP and voila Tons of cleanup work  PMDrive1061 2015 25 September 2009

Anything is better than nothing If you check my talk page over at English a user just alerted me to a sock which I failed to block and sure enough its BellSouth Heres the link to my page  Believe me Im more than happy to block him at English and blow the whistle over here Check out that um conversation between he and I on his most recent socks talk page  PMDrive1061 2025 25 September 2009

Articles which are simply copied from enwiki with little sign of simplification are clearly deletable under speedy criteria Secondly typically we delete or revert edits by banned editors no matter what This was always intended to discourage banned editors from attempting to continue to edit Majorly you said we removed the speedy criteria for banned accounts  can you clarify this or point me to the discussion please Cheers The Rambling Man 1557 26 September 2009

I must say PMDrive that I strongly suspect that every time you make a fuss about Bambifan and draw attention to him on threads such as this he will be laughing in our faces as you put it He probably loves it when you bring him up here I also expect he gets a thrill when we delete his articles Ive not seen any convincing argument as to why we should delete articles based on who wrote them if they meet our policies Deleting such articles is pure wikipolitics and against the interests of an encyclopedia anyone can edit All it achieves is drawing attention to him Majorly talk 1749 26 September 2009

  Im going to bed Ive been up to long and just had an enormous exam and have work tonight Please wait we seem to jump to fast sometimesAlso good articles are good articles If there bad they should be deleted regardless of who made them if they are a new editor who means well we should try to work with them if their Bambi we should hit them over the head with a shovelJamesofur 1814 26 September 2009

PS If anyones interested the last talk page discussion I had with this individual prior to its being blocked is here  Hes unhinged pure and simple and heaven help me I will never get involved in trying to reason with him again  PMDrive1061 1654 27 September 2009

Weve talked about these guys on IRC a couple times and sort of brushed it off but I wanted to bring it up here so that more could see and comment and for mostly a heads up There is a set of what appears to be 3 accounts UserDkes UserNapoleon and UserNapless who appear that they could be related Both Dkes and Napoleon were created on the same day about 6 hours apart Napoleon was created and started editing at 0245 Dkes was created and started editing the same pages at 0818 about 20 minutes or so after Napoleon stopped for the day Napless was created on the 21st and proceeded to edit the same pages Since then they have basically gone in cycles Napoleon Dkes Napless never at the same time always the same articles and writing style and almost always in that order So far there has not been any real oddness and so even if they are socks there really isnt a reason to block them but was just a little weird Well no oddness until httpsimplewikipediaorgwindexphptitleWikipediaVerygoodarticlesGeishadiffnextoldid1761462 today Jamesofur 0936 29 September 2009

In 1996 when the band finished recording their demo album Mate Feed Kill Repeat Slipknot saw its first line up change when guitarist Donnie Steele left the band and was replaced by Craig Jones Shortly after drummer Jordison said they needed a full time sampler and Jones took the position as he liked doing that anyway Mick Thomson then joined the band to be the new guitarist After Mate Feed Kill Repeat was released the band were working on new songs which needed more singing melody and the then lead singer Colsefini had a hard time with this In 1997 Corey Taylor was asked to join the band and after practicing with Slipknot everything just clicked Because of that Colsefini was moved to backing vocals and percussion However Colsefini was unhappy with his new role and left the band a month later

Since the band wanted to keep their percussive sound Greg Welts joined the band to replace Colsefini Towards the end of 1997 each band member picked an a number to identify themselves In 1998 Welts became the only member to be kicked out of the band and he was replaced by Chris Fehn Slipknot wanted to have a DJ in the band but had a hard time finding one because the people they knew who were DJs all sucked Sid Wilson approached the band after seeing them live He proceeded to impress the band with his ability and his antics Wilson was considered Slipknot material and his hiring brought the bands line up to nine members The final change in the bands line up came at the latter stages of the recording process of the bands debut album Slipknot in 1999 While the band took a break from recording the album Brainard decided to leave the band and was replaced by Jim Root

The Pauli exclusion principle refers to the fact that certain particles cannot be at the same place at the same time with the same energy Only fermions are bound by the Pauli exclusion principle while bosons are not A more precise way to describe the Pauli exclusion principle is to say that two of the same kind of fermions cannot have the same quantum numbers This principle was discovered by physicist Wolfgang Pauli in 1925 It is a very important principle in physics because the particles that make up ordinary matter are fermions

The anthropic principle is a principle that says that the universe is how it is because it must allow for the eventual creation of us as observers The anthropic principle was thought of in 1974 by the astronomer Brandon Carter

There are two different kinds of anthropic principles the weak anthropic principle and the strong anthropic principle

The original thoughts that Brandon Carter had were Weak anthropic principle We must be prepared to take into account the fact that our location in the universe is necessarily privileged to the extent of being compatible with our existence as observers

Strong anthropic principle The Universe must be such as to admit the creations of observers within it at some stage

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution shortened in Chinese as or also known simply as the Cultural Revolution was a time of large cultural change in China started by the leader Mao Zedong It happened from 1966 to 1976

The start of the Cultural Revolution was when Mao tried to remove capitalists from the Communist Party of China the party in charge of China To try and get rid of the capitalists he started the Socialist Education Movement It started in 1962 and ended in 1965 At the same time a redoing of the school system made sure that students were able to also work in factories and broken wikt linkcommunecommunes Mao slowly started to regain power in 1965 supported by Lin Biao Jiang Qing and Chen Boda

The Communist Party was split between Maos partners and Deng Xiaopings partners Deng Xiaoping was a rival of Mao Mao then tried to get support from young people in China by creating the book Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong a collection of Maos sayings The Red Guard was also made popular They were a group of young people in China that went around teaching Maos sayings They also beat people who disagreed with Mao and destroyed homes and museums There were many fights breaking out and China faced anarchy During the revolution several important people in China were forced to leave These people included Liu Shao chi head of state and Teng Hsiao ping the secretary general of the Communist Party of China

The Cultural Revolution began to slow down in 1967 and ended in 1969  The Ninth National Party Congress was a meeting where the end of the Cultural Revolution was announced

The Cultural Revolution caused a lot of problems in China Production in factories was lowered because of the workers political activities It was also lowered because the people put in charge of the factories did not know how to run them Transportation was made worse because a lot of trains were being used to take Red Guards around the country Many scientists and engineers were put in jail or sent to work on the farms which meant that their knowledge was lost Because of these changes the industrial output of China was reduced by 14 percent

The education of many Chinese people was also cut short The education system was more broken wikt linkdisrupteddisrupted in the cities than in the countryside Universities and many schools were closed A program called the sent down youth program also disrupted education In that program children were sent from the cities to the countryside



The club formed from a merger of two football clubs EC Pinheiros and Colorado EC in 1989

The Great Leap Forward was a plan that was created to increase Chinas economy and industry It was started by the Communist leader Chairman Mao Zedong in 1957 and ended in 1960 The Great Leap Forward was bad for the Chinese people as it ended up with many people dead Some people think it to be the biggest famine in history

Mao wanted China to be able to make food for the country and make food to export he also wanted China to produce a lot of goods He started the Great Leap Forward to do this Some people were forced to give their land to the government Many people had to work on farms for the government also called agricultural cooperatives Later these cooperatives were put together to involve thousands of people In 1958 ninety eight percent of people who worked on farms were in these cooperatives

In 1958 there was a good harvest However this began to change the year after

People believed that planting plants close together was good They thought this because Stalin thought so too However crops did not grow as well when they were close together This led to lower grain harvests in 1959 After that the harvests were bad also because resources were not used well This lasted at least until 1961

The change in China was put on a schedule Mao wanted China to have a greater industrial output than Britain in fifteen years He later shortened this to one year If people did not like the fast pace of the schedule they were usually killed By 1958 550000 people were killed because they did not agree with the government

Because the government spent a lot of money on industry the country increased its debt Many people wanted to help the government meet its goals so they would build furnaces in their backyard They would then try to make iron for tools However this did not work very well People ended up melting good things turning them into unusable things

Leaders competed with each other to see who could make the most things This led the farms to be forgotten Leaders would also lie about the amount of crops being grown They would tell the government that they were making more than they actually were In 1959 the country began running out of food This is because they sold their grain to other countries This problem was made worse because the output of farms was decreasing People were also not allowed to leave the areas they were living in That meant that they could not look for food in other places Some villages had one fourth or one third of people dying in them Girls and old people were underfed Infants and the very old were the first to die

The famine is thought to have killed between 165 million and 40 million people

The government tried to stop the famine by canceling orders for technology Instead they imported food for people to eat However the economy of China continued to fall after the end of the Great Leap Forward Workers were stressed and the Soviet Union took away its support of China

The Legacy was a professional wrestling heel stable on World Wrestling Entertainments Raw brand that consisted of Randy Orton Ted DiBiase Jr Cody Rhodes and former members Sim Snuka and Manu The stable was founded at Night of Champions when Cody Rhodes turned on Hardcore Holly forming Priceless with Ted DiBiase Jr Legacy held the WWE Tag Team Championship twice with Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase holding the titles on two separate occasions 

The roots of the team started December 10 2007 on the Raw 15th anniversary when Cody Rhodes and Hardcore Holly defeated Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch for the World Tag Team Championship They retained the championship in many matches against fellow tag teams such as Carlito and Santino Marella and Paul London and Brian Kendrick

Rhodes and Holly would then enter a feud with Ted Dibiase and his mystery partner when DiBiase Jr and The Million Dollar Man Ted DiBiase Sr appeared in a segment on Raw DiBiase and his father challenged Rhodes and Holly to a title match at Night of Champions against DiBiase and a mystery partner which they accepted At Night of Champions DiBiase came to the ring unaccompanied and said his partner would be there However the bell rang and there was no partner for it to be a two on one handicap match DiBiase demanded that he face Holly first and as DiBiase approached Holly Holly was attacked by his tag team partner Rhodes revealing that he was DiBiases tag team partner turning Rhodes heel and in the process Rhodes and DiBiase became the new tag team champions

After holding the titles for just over a month they dropped it to John Cena and Batista on the August 4 edition of Raw The following week DiBiase and Rhodes used their rematch clause to regain the title Rhodes and DiBiase were joined by Manu forming a stable of multi generational superstars On the October 27 2008 edition of Raw Rhodes and DiBiase lost their titles to Kofi Kingston and CM Punk During this time Rhodes DiBiase and Manu entered a storyline with Randy Orton where Orton constantly criticized and insulted them and attacked DiBiase on November 7 on Raw punting him in the head At Survivor Series Rhodes along with Orton was a sole survivor for Ortons team in the Elimination match

Rhodes and Manu accepted Ortons offer to form an alliance a few weeks after the DiBiase incident attacking John Cena along with Chris Jericho and the trio dubbed themselves The Legacy debuting the following week in a 2 on 3 handicap match against Batista and the WWE Champion Triple H and although they were now a stable neither one of the three made any changes in their attire

The December 15th edition of Raw they defeated Batista and the World Heavyweight Champion John Cena in a match where Orton punted Batista in the head leaving him indefinitely inactive also that night Cody and Manu interfered in Rey Mysterios match against Sim Snuka giving a beating to Rey who was later attacked by Mike Knox 

Randy Orton and Cody Rhodes and Ted Dibiase JR formed Legacy

The following week December 22 Orton qualified for a Fatal Four Way Elimination Match his opponent being the now unable to compete Batista while the same night Manu lost to Kofi Kingston in a one on one match with Rhodes at ringside 

After Orton grew tired of The Legacy losing matches in an ongoing quest to mold his disciples he informed Cody Rhodes Sim Snuka and Manu that that very night they would have to complete their first test Each man would have to compete in a singles match Each man who won would have completed step one any man who lost would be out of his Legacy the only man that lost was Manu While same that night Kelly Kelly confronted her real secret romance Randy Orton After lying to Kane about his identity two weeks previous After listening to Kelly Kelly berate him for not calling her back Orton told Kelly that he didnt need her to protect him against Kane He then blew her off by telling her that he didnt need any distractions while vying for the World Heavyweight Championship this caused an alteration in between Kane and Orton in a match where Kane jobbed to Kane and thus ending the feud

In the Elimination Fatal Four Way to determine who would follow to face John Cena at the Royal Rumble in between Y2J Orton Shawn Michaels and JBL just as Jericho prepared to lock JBL into the Walls of Jericho Michaels laid out the first ever Undisputed Champion Chris Jericho with a Sweet Chin Music Next up it was Orton who found himself on the receiving end of Sweet Chin Music

Orton opened Raw the night after the Royal Rumble flanked by the members of the Legacy Rhodes and DiBiase as well as two lawyers and a therapist He followed to reveal that he suffers from IED According to Orton and his therapist WWE knew of the condition and if fired the Orton said that he planned on not only taking Rhodes and DiBiase with him but also on bringing a lawsuit against the company 

The leader of the Legacy then detailed his plans for a second lawsuit suing for breach of contract if he is not granted the opportunity to compete in the main event of WrestleMania XXV an honor he earned by defeating 29 other Superstars in the Royal Rumble Match the night before Before leaving with Rhodes DiBiase his therapist and his lawyers Orton issued a prepared half hearted apology to Mr McMahon his family and the WWE Universe

At the close of the show Stephanie McMahon entered the ring expressing her desire to speak to Randy Orton face to face Accompanied by his therapist two lawyers Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase the 2009 Royal Rumble winner made his entrance reiterating the consequences waiting for Stephanie if she was to fire him Two costly lawsuits being filed against WWE as well as DiBiase and Rhodes walking The Legend Killer went even further threatening to file an injunction to stop WrestleMania the event at which he is guaranteed a World Title Match 

After daring McMahon to fire him the Raw General Manager announced that they had other plans for him even beyond the Superstars that engulfed the ring With that Stephanies brother Shane McMahon made his entrance and attacked Orton with such ferocity that it took the entire Raw roster to restrain him

The following week Orton challenged McMahon to a No Holds Barred match at No Way Out which Shane accepted

The next week Orton faced The Undertaker and lost by desqualification while Rhodes and DiBiase defeated Cryme Tyme Orton would then go on to feud with then WWE Champion Triple H for what Orton and Legacy had done to Triple Hs family On the March 2nd edition of Raw Randy Orton chose to face Triple H in the main event at Wrestlemania 25 At Wrestlemania 25 Triple H would defeat Randy Orton after hitting him with a sledgehammer and a pedigree The night after Wrestlemania 25 Orton had a one on one match with Mr McMahon just as Orton was about to go for the punt kick Shane McMahon came to the aid of his father this prompted Rhodes and DiBiase to come out and attack Shane which then lead to Triple H coming out As Legacy were attacking Triple H Batista returned to attack Randy Orton for what he did to him in December of 2008

On the February 22nd 2010 episode of Monday Night RAW Orton made a 6 Man Tag Match because he was thinking Legacy needed to form together and Randy even said he was sorry but after Orton left the scene it was revealed that Ted and Cody were planning to betray Randy once and for all but during the match when Cody tagged Randy out while entering the ring Orton shockingly DDTd Cody Ted was in shock because he realized Orton figured out their plan which lead to Orton supposedly turning into a face and RKOd Ted DiBiase right on the spot and left the arena leaving Evan Bourne to pin the fallen Cody Rhodes

Jean Baptiste Pierre Antoine de Monet Chevalier de la Marck usually known as Lamarck was a French soldier naturalist and academic He was one of the first people to suggest that organisms changed in accordance with natural laws This is known as evolution

Jean Baptiste was the 11th child of Philippe Jacques de Monet de La Marck and Marie Franoise de Fontaine de Chuignolles His parents were nobles but they were not well off His parents wanted him to become a priest Starting at age eleven he attended a Jesuit school in Amiens After his fathers death in 1759 Jean Baptiste joined the army Lamarck fought in the Pomeranian War with Prussia and was awarded a medal for bravery on the battlefield During his service he was stationed in different forts in France mostly at the eastern border and the Mediterranean coast At his post in Monaco Lamarck became interested in natural history and resolved to study medicine In 1766 he was injured He retired from the army in 1768 and returned to his medical studies He worked at a bank in Paris From 1770 to 1774 he studied medicine at the university but did not finish his studies with a degree During this time he met some of the well known scientists of his day such as the botanists Bernard and Antoine Laurent de Jussieu and the naturalist Georges Louis Leclerc Comte de Buffon 

Lamarck developed a particular interest for botany and later after he published a three volume work Flora franaise he gained membership of the French Academy of Sciences in 1779 Lamarck became involved in the Jardin des Plantes and was appointed to the Chair of Botany in 1788 When the Musum national dHistoire naturelle was founded in 1793 Lamarck was appointed as a professor of zoology In 1801 he published Systme des animaux sans vertbres a major work on the classifications of invertebrates In an 1802 publication he became one of the first to use the term biology in its modern sense Lamarck continued his work as a top authority on invertebrate zoology 

In the modern era Lamarck is remembered mainly for a theory of the inheritance of acquired characters called soft inheritance or Lamarckism His major work on this subject was Philosophie zoologique Paris 1809

His idea of soft inheritance was a reflection of the folk wisdom of the time accepted by many natural historians Lamarcks contribution to evolutionary theory was an early perhaps the first theory of evolution In Lamarcks theory an alchemical complexifying force drove organisms up a ladder of complexity A second environmental force adapted them to local environments through use and disuse of characteristics making them different from other organisms Since these ideas cannot be reconciled with what we know about genetics they are now history 

Lamarck died in Paris in 1829 When he died his family was so poor they had to apply to the Academie for financial assistance Lamarcks books and the contents of his home were sold at auction and he was buried in a temporary lime pit

Lamarck came into conflict with the widely respected palaeontologist Georges Cuvier who was not a supporter of evolution

After his death Cuvier used the forum of a eulogy to denigrate Lamarck 

Opposition to Lamarks theories became stronger when Mendels genetics was rediscovered but there were always common sense doubts Particular criticism came from Alfred Russel Wallace and August Weismann later in the 19th century Here is an example

Fritz Mller was a German biologist and doctor who went to live in southern Brazil There he studied the natural history He was an early supporter of Darwinism and lived in Brazil for the rest of his life Mllerian mimicry is named after him

Unlike most of his contemporaries in Britain Mller had what would be seen today as a normal scientific education at the universities of Berlin and Greifswald culminating in a doctoral degree Then he decided to study medicine As a medical student he began to question religion and in 1846 became an atheist Despite completing the course he did not graduate because he refused to swear the graduation oath which contained the phrase so help me God and his sacred Gospel

Mller was disappointed by the failure of the Prussian Revolution in 1848 and realised there might be implications for his life and career As a result he emigrated to South Brazil in 1852 with his brother August and their wives to join Hermann Blumenaus new colony in the State of Santa Catarina The colony near the coast on the Itaja River was called Blumenau In Brazil Mller living with his wife Caroline became a farmer doctor teacher and biologist sometimes employed by the provincial government sometimes surviving on his own efforts sometimes defending against Indians but always collecting evidence of life in the Atlantic forest The climate here is sub tropical and the vegetation typical of the Brazilian coast it is not rain forest

In 1876 he was appointed as Travelling Naturalist to the National Museum in Rio de Janeiro This was the ideal post for him it gave him the opportunity to range over the whole of the Itaja system and study anything that interested him A series of reports published in the Archivos of the National Museum record this work 

At last this the best period of his life was brought to an end indirectly by the overthrow of the liberal monarchy of Dom Pedro II in 1889 The new Brazilian Republic was riddled with corruption and nepotism and eventually there was a civil war in 1893 5 Travelling naturalists were to be based in Rio de Janeiro and instructions were sent out Mller refused point blank and was dismissed as was von Ihering in So Paulo

In his retirement years Mller received many letters of support and offers of financial help His cousin Alfred Mller visited him and eventually became his biographer His rewards during life from the Brazilian state were minor but his reputation now stands high He was one of a half dozen great naturalists to visit and work in South America during the nineteenth century Humboldt Darwin Wallace Bates Spruce and Fritz Mller He was the only one of these to settle in Brazil for the rest of his life A statue was erected to Mller in Blumenau in 1929

A broad chronology of Mllers life is as follows 

During his life Mller published oved 70 papers mostly in German language periodicals some in English and Portuguese The topics covered a range of natural history topics in entomology marine zoology and botany

 Mllerian mimicry  Mllers great discovery concerned the resemblance between two or more unpalatable species which are protected from predators capable of learning The protection is often a noxious chemical perhaps gained from the larva eating a particulat plant or it may be a sting or other defence It is an advantage for such potential prey to advertise their status in a way clearly perceptible to their predators this is called aposematic or warning colouration In Mullers case the prey were butterflies and the predators usually birds or reptiles 

The aposematic colours are most often some combination of red yellow black white whereas palatable animals are usually cryptic The noxious animals may display by slow flying and in general are prominently visible Noxious animals usually have thick leathery cuticles through which at certain points they extrude noxious fluids when pecked they will often survive a trial 

In Mllerian mimicry an advantage is gained when unpalatable species resemble each other especially when the predator has a good memory for colour Thus one trial may work to dissuade a bird from several species of butterfly which all fly the same flag Brazilian butterflies provide some of the most extraordinary examples of mimicry and Mller Bates and Wallace all had lengthy experience of this All three traveller naturalists believed firmly that such systems of mimicry could only come about by means of natural selection and all of them wrote about it

 Stingless bees  One of his favourite topics was the life habits of the stingless honey bees Melipoma and Trigona They are protected by a venom which they squirt when disturbed The local name for them is Cagafogo 

 Dimorphism in midges Another discovery was the dimorphism in midges of the family Blepharicereidae There are two female forms with different mouth parts one sucks blood the other takes nectar as does the male To prove the point to skeptics he sexed the flies carefully and reared them from pupae

 Termites By studying living termites Mller was able to correct many errors to be found in text books For example their caste system is organised quite differently from ants since the castes contain members of both sexes whereas in hymenoptera the castes are unisexual and the males are haploid Termites are placed in a different order from ants the Isoptera

Much of Mllers botany was stimulated by the series of botanical works published by Darwin in the years after the Origin Mller made contributions in all these fields After Darwins Fertilisation of Orchids he spent years of work on orchids sending observations to his brother Hermann and to Darwin Darwin used some of this work in his second edition of 1877 and Hermann later became famous for his work on pollination On Climbing plants Mller sent a letter to Darwin listing 40 genera of climbing plants classified by their method of climbing The next few months saw more observations which Darwin had translated and published as Mllers first paper in English

Mller became a strong supporter of Darwin He wrote Fr Darwin in 1864 arguing that Charles Darwins theory of evolution by natural selection was correct and that Brazilian crustaceans and their larvae could be affected by adaptations at any growth stage This was translated into English as Facts and Arguments for Darwin in 1869 If Mller had a weakness it was that his writing was much less readable than that of Darwin or Wallace both the German and English editions are hard reading indeed which has limited the appreciation of this significant book

Extensive correspondence exists between Mller and Darwin and Mller also corresponded with Alexander Agassiz Ernst Krause and Ernst Haeckel

John Adrian Louis Hope 1st Marquess of Linlithgow KT GCMG GCVO PC known as Viscount Aithrie before 1873 and as The 7th Earl of Hopetoun between 1873 and 1902 was the first Governor General of Australia 

Hope was born at South Queensferry West Lothian in Scotland He was the eldest son of the 6th Earl of Hopetoun He was educated at Eton College and the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst where he passed in 1879 but did not join the Army He looked after the family houses and lands In 1883 he became active in the House of Lords He served as a Lord in Waiting from June 1885 to January 1886 and August 1886 to August 1889

Governor In 1889 he was made the Governor of Victoria where he served until 1895 He went back to the United Kingdom and was made a privy councillor He became the Paymaster General from 1895 to 1898 and then Lord Chamberlain until 1900 The Australian colonies joined together to form the Commonwealth of Australia from 1 January 1901 Hopetoun was well liked in Victoria and he knew all the important Australian politicians This made him a good choice to be the first Governor General of the Commonwealth and he was appointed in July 1900 In India on his way to Australia he got typhoid fever and his wife got malaria They arrived in December 1900

Hopetouns first job was to choose a Prime Minister to form a government which would start on 1 January 1901 The first elections were not going to be held until March so he could not choose the leader of the biggest political party in the House of Representatives Instead he asked Sir William Lyne the Premier of the largest state New South Wales to be Prime Minister

While this was a reasonable choice Lyne had opposed federation and was unpopular with the leading federalist politicians Alfred Deakin and other important politicians told Hopetoun they would not work with Lyne Hopetoun then asked Edmund Barton the leader of the federal movement and the man everybody thought should be the Prime Minister This became known as the Hopetoun Blunder

There were soon more problems Hopetoun had brought his own Official Secretary Captain Edward William Wallington The Australians did not want an Englishman in charge of official business They also did not like the regal pomp and ceremony that Hopetoun used in his position and the money that this cost He acted as if ruled Australia with the Prime Minister This was not what writers of the Constitution had wanted

Hopetoun became friends with Melbourne anarchist and union pioneer John Chummy Fleming In May 1901 Fleming protested against unemployment in Melbourne by rushing onto the Princes Bridge to stop the Governor Generals carriage Hopetoun listened to Fleming talk about the problems of the unemployed According to some reports Hopetoun made the government speed up work projects

Finally there was a problem with how much the Governor General should be paid to have a house in both Sydney the largest city and Melbourne the home of the Australian government The Commonwealth and Victorian parliaments would not pay Hopetoun more money Hopetoun resigned in May 1902 He and his family left Australia on 17 July 1902 He knew he had failed in a historic role He was created 1st Marquess of Linlithgow on 27 October 1902 while he still the Governor General His term officially ended on 9 January 1903 He was made Secretary for Scotland in 1905

He died suddenly on 29 February 1908 in Pau Pyrnes Atlantiques France

On 18 October 1886 he married Hersey Everleigh de Moleyns daughter of the fourth Baron Ventry They had four children

His son Victor the 2nd Marquess of Linlithgow became the longest serving Viceroy of India 1936 43 a job he had always wanted His grandson Lord Glendevon married the daughter of the English novelist W Somerset Maugham

Henry Walter Bates was an English biologist who explored the Amazon Rainforest 

This naturalist and explorer gave the first scientific account of mimicry in animals Batesian mimicry is named after him He was most famous for his expedition to the Amazon River basin with Alfred Russel Wallace in 1848 He spent 11 years in the rain forest 

When Bates arrived home in 1859 he had sent back over 14000 species of which 8000 were new to science

In 1847 Wallace and Bates discussed the idea of an expedition to the Amazon The plan was to defray expenses by sending specimens back to London where an agent would sell them for a commission Also for the travellers to gather facts towards solving the problem of the origin of species as Wallace put it in a letter to Bates 

The two friends who were both by now experienced amateur entomologists met in London to prepare themselves by viewing South American plants and animals in the main collections

Bates and Wallace sailed from Liverpool in April 1848 arriving in Par at the end of May For the first year they settled in a villa near the city collecting birds and insects After that they agreed to collect independently

Eventually Bates health deteriorated and he returned to England sending his collection by three different ships He didnt want to put all his insects into one boat Bates wrote a famous book on his experiences The naturalist on the river Amazons

Alfred Russel Wallace OM FRS was a British naturalist explorer biologist and social activist He is best known for proposing a theory of natural selection This was published in 1858 together with Charles Darwins idea

Wallace did extensive natural history exploring He went first to the Amazon River basin with Henry Walter Bates and later to Malaya and Indonesia He wrote books on both these adventures While in Indonesia he drew the Wallace Line which divides Indonesia into two parts On one side are animals of Australasia On the other side are species mostly of Asian origin He wrote a wonderful book on the distribution of animals 

After a few years of working as a railway surveyor with his brother Wallaces life was changed by meeting Henry Walter Bates in Leicester in 1847 

Wallace and Bates discussed the idea of an expedition to the Amazon The plan was to defray expenses by sending specimens back to London where an agent would sell them for a commission Also for the travellers to gather facts towards solving the problem of the origin of species as Wallace put it in a letter to Bates The two friends who were both by now experienced amateur entomologists met in London to prepare themselves by viewing South American plants and animals in the main collections

Wallace continued charting the Amazon for four years collecting specimens and making notes on the peoples the languages the geography flora and fauna On 12 July 1852 Wallace embarked for England on the brig Helen After twenty eight days at sea balsam in the ships cargo caught fire and the crew was forced to abandon ship All of the specimens Wallace had on the ship most of his collection were lost He could only save part of his diary and a few sketches Wallace and the crew spent ten days in an open boat before being picked up by the brig Jordeson

From 1854 to 1862 age 31 to 39 Wallace travelled through the Dutch East Indies to collect specimens for sale and to study nature Wallace collected more than 125000 specimens in the Dutch East Indies More than a thousand of them represented species new to science 

His observations of the clear zoological differences across a narrow strait in the archipelago led to his proposing the zoogeographical boundary now known as the Wallace Line Bali and Lombok were two islands in the archipelago only 17 miles apart at the widest roughly the same size and with the same climate soil elevation and aspect Yet their flora and fauna were so different 

In this archipelago there are two distinct faunas rigidly circumscribed which differ as much as do those of Africa and South America yet there is nothing on the map or on the face of the islands to mark their limits The boundary line passes between islands closer together than others belonging to the same group I believe the western part to be a separated portion of continental Asia while the eastern is a fragmentary prolongation of a former west Pacific continent

Why was it he wondered that the animals and plants on the Bali side of the channel were of Asian types while those on the Lombok side were Australasian in type This had to mean that the western group had evolved from common western stock while the eastern group had evolved from a common eastern stock 

While he was exploring the archipelago he refined his thoughts about evolution and had his famous insight on natural selection In 1858 he sent an article outlining his theory to Darwin it was published along with a description of Darwins own theory in the same year

Accounts of his studies and adventures there were eventually published in 1869 as The Malay Archipelago It became one of the most popular natural history travel journals of the 19th century It was praised by Charles Darwin and Charles Lyell and by others such as the novelist Joseph Conrad who called it his favorite bedside companion

Unlike Darwin Wallace began his career as a travelling naturalist already believing in evolution Both he and Bates had read Vestiges a controversial work of popular science published anonymously in 1844 This advocated an evolutionary origin for the solar system the earth and living things He also read Malthuss Principle of population which he says twenty years later gave me the long sought clue to the effective agent in the evolution of organic species He meant by that the struggle for existence which led Wallace to natural selection

Wallace wrote his ideas on the small isle of Ternate in what was then the Dutch East Indies He was suffering from malaria While the natives looked after him his thoughts turned to Malthuss book I thought of Malthuss clear exposition of the positive checks to increase disease accidents wars famine which keep down the population It then occurred to me that the same causes or their equivalents are continually acting in the case of animals also Why do some die and some live And the answer came clearly that on the whole the best fitted live Then it suddenly flashed upon me that this self acting process would necessarily improve the race This was the origin of his letter to Darwin which set out the idea of natural selection

In 1864 Wallace published a paper The origin of human races and the antiquity of Man deduced from the theory of natural selection applying the theory to human beings Huxley had already published his view that evolution applied to mankind as it did to other living things

Wallace thought that natural selection could not account for mathematical artistic or musical genius as well as metaphysical musings and wit and humour He eventually said that something in the unseen universe of Spirit had interceded at least three times in history The first was the creation of life from inorganic matter The second was the introduction of consciousness in the higher animals And the third was the generation of the higher mental faculties in mankind He also believed that the purpose of the universe was the development of the human spirit 

Many including Huxley Hooker and Darwin himself were highly critical of these ideas As one historian of science has pointed out Wallaces views in this area were at odds with two major tenets of Darwinism These are evolution does not have a goal and it is not aimed at or centered around mankind It is thought by most biographers that his thinking on the evolution of man was influenced by his adoption of spiritualism which happened at the same time

Wallace was not a believer in revealed religion of any kind but he did believe in spiritualism This has puzzled biographers who struggle to think why such a man would believe in spirits Early in his life he experimented with hypnosis which was then doubted and criticised He used some of his students in Leicester as subjects with considerable success Apparently this persuaded him not to reject ideas which were doubted Even when Huxley told him that one of his favourite mediums was a proven fraud he refused to believe it He preferred the evidence of his own experience

Wallaces public support of spiritualism and his defence of spiritualist mediums against allegations of fraud damaged his scientific reputation It strained his relationships with friends such as Bates Huxley and Darwin who felt he was overly credulous Others became openly hostile to Wallace over the issue Wallace and other scientists who defended spiritualism were subject to much criticism from the press with The Lancet the leading English medical journal being particularly harsh The controversy affected the publics idea of Wallace for the rest of his career though he was always respected in other ways

Wallace had a wide range of interests and wrote books about all of them He wrote against vaccination for phrenology for spiritualism for land nationalisation against the moon having canals and for social change and the progress and improvement of mankind He did not believe in religion but he did believe in spiritualism He was a radical in politics economics and social reform He was a kind and honourable person but he could be a tough opponent if he thought something unfair was going on Even the titles of some of his books were sensational as for example

Wallace wrote about 22 books depending on how one counts them His greatest works include

Nikolai Ivanovich Vavilov was a Russian botanist and geneticist He is best known for showing how and where crop plants evolved He devoted his life to agriculture the study and improvement of wheat corn and other cereal crops

By 1940 Vavilov had accumulated a collection of 200000 plant seeds from the Soviet Union and from abroad He was widely admired but his life came to a terrible end Vavilov repeatedly criticised a powerful but poor scientist Trofim Lysenko As a result Vavilov was arrested and died of starvation in a prison in 1943 Today Vavilovs name stands high The Vavilov Institute of Plant Industry in St Petersburg is named after him It maintains one of the worlds largest collections of plant genetic material

This is mimicry in plants where a weed comes to look like a crop plant Before herbicides weeds were plucked by hand This has been done for thousands of years The weeds come to look like the crop because the weeders pick those weeds which look most different Vavilovian mimicry is caused by unintentional selection by humans The weeds that survive pass on their genes Gradually all the weeds look more like the crop plant

An example is rye a common Mediterranean species Rye was originally just a weed growing with wheat and barley Weeding made it like the crop Like wheat it came to have larger seeds and more rigid spindles to which the seeds are attached

Rye is a tougher plant than wheat it survives in harsher conditions Having become a crop like the wheat rye was able to become a crop plant in harsh areas such as hills and mountains

Gilbert White was a naturalist and bird lover

White was born in his grandfathers vicarage at Selborne in Hampshire He was educated by a private tutor in Basingstoke before going to Oriel College Oxford University He obtained his deacons orders in 1746 being fully ordained in 1749 Then he held several curacies in Hampshire and Wiltshire including Selbourne White also held the office of Junior Proctor at Oxford and was Dean of Oriel College In 1784 he became curate of Selborne for the last time remaining so until his death 

White is best known for the Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne This was a collection of his letters to Thomas Pennant the leading British zoologist of the day and the Hon Daines Barrington an English barrister and Fellow of the Royal Society These letters contained Whites discoveries about local birds animals and plants White believed in observing birds rather than collecting specimens He was one of the first people to separate the similar looking Chiffchaff Willow Warbler and Wood Warbler by means of their song

White is regarded by many as Englands first ecologist and one of the founders of modern respect for nature

Sir Charles Lyell 1st Baronet was a British geologist He was the foremost geologist of his day and an influence on the young Charles Darwin His work was rewarded with a knighthood and later he was created a hereditary baronet

The house of his birth is in the Lowlands of Scotland it is in the valley of the Highland Boundary Fault one of the great features of Scottish geology Round the house is farmland but within a short distance to the north west are the Grampian Mountains in the Scottish Highlands 

Charles would have seen this view from his house as a child He was also fortunate that his familys second home was in a completely different area at Bartley Lodge in the New Forest England Both these places lit his interest in the natural world

Lyell had private means and earned more money as an author He came from a prosperous family worked briefly as a lawyer in the 1820s He held the post of Professor of Geology at Kings College London in the 1830s From 1830 onward his books provided both income and fame

Lyells Principles of Geology was his most famous most influential and most important book It was first published in three volumes in 183033 The book was a development of the ideas of James Hutton but with many additions improvements and examples The book established Lyells credentials as an important geological theorist It was a work of synthesis backed by his own personal observations on his travels

The central argument in Principles was that the present is the key to the past This was called by William Whewell uniformitarianism Geological remains from the distant past are explained by processes we can see operating now Lyells interpretation of geologic change as the steady accumulation of minute changes over enormously long spans of time was a big influence on the young Charles Darwin

John Ray was an English naturalist sometimes referred to as the father of English natural history

Ray was a Protestant dissenter who had accepted the return of Charles II He was ordained in London in 1660 but refused to sign the Act of Uniformity of 1662 The Act of Uniformity made the Book of Common Prayer compulsory in religious services which was opposed by those of Puritan beliefs So Ray was forced to resign his Fellowship of Trinity College Cambridge he returned to his native village of Black Notley near Braintree in Essex After this his most important scientific works were supported financially by the Royal Society whose President at a critical time in the 1680s was Samuel Pepys

Ray published important works on plants animals and natural theology His classification of plants in his Historia Plantarum was an important step towards modern taxonomy Ray rejected the system by which species were classified according to an eitheror type system Instead he classified plants by observation according to similarities and differences Thus he advanced scientific empiricism against the deductive rationalism of the scholastics He was the first person to give a biological definition of the term species

Ray published about 23 works depending on how one counts them The biological works were usually in Latin the rest in English For ease of reading the titles below are in English

Including the various editions there are 172 works of Ray of which most are rare The only libraries with substantial holdings are all in Englandp153 The list in order of holdings is

The WWE Diva Search was a competition held by the World Wrestling Entertainment which ran from 2003 to 2007 The aim of the contest was to find a new WWE Diva from the 2004 contest onwards the winner of the contest was offered a WWE Contract which was worth 250000

Despite only one winner of the competition each year the WWE has signed multiple diva search contestants including Candice Michelle Taryn Terrell and many others

In 2003 the first Diva Search was held however the winner of the first Diva Search Jaime Koeppe did not receive a contract She did receive a photoshoot for an issue of WWE Magazine

Despite Christy Hemme winning the WWE hired many other Divas also featured within the contest this included Michelle McCool Amy Weber Candice Michelle Maria Kennllis and Joy Giovanni

Like the previous years Diva Search Ashley Massaro was not the only Diva WWE hired this included Kristal Marshall Trenesha Biggers and Elisabeth Rouffaer

Like the past two years this also featured the WWE hiring many losing Divas this included Milena Roucka the Garcia Twins Rebecca DiPietro Amy Zidian and Maryse Ouellet

WWE like in the previous years WWE hired runner ups this included Taryn Terrell Lena Yada and Angela Fong

Vladimir Samoylovich Horowitz was a Russian American classical pianist He is often said to be one of the best pianists of the 20th century

Horowitz was born in Kiev Russia to a Jewish family in 1903 He was the youngest of four children His father was an engineer and his mother was a pianist He first started piano lessons from his mother at an early age In 1912 he joined Kiev University where he was taught by Vladimir Puchalsky Sergei Tarnowsky and Felix Blumenfeld He performed Sergei Rachmaninoffs Piano Concerto No 3 in D Minor on his graduation He then performed his first solo concert in Kharkiv in 1920

Horowitz got more and more famous but was often paid in food rather than money because Russia wasnt very rich Although performing in many concerts he secretly wanted to be a composer In 1925 he moved to the West intending not to return

On January 2 1926 Horowitz played his first concert outside of Russia He then played in many other places such as Berlin Paris and London He gave his first concerts in the United States in 1928 

When World War II started in 1939 Horowitz decided to live in the U S He became an American citizen in 1944 Horowitz was very proud of being an American and decided to make a piano version of Sousas The Stars and Stripes Forever He played many concerts to raise money for the war effort and he asked people to call him the American pianist Horowitz began playing music written by an American composer Samuel Barber and gave the worlds first performances of the Barbers Piano Sonata and Excursions

During World War II Horowitz also played a lot of Russian music giving the first performances in America of Prokofievs Piano Sonatas Nos 6 7 and 8 and Kabalevskys Piano Sonatas Nos 2 and 3 

Horowitz stopped playing concerts four times as he was unsure that he was good enough even when he was popular

He made his television debut on September 22nd 1968 in a concert at Carnegie Hall

The way Horowitz played 

Horowitz was most well known for playing music written between 1830 and 1920 His 1932 recording of the Liszt Sonata is still considered by many to be the best ever even though many other pianists have recorded it Other pieces he was famous for were Scriabins tude in D sharp minor Chopins Ballade No 1 in G minor and many of Rachmaninoffs short pieces including Polka de WR Horowitz was praised for his way of playing the Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto No 3 and the composer said he swallowed it whole He had the courage the intensity the daring Horowitz later became good friends with Rachmaninoff Horowitz was also well known for playing quieter works like Schumanns Scenes of Childhood Scarlatti sonatas and some Mozart and Haydn sonatas

Horowitzs way of playing often used large contrasts between soft and loud volumes He was able to play louder than most other pianists without making an ugly sound His playing was also known for many different kinds of sounds sometimes called tone colors Horowitz was also famous for playing precise passages in octaves very fast

Horowitz began making recordings in 1928 He recorded for several record labels His most famous early records were Rachmaninoffs Piano Concerto No 3 with Albert Coates and the London Symphony Orchestra and Franz Liszts Sonata in B minor  When Horowitz was not playing in public he sometimes made recordings in his house His recordings won many awards and he continued recording until a few days before he died

In 1986 Horowitz told his friends that before I die I want to see the land where I was born So he decided to play two concerts in Russia At the time Russia and the United States were trying to be more friendly with each other and Horowitzs concerts were part of that effort The concert in Russias capitol Moscow was shown on TV and people in the audience could be seen wiping tears from their eyes

When Horowitz returned to the United States President Ronald Reagan gave him the Presidential Medal of Freedom

Vladimir Horowitz died on November 5 1989 in New York of a heart attack He was 86

Thomas Henry Huxley PC PRS was an English biologist He was known as Darwins Bulldog for his support of Charles Darwins theory of evolution Huxley was slow to accept some of Darwins ideas but he was wholehearted in his public support of Darwin 

Huxleys 1860 debate with the English Bishop Samuel Wilberforce was a famous public event The debate was about evolution and it was widely reported in the press Many thought Huxley won that debate which helped Huxleys career and the theory of evolution Huxley also developed scientific education in Britain and fought against the more extreme forms of religion Huxley used the term agnostic to describe his own views on religion a term which we use today

Huxley had little schooling and taught himself almost everything he knew Remarkably he became a great anatomist and zoologist Later he discussed the evolution of man and the apes Another of his ideas was that birds evolved from small carnivorous dinosaurs a view widely held today

His activity in favour of evolution and his public work on scientific education had a big effect on society in Britain and elsewhere

As a young man Huxley went on a long voyage of discovery to the southern continents He was Assistant to the Surgeon on the Royal Navy ship HMS Rattlesnake What he did was to collect sea animals and study them He went ashore in New Guinea and the eastern coast of Australia to study the animals and the native peoples He fell in love with a girl in Sydney Australia and some years later they married and had children

For nearly ten years he worked on the relationship of man to the apes This led him into a clash with Richard Owen a man who was disliked for his behaviour but admired for his skill The struggle between them ended in some severe defeats for Owen

Huxleys public lectures grew into his most famous work Mans place in Nature There he deals with the evolution of man before Charles Darwin published his Descent of Man in 1871

In the book Huxley gives evidence for the evolution of man and apes from a common ancestor It was the first book devoted to the topic of human evolution The book proposed to a wide readership that evolution applied as fully to man as to all other life

Huxley was an important public figure When he was young there were virtually no degrees in British universities in biology and few courses Most biologists of his day were either self taught or took medical degrees By the time he retired there were professors in biology in most universities and a broad agreement on what should be taught Huxley was the single most influential person in this transformation Huxley was for about thirty years evolutions most effective champion For some Huxley was the leading English spokesman for science in the nineteenth century

Huxley supported the reading of the Bible in schools Huxley was against organised religion but he thought the Bibles moral teachings and use of language helped English life I do not advocate burning your ship to get rid of the cockroaches

However what Huxley proposed was to create an edited version of the Bible shorn of shortcomings and errors These tender children should not be taught that which you do not yourselves believe The London School Board voted against his idea but it also voted against the idea that public money should be used to support students attending church schools Vigorous debate took place on such points and the debates were written down in detail Huxley said I will never be a party to enabling the State to sweep the children of this country into denominational schools The Act of Parliament which founded board schools allowed the reading of the Bible but did not permit any particular religious doctrine to be taught

It may be right to see Huxley as helping the secularisation of British society which gradually occurred over the following century Ernst Mayr said It can hardly be doubted that biology has helped to undermine traditional beliefs and value systems Huxley more than anyone else was responsible for this trend in Britain

Huxley worked on ten Royal and other commissions The subjects included medical law contagious diseases vivisection fisheries universities in Scotland and science education in Ireland He was Inspector of Fisheries 188185 and held many awards from many universities He was President of the Royal Society from 18831885 The British state made him a Privy Councillor as a reward for his public work

Theodosius Dobzhansky or Theodore Dobzhansky was a noted geneticist and an evolutionary biologist 

Dobzhansky was born in the Ukraine and emigrated to the United States in 1927 He was a central figure in the field of evolutionary biology for his work on the fruit fly Drosophila He did research on these flies in California mostly on populations of Drosophila pseudoobscura 

Dobzhansky was important in the modern evolutionary synthesis which was the synthesis of evolutionary biology with genetics

At school Dobzhansky collected butterflies and beetles and studued biology at Kiev University After graduation he moved to St Petersburg and studied under Yuri Filipchenko who had a Drosophila lab Dobzhansky collected Coccinellidae in the wild and explored their genetics

Dobzhansky emigrated to the United States in 1927 He worked with Thomas Hunt Morgan at Columbia University who had pioneered the use of fruit flies in genetics experiments He followed Morgan to the California Institute of Technology from 1930 to 1940 Dobzhansky took fruit fly research out of the laboratory and into the field He discovered that regional varieties of flies were more similar to each other genetically than to flies from other regions

In 1937 Dobzhansky published one of the major works of the modern evolutionary synthesis entitled Genetics and the Origin of Species He defined evolution as a change in the allele frequency within a gene pool It is through changes in the proportion of alleles in a population that evolution takes place Also in 1937 he became a naturalized citizen of the United States During this time he had a falling out with one of his Drosophila collaborators Alfred Sturtevant based perhaps on professional competition 

Dobzhansky returned to Columbia University from 1940 to 1962 He was one of the signatories of the 1950 UNESCO statement The Race Question He then moved to the Rockefeller University until his retirement in 1971

Sir Julian Sorell Huxley FRS was an English evolutionary biologist humanist and internationalist He was a proponent of natural selection and a leading figure in the modern evolutionary synthesis 

He was Secretary of the Zoological Society of London the first Director of UNESCO and a founding member of the World Wildlife Fund

Huxley came from the distinguished Huxley family His brother was the writer Aldous Huxley and his half brother a fellow biologist and Nobel laureate Andrew Huxley and his paternal grandfather was Thomas Henry Huxley a friend and supporter of Charles Darwin and proponent of evolution 

Huxley was well known for his presentation of science in books and articles and on radio and television He was awarded UNESCOs Kalinga Prize for the popularisation of science in 1953 the Darwin Medal of the Royal Society in 1956 and the Darwin Wallace medal of the Linnean Society in 1958 He was also knighted in that same year 1958 a hundred years after Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace announced the theory of evolution by natural selection In 1959 he received a Special Award of the Lasker Foundation in the category Planned Parenthood World Population Huxley was a prominent member of the British Eugenics Society

His particular interest was bird behaviour especially the courtship of water birds His observations on the ethology of the Great Crested Grebe published in 1914 was a landmark in avian field research His invention of vivid labels for the rituals made the ideas memorable and interesting to the general reader

Huxley was the most important biologist after August Weismann to insist on natural selection as the primary agent in evolution A fine communicator he was a prominent populariser of biological science to the public In the early 20th century he was one of the minority of biologists who believed that natural selection was the main driving force of evolution and that evolution occurred by small steps and not by jumps These opinions are now standard Though his time as an academic was quite brief he taught and encouraged a number of evolutionary biologists at the University of Oxford in the 1920s

Huxley was a key figure in the modern evolutionary synthesis This explained how the discoveries of Gregor Mendel on genetics fitted with Charles Darwins theory of evolution by means of natural selection Huxleys 

Huxleys first trial run was the treatment of evolution in the Science of Life and in 1936 he published a long and significant paper for the British Association In 1938 came three lengthy reviews on major evolutionary topics

Now it was time for Huxley to tackle the subject of evolution at full length in what became the defining work of his life His book Evolution the modern synthesis was written whilst he was Secretary to the Zoological Society and made use of his remarkable collection of reprints covering the first part of the century It was published in 1942 Reviews of the book in learned journals were little short of ecstatic the American Naturalist called it The outstanding evolutionary treatise of the decade perhaps of the century The approach is thoroughly scientific the command of basic information amazing

Huxleys main co respondents in the modern evolutionary synthesis are usually listed as Ernst Mayr Theodosius Dobzhansky George Gaylord Simpson Bernhard Rensch Ledyard Stebbins and the population geneticists JBS Haldane Ronald Fisher and Sewall Wright However at the time of Huxleys book several of these had yet to make their distinctive contribution EB Ford and his co workers in ecological genetics were at least as important

He always believed that on a broad view evolution led to advances in organisation Progress without a goal was one of his favourite phrases

In the final chapter of his Evolution the modern synthesis he defines evolutionary progress as a raising of the upper level of biological efficiency this being defined as increased control over and independence of the environment Natural selection plus time produces biological improvement Improvements in biological machinery the limbs and teeth of grazing horses the increase in brain power The eyes of a dragon fly which can see all round it in every direction are an improvement over the mere microscopic eye spots of early forms of life Over the whole range of evolutionary time we see general advance improvement in all the main properties of life including its general organization But improvement is not universal Lower forms manage to survive alongside higher

Huxley was a prominent member of the British Eugenics Society and was Vice President and President Huxley was one of many intellectuals at the time who believed that the lowest class in society was genetically inferior He advocated the virtual elimination of the few lowest and most degenerate types In his writing he used this argument several times no one doubts the wisdom of managing the germ plasm of agricultural stocks so why not apply the same concept to human stocks

In the post war years after the realisation that eugenic ideas had become tainted by the Nazis Huxley coined the term transhumanism to describe the view that man should better himself through science and technology possibly including eugenics but also importantly the improvement of the social environment

In response to the rise of European fascism in the 1930s Huxley was asked to write We Europeans with three other scientists Huxley suggested the word race be replaced with ethnic group After the Second World War he was instrumental in producing the UNESCO statement The Race Question which asserted that A race from the biological standpoint may therefore be defined as one of the group of populations constituting the species Homo sapiens Now what has the scientist to say about the groups of mankind which may be recognized at the present time Human races can be and have been differently classified by different anthropologists but at the present time most anthropologists agree on classifying the greater part of present day mankind into three major divisions as follows The Mongoloid Division The Negroid Division The Caucasoid Division Catholics Protestants Moslems and Jews are not races 

Gertrude Baines was an American woman who was believed to have been the oldest person in the world from the death of Portuguese woman Maria de Jesus on January 2 2009 until her death on September 11 2009 She was the last person known to have been born in 1894 and the oldest ever person to have been born in that year

Gertrude Baines married Sam Conley at a very young age and had one daughter who died of typhoid fever at the age of 18 Baines was known to have been living in Hartford Connecticut before moving to Ohio where she worked as a maid at the Ohio State University She later moved to California where she lived on her own until age 105 She spent her final years at the Western Convalescent Center in Jefferson Park Los Angeles

Reel Big Fish is a ska punk band that started in 1992 in California They have only ever skapunk music but moved more to a rock sound during the album Cheer Up They have had many different members since the start of the band including two different singers and over 10 different horn players They mainly got successful from the album Turn The Radio Off which had the single Sell Out in 1997 their most famous song

A common theme throughout some of their songs is their disapproval of big record companies Reel Big Fish was signed onto Jive Records but after their short lived success the record company neglected them and did not advertise their albums In their 2005 album Were Not Happy Til Youre Not Happy Reel Big Fish directly and indirectly expresses their anger towards their record company in several of their songs

During 2006 Reel Big Fish was dropped from Jive Records The band formed their own label and released a 3 disc live performance CDDVD set Our Live Album Is Better Than Your Live Album This package became available on July 18 2006 on the Internet and in retail stores on August 22 Jive later released a Reel Big Fish greatest hits album Greatest HitAnd More because they owned the rights to all previous songs The band did not approve of or make any money from the album and have spoken out against it

Cape Tribulation is both a headland and small town in northern Queensland Australia Convert110kmmi0lkonabbron north of Cairns It is in the Daintree National Park and the Wet Tropics World Heritage area The first people to live in the area were the Kuku Yalanji The first European to settle in the area was John Moffat in 1880 who set up a farm to grow food for the miners in the west

There is a sealed road to the area from the south from the Daintree River Ferry To the north there is a four wheel drive unsealed road called the Bloomfield Track This goes to the Bloomfield River Wujal Wujal Bloomfield Falls and Cooktown It is often closed during the wet season 

Tribulation means trouble and great suffering Cape Tribulation was named by British explorer Lt James Cook on 10 June 1770 after his ship ran into a coral reef near the headland because here began all our Troubles

Cape Tribulation is in a rainforest and it gets a lot of rain In 2006 the rainfall recorded was over 57 metres

Most people visit the area during the dry season between July and November There are four main resorts to stay in as well as several smaller bed and breakfast places The town has two small supermarkets two ATMs one takeaway food outlet and five restaurants During the wet season marine stingers are common so people swim in the many waterholes There are crocodiles in the creeks

The Great Barrier Reef is very close to the coast only Convert19kmmi0lkonabbron due east There are two boats that take visitors to the reef Other activities available are guided night walks 4 wheel drive tours horseriding kayaking jungle surfing tropical fruit tasting and crocodile cruises

Schefflera actinophylla is a tree in the Araliaceae family It is native to tropical rainforests and gallery forests in Australia New Guinea and Java Common names include Umbrella Tree Octopus Tree and Amate

The elegant schefflera is popular with people who want a big tree size plant In time it will easily reach seven or eight feet in its home environment in Australia it gets to be fifty feet tall

Much of its appeal as a houseplant comes from the unusual leaves A leaf is composed of a number of leaflets all set in a circle around a central stem and stretching out horizontally like the ribs of an umbrella Eash leaflet is a pointy oval size to eight inches long and rich shiny green

As it gets older schefflera loses leaves from the lower part of the stem increasing its tree shape

The broad leaves tend to collect dust and this in turn seems to be attractive to red spider mites To help keep them under control and to keep your plant looking its best keep the leave dusted

This will accommodate itself to our environment reasonable well It will accept normal household temperatures and adapts to different humidity levels With enough sunlight and clean conditions the schefflera will last a long time

A mycorrhiza is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant 

In a mycorrhiza the fungus lives inside the plant roots and in the earth The fungal hyphae are more efficient than plant roots at absorbing nutrients

Mycorrhizas are important for plant growth in many ecosystems At least 80 of all land plant species have mycorrhiza They depend on it for survival They are the most common symbionts in the plant kingdom they involve about 6000 species of fungi and 240000 species of plants

Mycorrhizas are divided onto two main types ectomycorrhiza and endomycorrhiza  The hyphae of ectomycorrhizal fungi do not penetrate individual cells within the root while the hyphae of endomycorrhizal fungi penetrate the cell wall and invaginate the cell membrane 

The mycorrhizal symbiosis is ancient dating to at least 400 million years ago

This mutualism gives the fungus sugars such as glucose and sucrose produced by the plant in photosynthesis The carbohydrates move from their source to the root and then to the fungal partner In return the plant gains the use of the myceliums very large surface area to absorb water and mineral nutrients from the soil especially phosphorus

The mechanisms of increased absorption are both physical and chemical Mycorrhizal mycelia are much smaller in diameter than the smallest root They can explore a greater volume of soil providing a larger surface area for absorption It is estimated that every kilogram of soil contains at least 200 km of fungi strands

Mycorrhizal plants are often more resistant to diseases such as those caused by microbial soil borne pathogens and are also more resistant to the effects of drought These effects are perhaps due to the improved water and mineral uptake in mycorrhizal plants 

Mycorrhiza is especially advantageous to the plant in nutrient poor soils Plants grown in sterile soils and growth media often perform poorly without the addition of spores or hyphae of mycorrhizal fungi to colonise the plant roots and aid in the uptake of soil mineral nutrients The absence of mycorrhizal fungi can also slow plant growth in harsh areas

The fungal partners may also help plant to plant transfer of sugars and other nutrients Such mycorrhizal communities are called common mycorrhizal networks Some species inhabit the tissues inside roots stems and leaves in which case they are called endophytes Similar to mycorrhiza endophytic colonization by fungi may benefit both partners Endophytes of grasses give their host more resistance to grazers and get food and shelter from the plant in return

Mycorrhizal roots offer excellent ecological niches for other microbes Mycorrhizal fungi may host bacteria that complete their life cycles within fungal cells One of the best known is Geosiphon pyriforme which can host cyanobacteria inside characteristic bladders Arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi are unique in hosting bacteria in their cytoplasm Intracellular structures very similar to bacteria were first described in the 1970s Research later identified them as true bacteria

A trampoline is a recreational or competitive device designed to allow users to bounce on It normally consists of a metal frame supporting a flat jumping surface connected to the frame by springs The jumping surface may be of a strong synthetic fabric material or mostly of a mesh design Trampolines allow users to bounce higher by storing energy in the springs as they land on the surface which then accelerates the user back away from the jumping surface as the springs contract

The first modern trampoline was invented by George Nissen in 1920 1922 as a kind of equipment for gymnastics 

During World War II the United States Navy Flight School developed the use of the trampoline in its training of pilots and navigators giving them concentrated practice in spatial orientation that had not been possible before After the war the development of the space flight program again brought the trampoline into use to help train both American and Soviet astronauts giving them experience of variable body positions in flight

Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker OM GCSI CB MD FRS was a British botanist and explorer of the 19th century Hooker was one of the founders of geographical botany and Charles Darwins closest friend He was Director of the Royal Botanical Gardens Kew for twenty years in succession to his father William Jackson Hooker and was awarded the highest honours of British science

The expedition consisted of two ships HMS Erebus and HMS Terror it was the last major voyage of exploration made entirely under sail Hooker was the youngest of the 128 man crew He sailed on the Erebus and was assistant to the ships surgeon who was instructed to collect zoological and geological specimens The ships travelled all over the southern oceans from South America to Australia and New Zealand Hooker made plant collections at each location and while travelling drew these and specimens of algae and sea life pulled aboard using tow nets

After spending 5 months in the Antarctic they returned to resupply in Hobart then went on to Sydney and New Zealand They left New Zealand to return to Antarctica After spending 138 days at sea and a collision between the Erebus and Terror they sailed to the Falkland Islands to Tierra del Fuego back to the Falklands and onward to their third sortie into the Antarctic The ships arrived back in England on 4 September 1843 the voyage had been a success for Ross as it was the first to confirm the existence of the southern continent and chart much of its coastline

On 11 November 1847 Hooker left England for his three year long Himalayan expedition he would be the first European to collect plants in the Himalayas Hookers expedition was based in Darjeeling Hooker wrote to Darwin relaying to him the habits of animals in India and collected plants in Bengal

Hooker and a sizable party of local assistants departed for eastern Nepal on 27 October 1848 They travelled north west along Nepals passes into Tibet In April 1849 he started on a longer expedition into Sikkim but he was imprisoned by the Dewan of Sikkim when they were travelling towards Tibet A British team was sent to negotiate they were released without bloodshed Hooker returned to Darjeeling where he spent January and February 1850 writing his journals replacing specimens lost during his detention and planning a journey for his last year in India

Hookers survey of hitherto unexplored regions the Himalayan Journals was published in 1854

This trip was taken in the autumn of 1860 with Daniel Hanbury They visited and collected in Syria and Palestine no full length report was published but a number of papers were written Hooker recognised three phytogeograpical divisions Western Syria and Palestine Eastern Syria and Palestine Middle and Upper mountain regions of Syria

Hooker visited Morocco from April to June 1871 in the company of John Ball George Maw and a young gardener from Kew called Crump

This was undertaken with his friend Asa Gray the leading American botanist of the day A difficult question was why in the great mountain chains of the Western United States there appeared to be only a few botanical enclaves of plants of eastern Asiatic afinities among plants of Mexican and more southern types Hooker was back in Kew with 1000 dried specimens by October

Some idea of the delights he encountered

His views on the flora of Colorado and Utah There are two temperate and two cold or mountain floras viz 1 a prairie flora derived from the eastward 2 a so called desert and saline flora derived from the west 3 a sub alpine 4 an alpine flora the two latter of widely different origin and in one sense proper to the Rocky Mountain ranges

While on the Erebus Hooker had read proofs of Charles Darwins Voyage of the Beagle provided by Charles Lyell and had been very impressed by Darwins skill as a naturalist They had met once before the Antarctic voyage started After Hookers return to England he was approached by Darwin who invited him to classify the plants that Darwin had collected in South America and the Galpagos Islands Hooker agreed and the pair began a life long friendship On 11 January 1844 Darwin mentioned to Hooker his early ideas on the evolution and natural selection and Hooker showed interest In 1847 he agreed to read Darwins Essay explaining the theory and responded with notes giving Darwin calm critical feedback Their correspondence continued throughout the development of Darwins theory and in 1858 Darwin wrote that Hooker was the one living soul from whom I have constantly received sympathy

Richard Freeman wrote Hooker was Charles Darwins greatest friend and confidant Certainly they had extensive correspondence and they also met face to face Hooker and Lyell were the two people Darwin consulted when Wallaces famous letter arrived at Down House enclosing his paper on natural selection Hooker was instrumental in creating the device whereby the Wallace paper was accompanied by Darwins notes and his letter to Asa Gray in a presentation to the Linnean Society Hooker was the one who formally presented this material to the Linnean Society meeting in 1858 In 1859 the author of The Origin of Species recorded his indebtedness to Hookers wide knowledge and balanced judgment

In December 1859 Hooker published the Introductory Essay to the Flora Tasmaniae the final part of the Botany of the Antarctic Voyage It was in this essay that Hooker announced his support for the theory of evolution by natural selection thus becoming the first recognised man of science to publicly back Darwin

At the historic debate on evolution held at the Oxford on 30 June 1860 Bishop Samuel Wilberforce Benjamin Brodie and Robert FitzRoy spoke against Darwins theory and Hooker and Thomas Henry Huxley defended it According to Hookers own account it was he and not Huxley who delivered the most effective reply to Wilberforces arguments 

Hooker acted as president of the British Association at its Norwich meeting of 1868 when his address was remarkable for its championship of Darwinian theories Hooker was a close friend of Thomas Henry Huxley a member of the X Club and the first of the three X Clubbers in succession to become President of the Royal Society

By his travels and his publications Hooker built up a high scientific reputation at home In 1855 he was appointed Assistant Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew and in 1865 he succeeded his father as Director holding the post for twenty years Under the Hookers the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew rose to world renown At the age of thirty Hooker was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and in 1873 he was chosen as its President He received three of its medals the Royal Medal in 1854 the Copley Medal in 1887 and the Darwin Medal in 1892 He continued to intersperse work at Kew with foreign exploration and collecting His journeys to Palestine Morocco and the United States all produced valuable information and specimens for Kew

Joseph Hooker was a general in the Union Army during the American Civil War He fought Robert E Lee at the Battle of Chancellorsville After the battle he was replaced by George Meade

The Ballets Russes were a company of ballet dancers whose full title was Les Ballets Russes de Serge Diaghilev They became extremely famous in Europe in the early part of the 20th century 

The group was formed and directed by the Russian Sergei Diaghilev The Ballets Russes had more influence on ballet and ballet music than any other ballet company of their time The dancers were from Russia but the group travelled throughout Europe spending a lot of their time based in Paris Stravinsky was one of the many composers who wrote ballet music for them

Sergei Diaghilev was an impresario who was extremely good at spotting good dancers and helping them to rise to great standards He had very good taste in art and music and inspired some great composers to write music for his dancers He got some of the most famous painters of his time to make set designs for his productions

The group was started in 1909 By 1911 they had become a group who toured regularly Many of the dancers had come from the Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg They adapted the productions from the Mariinsky Theatre performing ballets such as Prince Igor Cleopatra and Le Festin and Les Sylphides

During the World War I they were cut off from any contact with Russia During these years they experimented with many new ideas Productions such as Les Biches and Le Train Bleu were about the fashionable society around them At the same time the company also had productions which reflected Russian folklore Greek legends and the Orient

Their fame continued after the war 

When Diaghilev died suddenly in 1929 the Ballets Russes broke up and the dancers moved to other companies Some of them formed the Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo who travelled to America and influenced dancing there

The company worked with several very famous choreographers such as Marius Petipa Michel Fokine Vaslav Nijinsky Leonide Massine and the young George Balanchine Nijinskys dances reflect the art movement called Expressionism Many of his new ideas could be seen in LApres midi dun Faune and The Rite of Spring

The Ballets Russes had many famous dancers Many of them were from the Russian Imperial Theatres and they came to dance for Ballets Russes during the summer months Some of the great dancers include Anna Pavlova Tamara Karsavina Olga Spessivtzeva Mathilde Kschessinska Ida Rubinstein Bronislava Nijinska Lydia Lopokova and Alicia Markova

The company was particularly influential because they treated male dancers as important Up until this time the female dancers had much more attention than the male dancers Among the male dancers were Michel Fokine Serge Lifar Lonide Massine George Balanchine Adolphe Bolm and especially Vaslav Nijinsky who became the greatest dancer of his time

The most famous music composed for Ballets Russes was that by the composer Igor Stravinsky His ballets include The Firebird Petrouchka The Rite of Spring Les Noces and Apollon musagte The first time that The Rite of Spring was performed many in the audience hated it and booed and started to fight Others thought it was brilliant Stravinskys music was original and shocking and Nijinskys choreography went beyond classical ballet technique The audience found it difficult to understand the music and dance They were used to the romantic music and classical ballet of the nineteenth century

Diaghilev also used music which had already been composed This included music by Debussy Ravel Darius Milhaud Prokofiev and other famous composers of the time

The artists and designers who worked for the ballet included some of the 20th centurys most famous names Picasso Bakst Braque Matisse Coco Chanel Mir Dali and Utrillo were some of the best known

Rest mass the mass of a body as measured when the body is at rest but it is relative to an observer who is moving or not an inherent property of the body All matter such as any object has some rest mass Energy such as light or kinetic energy has no rest mass because it causes no change in spacetime in a frozen time frame However energy affects mass while time passes therefore it affects spacetime so it has mass

Sergei Pavlovich Diaghilev was a Russian art critic patron and ballet impresario He formed a ballet company called Les Ballets Russes de Serge Diaghilev Many think it was the greatest ballet company of all time

For twenty years between 1909 and 1929 they were the most famous ballet company in the world Many of their ideas influenced art and music as well as dance Diaghilev got some of the worlds greatest painters to design sets for his productions and some great composers including Igor Stravinsky to compose music for the ballets

His dancers included the legendary Nijinsky and the Imperial prima ballerina Karsavina also Pavlova Danilova and Spessivtseva His choreographers included Fokine Nijinska Massine and Balanchine his composers included Stravinsky Rimsky Korsakov Prokofiev Ravel and Debussy his set designers included Picasso Cezanne Matisse Utrillo Bakst and Braque Cocteau worked as an artist and wrote scenarios The ballets created and the performances changed the course of ballet history

Diaghilevs gift lay in spotting talent and bringing great artists to work together He also persuaded patrons to support the Ballets Russes The production costs were enormous and were not always covered by the ticket prices The repertoire of new ballets and new music grew and the productions were not always successful Diaghilevs company folded soon after his death though many of the group worked together in new companies

After 1815 the young prince known as Franz lived in Austria He was awarded the title of Duke of Reichstadt in 1818

He was very close to Princess Sophie of Bavaria and it has been said that he was the father of her son the future ill fated Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico This idea has not found acceptance 

Napolon II died of tuberculosis at Schnbrunn Palace in Vienna on 22 July 1832 It was said that Sophie never recovered after his death and that she blamed it on Metternich for the rest of her life

On 15 December 1940 his remains were moved from Vienna to the dome of Les Invalides in Paris This a gift to France by the German dictator Adolf Hitler Coming from Hitler this gift was not appreciated by the French people The remains of Napoleon I had been moved there on 15 December 1840 For some time the young prince was buried beside his father Later his remains were moved again into the lower church While most of his remains are in Paris his heart and intestines are still in Vienna The heart is in Urn 42 in the Heart Crypt and his intestines are in Urn 76 of the Ducal Crypt

Initiation is a ceremony at the entrance or acceptance into a group or society It can also be a formal admission to adulthood in a community Examples of initiation ceremonies are Christian baptism or confirmation Jewish bar or bat mitzvah acceptance into a fraternal organization like the freemasons or religious order like the Benedictines or graduation from school A person taking the initiation ceremony is called an initiate

Tribes often have initiations In many African tribes initiation means circumcision of males and sometimes circumcisiongenital mutilation of females as well Initiation is thought to be necessary for the individual to be regarded as a full member of the tribe Otherwise the individual may not be allowed to take part in ceremonies or even in social ritual such as marriage A man will not be allowed to marry or have any special relationship with a woman who didnt go to an initiation because she is not considered as a woman

Initiation may be thought of as an event which may help teens prepare themselves to be good husbands and wives Because of modernization initiation is not taken so seriously as before but there are still certain areas which still perform initiations

In some African tribes boys have initiation rites for 34 months and girls for 12 months

Australian Aboriginal tribes usually had long periods of time to help prepare adolescent boys teaching them the Law before they were ready to attend large elaborate ceremonies at the time of initiation when they were finally recognized as men in their society Most tribes had circumcision and scarification as part of the male initiation rituals while many Central Australian tribes also practiced subincision

In Judaism a Bar Mitzvah is a Jewish boy and a Bat Mitzvah a Jewish girl who has turned 13 years old and who has gone through a ceremony that represents acceptance of some responsibilities which symbolizes their coming of age The terms are also used for the ceremony celebrating this event 

According to Jewish law when Jewish children reach the age of majority they become responsible for their actions and become a Bar or Bat Mitzvah This is also the time when physical puberty normally begins Before this the childs parents have the responsibility that the child follows Jewish law and tradition and after this age children have their own responsibility for Jewish ritual law tradition and ethics and have the right to take part in all areas of Jewish community life

Swing voters are people who vote who do not always vote for the same party Their vote is called a swing vote

The swing vote is often closely studied when there are elections because it often decides who wins the election In many elections parties try to convince the swing voters and the people who vote for the first time to vote for them In contrast to the swing voters there are other voters who have always voted for the same party in the past A campaign for a vote therefore often focuses less on keeping the people who will always vote for their party the parties spend more effort and money on convincing new people to vote for them

Volgograd formerly called Tsaritsyn and Stalingrad is an important industrial city and the administrative center of Volgograd Oblast Russia It is 80 km long north to south on the western bank of the Volga River and has a population of 1011 millon people The city was made famous for its heroic resistance and extensive damage during the Battle of Stalingrad during World War II

The problem of evil is the question whether evil exists and if so does it disprove the existence of God Certain religions say there is a god who is all loving all knowing and all powerful In these religions the question to answer is how an all loving and all powerful god could allow evil to exist 

Responses include the argument that if there is free will evil must necessarily exist that humans cannot understand God that evil is simply being without god or that there is evil because the world is corrupted and fallen 

A version of the problem of evil perhaps by Epicurus goes as follows 

Another argument goes 

Arguments such as these are about the logical problem of evil They attempt to show that the assumed propositions lead to a logical contradiction and cannot therefore all be correct 

A common response is that God can exist with and allow evil in order to achieve a greater good Some philosophers accept that arguments such as God allows evil in order to achieve the greater good of free will are logically possible and thus solve the logical problem of evil Since the aim is only to defeat the assertion that God and evil are logically incompatible even a highly implausible instance of Gods coexistence with evil is sufficient for the purpose

Philosophies of science have approached the problem from the angle of empiricism For logical positivism the issue with God is the lack of any independent method of verification In their view this makes the proposition God exists not true or false but meaningless A similar position points to the lack of any way the proposition might be falsified

The Argument from inconsistent revelations is an argument that says that God probably does not exist There are many religions which are based on revelations The problem with these revelations is that they contradict each other A person must either accept or reject at least one of these revelations in order to be part of a religious group That way accepting one means rejecting some of the others Unless the revelation is personal the follower must to some extent rely on the judgment or the stories of others Assuming the revelation is personal the follower is still ignoring the revelations of those before him

Christians believe that Jesus is the savior of the world and the son of God Jews believe just as strongly that he is not Similarly Muslims believe that the Quran was divinely authored while Jews and Christians do not There are many examples of such contrasting views Positions where one religion contradicts another or where one group of people contradicts another are common There are many denominations in Christianity who do not agree about many things

A deadlock is a situation wherein two or more competing actions are waiting for the other to finish As a consequence neither ever does It is often seen in a paradox like the chicken or the egg

In computer science deadlock refers to a specific condition when two or more processes are each waiting for each other to release a resource It can also be that more than two processes are waiting for a number of resources Deadlock is a common problem in multiprocessing where many processes share a specific type of mutually exclusive resource known as a software lock or soft lock Computers intended for the time sharing or real time markets are often equipped with a hardware lock which guarantees exclusive access to processes This forces the prforcing serialized access Deadlocks are particularly troubling because there is no general solution to avoid deadlocks

This situation may be likened to two people who are drawing diagrams with only one pencil and one ruler between them If one person takes the pencil and the other takes the ruler a deadlock occurs when the person with the pencil needs the ruler and the person with the ruler needs the pencil to finish his work with the ruler Both requests cant be satisfied so a deadlock occurs

The telecommunications description of deadlock is a little stronger deadlock occurs when none of the processes meet the condition to move to another state and all the communication channels are empty The second condition is often left out on other systems but is important in the telecommunication context

A False analogy is an informal fallacy It apples to inductive arguments It is an informal fallacy because the error is about what the argument is about and not the argument itself

An analogy proposes that two concepts which arer similar have a common relationship to some property A has property X therefore B must also have property X In a false analogy the objects may have some similarities but they do not both have property X That way both objects may have the same color but this does not mean that they have the same size Even if bananas and the sun appear yellow one could not conclude that they are the same size One who makes an invalid analogy or comparison is often said to be comparing apples and oranges

The following are examples of false analogies 

Lord Berners whose full name was Gerald Hugh Tyrwhitt Wilson 14th Baron Berners was a British composer of classical music novelist and painter He is usually called Lord Berners He was an amateur composer who is remembered for his strange eccentric behaviour

Bernerss music is full of Romantic feeling irony and parody He wrote a lot for the theatre He composed The Triumph of Neptune in 1926 for Diaghilevs Ballets Russes His music could often be described as light music 

Berners started his strange behaviour when he was quite small He had heard that a dog could be taught to swim by throwing it into water so he decided to teach his dog to fly by throwing it out of the window The dog was not hurt but Berners was given a beating

The term race or racial group refers to the broken wikt linksubdivisionsubdivision of the human species based on broken wikt linkdistinguishingdistinguishing physical characteristics that are passed on to succeeding generations There are people who come from mixed races and have faced identity issues As more people mix it may turn into a race all on its own if there are distinguishing physical characteristics that differ from another race The most widely used human racial categories are based on salient visual traits and self identification

Some scientists argue that although race is a safe taxonomic concept in other species it cannot be applied to humans The biologists view of race varies a lot at time from the social version of race 

More recent genetic studies indicate that skin colour may change radically over as few as 25 generations or about 2500 years given the influence of the environment

ImageHuxley racespngthumb275pxHuxleys rather complex map of apparent racial categories from On the Geographical Distribution of the Chief Modifications of Mankind legenda143081 Bushmen  

Huxley states It is to the Xanthochroi and Melanochroi taken together that the absurd denomination of Caucasian is usually applied

The usual criteria involved over the years to define people by common non scientific list of physical features The belief was those who looked alike were derived from a common ancestor In Europe the people of the World divided in to 4 or in some cases 5 categories based on skin colour and to a degree the shape of the face as well The categories were as follows by Victorian times 

By about the First World War the scientifically inclined Europeans were sub dividing the White race in to 3 or 4 supposed sub races which were 

There was much prejudice based upon this perception of the world as the Europeans and Orientals both regarded them selves as superior to the other skin colours This all lead to racism a non scientific theory or ideology that a particular race had become superior or inferior to another via natural selection It advocated that in the races that make up the human race there are deep biologically determined differences which should not be crossed because it is extremely undesirable It also states races should live separately and not intermarry A supporter of racism is called a racist These attitudes in turn created the horrors of African slavery Apartheid the Jim Crow laws Nazism and Japanese imperialism

The mid 20th century racial classification by American anthropologist Carleton S Coon divided humanity into five races

In his landmark book The Races of Europe Coon defined the Caucasian Race as encompassing the regions of Europe Central Asia South Asia the Middle East North Africa and Northeast Africa His work drew some charges of obsolete thinking or outright racism from a few critics but some of the terminology he employed continues to be used even today although the oid suffixes now have in part taken on negative connotations

In the 21st Century Coons role came under further critical scrutiny when Prof John P Jackon Jr noted that the American Coon actively aided the segregationist cause in violation of his own standards for scientific objectivity

Social Darwinism refers to various ideologies based on a concept that competition is active among all individuals or even whole nations as social evolution in human societies 

It is a social adaptation of the theory of natural selection as first invented by Charles Darwin Natural selection explains success in various animal populations as the outcome of competition between any individual organisms for limited resources popularly known as survival of the fittest a term first used by either Herbert Spencer or Andrew Carnegie 

Fascist movements have commonly held social darwinist views of nations races and societies InNazi Germany the Nazis used social Darwinism to promote their racialist idea of the German nation was part of the Aryan race and believed in the competition of races The Nazis tried to strengthen the Aryan race in Germany by murdering those they regarded as weakerJews Slavs Gypsies and disabled people

It was believed until recently that race and IQ were connected The fact that environment such as schooling and alcohol consumptionboozing has a significant effect on IQ undermines the case for the use of IQ data as a source of genetic information 

This prejudice was partially applied in Europe and the USA to both the Irish Australian Aborigines Native American Indians Blacks Gypsies Albanians Italians Slavic Russians and Russias Chechens tribes

In the late 18th century Europeans began using the term Aryan to refer to the original prehistoric Proto Indo Europeans and their descendants up to the present day It was also assumed at the time that Aryans were a naturally culturally superior people By the late 19th century some Europeans began to use the name Aryan for only the Nordic peoples of Europe as a pure noble and racially superior race they claimed were descended from the original Aryan tribes The theory that the Aryans first came from Europe became especially popular in Germany and to a lesser degree in Austria and Hungary

There was much prejudice based upon this perception of the world as the Europeans and Orientals both regarded them selves as superior to the other skin colours which lead to the horrors of African slavery Apartheid the Jim Crow Laws Nazism and Japanese imperialism The accidental misinterpretation of the works of Charles Darwin only helped to fuel the non scientific opinions of race and racial superiority

When Europeans came to America they killed thousands of Native Americans and when the European settlers got to Australia they started killing of large numbers of Aborigines In both cases they regarded the native people as predestined to be inferior and not worth helping This view was based on the Europeans opinions on Darwinism and how it could be used to judge the value of the native peoples 

With the birth of there empires many other native tribes suffered in Canada New Zealand China Pakistan Bangladesh and India 

Japan also held similar beliefs about Chinese and Koreans in their colonies

Racism in the UK Ireland and France was usually about limiting the rights of Jews Gypsies and minorities like the French Basques

As the countries became independent after the 1950s many migrated to the UK and France but were decremented against Some British cafes and hotels would not welcome in Caribbean guests and the French made Arabs feel unwelcome in some French towns as well Since the 1960s India Pakistani and Bangladeshi people have moved to the UK and were victimised and Packy bashed The horror of 911 2001 has heightened the French and British fears about Islam and Arabs in general Polish and Brazilian migrant labours are also discriminated against in some places Racist parties like the UKs British National Party and National Front trade on these fears to get votes

Alleged scientific findings of racial differences were used by Nazi Germany to justify the racialist policy with its concept of Grodeutschland and the Nordic racecial idea The Nazis attitude towards the Jews were Anti Semitic and falsely blamed them for Germanys defeat in World War I and the Great Depression The Nazis and some of their anti Semitic allies like Hungary committed genocide against the Jews during the Holocaust of World War II 

Both the Nazis and Romanias Iron Guard also persecuted the Gypsies who were considered part of the allegedly inferior Indic race During World War II the Nazis embarked on systematic attempt at genocide of the RomaniesGypsies known as the Porajmos The Nazis also knowingly killed of thousands of Slavs lesbians Communists liberals and gays

Most Germans and Austrians are ashamed of this but Hungary has yet to really face up to what it did to the Roma Support for the racist Jobbik party rises

Fascist Benito Mussolini in a 1919 speech to denounce Soviet Russia claimed that Jewish bankers in London and New York City were bound by the chains of race to Moscow and claimed that 80 percent of the Soviet leaders were Jews

Many Italian fascists held anti Slavist views especially against neighbouring Yugoslav nations who they saw as being in competition with Italy which had laid claim to the Yugoslavias region of Dalmatia

Mussolini said Italy would get its own way and was willing to use force to settle arguments An early example was Italys bombardment of the Greek island of Corfu in 1923 Soon after he succeeded in setting up a puppet regime in Albania and crushed a rebellion in Libya which had been an Italian colony since 1912

Italy like Germany Austria and Hungary mistakenly regarded all Slavs and Gypsies as stupid racially inferior due to the effects of Social Darwinism and undeserving of there basic rights Anti Arab discrimination was also used in parts of Libya 

Some Italians still hate Arab Gypsy and Romanian immigrants today

The Iron Guard was an antisemitic fascist movement and political party in Romania from 1927 to 1941 They despised and denounced both Jews and Gypsies 

Some Romanian people still support these prejudice views even today

American racism has been a major issue in the country since before its founding Historically dominated by socially and ethnically diverse White settler society race in the United States as a concept became significant in relation to other groups Generally racist attitudes in the country have been most onerously applied to Native Americans African Americans and some foreign seeming action against Mexican immigrants among others The Chinese Japanese and Irish had trouble in America during the 19th Century but the Blacks fell foul of the Jim Crow Laws which once racially separated the racist parts of America between Blacks and Whites These first emerged in the late 19th Century and lasted to the mid 1960s and the Voting Rights Act of 1965

Millions of Africans were killed while they were held as prisoners or as slaves by the Europeans and Arabs The African American people and some others call this The Black Holocaust

South African Apartheid laws were a system was used to deny many rights of Non white people The laws allowed the white minority to keep the Black majority out of certain areas Black people had to carry special papers or have permission to live and work in particular areas Whites opposed intermarriage with non whites and Coloured people were also discriminated against but not as badly as the Non whites The Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act of 1949 prohibited marriage between persons of different races and the Immorality Act of 1950 made sexual relations with a person of a different race a criminal offence The Blacks suffered greatly and were even banned from voteing at one point

The Imperial Rule Assistance Association was a coalition of fascist and nationalist political movements of Japan such as the Imperial Way Faction and the Society of the East It was formed under the guidance of Japanese Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe Prior to creation of the IRAA Konoe had already effectively nationalized strategic industries the news media and labour unions in preparation for total war with China Japan needed more land minerals and colonies so they annexed Korea Manchuria and part of China The Japanese regarded the Chines Koreans and Europeans as an inferior race that should be crushed and exploited

When Konoes successor Hideki Tj took over the IRAA he attempted to establish himself as the absolute leader or Shogun of Japan under the Emperor of Japan

Some Japanese still believe that they did not commit as many massacres as the Western World and China said they did

With the revelations of what the Holocaust had done to its victims and how the civil rights movement tried to liberate the Afro Caribbeans from racist White supremacist rule in South Africa and the southern USA the old ideas about race were swept away along with the prejudices that followed in its wake Blacks could vote in South Africa after a 50 year ban and the word Nigger fell out use

In some cases positive discrimination the ethnics 1st laws and political correctness have taken the situation to the opposite extreme leading to accusations in the UK USA and Australia of reveres racism that is to say racism in favor not against the ethnic minorities Political correctness is a term applied to language ideas policies or behavior seen as seeking to minimize offense to gender racial cultural disabled aged or other identity groups Conversely the term politically incorrect is used to refer to language or ideas that may cause offense or that are unconstrained by orthodoxy or good manners

The United States is now a diverse country and in 2006 it became the third nation in world history to reach 300 million people China and India each each got just over 1 billion people in them

In biology a race is group of organisms These will usually be all of the same species They form a population a group within that species Sometimes this is called a subspecies Each organism is able to breed with any other organism within the same species For various reasons like geographical separation most organisms will breed with other organisms of the same population This will mean that phenotypes that are common to most individuals of the population will become more prominent

Genetic drift is the random change in gene frequencies between generations but a few individuals may leave behind more descendants and thus genes than other individuals The genes of the next generation will be the genes of these lucky individuals children not necessarily the healthier or better individuals children

A Plinian eruption is a kind of volcanic eruption which is similar to that of Mount Vesuvius in the year 79 AD It is named after Pliny the Younger who wrote the only surviving eyewitness account of the eruption That eruption of Vesuvius killed Pliny the Elder the uncle of Pliny the Younger

Plinian eruptions have columns of gas and volcanic ash high into the stratosphere There is a large amount of pumice broken wikt linkejectionejected into the atmosphere and very powerful gas blast eruptions

Short eruptions can end in less than a day Longer ones can take several days to months These eruptions begin with clouds of volcanic ash and occasionally pyroclastic flows Sometimes the amount of magma erupted is so large that the top of the volcano collapses This leaves a caldera behind Fine ash can deposit over large areas Plinian eruptions often happen with loud noises such as those created by Krakatoa

Some examples of large Plinian eruptions that formed calderas include the following

The lava is usually rhyolitic and has a lot of silicates Basaltic lavas are unusual for Plinian eruptions the most recent example is the 1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera

Pliny wrote about what his uncles did after first seeing the eruption

Pliny the Elder went to rescue some of the victims He sailed across the Bay of Naples to Stabiae Pliny the Younger wrote an account of his death and suggested that he collapsed and died through inhaling poisonous gases emitted by the volcano His body was found buried under the ashes of the Vesuvius with no apparent injuries on 26 August after the plume had dispersed This confirmed the death through asphyxiation or poisoning

Charles father died in 1765 which left Charles oldest surviving brother Louis Auguste to succeed their father in the capacity of Dauphin the French equivalent to a crown prince or heir apparent Charles mother Marie Josphe never recovered from the loss of her husband and she died in March 1767 from tuberculosis This left Charles an orphan at the age of nine

Throughout the 1770s Charles spent lavishly He accumulated enormous debts which Louis XVI paid for him in the early 1780s Their brother the comte de Provence also accumulated debts of a similar magnitude which Louis XVI also paid off

His political awakening started with the first great crisis of the monarchy in 1786 after which he headed the reactionary faction at the court of Louis XVI The comte dArtois supported the removal of the aristocracys financial privileges but was opposed to any reduction in the social privileges enjoyed by both the Church and the nobility

When the French Revolutionary Wars broke out in 1792 Charles escaped to Great Britain King George III of Great Britain welcomed the comte dArtois warmly and gave him a generous allowance He lived in Edinburgh and London with his mistress Louise de Polastron After the accession of Louis XVIII to the French throne Charles returned to France where he headed the ultraroyalist party of reaction

Charles first act as King of France was to grant the style of Royal Highness to his cousins of the cadet branch of the House of Bourbon the Orlans Because the Duke of Orleans had voted the death of his brother Louis XVI Louis XVIII had greatly disliked the Orlans family However Charles intended it to create a unified House of BourbonHis favoritism during his reign toward the Roman Catholic Church and the aristocracy aroused great opposition leading to the revolution of July 1830

Charles X is a strong believer in absolutism and rejected the Charter of the French Liberties which is issued by his predecessor and brother Louis XVIII In July 1830 he suspended the legislature limited the right to vote and restricted the press Liberals and radicals responded forcefully to the absolute king In Paris angry citizens threw up barricades across the narrow streets Others fired the soldiers and throw stones and roof tiles The revolutionary tricolor flew from the towers of Notre Dame cathedral Charles was forced to abdicate He again went into exile in Britain He was succeeded by his cousin Louis Philippe son of the Duke of Orleans who had supported the French Revolution

Charles caught cholera when he arrived in Gorizia Italy He died on November 6 1836 The townspeople draped their windows in black to mourn him Charles was buried in the Church of the Annunciation of Our Lady in the Franciscan Kostanjevica Monastery

Mark Oliver Everett his alternate persona Mr E and Eels are all the same person Mark Oliver Everett is his birth name Mr E is his nickname which he began calling himself as a teenager because it sounded mysterious Also many of his friends made fun of him because his initials spelled out MOE which he hated

Unlike most traditional rock bands Eels rarely plays with the same combinations of members twice Mark Everett is the only constant member meaning that he is the only one who plays on every single album and live show All other members are friends of his who contribute other instruments to the albums and concerts and most of them are in other bands such as Aysa and Chloe from the pop band Smoosh Many do not use their real names as Everett does for instance bassist Koool G Murder performed on the albums Souljacker and Hombre Lobo and has played bass at most shows on the tours for both albums

Each Eels concert is different Most feature the members who perform the song on the album playing the instruments that they did on that song although many are acoustic sets meaning that Mark Everett simply sings and plays piano all by himself A lot of songs that Eels perform live are covers and songs that have never appeared on any albums

Everetts next album as E was Broken Toy Shop The cover art which depicts Everett sitting in the center of a toy city has been said to be his least favorite album cover out of all his releases This would be Everetts last album using his real name or his pseudonym E as Eels first album Beautiful Freak featuring bassist Tommy Walter and drummer Butch was released in 1996

In 1998 Everett became the only living member of his family after his sister killed herself and his mother died of lung cancer He wrote 16 songs about his sadness that later became his next Eels album Electro Shock Blues featuring Butch from the last album Butch and Everett would also be the only members to appear on 2000s Daisies of the Galaxy

In 2001 Everett participated in a philosophical vacation on which he was not alllowed to write or speak for religious reasons Finding himself inspired he broke the rules and wrote 12 songs that would later become Souljacker with Koool G Murder Butch Joe Gore John Parish and Adam Siegel During this time he had stopped shaving and his beard had begun to grow very long as shown in this picture Today Everetts beard is even longer and the most recent Eels album features songs that Everett wrote about how the beard made him look and feel more dangerous

Following Souljacker Eels released Shootenanny an album that drew a lot of negative attention to the band for Everetts inappropriate behavior at press events to support the album In an interview with an Australian television show about rock music Everett joked about the interviewer waking him up after having sex with a prostitute and doing heroin the night before Also Everett was asked to write a review of the diaries of Kurt Cobain his review was a single sentence Please dont do this to me after I die Eels subsequent release Blinking Lights and Other Revelations a double disc concept album about a journey through life but not in a chronological order was much more well received

In addition to these studio albums Eels has also released one Best Of collection six live albums two collections of unreleased material a book by Everett about his father and has written songs for eleven movies including all three Shrek films

A patent troll is an unkind phrase used to describe a company or person that owns a patent and tries to get other people to pay a lot of money for the right to use the patent The patent troll usually asks for an amount of money that is less than defending a lawsuit 

A patent troll is different from other patent owners for two reasons First the patent troll usually does not make or sell anything products itself Second a patent troll is also not usually the inventor The patent troll instead buys the patent from other companies and usually very cheap because the other company was going out of business

Patent trolls make a lot of people unhappy because the money paid is a lot like a tax The term troll itself is meant to invoke the image from fairy tales of a mean monster living under a bridge that makes people pay to cross the bridge

The Monarch is an insect and a butterfly It is put in the family category of Nymphalidae It is the most well known butterfly in North America

Monarchs are known for their long annual migration In North America they travel long distances in the fall and again in the spring They migrate south beginning in August If they dont make it to frost free areas during this time the frost and cold temperatures will kill them A migration towards the north happens in the spring No single individual makes the whole round trip

The wings are orange with black edges and veins The male has a spot on his bottom wing It is called an androconium The spot gives out broken wikt linkscentscents to attract females The wingspan ranges from 89 to 102 centimeters The Viceroy butterfly is similar It has an extra black band across the bottom wing 

The Monarch caterpillar is banded with yellow black and white stripes The head is also striped with yellow and black There are four black body extensions two on each end of the body They look similar to antennae The caterpillar will be as long as 5 centimeters

Description The Monarch butterfly has a wingspan that ranges from 89 to 102 centimeters The upper side of the wings is orange with black veins and black wing margins There are white spots in the black wing margins The male has a small black spot on his bottom wing This spot gives out scents to help the female find and mate with the male This spot is called an androconium The female does not have an androconium on her bottom wing The underside of the wings is a tan orange color with black veins The wing margins are black with white spots in them 

A white form of the Monarch has been seen in Australia New Zealand Indonesia and the United States It has been seen as early as 1896 It was named nivosus by lepidopterists It is grayish white in all areas of the wings that are normally orange The white form makes up about 1 or less of all Monarchs except for on Oahu Hawaii where it has kept populations as high as 10

In North America the Monarch is found from southern Canada to northern South America It sometimes wanders to western Europe sometimes as far as Greece It reaches Europe from being transported by USA ships It can also wander to Europe by flying there if weather and wind conditions are right It has also been found in Bermuda Hawaii the Solomons New Caledonia New Zealand Australia New Guinea Ceylon India the Azores and the Canary Islands

Monarch butterflies are known for their long annual migration In North America they make large migrations towards the south starting in August until the first frost A migration towards the north takes place in the spring No single individual makes the whole round trip Female Monarchs lay eggs for the next generation during these migrations

By the end of October the Monarchs that are east of the Rocky Mountains migrate to Mexico They migrate to the broken wikt linksanctuarysanctuaries of the Mariposa Monarca Biosphere Reserve in the Mexican states of Michoacn and Mexico Most of the Monarchs that are west of the Rocky Mountains do not travel all the way down to Mexico Instead they overwinter in many places in central and southern California

While in Mexico the Monarchs gather in very large numbers to rest They perch on suitable trees and bushes by broken wikt linkclingclinging with their feet They cling to each other making layers and layers of resting Monarchs overwintering This was discovered by Dr Fred Urquhart of the University of Toronto who studied Monarch butterflies for nearly forty years He knew the Monarchs migrated because he would stop seeing them after a certain time of the year He put a label on each Monarch he found On this label was his name address and a request to send him the butterfly if it was found

A few months later people from all over North America and Mexico began returning his labelled butterflies to him Mexico was the southernmost area from which he had received a butterfly so he started traveling there to look for the Monarchs For many years he traveled to Mexico There he climbed through jungles walked through forests and talked to the people he found He finally heard there was a place west of Mexico City where people had seen lots of Monarchs all together After a long search he finally found millions of Monarch butterflies covering every part of the area

During the spring migration the population that is east of the Rocky Mountains may reach as far north as Texas and Oklahoma The second third and fourth generations return to their northern places in the United States and Canada in the spring

The Monarch can be found in many different kinds of habitats When it is breeding it is found in habitats with milkweed Some of these habitats include fields meadows prairies parks in or near cities gardens and roadsides The Monarch can be found in almost any kind of habitat during migration It overwinters in pine cypress and eucalyptus groves in California It overwinters in fir forests and pine groves in Mexico

Much of the Monarchs breeding habitat is not very good anymore In some states and provinces milkweed is thought to be a weed In these places the milkweed is killed to keep livestock from eating it and becoming sick With fewer milkweed plants the Monarch does not have as much habitat to breed in

The Monarch butterfly goes through complete metamorphosis

The female lays her eggs one by one They are laid on the underside of the leaves of caterpillars food plant The eggs are light yellow Freshly laid eggs are creamy white After three to four days they turn dark gray The egg usually weighs about 054 milligrams It is about 12 millimeters long Its diameter is about 087 millimeters

The caterpillar broken wikt linkhatchhatches out of the egg The young caterpillar is a gray black color with a black head After the first molt the caterpillar is banded with yellow black and white stripes The head is also striped with yellow and black There are four black body extensions two on each end of the body They look similar to antennae The caterpillar will reach a length of 5 centimeters The caterpillar eats the leaves and flowers of the food plant It make no nests or shelters It grows very quickly and because of this it molts four to five times

After the caterpillar molts one last time it makes a chrysalis A chrysalis is not the same as a cocoon The Monarch caterpillar attaches its back end to a support and hangs downward in the shape of the letter J The inside of the caterpillars body begins to change and it splits its skin to form the blue green chrysalis The blue green chrysalis has a band of black and bright gold near the top There are other gold spots lower down After spending many weeks in the chrysalis the adult finally comes out as a butterfly

The Viceroy is similar to but is smaller than the Monarch It has an extra black band across the bottom wing that the Monarch does not have

The Queen is dark reddish brown instead of orange It does not have black veins There are white spots on the top wing submarginal area These spots are on both the upper side and the underside

The Soldier is also dark reddish brown instead of orange It has thin black veins The underside of the bottom wing has a dark center It has light brown square shaped spots around the dark center

Monarchs are bad tasting and poisonous They are poisonous because of a chemical known as cardenolide The chemical slows the heart beat of vertebrates Monarch caterpillars get this chemical when they feed on milkweed When the Monarch becomes a butterfly it no longer eats milkweed but it still has the chemical in its body The butterfly shows that they are not good to eat with their bright orange and black wings This is known as aposematic coloration A bird may try to eat a Monarch but it will become sick and vomit after eating it After this experience the bird learns not to eat another Monarch

The Viceroy is similar looking to the Monarch but the Viceroy does not have the milkweed poison in its body Birds that have had the bad experience of eating a Monarch will usually not eat a Viceroy It is an example of Mllerian mimicry

Overwintering Monarchs in Mexico are often eaten by Black headed Grosbeaks These birds are immune to the glycoside Other birds such as orioles and jays have learned to eat only the thoracic muscles and the body parts inside the abdomen These parts have less poison than the rest of the body Some mice are also immune to large amounts of the poison Over time overwintering Monarchs become less poisonous This makes them more likely to be eaten by predators In Mexico about 14 of the overwintering Monarchs are eaten by birds and mice

On Oahu Hawaii there is a white form of the Monarch This is because two species of birds have been introduced The two birds are known as the Red vented Bulbul and the Red whiskered Bulbul They were introduced in 1965 and 1966 They are now the most common insectivore birds They are probably the only birds that eat insects as big as the Monarch Monarchs in Hawaii have low cardiac glycoside levels but the birds may be immune to the chemical The two bird species eat the caterpillars and sometimes the chrysalids They look for them on branches and the underside of leaves in milkweed bushes The birds also eat resting adults and egg laying females They eat flying Monarchs less often The white form has a higher chance of living than the orange one The white form does not fit the birds search image of a normal Monarch and so it is not eaten This kind of defense is known as apostatic selection The white form is also camouflaged in patches of light shining through groups of leaves

Parasites include the tachinid flies Sturmia convergens and Lesperia archippivora Caterpillars that have the Lesperia archippivora maggots inside them will finish their last molt They will then hang upside down on a horizontal surface They die before they turn into a chrysalis At that time one white maggot comes out of the caterpillar The maggot then forms a brown pupa on the ground

The bacteria Micrococcus flacidifex danai also infects the caterpillar and causes black death Just before turning into a chrysalis the caterpillar will find a horizontal surface They die a few hours later The body turns black shortly after The bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes infections in weakened insects It is a common cause of death in insects that are raised in laboratories

The Monarch is the state insect of Alabama Idaho Illinois Minnesota and Texas It is the state butterfly of Vermont and West Virginia It was nominated in 1990 as the national insect of the United States of America It was nominated along with the honeybee However the legislation did not pass

Many people like to attract Monarchs by growing a butterfly garden with the plant Asclepias physocarpa Others like raising them for fun or for educational purposes broken wikt linksanctuarySanctuaries have been made for migrating Monarchs The sanctuaries are found at the Monarchs favorite overwintering places These migrations can create a lot of tourism revenue

Many schools also enjoy caring for Monarchs They start with caterpillars When the caterpillars mature into butterflies they are then set free into the wild

Some organizations such as the Cape May Bird Observatory have Monarch labeling programs Labels are placed on the wing of the butterfly The labels have information on them This helps scientists track the Monarchs during their migration It also helps the scientists study the paths that the Monarchs take on their migration

Adult Monarchs have been seen on a number of different nectar plants Here is a list of some of them

Males will also take in water and minerals from damp soil and small wet rocks This is known as puddling The Monarch has also been seen puddling at an oil stain on pavement

Here is a list of plants that the Monarch caterpillar feeds on

Naturalism is the idea or belief that nothing exists beyond the natural world

It is a kind of philosophy called metaphysical because it covers everything nature is all there is and all basic truths are truths of nature 

All the things and powers which are commonly called supernatural such as God souls or witchcraft do not exist according to this position 

Methodological or scientific naturalism is specifically concerned with practical methods for acquiring knowledge 

Many scientists use the scientific method for their research The results they get from this research are independent of their beliefs or religious views Hypotheses are be explained and tested only by reference to natural causes and events

Explanations for observations are only useful when they are based on hypotheses of natural causes An explanation that relies on a natural mechanism that works according to certain rules is usable Explanations that need miracles to work are not Methodological naturalism is the principle underlying all of modern science 

Some philosophers extend this idea so that it can be applied to all of philosophy as well Science and philosophy according to this view are said to form a continuum WV Quine George Santayana and other philosophers have advocated this view

A number of other philosophical ideas are similar to naturalism

The Rite of Spring is a piece of music and a ballet The music was composed by Igor Stravinsky for a ballet of the same name The ballet was performed by Diaghilevs Ballets Russes with choreography by Nijinsky The set design and costumes were by the archaeologist and painter Nicholas Roerich The premire was in Paris in 1913

The ballet and its music is often called by its French title Le Sacre du Printemps It is one of the most famous pieces of music of the 20th century and it had a big influence on many composers It is the start of modernism in music The music has very complicated rhythms and strange chords that people were not used to at the time They were more used to Romantic ballet music such as that by Tchaikovsky 

The effect was sensational People started to fight in the theatre because some hated the music while others thought it brilliant This made everybody want to hear it and so it became well known and people got used to the new sounds

The music lasts about 40 minutes and is divided into two parts It has the subtitle Pictures from Pagan Russia Stravinsky had the idea of composing music which was about country people from old times in Russia who danced a fertility rite This means a ceremony which is supposed to bring good luck to the next years harvest In this ancient Russian dance one young girl is chosen to dance and dance until she dies She is the sacrifice She is sacrificed to the god of spring

The painter Nicholas Roerich talked with Stravinsky about the idea for this ballet in 1910 Stravinsky started writing down musical ideas while he was still working on his ballet The Firebird Then he worked on Petrushka In 1912 he was able to concentrate on The Rite of Spring All these ballets were composed for Sergei Diaghilevs Ballets Russes They were a very famous group of Russian dancers who worked in Europe mostly in Paris

The Rite of Spring was first performed by the Ballets Russes on 29 May 1913 at the Thtre des Champs lyses in Paris The conductor was Pierre Monteux The audience were shocked at the primitive kind of dancing and the irregular rhythms and strange orchestral sounds and unusual chords Nijinskys choreography was so different from classical ballet Nijinsky found it difficult to work with Stravinsky and difficult to work with the music

The complicated music and violent dance steps made the people start to boo They started to shout and whistle They argued and other people who liked it argued back Then some people started to fight In the end the police were called Stravinksy was very upset and ran out of the theatre The performance was a scandal but this actually made people curious and soon the ballet became very famous It was performed seven times that season and there were no more interruptions during the other performances

The music was first heard in the United States in 1924 It was a concert performance in other words it was played by an orchestra at a concert but without any dancing This is how it is usually heard today 

Stravinsky composed a version for two people to play at one piano He finished this before he finished the orchestral work This seemed quite natural because he sat at the piano while he composed the music He continued to make changes to the orchestral score even after the first performance

 Themes  The Rite of Spring is divided into two parts and each part has several sections

Stravinskys music has many complex harmonies with dissonant sounds There are passages with polyrhythms as well as polytonality The time signatures keep changing and he often uses ostinati

Stravinsky wanted his music to describe the releasing of lots of energy Most composers would have done this by using a lot of percussion instruments However although two players are needed for the timpani there are not many other percussion instruments Instead the whole orchestra becomes a kind of percussion instrument Also the music often sounds like Russian folkmusic

The Rite of Spring uses a very large orchestra with some unusual instruments Here is a list of the instruments used

Nijinskys choreography was thought almost as shocking as the music The idea is a tribe sacrifices a young virgin each year in the Spring to please their gods and make sure crops grow well The dancers adopt a pigeon toed stance their moves are heavy They move together in groups their movements are like a ritual They look like a primitive tribe performing a ritual The ritual moves towards the sacrifice of the girl The Rite of Spring is a link between classical ballet and Modern dancep395

Nijinskys choreography has not been kept very well but there have been efforts in recent years to reconstruct his performance using costumes and set designs that look like the original ones from 1913

The Rite of Spring was made even more popular when Walt Disney used some of the music in his film Fantasia in 1940 It is used in the film to describe early life on planet earth with dinosaurs roaming about

The theory of recapitulation is often known as ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny

It was an idea of tienne Serres in 182426 In 1886 Ernst Haekel proposed that the embryonic development of an individual organism followed the same path as the evolutionary history of its species It is also called the biogenetic law or embryological parallelism 

It was a theory that tied evolution with embryology The theory basically stated that before they are born organisms pass through developmental stages that look like adult animals of other species in roughly the same order that these other species split off during evolution

Although there is something to this idea it is no longer thought to be such a useful way to look at development

Haeckel formulated his theory as Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny Ontogeny is the steps an organism takes in its development before it is born starting as a single cell and ending as a baby Phylogeny is the steps a species takes in its development starting as a very simple organism and evolving into the current organism Recapitulates is a synonym for reflects and implies that the ontogeny of an organism is similar to the phylogeny of its species

For example Haeckel realized that before they are born there is a time when humans have slits in their necks These slits look like the gills on adult fishes Haeckel took this to mean that some time before our species became human we were fish like This view is supported by the fossil record and other evidence As the unborn human gets closer to being born it develops a tail In fact some human babies are even born with tails Haeckel concluded again correctly that at some time in humanities more recent evolutionary past the species that would go on to become humans had a tail

However not all of Haeckels evidence or conclusions were this good Haeckel produced several embryo drawings that often overemphasized similarities between embryos of related species These found their ways into many biology textbooks and into popular knowledge even though they were wrong Furthermore Haeckel used this evidence to conclude that white people were evolutionary superior to people of other races Not only is this a racist view but we know today that it is not true

Today scientists think that Haeckel overstated the case For example the gills of a developing human do not work Furthermore as better observations were made it was discovered that developing babies dont look exactly like the pictures Haeckel drew He may have exaggerated what he saw in order to support his point better Also Haekels discussion was entirely about morphology he did not discuss the evolution and development of animal behaviour

However this is not to say that nothing about the theory makes sense It is true that our ontogeny gives clues about our phylogeny However the relationship is not nearly as direct as Haeckel said it was In fact Haekels over emphatic claims led in due course to over emphatic rejections

Today scientists agree that some parts of Haeckels theory still make sense For example

Mount Tambora is a volcano in Indonesia It is also the tallest mountain in Indonesia When it erupted in 1815 it was the most destructive volcanic eruption in modern history It has been estimated that it was four times larger than the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa between Java and Sumatra in terms of volume of magma ejected The eruption killed as many as 92000 It also destroyed a small Asian culture known to archaeologists as the Tamboran kingdom It launched 100 cubic kilometers of ash into the upper atmosphere which caused 1816 to be the year without a summer

Carom billiards sometimes called carambole billiards or simply carambole are a family of billiards games played on cloth covered tables In these games the players strike heavy balls with sticks called cues Carom billiards tables have no pockets or opening where balls are sunk that snooker and pool tables do have In its simplest form the object of carom billiards games is to score points or counts by bouncing ones own ball called a cue ball off of the other two balls on the table The date the first carom game was invented is not exactly known Also how exactly the games developed and which game was first is not clear However carom billiards games are believed to have started sometime in the 18th century in France in Europe

There are many different games each with distinct rules strategies and objects of play that are all part of carom billiards Some of the most well known games are straight rail cushion caroms balkline three cushion billiards and artistic billiards There are many other carom billiards games that combine aspects of these games but that are not as well known For example the champions game was a short lived game that developed during a broken wikt linktransitionaltransitional period between the invention of straight rail and the invention of balkline Other games are combinations of these games and other games played on tables with pockets such as English billiards played on a snooker table and its related games American four ball billiards and cowboy pool played on a pool table

The word carom means any strike and bounce off something It started being used to describe the pocketless billiard games in the 1860s It is a shortening of the word carambola used in Spanish and Portuguese and spelled carambole in French Carambola was earlier used to describe just the red ball used in billiards games but later was given to the game itself Some people who study word origins suggest that carambola was originally the name of a yellow to orange colored tropical Asian fruit known in Portuguese as a carambola This was taken from an earlier word karambal from the Marathi language of India also known as starfruit The accuracy of the fruit origin has been questioned It has been said to be just a legend because the fruit does not look very similar to the big red ball that is used in carom games and there is no direct proof for the fruit explanation

Cloth has been used to cover billiards tables since the 15th century In fact the company that became the most famous maker of billiard cloth Iwan Simonis was formed in 1453 Most cloth made for carom billiards tables is a type of cloth called baize that is dyed green in color and is made from 100 wool that has fibers that are made to be very straight Baize cloth provides a very fast surface allowing the balls to travel easily across the table material called a bed The green color of cloth was originally chosen to look similar to grass Green has been the common cloth color since the 16th century However the color also serves a useful function Human eyes more easily see green than any other color This allows players to keep playing for longer periods of time without straining their eyes

Modern billiard balls are made from phenolic resin which is a type of very strong plastic The size of carom billiards balls is normally 615 mm in diameter They weigh between 205 and 220 grams and are quite a bit larger and heavier than the balls used for pool games While UMB the International Olympic Committee recognized world carom billiards authority permits balls as small as 610 mm no major manufacturer produces such balls any longer and the main standard is 615 mm The three standard balls in most carom billiards games are a completely white cue ball a second cue ball sometimes having a red or black dot on it and a third red ball In some sets of balls however the second cue ball is solid yellow Both types of ball sets are allowed in tournament play

Billiard balls have been made from many different materials since the start of the game For example they have been made from clay wood ivory plastics and even steel The most common substance from 1627 until the early to mid twentieth century was ivory The search for a substitute for ivory use was not for environmental reasons but based on how expensive they were and fear of danger for elephant hunters The search was made more enticing when a New York billiard table maker offered a 10000 prize for a substitute material The first usable substitute was made from a material called celluloid Celluloid which is an early form of plastic was invented by a man named John Wesley Hyatt in 1868 There was a problem with the material though Celluloid was unstable and highly flammable sometimes exploding when people were making it

The stick used to hit billiard balls called a billiards cue is different in some ways from the typical pool cue Compared with pool cues billiard cues are often shorter with a shorter end cap a fatter bottom portion where the back hand grips the stick a wooden screw in the middle rather than one of metal or plastic and a smaller tip diameter These features make the billiard cue stiffer This stiffness helps players in striking the larger and heavier billiard balls as compared with pool balls The stiffness also acts to reduce an effect called deflection Deflection is an undesirable effect from the use of sidespin Sidespin is spin placed on a ball by striking it not at its center but off to one side of its center causing it to spin as it travels down the table Deflection causes a ball to travel not in a straight line in the direction it was struck

Underneath the cloth of billiard tables is a very hard rock called slate The slate bed of a billiard table is often heated to about 5 C9 F above room temperature which helps to keep moisture out of the cloth to aid the balls rolling and rebounding in a consistent manner and generally makes a table play faster A heated table is required under international carom rules and is an important requirement for the games of three cushion billiards and artistic billiards Heating table beds is an old practice Queen Victoria of England had a billiard table that was heated using zinc tubes At that time though the reason for the heating was different The heat was used to keep ivory balls from going out of shape The first use of electric heating was for a tournament in the game of 182 balkline that was held in December 1927 between two players Welker Cochran and Jacob Schaefer Jr The New York Times announced it with fanfare For the first time in the history of worlds championship balkline billiards a heated table will be used 

Straight rail sometimes called carom billiards straight billiards the three ball game the carambole game and the free game in Europe is thought to date to the 1700s No exact time of origin is known though It was called French caroms French billiards or the French game in early times taking those old names from the French who made the game popular The object of straight rail is simple one point called a count is scored each time a players cue ball makes contact with both object balls on a single strike of the cue ball Winning is achieved by reaching a certain number of points agreed to between the players to be the winning number

When straight rail was first invented there was no broken wikt linkrestrictionrestriction on the way points were scored However the technique of crotching meaning to have two balls right next to each other on the area of one of the tables four corners where the rails meetthe crotchmade scoring a lot easier This resulted in an 1862 rule which allowed only three counts before at least one ball had to be sent away from the corner in order to legally score another point Techniques continued to develop which increased counts greatly despite the crotching ban One of these techniques is called nursing and made scoring much easier A nurse is a series of shots where the balls are kept very close together allowing a player to score off of them with very soft strokes without changing their positions much so the scoring can continue The most important of these nurse techniques called the rail nurse involves broken wikt linknudgenudging the balls down a rail moving them just a few centimeters on each score and keeping them close together and positioned at the end of each stroke in the same or near the same arrangement so that the rail nurse can be repeated

Professional straight rail in the United States was only seen for six years from 1873 to 1879 It was followed by a game designed to reduce the use of the rail nurse so that spectators would not be bored by watching it Today straight rail play is not very common in the US but it still popular in Europe where it is thought to be a good practice game for balkline and three cushion billiards Europe hosts professional competitions known as pentathlons after the ancient Greek Olympic competitions in which straight rail is one of five billiards games at which players compete The other four are called 471 balkline cushion caroms 712 balkline and three cushion billiards

A new game appeared in 1879 called the champions game or limited rail The champions game is considered an in between gamebetween straight rail and balklineand was designed to stop the rail nurse The game uses diagonal linesbalklinesdrawn at the tables corners to indicate that if balls were inside those lines points could not be scored thus cutting off four triangular spaces in the four corners taking away 28 inches 711 mm of the nursing surface of the end rails and 56 inches 1422 mm on the long rails Despite its differences from straight rail the champions game only expanded the areas of the table where many points in a row could be scored before the balls had to be moved to a new position This was not sufficient to stop nursing

Balkline came after the champions game It added more rules to stop nursing techniques There are many varieties of balkline but all divide the table into marked regions called balk spaces The balk spaces define areas of the surface of the table where a player may only score up to a certain number of points while the object balls are within that region

In the balkline games rather than drawing balklines a few inches from the corners as was done in the champions games the entire table is divided into rectangular spaces This is done by drawing balklines a certain distance across the length and the width of the table The lines are drawn a number of inches parallel from each rail This divides the table into eight rectangular areas called balk spaces Additionally rectangles are drawn where each balkline meets a rail called anchor spaces The anchor spaces were added to the game to stop nursing techniques that developed especially for the challenges of balkline without them 

Generally the differences between one balkline game and another are defined by two different things 1 where the balkines are drawn on the table and 2 the number of points that are allowed in each balk space before at least one ball must leave that region of the table Balkline games are named by giving two numbers that tell us about the spacing used and how many points can be scored in the balk spaces The first number tells us how many inches from the rail the balkine will be drawn The second number after a dot indicates the number of points that can be scored in the balk spaces before the balls must leave it So for example the name 182 balkline tells us that balklines are drawn convert18inmm distant from each rail and only two points are allowed in a balk space before a ball must leave that area

Over its history balkline has had many variations including 82 102 122 132 122 141 142 181 182 282 382 392 422 451 452 471 472 572 and 712 balkline In its different forms balkline was the main carom game played from 1883 to the 1930s After that other carom games became more popular This is especially true of three cushion billiards Balkline is not very common in the US but remains popular in Europe and the Far East

Cushion caroms 

Cushion caroms sometimes called by its original name the indirect game is thought to have developed in the 1820s in Britain it developed out of an older game called the doublet game that dates to at least 1807 The game is sometimes incorrectly called one cushion or one cushion billiards which is the direct translation of its name into English from various other languages such as Spanish and German 

The object of cushion caroms is to score cushion caroms meaning a bounce off of both of the other balls on the table with at least one rail of the table being struck by the cue ball before the contact with second object ball Cushion caroms was not played for a number of years but came back in the late 1860s Its return was for similar reasons as to why balkline developed It was frustration of many people with straight rail The techniques such as nursing that were invented to make scoring much easier also made the game very boring to watch Thus as straight rail lost popularity cushion caroms was broken wikt linkrevivalrevived for a time Cushion caroms is rarely played in the US but it still has some popularity in Europe

In three cushion billiards sometimes called three cushion carom three cushion three cushions three rail rails and the angle game the object is to carom off both object balls with at least three rails being contacted before the contact of the cue ball with the second object ball Arising sometime in the 1870s the origin of three cushion billiards is not entirely known It is undisputed that the Internal Revenue Collector of the Port of St Louis Wayman C McCreery made the game popular At least one publication states he invented the game as well

The first three cushion billiards tournament took place January 1431 1878 in C E Musseys Room in St Louis with McCreery taking part The tournament was won by New Yorker Leon Magnus The high run for the tournament was just 6 points and the high average a 75 The game was infrequently played prior to 1907 with many top carom players of the era saying they did not enjoy it However in 1907 after the introduction of the Lambert Trophy the game became more popular in the US and internationally

By 1924 three cushion had become so popular that two very well know players in other billiard areas agreed to play each other in it at a challenge match On September 22 1924 Willie Hoppe the world balkline champion and Ralph Greenleaf the world pocket billiards title holder played a well advertised multiple day 600 point match Hoppe was the eventual winner with a final score of 600527 The games decline in the US came about in 1952 when Hoppe then 51 time billiards champion announced his retirement 

Three cushion billiards is a very difficult game Averaging one point per turn at the table is professional level play and averaging 15 to 2 is world class play An average of one means that for every turn at the table a player makes one point and misses once This means that the player makes a point on only 50 of his or her shots The highest run at three cushion billiards for many years was 25 set by the American Willie Hoppe in 1918 during an exhibition As of 2007 the high run record is 31 points shared between Semih Saygner of Turkey and Hugo Patio who is originally from Colombia but resides in the US The best game at the standard 50 points in a tournament is 9 innings by the Swedish player Torbjrn Blomdahl in 2000 and 4 innings by Korean and US national champion Sang Lee in September 1992 in a game at SL Billards in Queens New YorkRp12 The highest tournament average is 2536 by Dick Jaspers from the Netherlands in 2002 at a tournament in Monaco Raymond Ceulemans from Belgium has won an unmatchable 21 three cushion billiards world championships

Three cushion billiards is the most popular carom billiards game played in the US today where pocket billiards is far more widespread Three cushion retains great popularity in parts of Europe Asia and Latin America

The principal governing body of the sport is the Union Mondiale de Billard That organization has been holding world three cushion championships since the late 1920s Decades later the Billiards World Cup Association competed with UMB but faded in the late 1990s due to financial problems The International Olympic Committee recognized World Pool Billiard Association cooperates with the UMB to keep their rulesets consistent

In Artistic billiards sometimes called fantasy billiards or fantaisie classique players compete at performing 76 planned shots each assigned a degree of difficulty Each set shot has a maximum point value assigned for perfect execution ranging from a 4 point maximum for lowest level difficulty shots and climbing to an 11 point maximum for shots deemed highest in difficulty level There is a total of 500 points available to a player The governing body of the sport is the Confdration Internationale de Billard Artistique

Each shot in an artistic billiards match is played from a well defined starting position In fact in some tournaments the balls must be placed within two millimeters of a diagrammed position Each shot must also be done in an established manner in order for points to be awarded Players are allowed three attempts at each shot In general the 76 shots in the gameeven the lowest difficulty 4 point shotsrequire a high degree of skill much practice and specialized knowledge to perform

World title competition first started in 1986 and required the use of ivory balls However this requirement was dropped in 1990 The highest score ever achieved in world competition was 374 by the Frenchman Jean Reverchon in 1992 The highest score in competition overall is 427 set by Belgian Walter Bax on March 12 2006 at a competition held in Deurne Belgium beating his own previous record of 425 The game is played mostly in western Europe especially in France Belgium and the Netherlands
