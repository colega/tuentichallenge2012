An indulgence in Roman Catholic theology means that temporal punishment for sins which have already been forgiven is taken from the sinner 

The indulgence is given by the church after the sinner has confessed and received absolution Indulgences replaced the severe penances of the early church

Martin Luther protested against them because they were sold This was the starting point for the Protestant Reformation 

The orbital parameters suggest that it may belong together with Sycorax and Setebos to the same dynamic cluster suggesting common origin However this suggestion does not appear to be supported by the observed colours The moon appears grey in the visible light similar to Setebos but different from Sycorax

Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos was a Spanish neoclassical statesman writer and philosopher

Involved in the disgrace of his friend Francisco de Cabarrs Jovellanos spent the years 1790 to 1797 in a sort of prison at Gijon where he wrote

In 1797 he came back and refused the post of ambassador to Russia but accepted to become minister of grace and justice 

Joseph Bonaparte on mounting the Spanish throne made Jovellanos lots of offers but he refused them all and joined a patriotic party When he was involved in the fall of the party he was sent back to Gijon The vessel in which he sailed was compelled by stress of weather to put in at Vega de Navia in Asturias and there he died on November 27 1811

The Empire State Building is a skyscraper in New York City United States It is 381 meters tall and has 102 floors For forty one years it was the tallest building in the world It is named after the popular nickname for New York The Empire State It was completed in 1931 and is one of the most famous landmarks in the US It has been the tallest building in New York City since the September 11 2001 attacks though it is expected to be surpassed again in 2013 when the new World Trade Center is completed

The Empire State Building was designed by the architects named Shreve Lamb Harmon Associates It was built at a time when many people were trying to make the worlds tallest building but the Empire State Building was the tallest It was completed in 410 days and President Herbert Hoover turned on the lights on May 1 1931

Although the Bible does not say that the apostle Peter went to Rome other Roman Christians who were alive in the 1st century AD have written about him Catholics believe that after Peter was killed his body was buried in a cemetery where the basilica now stands A tomb has been found below the altar of the basilica and there were some bones but no one can say for certain if they are the bones of St Peter

A church was built here in the 4th century AD The building that stands here now was begun on April 18 1506 and was finished in 1626 Many Popes have been buried there Although many people think St Peters is a cathedral it is not because it does not have a bishop The pope is the Bishop of Rome and although he usually uses St Peters as his main church because he lives in the Vatican his bishops throne is in a different church the cathedral of Saint John Lateran Large important churches like St Peters are often called basilicas There are four ancient basilicas in Rome that were begun by the Emperor Constantine soon after he made Christianity the legal religion of the Roman Empire in the early 4th century AD The basilicas are St Peters Basilica St John Lateran Santa Maria Maggiore and St Paul outside the Walls

St Peters is famous for many reasons

One of the books of the Bible called the Acts of the Apostles tells what happened to the disciples of Jesus after he was put to death by crucifixion in the 1st century AD One of his twelve disciples became the leader His name was Simon Peter and he was a fisherman from Galilee Peter became one of the most important people in starting the Christian Church Another important disciple was Paul of Tarsus who travelled to many places and wrote lots of letters to teach and to encourage people in the new Christian groups that began to spring up in many different parts of the Roman Empire St Paul travelled to Rome It is believed that St Peter also travelled to Rome and that both Paul and Peter were put to death there as Christian martyrs St Paul was beheaded with a sword Peter was crucified up side down It is believed that the body of St Peter was buried in a cemetery near the Via Cornelia a road leading out of the city on the hill called Vaticanus Peters grave was marked by a red rock the symbol of his name The place where Peter died was marked in the 1400s by a little round temple called the Tempietto designed by Bramante

St Peter is very important in Roman Catholic tradition because Peter was the head of the Christian church in Rome and so he was the first bishop The Gospel of Matthew tells that Jesus said these words to Peter

The name Peter means a rock The Roman Catholic Church believes that Jesus made Peter the head of the Christian Church and so all the Bishops of Rome must be the leaders of the Christian Church throughout the whole world The Protestant and Orthodox churches believe that Jesus was speaking about the important words Peter had just said You are the Christ and the Son of the Living God and that this Confession of Faith is the rock that the Christian Church is built on

On December 23 1950 while making his Christmas radio broadcast to the world Pope Pius XII announced that Saint Peters tomb had been discovered Archaeologists had been searching for ten years in a place under the basilica that had been covered up for about a thousand years They had found part of a small building dating from soon after St Peters death and some bones but no one could be sure if they were the bones of St Peter

St Peters Basilica as it stand today was begun in 1506 The first basilica which is now called Old St Peters Basilica was begun by the Emperor Constantine between 326 and 333 AD This was a big wide church in the shape of a Latin Cross over 1036 metres long The central part called the nave had two aisles on either side separated by rows of talls Roman columns In front of the main entrance was large courtyard with a covered walkway all around This church had been built over a small shrine believed to mark the burial place of St Peter The old basilica contained a very large number of tombs and memorials including those of most of the popes from St Peter to the 15th century 

By the end of the 15th century the old basilica was falling to pieces Pope Nicholas V was worried about it and got two architects Leone Battista Alberti and Bernardo Rossellino to make plans to restore it or build a new one But Pope Nicholas had so many political problems that when he died very little of the work had been done In 1505 Pope Julius II decided to demolish the old St Peters and build a basilica that would be the grandest church in the world and make Rome famous He held a competition and invited lots of artists and architects to draw designs A plan was selected and the build was begun but Pope Julius did not get his new basilica In fact it was not finished for 120 years The planning and construction lasted through the reigns of 21 popes and 8 architects

The changing plans for St Peters The architectural terms are explained in the article ImageBasilica di San Pietro 1450jpgThe Old Saint Peters Basilica drawn by H W Brewer 1891 He used very old drawings and writings to work out how it must have looked ImageSaintPierre4JPGBramantes plan is for a Greek Cross with a dome on four big piers There is a tower at each corner ImageSaintPierreRaphaelJPGRaphaels plan is simpler and is for a Latin Cross like the old basilica ImagePetersdomGrundrissjpgThe finished basilica shows Michelangelos plan with four huge piers It also shows Madernas nave portico and facade 

When Pope Julius decided to build the grandest church in Christendom the design by Donato Bramante was chosen and Pope Julius laid the foundation stone in 1506 Bramantes plan was in the shape of an enormous Greek Cross which means that it had four arms all of equal length and a large dome at the middle For the next hundred years the groundplan got changed backwards and forwards between a Greek Cross like Bramantes plan and a Latin Cross like the old basilica but one thing never changed and that was the idea of having an enormous dome at the place where the two arms crossed

At that time there were only three very large domes in the whole world One was far away in Constantinople on the church of Hagia Sophia and not many people in Italy had seen it The other two domes were both very well known One was the dome on the temple to the Ancient Roman gods called the Pantheon The other dome was built in the early 15th century on Florence Cathedral by Filippo Brunelleschi The dome of the Pantheon is metres across and the dome of Florence Cathedral is about metres but is much taller Bramantes plan for the dome of St Peters was for it to be about as wide as the dome of Florence and even taller

No architect with any sense would try to design a dome without first checking out how these other two domes were made Bramante checked them out He discovered that the dome of the Pantheon which had been standing for nearly 1500 years was made of concrete So that the concrete wouldnt be too heavy it was mixed with pumice stone which comes out of a volcano and is full of gas holes so it is very light weight Bramante learned how to make concrete like the Ancient Romans

Bramantes dome was to be like the one on the Pantheon But there was one very big difference between the Pantheon dome and Bramantes design The Pantheons dome stands on a round wall like a drum with only one doorway in it but Bramantes dome was designed to stand on a drum which was standing high up on four wide arches The aches rested on four enormous piers He had got this idea from Florence Cathedral which had an enormous dome resting on eight big piers Another idea that Bramante got from Florence Cathedral was the design for the little stone tower which sits on top of the dome and is called the lantern

When Pope Julius died in 1513 the next pope Leo X called in three architects Giuliano da Sangallo Fra Giocondo and Raphael Sangallo and Fr Giocondo both died in 1515 Raphael made a big change to the plan Instead of having a Greek Cross he decided to change the plan to a Latin Cross which had a long nave and aisles like the old basilica

Raphael also died in his early 30s in 1520 before any important changes could be made to the building The next architect was Peruzzi who like some of the ideas that Raphael had but did not like the Latin Cross plan Peruzzi went back to Bramantes Greek Cross plan But there were so many arguments in the church that the building stopped completely Then in 1527 Rome was invaded by Emperor Charles V Peruzzi died in 1536 without his plan being built The only main parts of the building which had been constructed were Bramantes four big piers to hold the dome

Antonio da Sangallo looked at all the different plans by Peruzzi Raphael and Bramante He put some of their ideas together in a design that had a very short nave and had a big porch at the front He changed Bramantes dome to be much stronger and also much more decorated The main new idea that he added were 16 stone ribs to strengthen the dome This idea came from Florence Cathedral which had eight stone ribs But Sangallos plan never got built either The main job that he did was to strengthen Bramantes piers which had begun to crack

On January 1st 1547 in the reign of Pope Paul III Michelangelo who was already over 70 became the architect of St Peters He is the main designer of the building as it stands today Michelangelo died before the job was finished but by that time he had got the construction up to a point where other people could get it finished Michelangelo had already done a lot of work for the popes carving figures for the tomb of Pope Julius II painting the Sistine Chapel ceiling which took five years and the enormous fresco the Last Judgement on the wall of the Sistine Chapel Michelangelo found the popes and the cardinals very difficult to work with When Pope Paul asked him to be the new architect for St Peters Michelangelo did not want the job In fact Pope Paul did not really want Michelangelo But his first choice Giulio Romano died suddenly Michelangelo told the pope that he would only do the job if he could do it in whatever way he thought was best

Michelangelo wrote

When Michelangelo took over a building site in 1547 the nave of the old basilica was still standing and in use There were four of the most enormous piers in the world standing where the western part of the old basilica had been The building work had stopped for so long that weeds and bushes were growing out between the stones of the unfinished building as if it was a cliff Michelangelo looked at all the plans that had been drawn by some of the greatest architects and engineers of the 16th century He knew he could do whatever he liked but he had respect for the other designers especially Bramante He knew that he was expected to make a design that would be the symbol of the city of Rome in the same way as Brunelleschis dome was the symbol of Florence where Michelangelo had lived as a young man He went back to the Greek Cross idea and re drew Bramantes plan making every part of it much stronger and simpler It had to be strong enough to support the tallest dome in the world

Michelangelo was a sculptor When he was going to carve something he would start by making a clay model Michelangelo could imagine the building like a lump of clay What if the building could be pushed and pulled and squeezed If you could squeeze the corners in then other bits would bulge out If you could put your hands around the whole building and squeeze it then the dome would bulge upwards The idea of imagining buildings as bendy and bulgy was a completely new one But other artists like Gianlorenzo Bernini looked at what Michelangelo did at St Peters and used this clever new idea in their own work This is called the Baroque style

As it stands today the Greek Cross part of the basilica is Michelangelos design and the nave which was added later is by Carlo Maderna Comparing Michelangelos plan with Raphaels plan shows that while the outside line of Raphaels plan has clear square and round shapes the outside line in Michelangelos plan has lots of changes of direction That is the way it was built All around the outside of the building are enormous pilasters Almost every pilaster is set at a different angle to the next one as if the flat walls had been folded up Right around the top of the building is a band called the cornice A cornice is usually quite flat but because of all the changes of direction this cornice ripples like a giant piece of ribbon tied around the outside of the building The art historian Helen Gardner wrote that it looked as of the whole building was being held together from top to bottom

Michelangelo designed the dome again using ideas from Bramante and Sangallo the Younger Three important ideas came from the dome that Brunelleschi had built in Florence more than 100 years earlier

When Michelangelo died in 1564 the walls were being built the piers had been strengthened and everything was ready for the building of the dome The Pope wanted Michelangelos assistant Vignola to finish it but he was not able to After twenty years Pope Sixtus V gave the job to the architect Giacomo della Porta and the engineer Domenico Fontana Giacomo della Porta successfully built the dome He made some changes to the design like adding some lions heads to the decoration because they were the symbol of Pope Sixtus family The main way that the dome is different from the wooden model is that it is much more pointy

Some writers believe that Michelangelo had changed his mind from his first plan and did not want the pointy dome They believe he wanted a round dome which would look more restful Other writers believe that Michelangelo wanted the pointed dome not just because it was safer to builld but also because it looked more exciting as if the building was pushing upwards Pope Sixtus V lived just long enough to see the dome finished in 1590 His name is written in gold letters around the inside just below the lantern

Pope Clement III had a cross raised into place on top of the lantern It took a whole day and everyone in Rome was given a holiday and all the church bells of the city were rung In the arms of the cross are set two lead boxes one containing a fragment of the True Cross and a bone of Saint Andrew and the other containing medals of the Holy Lamb

The dome of St Peters rises to a height of 13657 m from the floor of the basilica It is the tallest dome in the world Its inside diameter is 4147 metres just slightly smaller than those of the Pantheon and the Florence Cathedral

Around the inside of the dome is written in letters 2 metres high

In 1602 Pope Paul V put Carlo Maderna in charge of the building On February 18 1606 workmen began to pull down the rest of the old basilica Some people were very upset The building committee felt guilty They decided that the church was the wrong shape and that they wanted a Latin Cross plan because it was the symbol of the death of Jesus They wanted a nave which would cover all the Holy Ground where the old building had been In 1607 Madernas plans for the nave and the facade were accepted For the inside he used very large piers with pilasters like Michelangelos but he made a clear join between the two parts of the building The building work began on May 7 1607 and 700 men were employed to do the work In 1608 the facade was begun In December 1614 the building was all finished except for the decorations on the ceiling Early in 1615 the temporary wall between Michelangelos building and the new nave was pulled down All the mess was carted away and the nave was ready for use by Palm Sunday

The faade was designed by Maderna It is 11469 metres wide and 4555 metres high and is built of pale grey travertine stone with a giant Corinthian columns and a central triangular pediment Along the roof line are statues of Christ John the Baptist and eleven of the apostles

Inside the main doors is a portico which runs across the front of the building and has five doors leading into the basilica Its has a long curving roof decorated with gold The light that comes through the doors shines on the beautifully patterned marble floor At each end of the portico set between columns is a statue of a figure on horseback They are Charlemagne sculpted by Cornacchini to the south and Emperor Constantine by Bernini to the north Madernas last work at St Peters was to design a sunken crypt called the Confessio under the dome where people can go to be nearer the burial place of the apostle All around its marble handrail are 95 bronze lamps

As a young boy Gianlorenzo Bernini visited St Peters and said that one day he wanted to build a mighty throne for the apostle His wish came true As a young man in 1626 Pope Urban VIII asked him to work as architect for the basilica Bernini spent the next fifty years thinking of new and beautiful things to design He is thought of as the greatest architect and sculptor of the Baroque period 

Berninis first work at St Peters was to design the baldacchino which is like a tent or pavilion above the High Altar This amazing thing is 30 metres tall and is probably the largest piece of bronze in the world It stands underneath the dome and has four huge bronze twisted columns decorated with olive leaves and bees because bees were the symbol of Pope Urban Pope Urban had a niece that he loved very much and he got Bernini to put her face and the face of her new born baby boy on the columns as well

Bernini had a great idea for Bramantes great big piers He had four hollow niches carved into them where four huge statues could stand The basilica owns some precious relics a piece of the True Cross of Jesus a veil that a woman wiped the face of Jesus with while he was carrying the cross the spear that was used to pierce Jesus side and the bones of St Andrew the brother of St Peter No one knows for sure whether these things are real or not but for hundreds of years they have been precious Berninis plan was the make four marble statues of the four Holy people St Helena who found the cross St Longinus who was the soldier with the spear St Veronica who wiped Jesus face and St Andrew

Berninis next job was to make a special throne out of bronze to hold an ancient wood and ivory throne that had been at the basilica for more than 500 years It is called the Cattedra Petri or throne of St Peter The bronze throne with the old wooden throne inside it is held up high at the end of the basilica by four important saints who are called Doctors of the Church because they were all great writers and teachers The statues are made of bronze They are Saints Ambrose and Augustine for the Church of Rome and Saints Athanasius and John Chrysostum for the Orthodox Church Above the chair is a window which is made not from glass but thin translucent stone called alabaster The Dove of the Holy Spirit is in the middle of the window with rays of light spreading out into the basilica through a sculpture of golden clouds and angels Bernini designed this to look like a window into Heaven There was a great celebration when the chair was put in place on January 16 1666

Berninis last work for St Peters 1676 was to decorate of the Chapel of the Sacrament He designed a miniature version of Bramantes Tempietto and made it in gilt bronze On either side is an angel one gazing in adoration and the other looking towards the viewer in welcome Bernini died in 1680 in his 82nd year

To the east of the basilica is the Piazza di San Pietro The piazza was designed by Bernini and built between 1656 and 1667 It was not an easy job because the designer had lots of things to think about Firstly many people complained that Madernas facade on St Peters looked too wide so Bernini wanted to make it look narrower not wider Secondly in the old square left over from the Old St Peters Pope Sixtus V had a monument set up This monument was a precious Ancient Egyptian obelisk From its base to the top of the cross it was 40 metres high and had been brought to Roman in ancient times The obelisk really should be at the centre of the new square but it was not in quite the right place and was very difficult to move without breaking The third problem was that Maderna had built a fountain to one side of the obelisk and Bernini needed to make another fountain to match it otherwise the design would look unbalanced 

Bernini solved the problem by making two areas instead of one huge one The first area is an almost square area right in front of the facade It is cleverly designed with sloping sides that make the building look taller and not so wide The second part of the piazza is oval It has the obelisk at the centre with two fountains on either side at the widest part The two parts of the piazza are surrounded by a colonnade which is carried on tall columns All around are large statues of saints which seem to look down on the thousands of visitors that come to the square every day The colonnade is in two great arcs that seem to stretch out like loving arms welcoming people to the Basilica In recent times some buildings were demolished making another square to match the one near the piazza It is a good place for vans to park and can be seen in the photo

The famous architectural historian Sir Banister Fletcher said that no other city in the world had given such a wonderful view to people visiting their main church He said that no other architect except Bernini could have imagined such a noble design He said it is the greatest entrance to the greatest Christian church in the whole world

Because the computer is an electrical device it understands only electricity on and electricity off This is expressed by using two symbols 0 and 1 which are called binary digits or bits Numbers and text characters are represented as codes which are made up of combinations of 0s and 1s The character codes are called ASCII In ASCII eight bits any combination of 0s and 1s form one character or symbol For example the letter A is denoted by the code 01000001 The basic working unit of the computers memory is therefore a group of eight bits which is called a byte The computers memory consists of many thousands of bytes To make it easier the unit K can be used to express memory capacity One K equals 1024 For example 64K bytes of memory is the same as 65536 bytes For larger memory capacities the units mega and giga can be used One megabyte of computer memory usually means 1024 kilobytes which is 1048576 bytes whereas one gigabyte means 1024 megabytes which is 1073741824 bytes

The CPU calls instructions and data from the computers memory Because the same computer performs different tasks at different times the memory is erasable  much like audio cassette tapes must be erasable to record different musical selections at different times But there are some programs and instructions which the computer needs It does not matter what function you are performing These programs often are permanently recorded in the memory So they cannot be destroyed As a result the computers memory usually consists of two parts

This is the permanent memory which is used to store important control programs and systems software to perform a variety of functions such as booting up or starting up programs ROM is non volatile That means the contents are not lost when the power is switched off Its contents are permanently written at the time of manufacture

RAM is used as the working memory of a computer system It stores input data intermediate results programs and other information temporarily It can be read and written It is volatile that is all data will be erased when the power is turned off

Hurricane Noel was the fourteenth named storm and sixth hurricane of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season Noel formed on October 27 from the interaction between a tropical wave and an upper level low in the north central Caribbean Sea It strengthened to winds of 60 mph before making landfall on western Haiti and the north coast of eastern Cuba It turned northward and on November 1 it attained hurricane status The hurricane accelerated northeastward after crossing the Bahamas and on November 2 it became an extratropical cyclone

The storm caused at least 169 deaths along its path primarily in Hispaniola due to flooding and mudslides It was the deadliest Atlantic hurricane of the 2007 season After its transition to post tropical Noel became a very strong low pressure system causing flooding and wind damage over Maine and Eastern Canada It even dropped snow over some areas of Eastern Quebec and Labrador

The name Noel was retired in May 2008 and replaced by Nestor for the 2013 Atlantic hurricane season

The meteorological history of Hurricane Wilma the strongest tropical cyclone known in the Western Hemisphere began in the second week of October 2005 A big weather system formed across much of the Caribbean Sea and slowly organized to the southeast of Jamaica By late on October 15 the system was became strong for the National Hurricane Center to name it Tropical Depression Twenty Four

The depression slowly moved southwestward and in conditions that were good for strengthening it strengthened into Tropical Storm Wilma on October 17 In the beginning development was slow because of its large size although thunderstorms slowly organized From October 18 and over the next day Wilma underwent explosive deepening over the open waters of the Caribbean in a 30 hour period the systems central atmospheric pressure dropped from 982 mbar to the record low value of 882 mbar while the winds increased to 185 mph At its strongest the pinhole eye of Wilma was about 3 miles in diameter the smallest known eye in an Atlantic hurricane After the inner eye died off because of an eyewall replacement cycle Wilma weakened to Category 4 status and on October 21 it made landfall on Cozumel and on the Mexican mainland with winds of about 150 mph

Wilma weakened over the Yucatn Peninsula and reached the southern Gulf of Mexico before speeding up northeastward Despite increasing amounts of wind shear the hurricane re strengthened to hit Cape Romano Florida as a major hurricane Wilma weakened as it quickly crossed the state and entered the Atlantic Ocean near Jupiter Florida The hurricane again re intensified before cold air and wind shear penetrated the inner core of convection On October 26 it turned into an extratropical cyclone and the next day the remnants of Wilma were absorbed by another extratropical storm over Atlantic Canada

The origin of Hurricane Wilma is complicated During the second week of October an unusually large monsoon like lower level circulation and a large area of disturbed weather developed over much of the Caribbean Sea The system was enhanced by diffluencethe rate at which a fluid movesfrom an upper level low across the southwestern Atlantic By October 13 a broad area of low pressure developed and persisted about 150 miles southeast of Jamaica possibly aided by the passage of tropical waves through the area at the time Convection increased and became slightly better organized though upper level wind shear originally stopped development The system moved westward and early on October 14 the convection became more concentrated and a little better organized as upper level wind shear lessened slightly

Later on October 14 the system became much better organized with increasingly organized shower and thunderstorm activity as conditions in the upper levels of the atmosphere became significantly more favorable It was then that the National Hurricane Center first said that it was possible for a tropical depression to develop in the area Dvorak classifications were initiated on October 15 The system continued to organize with the National Hurricane Center remarking the system could ultimately become a hurricane By late on October 15 the surface circulation became defined well enough with enough organized deep convection for the National Hurricane Center to designate the system as Tropical Depression Twenty Four while it was located about 220 miles east southeast of Grand Cayman

The depression tracked slowly westward a motion due to weak steering currents caused by a high pressure system to its north across the Gulf of Mexico Initially the center of circulation was broad without a defined inner core forecaster Lixion Avila remarked The area of minimum pressure could have been anywhere within 60 miles of its initial advisory position Originally the tropical depression was forecast to drift west southwestward before turning to the north within 120 hours of the forecasts issuance the system was predicted to be located about 80 miles south of the Isle of Youth as a 105 mph hurricane However the National Hurricane Center noted in the first advisory on the depression that there were all indications that there could a dangerous hurricane in the northwestern Caribbean Sea in 3 to 5 days This was due to the depression being located within an environment very ideal for development specifically low amounts of wind shear and very warm water temperatures

As Tropical Depression Twenty Four drifted southwestward it steadily organized by early on October 16 rainbands began to slowly consolidate with well established outflow and a large upper level anticyclone developed over the depression Although deep convection and banding features increased mid level dry air from the north prevented significant organization and the convection was split into two primary areas Surface buoy reports indicated that due to its large size the system failed to strengthen beyond tropical depression status even though it received tropical storm strength Dvorak classifications from The National Hurricane Centers Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations Satellite Analysis Branch Continued reconnaissance flights reported peak winds of about 30 mph

By early on October 17 the outer rainbands which had previously controlled the structure of the cyclone dissipated while deep convection developed near and to the south of the center Computer models predicted steady strengthening as the depression moved westward before turning to the north Of the intensity models the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory predicted an intensity of 135 mph within 36 hours with other forecasts being more conservative in their predictions Deep convection continued to develop to the south of the center and the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Wilma at 0600 UTC on October 17 while located about 200 miles southeast of Grand Cayman Right after becoming a tropical storm the National Hurricane Center predicted Wilma to track west northwestward reaching winds of 105 mph before striking the northeastern portion of the Yucatn Peninsula The storm continued to the southwest while deep convection laid near the center National Hurricane Centner forecaster James Franklin said Confidence at the later ranges of the forecast track was unusually low because of wide divergences between computer models Late on October 17 a Hurricane Hunters flight into Wilma recorded winds of 50 mph but an unusually low pressure of 989 mbar which would be more typical of a minimal hurricane This was because of a number of unusual low pressures across the region which resulted in a lesser pressure gradient and thus lighter winds Convection continued to develop near the center and became much more symmetrical

Tropical Storm Wilma began to turn to the west northwest on October 18 during which the storm developed a small intermittent and ragged eye feature as well as a mid level eye feature It continued to strength and at 1200 UTC on October 18 Wilma strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane while located about 225 miles south southeast of Grand Cayman Shortly after reaching hurricane strength the hurricane began undergoing explosive deepening subsequent to the development of a pinhole eye 9 miles in diameter This small eye was surrounded by a ring of deep convection with cloud top temperatures of about 125 F

Early on October 19 Wilma attained major hurricane status while continuing to rapidly intensify and by 0600 UTC the storms maximum sustained winds increased to 170 mph making Wilma a dangerous Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir Simpson Hurricane Scale In the span of just 24 hours Wilma had intensified from a 70 mph tropical storm to a 175 mph Category 5 hurricane an event that has never happened before for an Atlantic hurricane The eye continued to contract to a diameter of about 3 miles the smallest known eye in an Atlantic hurricane and at 1200 UTC on October 19 Wilma reached peak winds of 185 mph The central pressure quickly dropped 54 mbar from 0000 to 0600 UTC

At 0800 UTC a Hurricane Hunters flight recorded a minimum central pressure of 884 mbar in a dropsonde near the center of the extremely small eye As the dropsonde did not reach the calm winds in the center the pressure was estimated at 882 mbar the lowest pressure in an Atlantic hurricane on record The pressure continued to fall as the Hurricane Hunters left the hurricane and it is possible the pressure was a little bit lower Operationally the peak intensity was estimated at 175 mph At the time of its peak intensity hurricane force winds extended only 50 miles from the small center of Wilma with tropical storm force winds extending only about 160 miles

Shortly after peaking in intensity the coldest cloud tops surrounding the eye warmed a little bit and an outer eyewall began to form meaning that an eyewall replacement cycle was happening By late on October 19 the winds in Hurricane Wilma decreased to 160 mph as the inner 5 mile wide eye weakened and the wind field expanded Early on October 20 the hurricane weakened to Category 4 status after the small inner eye dissipated and the 45 mile wide outer eyewall became the new eye At the time the pressure measured 892 mbar the lowest known pressure for a Category 4 hurricane and Wilma retained the large eyewall as it turned northwestward Originally the hurricane was forecasted to re intensify into a Category 5 hurricane with one forecast predicting it to make landfall on the Yucatn Peninsula with winds of 165 mph though Wilma remained a strong Category 4 hurricane as it tracked northwestward

Steering currents stayed weak though a series of troughs eroded the high pressure system across the Gulf of Mexico resulting in a turn towards the north northwest Environmental conditions remained favorable with the eye becoming more distinct early on October 21 At about 2145 UTC on October 21 Wilma made landfall on the island of Cozumel with winds of 150 mph It weakened a little bit as it continued northwestward and struck the Mexican mainland near Puerto Morelos at 0330 UTC on October 22 with winds of 135 mph and gusts of up to 170 mph

On October 22 the mid level ridge to the north of Wilma later dissipated leaving the hurricane moving northward across the northeastern Yucatn Peninsula As the hurricane moved farther inland the eye became cloud filled as the deepest convection began to warm and the winds slowly weakened during its passage over land About 26 hours after making landfall on Cozumel Wilma emerged into the southern Gulf of Mexico near Cabo Catoche with winds of about 100 mph After reaching open waters Reconnaissance Aircraft reported the remains of an inner eyewall and an outer eyewall measuring between 70 and 90 miles in diameter Convection deepened around the eyewalls and the inner core of convection which had previously become disrupted over land became a little bit more organized

A powerful eastward moving mid level trough across the central United States turned the hurricane northeastward and caused it to gradually speed up Vertical wind shear increased as strong upper level southwesterly flow increased though in spite of the shear Wilma continued to intensify Early on October 24 Wilma re gained major hurricane status while located about 120 miles west southwest of Key West Florida It slowly became better organized with the large 50 mile eye becoming very distinct on satellite and radar imagery Wilma was able to retain its strength because large eyes in tropical cyclones are more stable and more resistant to vertical wind shear Despite wind shear values of about 30 mph Wilma strengthened further to reach winds of 125 mph It weakened a little bit as it approached Florida and made landfall at Cape Romano with winds of 120 mph at around 1030 UTC on October 24

Hurricane Wilma crossed the Florida peninsula in about 45 hours while continuing to speed northeastward and entered into the Atlantic Ocean as a weakened 110 mph hurricane near Jupiter A vigorous cold front associated with the mid level trough moved across the area to the west of Wilma yet the cooler and drier air behind the front could not fully penetrate the inner core of the hurricane to weaken it Shortly after exiting the Florida coastline Wilma began to re intensify believed to be due to a reduction of friction of the eyewall and warm waters of the Gulf Stream Early on October 25 the hurricane reached a secondary peak intensity of 125 mph while located about 340 miles east of Jacksonville Florida During the time the large circulation of Wilma absorbed smaller Tropical Depression Alpha over the Bahamas Shortly thereafter the wind shear combined with its rapid forward motion of 50 mph resulted in a slow weakening trend The overall cloud pattern began to be disorganized with the eye becoming less visible and the convection less symmetric By 1170 UTC on October 25 the center was located to the northwest of the primary convection as cold air from the southwest disturbed the circulation The remaining convection continued to diminish and early on October 26 Wilma turned into an extratropical cyclone while located about 230 miles southeast of Halifax Nova Scotia The extratropical remnant continued east northeast before being absorbed by another extratropical storm on October 27

The discovery images were taken on May 15 2005 and May 18 2005 the moons were independently found by Max J Mutchler on June 15 2005 and Andrew J Steffl on August 15 2005 The discoveries were announced on October 31 2005 after confirmation by precoveries from 2002 The moons were designated S2005 P 1 and S2005 P 2

The moon follows a circular orbit in the same plane as Charon It takes 249 days to circle around Pluto

Although its size has not been directly measured the moon is calculated to have a diameter of between 46 km if its reflectivity is similar to Charons 35 and 137 km if it has a reflectivity of 4 like the darkest Kuiper Belt Objects Nix is slightly fainter than Hydra suggesting that it is somewhat smaller in size In the discovery image Nix is 6300 times fainter than Pluto

Early research appeared to show that Nix was reddish like Pluto and unlike the other moons but more recent reports have been that it is grey like the remaining moons

Nix is to be visited along with Pluto by the New Horizons mission in 2015

The formal name Nix from the Greek goddess of darkness and night and mother of Charon was announced on June 21 2006 on IAU Circular 8723 where the designation Pluto II is also given Together with Hydra Plutos third moon the initials are those of the New Horizons probe The initial proposal was to use the Classical spelling Nyx but to avoid confusion with the asteroid 3908 Nyx this was changed to the Egyptian spelling of the Greek name

Hydra is the farthest moon of Pluto It was found along with Nix in June 2005 by the Hubble Space Telescopes Pluto Companion Search Team which is composed of Hal A Weaver Alan Stern Max J Mutchler Andrew J Steffl Marc W Buie William J Merline John R Spencer Eliot F Young and Leslie A Young The discovery images were taken on May 15 2005 and May 18 2005 the moons were independently found by Max J Mutchler on June 15 2005 and Andrew J Steffl on August 15 2005 The discoveries were announced on October 31 2005 after confirmation by precoveries from 2002 The moons were provisionally designated S2005 P 1 and S2005 P 2

The moon orbits the barycenter of the system in the same plane as Charon and Nix at a distance of about 65000 km Unlike other moons of Pluto its orbit is only nearly circular its eccentricity of 00052 is small but significantly non zero Its orbital period of 382 days

Although its size has not been directly measured calculations based on its brightness give it a diameter of between 61 km if its reflectivity is similar to Charons 35 percent and about 167 km if it has a reflectivity of 4 percent like the darkest Kuiper belt objects At the time of discovery Hydra was about 25 percent brighter than its sister moon Nix which led to the assumption that its diameter was some 10 percent bigger Pre discovery data from Hubble observations in 2002 3 inferred that Nix was the brighter moon However Hubble observations in 2005 6 specifically targeting the dim moons once again showed Hydra to be a little brighter Hydra appears to be grey like Charon and Nix though Pluto is reddish

Hydra is to be visited along with Pluto by the New Horizons mission in 2015

The name Hydra was announced on June 21 2006 in IAU Circular 8723 along with the formal designation Pluto III It was named after Hydra the monster who guarded the waters of PlutoHadess underworld in Greco Roman Mythology

The meteorological history of Hurricane Ivan the longest tracked tropical cyclone of the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season lasted from late August through late September The hurricane developed from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on August 31 Moving westward from the effects of a ridge favorable conditions allowed it to develop into Tropical Depression Nine on September 2 in the deep tropical Atlantic Ocean The cyclone slowly intensified until September 5 when it underwent rapid deepening and reached Category 4 status on the Saffir Simpson Hurricane Scale at the time Ivan was the southernmost major hurricane on record

Ivan quickly weakened because of dry air but it slowly reorganized itself passing just south of Grenada as a major hurricane on September 7 The hurricane strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane while located in the central Caribbean Sea Over next the days its intensity changed largely due to eyewall replacement cycles and Ivan passed just south of Jamaica the Cayman Islands and western Cuba with winds at or slightly below Category 5 status Turning northward and encountering unfavorable conditions Ivan slowly weakened before making landfall just west of Gulf Shores Alabama on September 16 with winds of 120 mph The cyclone quickly weakened to tropical depression status as it turned to the northeast and Ivan transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September 18

The remnant low of Ivan turned to the south and southwest and after crossing Florida on September 21 it began to regain tropical characteristics It became a tropical depression again on September 22 to the southeast of Louisiana and Ivan reached winds of 60 mph before weakening and moving ashore along southwestern Louisiana as a tropical depression the circulation of Ivan dissipated after crossing into Texas on September 25 The cyclone broke several intensity records and its duration was the tenth longest on record for an Atlantic hurricane

On August 31 a large tropical wave moved off the west coast of Africa A tropical system along the wave axis contained a low pressure area as well as an impressive outflow pattern though originally its convection was disorganized and limited By September 1 a cyclonic circulation with a diameter of 690 mile was seen on satellite imagery well to the southeast of the Cape Verde Islands and several hurricane forecast models expected development and strengthening As it moved quickly westward the convection organized and developed into rainbandsbands of showers and thunderstorms that move in a spiral direction towards the center of the stormand late on September 1 meteorologists began tracking the system using the Dvorak technique Low amounts of wind shear and favorable outflow allowed strong deep convection to develop and persist near the center and by 1800 UTC on September 2 the system developed into Tropical Depression Nine about 450 miles southwest of Praia Cape Verde

After being classified as a tropical cyclone the depression was embedded within a deep easterly steering current provided by a ridge to its north Expected to move across sea surface temperatures greater than 82 F the cyclone was forecasted to slowly strengthen and within four days become a hurricane the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory predicted the depression to reach Category 4 status on the Saffir Simpson Hurricane Scale within three days Increased northeasterly wind shear shifted the center to the northeastern edge of the deep convection and despite the shear and its relatively low latitude of 97 N the depression strengthened to attain tropical storm status early on September 3 upon reaching the intensity the National Hurricane Center classified the system as Tropical Storm Ivan

Tropical Storm Ivan slowly became more organized as wind shear decreased and its outflow expanded in all quadrants Satellite imagery late on September 3 showed a well defined curved band wrapping around much of the circulation The next day the deep convection temporarily became disorganzied before reorganizing and developing an eye feature Convection strengthened further as the feature transitioned into an eye and Ivan became a hurricane at around 0600 UTC on September 5 After reaching hurricane status Ivan began to rapidly intensify with continued favorable conditions and in an 18 hour period the pressure dropped 39 mbar as the winds increased by 60 mph early on September 6 Ivan reached its first peak intensity of 135 mph while located about 825 miles east of the island of Tobago in the southern Lesser Antilles

While at major hurricane status Ivan kept very strong convection in its core with a well defined eye Operationally the probability for further rapid strengthening was considered nearly nine times the average of a normal hurricane Accordingly Ivan was forecasted to pass near Barbados with winds of about 150 mph Shortly after becoming a Category 4 hurricane the outer convection of the hurricane became ragged Hurricane Hunters found a Saharan Air Layer in the northern portion of the eye leaving the eyewall eroded which caused a marked decrease in winds by late on September 6 Ivan weakened to winds of 105 mph The inner eyewall died out as a 23 mile outer eyewall became took over and at the same time the overall organization of the hurricane improved Ivan then re gained major hurricane status as it approached the Lesser Antilles and at 2130 UTC on September 7 the cyclone passed 7 miles south southwest of the southern tip of Grenada its closest approach to the island At the time the hurricane maintained an eye diameter of 12 miles with the northern portion of the eyewall producing strong winds on the island

Hurricane Ivan again reached Category 4 status as it entered the Caribbean Sea Subsequently it underwent another eyewall replacement cycle and for about 18 hours the intensity stayed the same as it paralleled the northern coast of Venezuela offshore Another period of rapid deepening began late on September 8 as its motion turned to the west northwest Hurricane Hunters recorded flight level sustained winds of 180 mph to the north and northeast of the eye and a dropsonde about 630 feet above the surface recorded winds of 200 mph and an extrapolated pressure of 916 mbar Based on the reports it is estimated Ivan attained Category 5 status at 0600 UTC on September 9 while located about 90 miles north of Aruba At the time the cyclone was forecasted to strike southern Florida as a major hurricane

After maintaining Category 5 status for about 12 hours Ivan began a steady weakening trend because of another eyewall replacement cycle until reaching winds of 140 mph on September 10 Early next day the hurricane reorganized as it reached winds just al little bit below of Category 5 status However the storm weakened again beause of another eyewall replacement cycle and at 0330 UTC on September 11 Ivan passed 23 miles south of Portland Point Jamaica its closest approach with winds of 150 mph The hurricane was previously forecasted to make landfall on the island though the weakening and a turn to the west kept the strongest winds offshore the last minute turn to the west was due to a mid level high pressure system over the eastern Gulf of Mexico A slight weakening trend continued due to its northern outflow being disrupted by an upper level low over the Bahamas As it tracked further away from Jamaica Ivan again rapidly intensified to Category 5 status and early on September 12 it reached its peak intensity of 165 mph with a pressure of 910 mbar

Shortly after peaking in intensity the hurricane again weakened as it underwent an eyewall replacement cycle At 1415 UTC on September 12 Ivan passed 25 miles south southwest of George Town Cayman Islands with winds of 150 mph After its eyewall became re established Ivan attained Category 5 status for a third time early on September 13 Shortly thereafter a trough created a weakness in the ridge to its north causing the hurricane to turn to the northwest The combination of the combination of enhanced outflow from the trough and very warm waters allowed Ivan to maintain Category 5 status for 30 hours Early on September 14 the hurricane passed through the Yucatn Channel about 17 miles southwest of Cabo San Antonio Cuba with the eastern portion of the eyewall crossing the western portion of the island

After entering the southern Gulf of Mexico Hurricane Ivan weakened to Category 4 status by 0600 UTC on September 14 As it slowly turned to the north southwesterly flow from a large trough over the central United States increased wind shear over the hurricane An eyewall replacement cycle along with dry air and restricted outflow contributed to the weakening By late on September 14 the weakening trend ceased as the eyewall became better defined and Ivan was expected to restrengthen a little bit over an area of warmer water temperatures The eye diameter expanded to 60 miles though concurrently westerly wind shear and dry continued to increase As Ivan approached the Gulf Coast of the United States Hurricane Hunters reported erosion of the southern portion of the eyewall and cooler waters just offshore contributed to further weakening At around 0650 UTC on September 16 Hurricane Ivan made landfall just west of Gulf Shores Alabama with winds of 120 mph the strongest winds occurred over a narrow area near the southern Alabama and western Florida border

Upon moving ashore the National Hurricane Center expected the forward path of Ivan to be blocked and accordingly forecasted the hurricane to stall in the southern Appalachian Mountains before dissipating As the hurricane crossed Mobile Bay it turned to the north northeast and within twelve hours Ivan rapidly weakened to tropical storm status The circulation became less defined and early on September 17 the cyclone weakened into a tropical depression over northeastern Alabama Ivan accelerated to the northeast ahead of an approaching cold front dropping heavy rainfall along its path Late on September 18 the remnants of Ivan became an extratropical low as it merged with the cold front over the Delmarva Peninsula

After becoming an extratropical low the remnants of Ivan turned to the southeast and entered into the Atlantic Ocean due to the building of an upper level ridge to its east As an extratropical cyclone Ivan remained identifiable in both surface and upper level data and the system turned south and southwestward over the next few days By September 20 the system was located off the east coast of Florida creating scattered thunderstorms unfavorable wind shear stopped tropical redevelopment though forecasters mentioned the possibility for more favorable conditions a few days later On September 21 the low crossed southern Florida and emerged into the Gulf of Mexico and as it moved across the warm waters of the region the low began to re acquire tropical characteristics the low level circulation became increasingly better defined and convection redeveloped over the center Based on reports from Hurricane Hunters it is estimated the low redeveloped into Tropical Depression Ivan late on September 22 while located about 175 miles south southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River

In its first advisory on the re developed cyclone the National Hurricane Center classified the system Ivan after considerable and sometimes animated in house discussion of its demise in the midst of a low pressure and surface frontal system over the eastern United States based primarily on the reasonable continuity observed in the analysis of the surface and low level circulation In spite of unfavorable wind shear and its disorganized cloud structure the cyclone strengthened to tropical storm status early on September 23 based on Hurricane Hunter reports As an area of deep convection developed over the center Ivan reached winds of 60 mph though the winds decreased as thunderstorm activity diminished Ivan weakened to a tropical depression at 0000 UTC on September 24 and two hours later it moved ashore near Holly Beach Louisiana

At first computer models forecasted the low level circulation to turn southwestward and re emerge into the Gulf of Mexico However the storm rapidly weakened over land and by 1200 UTC on September 24 Ivan degenerated into a remnant low pressure area over southeastern Texas The low turned to the south and the circulation dissipated early on September 25 The remnant trough reached the northwestern Gulf of Mexico later that day producing scatter thunderstorms for a short time before it diminished

Ivan became the southernmost major hurricane on record after reaching Category 3 status on the Saffir Simpson Hurricane Scale at 102 N Additionally the hurricane reached Category 4 and Category 5 status further south than any other Atlantic hurricane At the time Ivan was the sixth most intense Atlantic hurricane on record but has now dropped to the tenth most intense Atlantic hurricane Throughout its existence Ivan kept winds of major hurricane status or greater for a total of 10 days establishing an Atlantic hurricane record Lasting as a tropical cyclone for a total of 450 hours Ivan was the tenth longest tracked Atlantic hurricane on record After making its first landfall in the United States the hurricane spawned a total of 117 tornadoes which is the largest tornado outbreak caused by a tropical cyclone this broke the previous record of 115 set by Hurricane Beulah in 1967

Tropical cyclones are ranked according to their maximum winds using several scales These scales are provided by several bodies including the World Meteorological Organization the National Hurricane Center and the Bureau of Meteorology The National Hurricane Center uses the Saffir Simpson Hurricane Scale for hurricanes in the eastern Pacific and Atlantic basins Australia uses a difference set of tropical cyclone categories for their region Many basins have different names for storms of hurricanetyphooncyclone strength The use of different definitions for maximum sustained wind creates additional confusion into the definitions of cyclone categories worldwide

Gulf Shores is a coastal city in Baldwin County Alabama United States As of the 2000 census the population was 5044 However since the year 2000 Baldwin County Alabama as a whole has experienced the fastest rate of population growth in the state second only to Shelby County Alabama

Hurricane Ivan was the strongest hurricane of the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season The storm formed as a Cape Verde type hurricane in early September and became the ninth named storm the sixth hurricane and the fourth major hurricane of the year Ivan reached Category 5 strength on the Saffir Simpson Hurricane Scale the highest possible category and the only one of the season At the time it was sixth most intense Atlantic hurricane on record

Ivan caused great damage to Grenada which it struck directly at Category 3 strength and heavy damage to Jamaica Grand Cayman and the western tip of Cuba After peaking in strength it moved north northwest across the Gulf of Mexico to make landfall as a strong Category 3 storm in the United States in Orange Beach Alabama causing very heavy damage there Ivan dropped heavy rains on the southeastern United States as it looped across Florida and back into the Gulf of Mexico The remnant low from the storm regenerated into a new tropical system which moved into Louisiana and Texas causing minimal damage Ivan caused an estimated 13 billion worth of damage in the United States making it the fifth costliest hurricane to ever strike the United States

On September 2 Tropical Depression Nine started The next day it became a tropical storm and was called Ivan Tropical Storm Ivan moved to the west and on September 5 it became a hurricane Ivan strengthened fast and by the end of the day on September 5 it became a category 3 hurricane 

Hurricane Ivan weakened a little bit because of wind shear Ivan strengthened back and became a category 2 and later on a category 3 hurricane On September 7 while Ivan was a category 3 hurricane it passed very close to Grenada Ivan entered the Caribbean Sea and again strengthened very fast By the morning of September 8 Hurricane Ivan was a category 4 hurricane and later on that day Hurricane Ivan came close to the Netherlands Antilles 

For about twelve hours on September 9 Hurricane Ivan was a category 5 Hurricane Ivan weakened a little bit before it came close to Jamaica on September 10 Ivan strengthened into a category 5 again on September 11 after moving away from Jamaica At this point Ivan reached its strongest winds which were at 165 mph But Ivan again weakened before it moved close to the Grand Cayman Islands on September 12 

For just one more time Hurricane Ivan again became a category 5 hurricane later on September 12 By later on September 13 it entered the Gulf of Mexico and weakened back to a category 4 hurricane For most of Ivans trip across the Gulf of Mexico it stayed as a category 4 hurricane Later on September 13 it entered the Gulf of Mexico and weakened back to a category 4 hurricane 

For most of Ivans trip across the Gulf of Mexico it stayed as a category 4 hurricane But by midday on September 15 Hurricane Ivan weakened to a category 3 hurricane About 2 am Central Daylight Time on September 16 Hurricane Ivan made landfall in Gulf Shores Alabama while winds were at 120 mph Ivan weakened fast after landfall 

On the same day Hurricane Ivan weakened to a tropical storm in Central Alabama Even later that day in Northern Alabama Tropical Storm Ivan weakened into a depression Tropical Depression Ivan stayed as a depression as it moved through several states On September 18 it almost survived its way back out to the Atlantic Ocean But Tropical Depression Ivan died on September 18 in Eastern Maryland 

The remains entered the Atlantic Ocean and moved south On September 21 the remains of Ivan crossed into Southern Florida The remains moved west and went into the Gulf of Mexico About halfway it reformed and became a tropical depression again on September 22 and shortly later it became a tropical storm again 

Tropical Storm Ivan weakened back to a depression as it moved close to Louisiana and Texas On September 24 Ivan made landfall in Cameron Louisiana and finally died out over Texas on September 24 The remains were last seen in the Gulf of Mexico on September 25

Ivan killed about 121 people 1 in Barbados 2 in Cayman Islands 4 in Dominican Republic 39 in Grenada 17 in Jamaica 1 in Trinidad and Tobago 54 in the United States and 3 in Venezuela In total Ivan caused 18 billion in damage nearly 13 billion was in the United States

Ivan affected many islands in the Caribbean including Barbados Cuba Cayman Islands Dominican Republic Grenada Jamaica and Trinidad Tobago In the Caribbean Ivan caused about 3 billion in damage But the damage in Dominican Republic is unknown The most damage was to the Cayman Islands Cuba and Grenada 35 billion in damage in Cayman Islands 12 billion in Cuba and 11 billion in Grenada

Because the damage was high the name Ivan was retired in the Spring of 2005 Meaning the name Ivan will not be used for another storm in the Atlantic Ocean In 2010 the name Igor may be used instead

Ivan could have caused a wave that was nearly 131 feet high Hurricane Ivan was also at the time the third costliest hurricane in the United States It was beaten by Hurricane Katrina Hurricane Wilma and Hurricane Ike So now it is about the sixth costliest hurricane in the United States Ivan got an ACE total at 7038 with is the second highest for an Atlantic hurricane second only to the 1899 Hurricane San Ciriaco which had 7357

Jean de Joinville was a close friend of Louis and wrote a famous biography of the king from which we have most of our information about him

Two other important biographies were written by the kings confessor Geoffrey of Beaulieu and his chaplain William of Chartres While several other people wrote biographies about the king only Jean de Joinville Geoffrey of Beaulieu and William of Chartres had reliable information

Louis was born in 1214 at Poissy near Paris

He was the son of Louis VIII of France and Blanche of Castile Louis was eleven years old when his father died on November 8 1226 He was crowned king the same year in the cathedral at Reims Because Louis was so young his mother ruled France as regent while he was a child 

His younger brother Charles I of Sicily was made count of Anjou

On May 27 1234 Louis married Marguerite of Provence whose sister Eleanor was the wife of Henry III of England

At the age of 15 Louis brought an end to the Albigensian Crusade in 1229 after signing an agreement with Count Raymond VII of Toulouse

Louiss kindness towards the poor was much celebrated He went on crusade twice in his mid 30s in 1248 and then again in his mid 50s in 1270 Both crusades were complete disasters after initial success in his first attempt Louiss army of 15000 men was met by overwhelming resistance from the Egyptian army and people where he was captured After his release from Egypt Louis spent four years in the crusader Kingdoms of Acre Caesarea and Jaffe

In 1252 Louis attempted an alliance with the Egyptians for the return of Jerusalem if the French assisted with the subduing of Damascus

In 1253 Louis tried to seek allies from the Ismailian Assassins and the Mongols

The Federal Ministry of Intra German Relations was a federal ministry of the Federal Republic of Germany It was responsible for all relations with the East German government This was because the West German government said there should be only one Germany This meant they could not use the Ministry of Foreign Affairs because they could not admit that East Germany was a foreign country

The ministry was created in 1949 as the Federal Ministry of All German Affairs This ministry was also in charge of matters about the German lands east of the Oder Neisse Line which had become a part of Poland The ministry was renamed in 1969 when Willy Brandt signed a treaty with Poland which said that Polands western border was along the Oder and Neisse Rivers This was part of Willy Brandts ideas of Ostpolitik At that time Poland was under a communist government They could not allow West Germany to sign a treaty about East Germanys borders which is why the treaty says the western border of Poland and not the border between Germany and Poland

The ministry was abolished in 1991 about one year after German Reunification after helping with the change to one country All intra German affairs are now jobs of the Ministry of the Interior The Minister of the Interior is now also Commissioner for the New Bundeslnder to show that there is still some work to make all of the states equal

A decomposer means an organism that breaks down large molecules from dead organisms into small molecules and returns important materials to the environment Sooner or later all living things die When a plant or an animal dies its body begins to break down into small pieces Special living things called decomposers break down the body A decomposer makes dead things into chemicals and then the chemicals go into the air ground or water and is used again

Some types of decomposers are Bacteria and Fungi Others are worms and mushrooms The worms live in the ground They eat their way through bits of dead plants and animals Some mushrooms and fungi grow out of dead plants and animals to help break them down But most decomposers are too small for us to see They are all around us in the air and in the ground

Decomposers are very helpful to the ecosystem and human race If there were no decomposers and if dead plants and animals did not break down Earth would be covered with their bodies Decomposers are needed by living creatures They keep the Earth clean and help plants grow and recycle corpses

Albniz started to learn the piano when he was three His elder sister taught him He was a child prodigy who first performed at the age of four When he was seven he passed the entrance examination for piano at the Paris Conservatoire but he was not given a place because they thought he was too young A year later his father lost his job so he took his two children on tour so that they could give concerts and earn some money In 1869 the family moved to Madrid but Albniz had an unsettled childhood He twice ran away from home giving concerts in various places and even escaping as a stowaway to South America where he visited Argentina Uruguay Brazil Cuba Puerto Rico and then the USA He returned to Spain in 1873 By the age of fifteen he had already given concerts all over the world After a short stay at the Leipzig Conservatory in 1876 he went to study in Brussels In 1880 he went to Budapest wanting to study with Franz Liszt but Liszt was not there

Anglo Saxon mythology refers to the Migration Period Germanic paganism practiced by the English peoples in 5th to 7th century England

The Anglo Saxons composed of tribes of the Angles Saxons Friesian and Jutes arrived in Britain from southern Scandinavia the Netherlands and northern Germany It is from these people that the modern English language derives An impression but only that of the Anglo Saxon mythology can be obtained from reading about Scandinavian mythology The latter was written down much later by Snorri Sturluson because Iceland remained pagan until well into the Christian era The Norse of Iceland and the English certainly shared a common ancestry in 6th century Denmark The Anglo Saxons were a largely illiterate society and tales were orally transmitted between groups and tribes by the Anglo Saxon traveling minstrels the scops in the form of verse

The chief literary source is Bede a Christian monk who wrote of the old English calendar in his De Temporum Ratione Only a little Old English poetry has survived and all of it has had Christian editors The epic poem Beowulf is an important source of Anglo Saxon pagan poetry and history but it is clearly addressed to a Christian audience containing numerous references to the Christian God and using Christian phrasing and metaphor The monster Grendel for example is described as a descendant of the biblical Cain In fact the only fragment of poetry dating to the pagan era that has not undergone edits by Christian editors is the Finnsburgh Fragment

The Anglo Saxons believed in supernatural creatures such as elves dwarves and giants who often brought harm to men It is likely that they believed in Wyrd usually translated as fate although the modern term fate does little justice to the true meaning of wyrd

Being a Germanic people the Anglo Saxons worshiped the same gods as the Norse and other Germanic peoples The names are slightly different due to the differences in language among the Germanic peoples For example Thunor of the Anglo Saxons was the same god as Thor of the Norse and Donar of the Germans Likewise Woden of the Anglo Saxons is the same as Odin among the Norse and Wotan of the Germans 

The religious ideas of the Anglo Saxons made allowance for the worship of many gods There the Anglo Saxons had temples that housed images of their gods as well as an altar Pope Gregory instructed Augustine to destroy the idols but use their houses for Christian worship

The se correspond to the Norse sir

Woden the leader of the Wild Hunt and the one who carries off the dead is one of the chief gods of the Anglo Saxons before the Christian era He was held to be the ancestor of Hengest and Horsa two legendary figures from early English history and most of the early Anglo Saxon kings claimed descent from Woden He gives us the modern Wednesday

Thunor is the god of thunder who rules the storms and sky He also protects mankind from the giants He was the god of the common people within the heathen community His name gives rise to the modern Thursday

Frge is the goddess of love and is the wife of Woden She is one of the most powerful Goddesses this position being threatened only by Freya Her day is Friday but there is also the belief that Friday is named for Freya instead

Tiw is the god of warfare and battle and gives us Tuesday Some people believe that he is a sky god figure and formerly the chief god replaced over the years by Woden

Ingui Fry was one of the most popular Gods after Thunor and Woden  there is evidence to suggest that Ingui was the most popular of the Anglo Saxon deities his cult later being replaced in popularity by that of the Ese He is above all the god of fertility bringing  and fruitfulness to the crops herds and the folk Though he is a fertility god he is also connected to warfare to a degree however this warfare is defensive as opposed to offensive and is not to create havoc After all peace is necessary for a good harvest and a productive community while needless warfare destroys any prospect of peace and fruitfulness The Yngling royal line of Sweden claimed descent from him 

Freya or Freo is said to be the most beautiful of all the goddesses and is therefore described as the goddess of love She is not to be mistaken with Frige however Friggas is love and marriage It is likely that Freya directed Wodens Waelcyrge onto the battlefield to claim the dead soldiers Like her brother Fry she is connected to abundance and wealth however her wealth is in metals and gems She is also a goddess of magic having taught Woden seithr 

Neorth is Frey and Freyas father and is the god of the seas and commerce He is called upon by fishermen and sailors who depend upon good seas Like his son and daughter his realm is that of wealth namely the wealth of the sea He married the giantess Sceadu though the marriage was not successful as neither of them could accept the others element Sceadu his sea and Neorth her mountains

Hengest and Horsa who are named in historical sources as leaders of the earliest Anglo Saxon raids and settlements in the south may also had deific status The name Hengest means stallion and Horsa means horse the horse in the Anglo Saxon mythology is an important symbol

Wayland is a mythic smith Originally he was an elvish being a shape changer like his wife a swan maiden and Waelcyrge His picture adorns the Franks Casket an Anglo Saxon royal box and was meant there to refer to wealth and partnership 

Eorthe whose name means Earth is the wife of Woden and mother of Thunor She is also the daughter of the Goddess Niht Her worship is generally passive as opposed to active though she is called on for might and main Her latent strength can be seen in her son Thunor

Eostre according to St Bede was a Goddess whose feast was celebrated in Spring Bede asserts that the current Christian festival of Easter took its name from the Goddesss feast in Eostur monath

Niht is the Goddess of Night and also the mother of Eorthe The Norse night was the daughter of Narvi She was married three times the first to Naglfari by whom she had Aud the second to Annar by whom she had Eorthe and the third to Dellinger Daeg

Sigel is the Goddess of the Sun Her day is of course Sunday

Since Anglo Saxon religion a subset of Germanic paganism in general many of its central practices are also shared by other religions such as the religion of the Norse peoples

The Germanic gods have affected elements of every day western life in most countries that speak Germanic languages An example is some of the names of the days of the week Most of the days of the week were named after Roman gods in Latin The names for Tuesday through Friday were replaced with Germanic versions of the Roman gods In English Saturn was not replaced Saturday is named after the sabbath in German and is called washing day in Scandinavia Sunday and Monday are named after the Sun and the Moon

Also many place names such as Woodway House Wansdyke Thundersley and Frigedene are named after the old deities of the English people

JRR Tolkiens The Lord of the Rings was influenced by the myths of the Northern Europeans As it became popular parts of its fantasy world moved into how people see the fantasy genre In almost any modern fantasy novel you can find Germanic creatures like elves dwarves and giants

Hengest was a semi legendary ruler of Kent in southeast England His name is Anglo Saxon for stallion Horsa Hengests brother was a 5th century warrior who took part in the settlement of Britain

Holly Beach also known as the Cajun Riviera is a coastal town in the state of Louisiana United States in Cameron Parish It is located 10 miles west of Cameron and 12 miles east of Johnson Bayou

Wayland was the Germanic god of blacksmiths In Anglo Saxon writing he appears in Deor Waldere and in Beowulf and the legend is shown on the Franks Casket 

Wayland is connected with Waylands Smithy a burial mound in Oxfordshire This was named by the Saxons but it was there before them The place has a superstition that says that if a horse is left there overnight with a small silver coin it would have new shoes by morning

The 1982 FIFA World Cup was a football sporting event that was held in Spain in 1982 Italy won the trophy after beating Germany in the final

A sporting event is when athletes play games or matches to compete or otherwise show off their abilities in athletics

Penance is repentance of sins as well as the name of the Catholic Sacrament of Penance and ReconciliationConfession The word penance comes from the Latin poenitentia the same root as penitence which in English means repentance the desire to be forgiven see contrition in many languages there is only one single word for it Penance and repentance were similar in their original sense After the controversy about the merits of faith and good works they are seen as conflicting views

At the start of the season six teams needed to pre qualify Lola AGS EuroBrun Osella Coloni and Life

The first race of the year was held in Phoenix USA Unexpected rain in qualifying led to a grid with Gerhard Berger on pole position with Pierluigi Martini second in the Minardi Andrea de Cesaris third in the Dallara Jean Alesi fourth in the Tyrrell Ayrton Senna down in fifth and Nelson Piquet sixth Alesi took the lead at the start ahead of Berger de Cesaris Senna Martini and Piquet 

Alesi pulled away and Berger was dropping back Senna passed de Cesaris and Berger hit a wall on lap 9 forcing him to pit He charged back but retired with clutch problems Alesi was 82 seconds ahead but Senna started to reel him in Senna attacked on lap 34 but Alesi defended and kept the lead Senna did the job properly one lap later and pulled away to win Behind Thierry Boutsen passed Piquet to take third with Stefano Modenas Brabham and Satoru Nakajimas Tyrrell getting the final points

In qualifying in Brazil Senna and Berger were 1 2 with Boutsen and Patrese 3 4 and the Ferraris of Nigel Mansell and Alain Prost behind them At the start Senna led Berger Boutsen Prost Patrese and Mansell Boutsen passed Berger early on but could not keep up with Senna

At the stops Boutsen ran into a tyre and had to change his nose cone dropping back to 11th and some good work from the Ferrari crew got Prost ahead of Berger and Mansell ahead of Patrese Senna was ahead of Prost Berger Mansell Patrese and Alesi Senna 10 seconds ahead hit backmarker Nakajima forcing him to pit and drop back to third With just a few laps to go Patrese retired with a broken oil cooler Prost duly won from Berger Senna Mansell the recovering Boutsen and Piquet

An almost identical grid to Brazil saw Senna Berger Patrese Boutsen Mansell and Prost line up after qualifying At the start Senna and Berger got away well but Boutsen sliced ahead of Patrese to take third with Mansell and Prost behind Boutsen passed Berger on lap 2 On the next lap a stone sliced through Sennas wheelrim spinning him into a sandtrap and out of the race Boutsen pulled away from Berger but his engine blew on lap 18 

Soon Mansell passed Patrese and then attacked Berger Berger closed the door and Mansell spun without hitting anything nor losing a place He set off after Berger again but retired with engine problems At the second stops Nannini got ahead of Prost Patrese closed in on Berger and passed him on lap 51 Patrese pulled away and won from Berger Nannini Prost Piquet and Alesi

In Monaco Senna took pole but Prost was second with Alesi third ahead of Patrese Berger and Boutsen At the start Berger collided with Prost blocking the track and stopping the race The second was all right and Senna led from Prost Alesi Berger Patrese and Boutsen 

The race settled down and nothing changed until lap 30 when Prost retired with a battery failure Then Mansell hit the back of Boutsen and was forced to pit and changed his front wing Patreses distributor failed on lap 42 Behind Mansell was charging through the field and passed Boutsen to take fourth But then he was sidelined with the same problem as Prost At the front Senna won from Alesi Berger Boutsen Alex Caffi in the Arrows and ric Bernards Larrousse

Canada was next and the McLarens were 1 2 in qualifying with Senna ahead of Berger with Prost third Nannini fourth Piquet fifth and Boutsen sixth The track was damp on race day and Berger jumped the start and then hesitated He got a 1 minute time penalty as well as allowing Senna to lead on the road Senna led Nannini Alesi Prost Boutsen and Piquet 

The track began to dry and everyone pitted But when Nannini rejoined he hit a groundhog and had to pit again for repairs He spun off on lap 22 Berger took the lead on the road but he needed a minute to stay ahead at the end He charged and was a second quicker than the others as Boutsen spun off while battling Prost Senna now led from Prost Piquet Mansell Patrese and Derek Warwick 

Piquet after many laps finally passed Prost who was then attacked by Mansell Patrese retired putting Berger to fifth Mansell passed Prost and slowly pulled away With two laps to go Berger got past Prost on aggregate but could not get ahead of Mansell Senna won from Piquet Mansell Berger Prost and Warwick

After Canada came Mexico and Berger qualified on pole position with Patrese beside him and Senna third Mansell fourth Boutsen fifth and Alesi sixth At the start Patrese and Berger jumped Senna while Piquet got ahead of Boutsen and Mansell Early on Senna passed Patrese and Berger followed him through Patrese was dropping back and Piquet got by him as well Boutsen was the next to go through but at the same time Berger had a problem with his tyre and was forced to stop and dropped back to 12th Senna lead from Piquet Boutsen Patrese Mansell and Prost 

Soon Mansell passed Patrese and got Boutsen four laps later as Prost did the same to Patrese Prost sneaked ahead of Boutsen as Mansell closed in on Piquet Mansell got ahead on lap 36 and Prost followed him through six laps later Piquet soon stopped and dropped behind Nannini Boutsen and Berger Berger passed Boutsen on lap 47 and Nannini four laps later Prost passed Mansell on lap 55 and they began to close in on Senna Prost passed Senna followed by Mansell Then Mansell spun but at the same time Senna got a puncture that let to him retiring in the pits 4 laps before the end and allowing Berger to get third and close in to Mansell With a daring move Berger passed Mansell but Mansell charged back and attacked taking back second place Prost won with Mansell second making it a Ferrari 1 2 ahead of Berger Nannini Boutsen and Piquet

France was next the fans were wearing red and a Ferrari did take pole However it was not their hero Prost but Mansell who was ahead of Berger Senna Prost Nannini and Patrese At the start Berger got past Mansell while Prost lost out as well Berger led with Mansell Senna Nannini Patrese and Prost behind On lap 2 Senna passed Mansell for second and the order stayed like that until Senna passed Berger whose tyres were destroyed 

Nannini and Piquet pitted early while Berger and Senna went too late Mansell and Prosts tyres lasted longer and thus they pitted late Riccardo Patrese went too late and was the big loser This left the two Leyton Houses ahead with a totally shuffled order behind them Ivan Capelli led Maurcio Gugelmin Prost Nannini Mansell and Senna Prost then caught and passed Gugelmin who then went out with engine trouble 

As Prost closed in on Capelli Mansell sneaked past Nannini and started to close in on Capelli and Prost Capelli defended from Prost on each an every attempt as Mansell went out with engine trouble Nannini took third but he then had electrical trouble and was forced to retire while Prost passed Capelli with three laps to go Prost won ahead of Capelli Senna Piquet Berger and Patrese

Britain was next and Mansell roared on by his home fans took pole with Senna second Berger third Boutsen fourth Prost fifth and Alesi sixth At the start Senna outdragged Mansell while Alesi also got bogged back Senna led from Mansell Berger Boutsen Prost and Patrese But Mansell then passed Senna on lap 2 and Senna spun on the next lap dropping down to fifth 

Soon Prost passed Boutsen for third as Mansell began to have troubles with his gearbox Berger passed him to lead but then Mansells car seemed to improve again He repassed Berger but Prost was right behind them by now Soon Prost sneaked by Berger and chased off after Mansell who had gearbox issues again Prost got ahead of Mansell on lap 44 and pulled away 

However Berger was unable to catch Mansell as he in turn had handling issues Behind them Piquet who had tyre trouble spun giving fifth to Senna Mansell then suddenly slowed down on lap 55 as his gearbox troubles became serious ending hopes of a Ferrari 1 2 Berger took second but he went out with throttle failure five laps later In between Bernard had passed Piquet as well Prost won again from Boutsen Senna Bernard Piquet and Aguri Suzuki

Thus at the halfway stage Prost led with 41 points with Senna second with 39 Berger third with 25 Piquet fourth with 18 Boutsen fifth with 17 Alesi and Mansell sharing sixth with 13 with Patrese eighth with 10 In the constructors McLaren with 64 points led Ferrari who were second with 54 Williams who were third with 27 and Benetton who were fourth with 25

At the start of second half of the season there was minor shake up in pre qualifying Lola escaped due to their points while two Ligiers needed pre qualifying

McLarens were 1 2 in qualifying Senna ahead of Berger Ferrari were 3 4 with Prost ahead of Mansell and Williams were 5 6 to complete the Noahs Ark formation Patrese ahead of Boutsen At the start Berger took off better than Senna but Senna just stayed ahead with Berger second Prost third Mansell fourth with Patrese fifth and Piquet sixth 

There were no changes until lap 11 when Piquet tried to pass Patrese and went through an escape road allowing Nannini to get ahead Three laps later Mansell went through the grass at Ostkurve without losing a place but damaging his car It proved crucial as he retired two laps later the damage being too much Meanwhile Nannini passed Patrese as the top three stopped for tyres the Williamses and Benettons planning to go without a stop Piquet retired with engine trouble 

Thus Nannini led Senna Patrese Piquet Berger and Prost Patreses tyres were too badly damaged and he was forced to pit Prost then passed Boutsen for fourth with Patrese following him two laps later On lap 34 Senna passed Nannini for the lead and pulled away Senna won from Nannini Berger Prost Patrese and Boutsen

Hungary was next and the Williamses qualified ahead of the McLarens Boutsen taking pole ahead of Patrese Berger Senna Mansell and Alesi At the start Boutsen kept the lead but it was Berger went away best and passed Patrese while Senna was worst and lost out to both Mansell and Alesi Thus it was Boutsen Berger Patrese Mansell Alesi and Senna 

It stayed like that on lap 21 when Senna passed Alesi for fifth but he was forced to pit on the next lap with a slow puncture Nannini soon passed Alesi to take fifth The leaders stopped and Berger was the big loser with Nannini and Senna the big gainers rising directly behind the Williams men The order was Boutsen Patrese Nannini Senna Mansell and Berger Boutsen then pulled away while Patrese held up the others until Nannini streamed by with Senna following him 

Patrese then pitted and dropped behind Piquet as Berger passed Mansell only for Mansell to get back at him Senna tried to pass Nannini on lap 64 and tipped Nannini into a spin and retirement Berger tried to do the same thing on Mansell on lap 72 at the same corner with the same result  a collision but with both cars out Boutsen won ahead of Senna Piquet Patrese Warwick and Bernard

Monteverdi team had pulled out of F1 meaning that two Ligiers escaped from pre qualifying again In Belgium McLaren were 1 2 with Senna on pole ahead of Berger Prost Boutsen Mansell and Patrese At the first start Piquet pushed Mansell off the road and soon Nakajima and Modena collided as well resulting in start No2 

Once again Senna took the lead while Boutsen sliced into second and Prost dropped back to fifth However Paolo Barilla smashed into a wall in his Minardi blocking the track as well as bringing out the red flags 

Start No3 was clean and Senna took the lead ahead of Berger Prost Boutsen Patrese and Nannini On lap 11 Mansell was into the pits with handling problems He went out but retired eight laps later as the problems became serious On lap 14 Prost sliced ahead of Berger who then pitted for tyres Senna and Prost separated by 2 seconds stopped at the same time but then Nannini who was planning to go without stopping came in between them Then both Patrese and Boutsen went out with gearbox troubles Prost passed Nannini and Berger tried the same but this time Nannini came back at him to keep the place On lap 41 Nannini went wide and Berger sailed through to take third Senna duly won from Prost Berger Nannini Piquet and Gugelmin 

With five more races to go Senna now had 63 points 13 points ahead of Prost with 50 Berger was third with 33 Boutsen fourth with 27 Piquet fifth with 24 Nannini sixth with 16 Patrese seventh with 15 with Alesi eighth with 13 In the constructors McLaren led with 96 with Ferrari second with 63 Williams third with 42 and Benetton fourth with 40

After Belgium came Italy and Senna took pole again with Prost second Berger third Mansell fourth Alesi fifth and Boutsen sixth At the start Berger raced past Prost while Alesi jumped by both the Ferraris But Warwick crashed at the Parabolica bringing out the red flags In the restart Berger got past Prost and Alesi got by Mansell immediately Alesi then passed Prost into the second corner and so we had Senna leading Berger Alesi Prost Mansell and Boutsen

On lap 5 Alesi spun off and retired Nothing changed until lap 18 when Boutsen retired with a suspension failure and Bergers tyres began to fade Prost then passed Berger and the stops did not change anything The top three then began to battle for the lead but none was able to close in on the other while Mansell continued to drop back fighting a faulty throttle return spring Senna won from Prost Berger Mansell Patrese and Nakajima

Portugal was next and the Ferraris took 1 2 in qualifying with Mansell ahead of Prost Senna Berger Patrese and Piquet At the start Mansells snaky start almost took Prost out and the McLarens blasted by them with Piquet getting by Prost as well The order was Senna Berger Mansell Piquet Prost and Boutsen 

On lap 13 Prost took Piquet for fourth and later Mansell went to the grass allowing Prost to take third Mansell and Berger pitted soon as Prost passed Senna at the same time to lead These two soon pitted as well with a shuffled order Senna Mansell Berger Prost Nannini and Piquet The Ferraris started to close in on the McLarens in front of them by now Behind them Piquet passed Nannini to take fifth 

On lap 50 Mansell was close to Senna and passed him to lead He pulled away fast but then hit Phillipe Alliot while lapping him pushing the Ligier into a wall while Mansell got away with no damage Prost then passed Berger on lap 59 Two laps later Suzuki and Caffi collided and with the latter stuck in the cockpit on a zone with the wall next to the track the race was stopped Thus Mansell won from Senna Prost Berger Piquet and Nannini

Now in Spain and Senna took his 50th career pole position ahead of Prost Mansell Alesi Berger and Patrese At the start Senna took off into the lead but behind them Patrese hit Alesi spinning him into the gravel trap and into retirement Lap 1 and Senna led Prost Mansell Berger Boutsen and Patrese 

Berger was holding up a train of four cras behind him none of them able to pass on the twisty Jerez circuit At the stops Mansell got ahead of Prost but waved Prost through to help his championship hopes just as Senna was coming out of the pits He split the two Ferraris The order was Piquet Prost Senna Mansell Nannini and Boutsen 

Prost started to attack Piquet who succumbed to the pressure and went wide dropping down to fourth Then Mansell attacked and passed Senna to make it a 1 2 for Ferrari as Piquet retired with battery problems Senna pitted for tyres but retired when his radiator failed soon after Three laps later Berger attacked Boutsen for fourth and two collided Berger spinning out Prost won with Mansell making it a Ferrari 1 2 ahead of Nannini Boutsen Patrese and Suzuki

With two races to go Senna had 78 points to Prosts 69 and with both having 11 results in the points it was clear that they would have to drop points However Senna would have had to drop two third places unlike Prost who would only have to drop a fourth and a fifth Berger was third with 40 Mansell was fourth with 31 Boutsen was fifth with 30 Piquet was sixth with 26 Nannini seventh with 21 and Patrese eighth with 19 In the constructors McLaren led with 118 points with Ferrari second with 100 Williams was third with 49 and Benetton was fourth with 47

Before the Japanese Grand Prix Nannini was involved in a helicopter crash and sustained career ending injuries He was replaced by Roberto Moreno for the rest of the season Moreno had been free since EuroBrun had withdrawn from Formula One along with Life As a result pre qualifying was not needed

In qualifying Senna took pole ahead of Prost Mansell Berger Boutsen and Piquet However Senna was unhappy at the side on which the pole was located on as the pole was located on the dirty side of the track and thus the second place being on the racing line which should give the second placed driver the advantage into the first corner He went to FISA president Jean Marie Balestre to change the side on which pole was located but was refused After this he decided that he would go for any gap into the first corner if Prost had the advantage At the start Prost did have the advantage and Senna went for the gap Prost did not know it and closed the door Sennas left front touched Prosts rear wing spinning both of them into the gravel trap The world championship was sealed 

Although Senna led by 9 points and there were 9 points for a win if Prost won the last race he would have had to drop his fifth place in Canada which meant that he would be two points behind Senna even if Senna retired Senna was the new world champion Back to the race now and Berger was leading Mansell Piquet Moreno Boutsen and Patrese At the start of the second lap Berger spun off into retirement after hitting debris from the Senna Prost collision This left Mansell who was under pressure by the Benettons leading 

Mansell then began to pull away from Piquet and Moreno as Suzuki passed Warwick for sixth Mansell pitted with a 15 second lead on lap 27 for tyres but his driveshaft snapped as he went out of his garage He retired giving the Constructors title to McLaren as they were 18 points ahead and a 1 2 can get only 15 points The Benettons and Suzuki did not stop but Patrese and Boutsen did with Patrese getting ahead at the stops but both rejoined behind Suzuki Then Nakajima passed Warwick to take sixth as Warwick then retired with gearbox trouble Piquet won with Moreno making it a Benetton 1 2 Suzuki was third Patrese fourth Boutsen fifth and Nakajima sixth

The last race of the year was in Australia and the McLarens took 1 2 in qualifying ahead of the Ferraris Senna ahead of Berger Mansell Prost Alesi and Patrese At the start Senna took off into the lead with Berger defending from the Ferraris and Piquet getting by Alesi and Patrese The order was Senna Berger Mansell Prost Piquet and Alesi 

On lap 2 Berger missed a gear selection allowing Mansell to get ahead While defending from Prost he held up Prost allowing Piquet to get ahead of him Piquet soon passed Berger for third and the order settled down Senna and Mansell continued to pull away from the rest none of them able to keep up Soon Patrese got past Alesi with Boutsen following suit 

Then on lap 43 Mansell went up an escape road giving Senna a good lead Mansell was caught and passed by Piquet and pitted for tyres soon after At the stops Boutsen got ahead of Patrese Berger then ran wide entering the Brabham straight allowing Prost to take third Mansell passed Berger on lap 57 and soon passed Prost on his new tyres Senna had a gearbox glitch on lap 62 and went straight on into the wall and retired Mansell closed in on Piquet breaking the lap record 3 times towards the finish taking 2 seconds a lap out of his lead Piquet made an error with 4 laps to go allowing Mansell to close right up Mansell attacked on the last lap with a desperate passing attempt at the end of the straight was too far behind to make the pass Thus Piquet won from Mansell Prost Berger Boutsen and Patrese

At the end of the season Senna was world champion with 78 points with Prost second with 71 Piquet third with 43 Berger fourth with 43 Mansell fifth with 37 Boutsen sixth with 34 Patrese seventh with 23 and Nannini eighth with 21 In the constructors McLaren were champions with 121 points with Ferrari second with 110 Benetton third with 71 and Williams fourth with 55

Comedy drama also called dramedy or crama is a style of television and movies when there are equal amounts of both humor and seriousness 

Traditional theatre was separated from its earliest days into comedy and tragedy Authors such as Anton Chekov and George Bernard Shaw famously blurred the line between comedy and drama  

In live theatre the difference between comedy and tragedy became less and less significant in mass media comedy and drama were clearly separated Comedies especially were meant to only have jokes and not any serious content

By the early 1960s television had started to present half hour long comedy series or one hour long dramas Half hour series were mostly situation comedy or family comedy One hour dramas could have detective series westerns and science fiction

A drama comedy today is usually an hour long dramatic series with funny jokes such as Moonlighting Northern Exposure Auf Wiedersehen Pet Buffy the Vampire Slayer Eureka Life on Mars House Desperate Housewives Charmed Popular Skins Monk Psych Gilmore Girls The OC Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip Ally McBeal Ugly Betty Brothers Sisters Greys Anatomy or Boston Legal

The contrabass trombone is the lowest sounding trombone used in music today It sometimes has a double slide meaning that the slide tube wraps twice instead of once like on a tenor trombone

The bass trombone is different from the tenor trombone because it has one or two triggers and has a larger bell which makes it sound better in lower octaves Most bands have only one bass trombonist Usually if a song does not have a bass trombone part the bass trombonist reads off the 3rd or 4th trombone part

A Global Positioning System also known as GPS is a system designed to help navigate on the Earth in the air and on water

A GPS receiver shows where it is It also shows how fast it is moving which direction it is going how high it is and maybe how fast it is going up or down Many GPS receivers have information about places GPSs for automobiles have travel data like road maps hotels restaurants and service stations GPSs for boats contain nautical charts of harbors marinas shallow water rocks and waterways Other GPSs for planes hiking and backpacking bicycling or many other activities

Most GPS receivers record where they have been and help plan a journey While traveling a planned journey it predicts the time to the next destination

A GPS unit gets radio signals from satellites in space circling the Earth There are about 30 satellites convert20200kmmi 2 above the Earth Far from the North Pole and South Pole a GPS unit can receive signals from 6 to 12 satellites at once Each satellite contains an atomic clock which is carefully set by NORAD several times every day

The radio signals contain very good time and position of the satellite The GPS receiver subtracts the current time from the time the signal was sent The difference is how long ago the signal was sent The time difference multiplied by the speed of light is the distance to the satellite The GPS unit uses trigonometry to calculate where it is from each satellites position and distance Usually there must be at least four satellites to solve the geometric equations

A GPS receiver can calculate its position many times in one second A GPS receiver calculates its speed and direction by using its change in position and change in time

Many inexpensive consumer receivers are accurate to convert20mft0 most anywhere on the Earth Sometimes military and costly commercial receivers are accurate to convert30cmin0

The system was created by the United States Department of Defense In the beginning it was only used by the US military but in 1983 President Ronald Reagan made an order to allow anyone to use the system

Sometimes GPS receivers are part of cell phones wrist watches and cars

There are other systems that act in the same way One was put in space by Russia called GLONASS Another that is not yet done is Galileo built by the European Union

Transmitter is an electronic device or tool which sends a signal through electromagnetic radiation It is used by people to communicate Transmitter sizes can be very small for people to use or wear or can be as big as a building

For the WWE diva see Layla El

Layla is a song by Derek and the Dominos The song first appeared on the album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs This song clocks in at 7 minutes and 4 seconds and it is split into two sections The first section has the unmistakable guitar riff which has two parts to it The first part is played on a Brownie guitar by Eric Clapton The next part that comes in is played on a Gibson Les Paul by Duane Allman Clapton also sings the lead vocals Bobby Whitlock sings the backup vocals and he plays the keyboard Carl Radle plays the bass and Jim Gordon plays the drums He plays the piano part in the second segment and Clapton and Allman both play slide guitar during the piano exit part Bobby Whitlock plays an acoustic guitar which augments the piano While Led Zeppelins Stairway to Heaven builds from a quiet introduction to a hard rock finale Layla does pretty much the opposite

This song was dedicated to Pattie Boyd who was already married to George Harrison The lyrics have something to do with unrequited love The song was also named after a fictional character in a movie

Royal Warrants of Appointment are given by members of the British Royal Family to companies and other people who supply them with goods

The warrant does not mean that the things are the best only that the Royal family has been buying then for at least five years

Only three members of the Royal Family issue warrants now They are

The Queen Mother also issued royal warrants They were all expired in 2007 five years after her death

Many royal families in Europe issued similar awards Sweden still does but they are for supplying the Royal Swedish Court that is the royal palace rather than a named member of the royal family

Antonio de Cabezn was a Spanish composer and organist of the Renaissance He was blind from early childhood He is best known for the music he composed for the organ

His parents came from noble families and owned a lot of land He probably had his first organ lessons at the local church Then he had more music lessons in Palencia He probably had organ lessons from the cathedral organist He never had an official job at the cathedral but he must have been an excellent student and his teachers who had a lot of influence recommended him to the royal family In 1526 he became organist to Queen Isabella and played at the Spanish chamber concerts of King Charles V of Spain

About 1538 he married the daughter of a rich family and he went to live in Avila where his wife came from They had five children who had important positions at the royal court when they grew up

After Queen Isabella died he spent all his time working for Prince Philip who became Philip II King Philip thought he was the worlds greatest artist except for the painter Titian He often travelled with the king to countries such as Italy Germany Luxembourg and the Netherlands He influenced many European composers that he met and they influenced him When the king moved to Madrid and made it the capital of Spain Cabezn went there too He stayed there until his death

Cabezn was one of the greatest composers of his time He was good at writing music which sounded just right for the organ and the clavichord He used the techniques of other composers of his time but added some very special effects Instead of just putting in a lot of ornamentation to make the music interesting he enjoyed creating tension between harmony and melody

He wrote diferencias which use Spanish tunes which were often dances such as the folia pavan and galliard Many of his organ compositions are called glosas  Each one has something very special to say

Creol blcoked a rather broad IP range after his checkuser investigations about a username vandal who created 43 vandal accounts with the names of admins or famous people in them Today 8819817578 and 88659219 where used to post unblock requests for the blocked range As the unblock requests were not filled correctly I deleted them The IPs do not reside in the same country too Anyways I thought itd be useful to report it here so if the requests continued we could consider restricting the range a little if possible Best  Huji reply 1520 13 October 2007

Maxim I guess we sort of discussed this on IRC too some time ago As an admin I think it would be okay to tag those redirects which are obviously useless as QD However please also notice that if a QD request is returened the page can only be deleted through RfD  Huji reply 2001 20 October 2007

We have over time dealt a lot with the Username vandal This is the person who creates most of the accounts targeting people who either revert or block his actions here I originally blocked a rather wide section of ips to limit the problem but this isnt going to stop them it will only slow them down The original block was set against all Verizon wireless users Basically the user was creating accounts via the web browser on their cell phone This allowed them to create at any time of the day that they got bored With the main block they were limited to doing it from their computer at home but at least they are partially limited Since the initial block their actions have been limited to hunting out open proxies to cause their disruption To combat this I am routinely checking IPs on those accounts which are blatant socks of this vandal to identify the IP and then try and verify if it is an open proxy in need of blocking I am doing this pro actively on the most obvious instances rather than waiting for a Check user request for each and every name this person creates as part of an on going vandalism problem At least two computer profiles have emerged in addition to the cell phone for this person 

As the entire range of IPs has shown no actions which were not tied to this vandalism and the likelihood of a productive editor coming from a group that uses cellphones to edit is very small I do not see blocking the entire range as an issue As a worst case scenario a person who actually does want to edit that way can create an account from home and then edit whenever via cellphone There is also a range of open proxies from a specific company that is presenting itself as a problem Several of the open proxies are all controlled by a specific web host out of Chicago This is a company that serves as a commercial source for web spaces I do not think we are likely to get anything but trouble from any person who would re route their connection through a commercial source like this A check of their ip range has included only one semi valid edit If this group continues to present a problem with open proxies a wider block many one day be warranted  Creol 0610 16 October 2007

Ionas68224 joined the wikipedia simple channel a while ago and admitted to being the Wikipedia facing serious attackLinda E MackChinese text vandal blaming his uncontrollable urge to vandalise on his ban I also believe he created UserAmorrow as well Archer7  talk 2328 24 October 2007

Indeed Ionas is already helping Simple English Wikipedia by providing us with a list of open proxies Even I had to laugh at that one 

I agree I was way too harsh on the Community at first and I need at the very least a 3 month ban but 9 at most I wont be taking a year break from Wikipedia

I was rude to the community being disruptive and pranksterish I understand that while most of my activities were in good faith I surely didnt show it and I devastated this site I truly and humbly apologise for the activities I have done and hope to clear of my past and contribute as I did with one sockpuppet smalltalker which you have to admit did contribute constructively

However my apolog may not be taken seriously for I vandalised with sockpuppets the first being COCO eventually spiraling into what I call WP attack replacing pages with the chinese text and the words Wikipedia facing serious attack However there are two types of vandals 1 Situational vandals who vandalise when a certain action happens to them and take out their rage against what they see as manipulating them and 2 Outright vandals who vandalise to troll and get attention I am the first and I was quite rude So since certain parts of my brain debate with each other the vandal part of my brain wins the debate over the sensical side I begin to vandalise with anger

Since I am a situational vandal I dont always vandalise and if it werent for the ban I wouldnt have vandalised But if I think about it I caused it myself for disruption It was my own choice that I didnt think ahead that 1 I was doing something stupid and 2 it would damage my reputation here forever I was immature and I have only myself to blame

But if I were given one just one more chance to edit constructively I would gladly thank the administrators who granted my wish

The only reason I keep editing here is because I feel if I didnt respond I would be ignoring you I also want to respond as quickly as I can to respond to and answer all questions 

I would like to thank Snake311 and Spiderpig for being the nice people they always were Your kindness helps me along times like this  Ionas

Glosa is a term that was often used by Spanish musicians in the 16th century to mean a piece of music which was similar to a set of variations Composers at that time often wrote collections of glosas The term is related to the word gloss They were comparing it to gloss that a poet might put on his poem They were often on religious themes

Antonio de Cabezn was an important composer of glosas

Glosa was also used by Spanish musicians to mean musical ornamentation This is the meaning in the title of a famous book of music for viola da gamba and harpsichord by Diego Ortiz called Trattado de glosas

This asteroid was found by Annibale de Gasparis on March 17 1852 from Naples and named after the Greek nymph Psyche The first fifteen asteroids to be found were given symbols by astronomers as a type of short hand notation In 1851 however J F Encke suggested using a circled number 16 Psyche was the first new asteroid to be found that was designated with this scheme

Radar observations indicate that it is made of iron nickel Psyche appears to be a case of an exposed metallic core from a bigger differentiated parent body Unlike some other M type asteroids Psyche shows no sign of the presence of water or water bearing minerals on its surface consistent with its interpretation as a metallic body Small amounts of pyroxene appear to be present

If Psyche is the core remnant of a bigger parent body we might expect other asteroids on similar orbits Psyche does not belong to any asteroid family One theory is that the collision occurred very early in the solar systems history and all the other remnants have since been ground into fragments by subsequent collisions or had their orbits perturbed beyond recognition

Psyche is massive enough that its perturbations on other asteroids can be measured which enables a mass measurement Its density is fairly low for metal indicating a fairly high porosity of 3040

Psyche appears to have a fairly round surface and is approximately ellipsoidal in shape Recent lightcurve analysis indicates that its pole points towards either ecliptic coordinates  or with a 10 uncertainty This gives an axial tilt of 95

Two stellar occultations by Psyche have been seen Lightcurve changes indicate a non spherical body consistent with the lightcurve and radar results

The Mid Atlantic States form one of the nine geographic divisions within the United States that are officially recognized by the United States Census Bureau The division consists of three states New Jersey New York and Pennsylvania This definition corresponds with the regions traditional definition as the section of the Atlantic Seaboard between New England and the South However many people consider the Mid Atlantic to be the states south of the Northeast centered in Delaware Maryland

The traditional Mid Atlantic States comprise the most densely populated of the nine US regions and anchor the megalopolis which runs from Boston to Washington DC The southeastern part of New York State eastern Pennsylvania and all of New Jersey combine to form the bulk of the moral region of the Metropolis according to socio political geographers James Patterson and Peter Kim co authors of the 1991 book The Day America Told The Truth The book classifies the remainder of New York State and Pennsylvania in the Rust Belt

Landfall is when a tropical cyclone or waterspout moves from being over water to being over land When a tornadic waterspout makes landfall it can be called a tornado and can cause damage to buildings and other things made by people When a fair weather waterspout makes landfall it quickly spreads out and loses its energy the water falls as rain

A tropical cyclone is said to make landfall when its center moves over land in tropical cyclones this can be when the eye moves over land This is where most of the damage occurs because when the storm is over water there is a little chance of damage except if the parts of the storm that are raining are over land which can cause severe flooding especially when the system is moving slowly or not at all The effects of landfall are

Together with the high surf these can cause a lot of beach erosion In low lying areas the storm surge can stay inland for a long time and mix with chemicals already in the area to create a toxic mess When a tropical cyclone makes landfall the eye closes surf gets less and winds get less as the cyclone spreads out losing energy Damage inland may include flooding rains gusty winds and severe weather associated with the cyclones remnant thunderstorms

A landfall should not be confused with a direct hit which happens when the core of high winds comes over the land but the center of the storm stays over water The effects of this are similar but storm surges can be much less These effects are

The iPod touch is a media player that was created and sold by Apple Inc It was first seen by the public at an Apple meeting called The Beat Goes On on September 5 2007 The iPod touch is famous for its touch screen It has internet access with YouTube and the iTunes store It is sold with either 8 GB 16 GB 32 GB or 64 GB of storage

The iPod touch can see last 10 songs played in a Starbucks caf through Wi Fi within the location of the iPod With an iPod touch the user can download tracks in the online iTunes music store This feature is to be offered in some Starbuck stores in the US Right now there are no plans to expand its Wi Fi iTunes stores in any other than country than the United States

The iPod touchs touch screen ability is the same like that of the iPhone Like the iPhone the iPod touch also has a physical home button separate from the touch screen The home screen includes a headphone set an alarm clock and also a list of buttons corresponding to the available applications Music Videos Photos iTunes on the bottom button row Safari Calendar Contacts Clock Calculator and Settings are at the top The iPod touch is also sold with 28 wallpaper photos some of which are figures from the iPod advertisements

When the iPod Touch is taken out of the box for the first time it needs to be connected to a computer for it to start When its first turned on iTunes must be installed on either a Mac OS X or Microsoft Windows operating system computer for programming the iPod touch On either operating system the iPod touch needs a USB 20 port on the computer to connect When the ipod is first turned on it needs data communications with iTunes and will always show the cable to iTunes picture until it senses iTunes

To use the iPod touch for buying products at the iTunes Store through Wi Fi an iTunes account is needed and can be created through iTunes when whe ipod touch is being programmed

The official requirements for the iPod touch are

The iPod touch is included with Wi Fi 80211bg and like the iPhone has the Safari web browser and YouTube The iPods Wi Fi ability can also be used to buy music from the iTunes Store 

On October 17 2007 Steve Jobs gave an open letter posted on Apples webpage announced that a software development kit for the iPhone would be made ready to third party developers in February 2008 Because of security concerns and Jobs praise of Nokias digital signature system it is also suggested that Apple will adopt a similar method The SDK will also apply to the iPod touch However end users have still been able to jailbreak the iPod touch in similar methods to the iPhone allowing the usage of third party applications created by users The most popular iPod touch jailbreak method is a website which takes advantage of a TIFF exploit in the iPod touchs web browser to execute the code in order to install the hacks The site also patches the exploit as well This method only worked on the 111 firmware as 112 fixed the exploit needed for the installer to work

During the initial launch of the iPod touch reviews have noted some differences when compared to Apples similar iPhone One of the primary criticisms of the iPod touch is the absence of iPhones email mapping and stock tracking applications On January 15 2008 Steve Jobs announced at his Macworld 2008 keynote that the January Software Upgrade for the iPod touch consists of five new applications Mail Maps Stocks Notes and Weather The new Maps feature is similar to that of the iPhones with new software from Skyhook Wireless that pinpoints the users location using Wi Fi The software upgrade is available for current iPod touch owners via iTunes download for US1999 New iPod touch units with 113 installed will also have the software upgrade pre installed Customers who purchase an iPod touch with part number MA623LLA or MA627LLA must pay the upgrade fee to receive the new applications

The first reviews of the iPod touch have cited some differences compared to Apples similar iPhone One of the biggest criticisms of the iPod touch was that it did not have the iPhones email mapping and stock tracking applications Another complaint mentioned that the iPod touch had no physical buttons for volume control  a feature that the iPhone had The iPod touch instead uses software based controls which makes users to double click the home button bringing up an on screen volume control The iPod touch also did not have the iPhones external speakers built in camera and Bluetooth capability but the 2nd generation onward has external speakers and the Bluetooth capability The fourth generation released in September 2010 was the first iPod touch to feature the retina display and two built in cameras for FaceTime and for videos and still photos At least one critic has suggested that Apple may have left out these applications and hardware features on purpose in order to differentiate the iPod touch from its more expensive cousin the iPhone Others say that the touch does not need the applications mentioned above because its an iPod and not a mobile phone However the 2009 model of the iPod touch does feature Bluetooth but only to link with bluetooth headphones

A number of early iPod Touch users have complained that their iPods screen could not properly display shades of black The problem has been related to the bad reflective coating on the LCD display and bad quality control The defect caused the screen to have very narrow optimal viewing angle and also resulted in shimmering blacks This screen problem was later fixed with the firmware update 111 although some still complained that the screen still could not properly display certain shades of black Critics also say that the update simply alleviates the screen problem by adjusting contrast settings and does not provide a fix for the screen itself

Notre Dame is a very old cathedral in Paris France It is one of Frances most famous landmarks and many people visit it each year The cathedral is on a small island on the River Seine It is the cathedral of the Catholic Archdiocese of Paris one of 23 archdioceses in France The cathedral was built during two centuries It is a very good example of Gothic Architecture in France At the time it was finished the cathedral was the biggest such building in Western Europe Between 1844 and 1864 the building was renovated under the direction of Eugne Viollet le Duc who incorporated elements into the design that the medieval building had not possessed before The two rose windows which ornate the transept are among the biggest in Europe each has a diameter of 13m 

The bronze plate in the parvis before the cathedral is the origin of all road distances in France calulated from Paris The national geographic institute in France uses the building as a benchmark The coordinates and altitude for this point are known precisely

Victor Hugo wrote a famous story The story takes place around the cathedral The English title is The Hunchback of Notre Dame but in French it is called Notre Dame de Paris 

Tradition has it that Notre Dames first stone was laid in 1163 in the presence of Pope Alexander III

Erich Honecker was an East German Communist politician who led the German Democratic Republic from 1971 until 1989

After German re unification he went to the Soviet Union but was sent back by the new Russian government to Germany where he was imprisoned and tried for high treason and crimes committed during the Cold War However as he was dying of cancer he was released from prison He died in exile in Chile about a year and a half later

Honecker was born in Neunkirchen now Saarland He had two brothers and three sisters

He joined the Young Communist League of Germany the youth section of the Communist Party of Germany in 1926 and joined the KPD itself in 1929 Between 1928 and 1930 he worked as a roofer but did not finish his apprenticeship Thereafter he was sent to Moscow to study at the International Lenin School and for the rest of his life remained a full time politician

He returned to Germany in 1931 and was arrested in 1935 after the Nazis had come to power In 1937 he was sentenced to ten years for Communist activities and remained in captivity until the end of World War II At the end of the war Honecker started working for the communist party again under leader Walter Ulbricht In 1946 he became one of the first members of the new Socialist Unity Party of Germany made up of the old KPD and the Social Democrats of eastern Germany

He was a member of the parliament in the Soviet Occupied Zone after the elections of October 1946 The German Democratic Republic was created on 7 October 1949 Its constitution set up a system of government like the Soviet Unions In 1950 Honecker became a candidate member of the secretariat of the Central Committee in 1950 and full member in 1958

In 1961 Honecker was in charge of the building of the Berlin Wall In 1971 he started a political power struggle The Soviets supported him so Hoinecker became the new leader or General Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party replacing Walter Ulbricht In 1976 he also became Chairman of the Council of State

Under Honecker there was a big improvement in living standards even though the GDR had the highest standard of living in the Eastern bloc countries More consumer goods were made available and new house building was speeded up

Although Honecker was more caring to the people about goods and housing he did not allow criticism of the government The most obvious way this was showed was the Berlin Wall About 125 East German citizens were killed during this period while trying to cross the border into West Berlin

In foreign relations Honecker would never allow a unified Germany He was very loyal to the USSR but accepted dtente Under his government East Germany even became friendlier to West Germany In September 1987 he became the first East German head of state to visit West Germany

In the late 1980s Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev introduced glasnost and perestroika reforms to liberalize communism Honecker and the East German government however refused to implement similar reforms in the DDR As the reform movement spread across Central and Eastern Europe there were demonstrations against the East German government The biggest were the 1989 Monday demonstrations in the city of Leipzig The other leaders of the DDR decided to get rid of Honecker and forced him to resign on 18 October 1989 Egon Krenz took over instead

After the German reunification Honecker stayed in a Soviet military hospital near Berlin Then he fled to Moscow with his wife to avoid prosecution over charges of Cold War crimes The German government said he should be prosecuted because 192 East Germans died trying to leave East Germany After the Soviet Union broke up in December 1991 Honecker went to the Chilean embassy in Moscow but was sent back by Boris Yeltsins government in 1992 The trial started in early 1993 but Honecker was released due to ill health and on 13 January of that year moved to Chile to live with his daughter Sonja her Chilean husband Leo Yez and their son Roberto He died of liver cancer in Santiago Chile on 29 May 1994

Honecker married Edith Baumann in 1950 and divorced her in 1953 They had a daughter Erika In 1953 he married Margot Feist and they remained married until his death They had a daughter Sonja born in 1952 Margot Honecker was the Minister for National Education in East Germany

Notre Dame de Reims is a cathedral in Reims It was built in the 13th century It is not as old as Notre Dame de Paris or Notre Dame de Chartres The building process started in 1211 Most of the works were done in 1275 It was built before the Cathedrals of Strasbourg Amiens and Beauvais which are also called Notre Dame 

The cathedral is one of the best examples of Gothic architecture It has been an UNESCO world heritage site since 1991 In 2006 about 15 million people visited it

The Kings of France were crowned in this cathedral The last coronation ceremony was that of Charles X of France in 1825 

Bayeux Cathedral is a cathedral It is in Bayeux in Basse Normandie The current cathedral was consecrated on July 14 1077 It is part of a larger complex a bishops palace It was built as a replacement for an earlier church which dated from the Merovingian era It was here that Harod Godwinson signed an oath that later ledto the Norman Conquest

Coelurosauria is the clade containing all theropod dinosaurs more closely related to birds than to carnosaurs

This is a varied group that includes tyrannosaurs ornithomimosaurs compsognathids and maniraptors Maniraptora includes birds the only descendents of coelurosaurs alive today 

All Paraves discovered so far have been coelurosaurs It is probable that all coelurosaurs were feathered 

Some diagnostic characteristics of coelurosaurs include elongated arms and well developed hinge like ankles These features may be lost or modified by later coelurosaurs

An increase in the proportion of the brain occupied by the cerebrum seems to have occurred in the Coelurosauria and continued throughout the evolution of maniraptorans and early birds

A few fossil traces of the Coelurosauria date back as far as the Upper Triassic A possible but not confirmed example would be the archosaur Protoavis What has been found between then and the start of the late Jurassic is fragmentary 

Many nearly complete fossil coelurosaurians are known from the late Jurassic Archaeopteryx is known from Solnhofen limestone at 155 150 Ma Ornitholestes the troodontid WDC DML 110 Coelurus fragilis and Tanycolagreus topwilsoni are all known from the Morrison Formation in Wyoming at about 150 Ma Epidendrosaurus and Pedopenna are known from the Daohugou Beds in China whose age is still being debated but may be about 160 Ma or 145 Ma

The wide range of fossils in the late Jurassic and morphological evidence suggests that coelurosaurian differentiation was virtually complete before the end of the Jurassic

In the early Cretaceous a superb range of coelurosaurian fossils are known from the Yixian Formation in Liaoning All known theropod dinosaurs from the Yixian Formation are coelurosaurs Many of the coelurosaurian lineages survived to the end of the Cretaceous period and fossils of some lineages such as the Tyrannosauroidea are best known from the late Cretaceous Most coelurosaur groups became extinct in the KT extinction event Only the Neornithes survived and continued to diversify into the numerous forms found today

There is consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of coelurosaurs Birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup Maniraptora

Maniraptors is a clade of coelurosaurian dinosaurs starting in the Jurassic period 

Many paleontologists believe birds evolved from them some 150 or so million years ago Hence according to phylogenetic taxonomy birds are by definition maniraptors and the other maniraptors are their closest relatives It is now known from the Jehol biota that many or all of this clade had feathers They are often called dinobirds

The most primitive member of the group may be Ornitholestes and the most advanced of the non bird maniraptors is Deinonychus

This is a list of Treehouse of Horror episodes produced by the animated television series The Simpsons Treehouse of Horror episodes have aired annually since the second season and each episode has three separate segments These segments usually involve the family in some horror science fiction or supernatural setting and always take place outside the normal continuity of the show and are therefore considered to be non canon Treehouse of Horror episode aired on October 25 1990 and was inspired by EC Comics Horror tales Before Treehouse of Horror XI which aired in 2000 every episode has aired in the week preceding or on October 31 Treehouse of Horror II and Treehouse of Horror X are the only episodes to air on Halloween However due to Foxs current contract with Major League Baseballs World Series every episode since has aired in November with the exception of Treehouse of Horror XX which aired on October 18 2009 From Treehouse of Horror to Treehouse of Horror XIII all three segments were written by different writers and in some cases there was a fourth writer that wrote the opening and wraparound segments For Treehouse of Horror there were even three different directors for the episode However starting with season fifteens Treehouse of Horror XIV only one writer was credited as having written a Treehouse of Horror episode and the trend has continued since

As of 2009 there are 20 Treehouse of Horror episodes with one airing every year They are known for being more violent than an average Simpsons episode and contain several different trademarks including the alien characters Kang and Kodos who have appeared in every episode Quite often the segments will parody well known films books radio shows and television shows The Twilight Zone has been parodied quite often and has served as the inspiration for numerous segments

Georges Auguste Escoffier was a French chef restaurateur and writer who updated traditional French cooking methods and made them more popular He was important in the development of modern French cuisine

A lot of Escoffiers ideas and ways of working were based on Antoine Carmes Careme wrote about French Haute cuisine Escoffier simplified and modernised Carmes complicated recipes and style

As well as recording and inventing recipes Escoffier made cooking a respected profession

He organised his kitchens into sections run by chefs de partie He also carried on Caremes habit of service la russe instead of service la franaise Gregor Von Grg Chef to the Royal family at Buckingham Palace was quick to assume this form of service and soon all High Society was adopting Russian style service

He was born in the village of Villeneuve Loubet near Nice At thirteen he became an apprentice at his uncles restaurant Le Restaurant Franais in Nice In 1865 he moved to Le Petit Moulin Rouge restaurant in Paris He stayed there until the start of the Franco Prussian war in 1870 when he became an army chef His army experience led him to study the ways of canning food 

Some time before 1878 he opened his own restaurant Le Faisan dOr in Cannes In 1880 he married Delphine Daffis In 1884 the couple moved to Monte Carlo where Escoffier took control of the kitchen at the Grand Hotel

During the summers he ran the kitchen of the Hotel National in Lucerne where he met Csar Ritz At that time the French Riviera was a winter resort 

The two men formed a partnership and in 1890 moved to the Savoy Hotel in London From the Savoy they started a number of famous hotels including the Grand Hotel in Rome and many Ritz Hotels around the world

At the London Savoy Escoffier created many famous dishes For example in 1893 he invented the Pche Melba in honour of the Australian singer Dame Nellie Melba Another of his creations was Tournedos Rossini in honour of the Italian composer Gioacchino Rossini He left the Savoy Hotel after taking money from food suppliers

In 1898 Escoffier and Ritz opened the Htel Ritz in Paris The Carlton in London followed in 1899 where Escoffier first introduced the practice of the la carte menu Ritz had a nervous breakdown in 1901 leaving Escoffier to run the Carlton until 1919 shortly after Ritzs death For a time one of his pupils was Ho Chi Minh who was training as a pastry chef

In 1903 Escoffier published his first major book Le Guide Culinaire This Guide to Cooking had 5000 recipes Even today it is used as both a cookbook and textbook for classic cooking 

In 1904 and 1912 Escoffier was hired to plan the kitchens for ships belonging to the steam ship company Hamburg Amerika Lines On the second voyage Kaiser William II congratulated Escoffier telling him I am the Emperor of Germany but you are the Emperor of chefs

In the 1920s Escoffier became the first chef to receive the Legion of Honour and in 1928 was made an Officer of the Legion

He died at the age of 88 in Monte Carlo a few days after his wife

Pikaia gracilens is regarded as the earliest known primitive chordate from the Middle Cambrian fossil found near Mount Pika in the Burgess Shale of British Columbia It was discovered by Charles Walcott in 1911 Walcott classified it as a Polychaete worm It was about 40 mm in length and swam above the sea floor Pikaia may have filtered particles from the water as it swam along Only 60 specimens have been found to date 

Opabinia is a fossil animal found in Cambrian fossil deposits Its sole species Opabinia regalis is known from the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale of British Columbia The discoverer of Opabinia Charles Doolittle Walcott named it after a local mountain Opabin Peak in the Canadian Rockies Thirty specimens of Opabinia are known and each ranges in size from 40 to 70 mm The most intriguing feature of Opabinia are its five eyes found on the dorsal surface of the head These eyes were used to search for food Because of its flexible body it is not known whether Opabinia was pelagic or benthic

Wiwaxia corrugata is an extinct species of animal known only from fossils found in Canadas Burgess Shale deposits 

Wiwaxia somewhat resembles a very small porcupine with its quills pulled out The body is covered by both spines and scales The spines are believed to have been used for defence purposes Wiwaxia probably grazed or scavenged by walking or crawling along the sediment One hundred and forty specimens are known from the Burgess Shale Similar scales and spines have turned up in similarly aged sediments from elsewhere around the world suggesting that Wiwaxia was widespread during the Cambrian

The Cambrian is the first geological period of the Paleozoic era lasting from 542 or 545 million years ago to 488 million years ago It is preceded by the Neoproterozoic and succeeded by the Ordovician Its subdivisions and indeed its base are somewhat in flux The Cambrian is unique in its many sites of exceptional preservation where soft parts of organisms are preserved as well as their more resistant shells This means our understanding of the Cambrian biota surpasses that of many later periods

The Cambrian period marked a profound change in life on Earth Before the Cambrian life was on the whole small and simple Complex organisms became gradually more common in the Proterozoic but it was not until the Cambrian that mineralised hence readily fossilised organisms became common This diversification of lifeforms was relatively rapid and is termed the Cambrian explosion This adaptive radiation produced the first members of most modern phyla 

While life prospered in the oceans the land was barren with nothing more than a microbial crud gracing the soils Apart from tentative evidence suggesting that some animals floundered around on land most of the continents resembled deserts spanning from horizon to horizon Shallow seas flanked the margins of several continents which had resulted from the breakup of the preceding supercontinent Pannotia The seas were relatively warm and polar ice was absent Animals with hard shells appeared in great numbers for the first time during the early Cambrian

 The substrate revolution 

The Cambrian marked a steep change in the diversity and composition of Earths biosphere The incumbent Ediacaran biota suffered a mass extinction at the base of the period which corresponds to an increase in the abundance and complexity of burrowing behaviour This behaviour had a profound and irreversible effect on the substrate and occurred around the same time as the Cambrian explosion saw the seemingly rapid appearance of representatives of all but one of the modern phyla There are even suggestions that some Cambrian organisms ventured onto land producing the trace fossils Protichnites and Climactichnites

The fossil record of the Cambrian is extraordinary with a number of sites showing preservation of soft parts such as the Burgess Shale formations in Ontario Canada In order of appearance these are some of the Cambrian novelties

There are at several sites many good fossils of soft bodied animals which cannot be assigned with certainty to a phylum

A conjecture is an idea in mathematics that appears likely to be true but that has not been proven to be true

After a conjecture is proven true it becomes a theorem

Until recently the most famous conjecture was the badly named Fermats last theorem The name is wrong because Fermat claimed to have found a clever proof of it but no proof could be found among his notes after his death The conjecture challenged mathematicians for over three centuries before a British mathematician Andrew Wiles could finally prove it in 1993 Now it is properly called a theorem

Other famous conjectures include

Not every conjecture can be proven true or false The continuum hypothesis which says something about some properties of certain infinite sets is such an example It was shown to be undecidable from the generally accepted set of axioms of set theory It is therefore possible to take this statement or its negation as a new axiom in a consistent manner

In this case if a proof uses this statement researchers will often look for a new proof that does not require the hypothesis The one major exception to this in practice is the axiom of choice  unless studying this axiom in particular the majority of researchers do not usually worry whether a result requires the axiom of choice

The Boeing 787 is an aircraft made by Boeing Its first flight took place on 15 December 2009 According to current plans 787 should start being used by airlines in the year 2010 These dates have been changed lots of times and now some airlines will get their aircraft nearly 30 months late 

Boeing are making 3 variants of the Dreamliner the 787 3 787 8 and the 787 9 

The 3 will be the smallest and have the shortest range at about 5000 km will fly about 290 people and will be the last to be made It will replace the Boeing 747 400D that was used by two Japanese airlines

The 9 will be largest and have the biggest range at about 15250 km It will be able to fly about 270 people and will be made in 2012 It will compete against Airbus and their A330 300 aircraft and their A330 200 It will replace the Boeing 767 400ER

The 8 model will be in the middle flying 210 people about 14750 km and will be the first type to be made in 2009 The 8 will replace the Boeing 767 200ER and Boeing 767 300ER aircraft

Buddha Akshobhya is one of the five Dhyani buddhas

Akshobya represents Dharma that changes hatred and dislike into wisdom He is shown touching the earth with his right hand and holding an upright thunderbolt in his left hand Akshobyas blessings enables us to develop wisdom and understand the true nature of reality

In the Buddhist religion Jambhala is the wealth giving form of Avalokitevara or Chenrezig the bodhisattva of compassion 

Jambhalas blessings are to help others by eliminating poverty so that they may practice the Dharma There are five Jambhalas  Yellow Jambhala White Jambhala Black Jambala Green Jambhala and Red Jambhala For instance the White Jambhala is shown sitting on a turquoise dragon and his left hand holds a mongoose that spews out precious jewels

Bodhi or Enlightenment refers to full awakening where all limitations have been removed from the mind All positive potential including unlimited compassion skill and wisdom are said to be realized The enlightened being is free from samsara

Granados started having piano lessons in Barcelona and then went to Paris where he studied privately with Charles de Briot He returned to Barcelona in 1889 and the following year gave his first piano recital  He wrote a zarzuela called Maria del Carmen The king liked it very much and gave him an award

During the following years he composed a lot and performed with famous musicians such as Jacques Thibaud Pau Casals and Camille Saint Sans His piano suite Goyescas was first performed in Barcelona in 1911 and then in Paris in 1914 where it soon became extremely popular

He was persuaded to make Goyescas into an opera The opera was going to be performed at the Paris Opra but because of World War I it was performed in New York instead Granados was invited to go to New York to watch the first performance of his opera He was very frightened of the sea but eventually was persuaded to go The opera was a great success when it was performed on 26 January 1916 Granados felt that he was at the beginning of a successful career President Wilson invited him to play the piano at the White House Because of this invitation he missed the ship that would have taken him back to Spain He took a ship to England instead In Liverpool he got off the ship and got onto another one which would take him to Dieppe in France The ship was called the Sussex When the Sussex was in the middle of the English Channel it was torpedoed by a German submarine Granados managed to get onto a lifeboat but then he saw his wife in the sea and he jumped in to try to save her but they both drowned

Granados wrote mainly piano works and songs He was influenced by Romantic composers such as Grieg Schumann and Liszt but he was starting to make his music sound very Spanish His songs include some of the best written by a Spanish composer His piano works include Ten Spanish Dances which are not too difficult to play and the suite Goyescas which is mostly quite difficult to play The most popular piece in this suite is called Lament or The Maiden and the Nightingale It has a very romantic tune which is repeated several times

Manuel de Falla born Cdiz Spain 23 November 1876 died Alta Gracia Argentina 14 November 1946 was a Spanish composer Falla together with Albniz and Granados helped to make Spanish music important again after three centuries during which there had been no important Spanish composers

Falla had his first music lessons in Cdiz At first he did not know whether he wanted to take music or literature as a career When he was ten he started to go to music evenings where he heard chamber music being played Then he started to go to the opera and he heard church music and orchestral music He liked the music of Grieg and decided that he wanted to do something similar with Spanish music He went to Madrid where he studied very hard and won prizes His first compositions were played in Cdiz He studied with Pedrell who had also taught Albniz and Granados

He wrote a song called Tus ojillos negros which became very popular and he won a prize for a piano composition but it was his opera La vida breve which really showed his genius although it was not performed at the time No one in Spain wanted to perform his zarzuelas so he went to Paris in 1907 He soon made friends with Dukas Debussy and Ravel He made changes to La vida breve and it was performed in Paris in 1913 His piano works and songs were also performed in Paris and in Madrid

In 1915 he wrote El amor brujo It was a work with dances songs and spoken passages He soon turned it into a ballet The music uses the songs of Andalusia and the rhythms of Spanish folkmusic He wrote a work for solo piano and orchestra called Noches en los jardines de Espaa Later he changed it to a ballet for Diaghilev calling it El sombrero It was performed in London in 1919 with designs by Picasso The music is very lively and often sounds like a guitar He wrote a piano piece called Fantasia btica which is the most important Spanish piano work after Albnizs Iberia

Falla had many friends including Lorca They liked small theatre pieces and Falla wrote El retablo and set it as a puppet opera He liked the music of the past centuries and wrote a concerto for harpsichord and five other instruments

During his final years Falla was composing a very large work called Atlntida It was a long oratorio for soloists chorus and orchestra The words were in Catalan Falla did not live long enough to finish the work He became very depressed because of World War II In the end he was invited to Argentina where he settled He continued to work at Atlntida but he had not finished it when he died A man called Ernesto Halffter spent many years trying to finish it and prepare it for a performance It was performed on stage at La Scala Milan in 1962 but it does not work well as an opera Occasionally it is performed as a concert piece

Joaqun Turina was a Spanish composer

Turina was brought up in Seville and the music of this town always had a big influence on his music His father was a painter As a small boy Turinas favourite toy was a small toy accordion He started to study medicine but he wanted to be a musician so his father let him study music instead He had piano lessons with Enrique Rodriguez and studied harmony with Garcia Torres who was in charge of music at the cathedral in Seville

Soon Turina started to compose He met Falla and the two musicians became lifelong friends He moved to Paris in 1905 where he studied with Moskowski and dIndy One of the his first works to be performed was piano quintet The style was similar to Csar Franck Albniz heard it and advised the young composer to make his music sound Spanish

Turinas music started to be performed widely In 1914 both Turina and Falla returned to live in Spain They were two of the most important Spanish composers He was choirmaster at the Teatro Real and he had an opera Jardin de oriente performed there He became director of the Madrid Conservatory and received many honours He died after a long illness

Turinas music always sounds very Spanish although he used the forms of main European composers He wrote many short piano pieces which often describe a person He wrote songs and guitar music

Edouard Lalo was a French composer 

His life 

His family originally came from Spain Edouard learned to play the piano and violin at the Lille Conservatory but his parents did not want him to take music as a profession So he left home when he was 16 and went to Paris He took some lessons and earned money by teaching and playing the violin He liked chamber music Not many people in France were interested in chamber music at that time With three friends he formed a string quartet and they helped to make the string quartets of Haydn Mozart and Beethoven better known in France He played the viola in his quartet and later he played second violin In 1859 he composed a string quartet

It was not until the 1870s when he was already in his 50s that he started to become really well known Some famous conductors such as Pasdeloup Lamoureux and Colonne and the violinist Sarasate took an interest in his orchestral works and performed them He wrote a violin concerto and a work called Symphonie espagnole which was also for solo violin and orchestra Sarasate played both these works He wrote a cello concerto in 1877

He wrote an opera Le roi dYs but no opera house wanted to perform it They asked him to write a ballet instead He did not know anything about ballet but he composed one called Namouna It had some good music although people who did not like him said it sounded like Wagner or like the music of someone who is used to writing symphonies

In 1888 his opera Le roi dYs was performed at last It was an enormous success but Lalo only had four more years to live and he did not compose anything more of importance He had married one of his pupils in 1865 and they had a son

In France Lalo is mainly remembered for his opera Le roi dYs but in other countries his best known work is his Symphonie espagnole It is not really a symphony it is a violin concerto It has five movements and there are lots of lively Spanish rhythms His cello concerto is also an excellent work

To the southeast the land is mostly sandy There are small rivers and brooks cutting through it Examples for such rivers are Regge and Dinkel In the northwest the geology is mostly made of sediments from the Overijsselse Vecht and clay The northern parts were once covered by veen which separated the dryer and more arable south from Drenthe These bogs have been exploited as fuel to a large degree Only small patches survive today Engbertsdijksvenen near Tubbergen Witteveen and the Aamsveen The extreme northwest is dominated by a system of lakes formed by former peat mining the Weerribben which is a valuable wetland

The highest point in Overijssel is the summit of the Tankenberg a hill in the municipality of Losser It is 89 metres The lowest point is in the Mastenbroek Polder near Kampen at 2 metres below sea level

Overijssel was formerly known as Oversticht In 1336 it was made part of Guelders It was given to the Bishopric of Utrecht in 1347 Utrecht was known as het Sticht The Bishops gave the Oversticht to the Emperor Charles V in 1528 who styled himself Lord of Overijssel With this he gave the province its modern name The people joined with the other Dutch and rebelled against Charles heir Philip II Overijssel became governed by the most powerful mayors and lords in the province

Goldbachs conjecture is one of the oldest unsolved problems in number theory and in all of mathematics It states

On 7 June 1742 the Prussian mathematician Christian Goldbach wrote a letter to Leonhard Euler in which he proposed the following conjecture

He considered 1 to be a prime number a convention subsequently abandoned A modern version of Goldbachs original conjecture is

Euler becoming interested in the problem answered by noting that this conjecture would follow from a stronger version

adding that he regarded this a fully certain theorem in spite of his being unable to prove it

A compass is a drawing tool that can be used for making circles or arcs They can also be used as a tool to measure distances in particular on maps Compasses can be used for mathematics drafting navigation and other purposes

Compasses are usually made of metal and consist of two parts called legs connected by a hinge which can be adjusted Typically one part has a spike at its end and the other part a pencil or sometimes a pen 

Circles can be made by fastening one leg of the compasses into the paper with the spike putting the pencil on the paper and moving the pencil around while keeping the hinge on the same angle The radius of the circle can be adjusted by changing the angle of the hinge

Distances can be measured on a map using compasses with two spikes The hinge is set in such a way that the distance between the spikes on the map represents a certain distance in reality and by measuring how many times the compasses fit between two points on the map the distance between those points can be calculated

Compass and straightedge construction is used to illustrate principles of plane geometry Although a real pair of compasses is used to draft visible illustrations the ideal compass used in proofs is an abstract creator of perfect circles The most rigorous definition of this abstract tool is the collapsing compass having drawn a circle from a given point with a given radius it disappears it cannot simply be moved to another point and used to draw another circle of equal radius

Phonetics is the science of the sounds of human speech Somone who is an expert in phonetics is called a phonetician

Phonetic theory regards the nature of sounds in speech and how they are made heard and thought of Phonology which came from it studies sound systems and sound units Phonetics is one of the two parts of orthographical linguistics the other part being spelling differing from grammar and lexis

Phonetics has three main branches

There are more than 100 different phones recognized by the International Phonetic Association and are shown in their writing system called the International Phonetic Alphabet

The first time phonetics was studied was 2500 years ago in what is now India with Pini when he wrote about the place and manner of articulation of consonants in Sanskrit in his 5th century BC essay on Sanskrit linguistics The major Indic scripts today order their consonants the way Pini did

Laws of Form is a book by George Spencer Brown published in 1969 It is about logic mathematics and philosophy The mathematical systems that Spencer Brown presented in the book are known by the names calculus of indications distinction calculus and often just LOF

Laws of Form grew out of the authors work in electronic engineering The book has been published in several editions and translations and has never gone out of print A short book its mathematical part is only 55 pages long

Spencer Browns philosophy was influenced by Ludwig Wittgenstein RD Laing Charles Sanders Peirce Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead

Laws of Form was listed in the Whole Earth Catalog in 1969 and quickly became a cult classic The calculus of indications and the primary algebra may be regarded as a way to think about a fundamental activity of the mind namely the ability to distinguish or to draw distinctions The book argues that this ability is the foundation of human cognition and consciousness According to Spencer Brown the primary arithemetic and primary algebra reveal new connections among logic mathematics the philosophy of language and the philosophy of mind

Let 0 and 1 be the two basic primitive values of Boolean algebra Let AB denote a binary operation of Boolean algebra Let stand for the Boolean complement of X Then the calculus of indications is simply Boolean arithmetic reduced to the two equations 111 and0 These are the only axioms in LoF

The primary algebra is mainly a simpler notation for Boolean algebra except for one thing In Boolean algebra is not defined is empty complementation On the other hand in the primary algebra is defined and stands for one of 0 or 1 stands for the other primitive value and is the same thing as the blank page

Let A and B be any two expressions of the primary algebra The primary algebra is made up of equations of the form AB and these equations are treated in the same way as the equations of the number algebra taught in all schools Standard methods of logic seldom use equations LoF argues that doing elementary logic with the primary algebra is easier In particular if A is a tautology in logic then one of A or A holds in the primary algebra

Laws of Form proves the following fact about the primary algebra

Hence the primary algebra is a well behaved piece of mathematics It can be useful even if the philosophy and cognitive science of LoF are wrong or uninteresting

The Marx Brothers were a popular team of sibling comedians who appeared in vaudeville stage plays movie and television 

The brothers were Chico Harpo Groucho Gummo and Zeppo

Born in New York City the Marx Brothers were the sons of Jewish immigrants from Germany Their mother Minnie Schnberg was from Dornum in East Frisia and their father Simon Marrix was a native of Alsace now part of France and worked as a tailor The family lived in the then poor Yorkville section of New York Citys Upper East Side between the Irish German and Italian Quarters

The Marx Brothers began as a musical group during the days of vaudeville theater They would make jokes play funny characters and pretend to get into fights when they performed In time their broken wikt linkanticantics got them more applause than their music and they became a comedy group Music stayed in their act with the brothers performing in character but their focus was on getting laughs Makeup and costumes gave their characters their look When the brothers were out of costume they could blend into the audience

Gummo did not appear in any of the movies In the movies each brother played a role that was mostly the same in every movie Groucho was a wise guy who big bushy eyebrows glasses and a moustache who smoked a cigar Chico spoke with an Italian accent and played the piano Harpo never spoke and played the harp Zeppo usually played the straight man He left the group in 1933 and they worked with other actors Margaret Dumont played the leading lady role in many of their shows She did not appear to know when a joke was made about her and this made her role funnier

The fortunes of the brothers rose and fell over the years Groucho lost a lot of money in 1929 when the stock market collapsed Chico had a problem with gambling and lost more money than he won at it Harpo and his wife could not have children of their own so they adopted enough to have a large family

Groucho kept working after his brothers retired He hosted a television quiz show called You Bet Your Life which was more liked for Grouchos way of hosting than for the game itself He made a few movie and television appearances late in his life He also appeared at Carnegie Hall telling stories about his life and career and singing songs from every part of his career A recording of his Carnegie Hall show became a broken wikt linkbest sellerbest seller

Huntsville is named after John Hunt He was the first settler of the land around the Big Spring Park However Hunt did not correctly register his claim The area was purchased by Leroy Pope who imposed the name Twickenham on the area to honour the home village of his kinsman Alexander Pope

Twickenham was carefully planned The streets were built from the northeast to southwest direction based on the Big Spring However due to anti English feeling during the War of 1812 the town name was changed to Huntsville to honour John Hunt who had been forced to move to other land south of the new city

Both John Hunt and Leroy Pope were Freemasons and charter members of Helion Lodge

In 1811 Huntsville became the first official town in Alabama However the recognized birth year of the city is 1805 This was the year of John Hunts arrival The citys sesquicentennial anniversary was held in 1955 and the bicentennial was celebrated in 2005

Huntsvilles quick growth was generated by the cotton and railroad industries Many rich planters moved to the area from Virginia Georgia and the Carolinas The forty four delegates who met in Huntsville wrote a constitution for the new state of Alabama The new state constitution said that Huntsville is Alabamas first capital This was temporary for one legislative session only The capital was then moved to another temporary location Cahawba until the legislature selected Montgomery as the permanent location

In 1855 the Memphis and Charleston Railroad was built through Huntsville It became the first railway to link the Atlantic coast with the lower Mississippi River

Huntsville firstly opposed secession from the Union in 1861 but provided many men for the states defense The 4th Alabama Infantry Regiment led by Col Egbert J Jones of Huntsville fought at the Battle of Manassas It was the first major battle of the American Civil War The Fourth Alabama Infantry which contained two Huntsville companies were the first Alabama troops to fight in the war Eight generals of the war were born in or near Huntsville

After the Civil War Huntsville became a center for cotton textile mills such as Lincoln Dallas and Merrimack Each mill had its own housing community It included everything the mill workers needed

During the 1930s industry decreased in Huntsville because of the Great Depression Huntsville became known as the Watercress Capital of the World because of its harvest in the area Madison County produced most cotton in Alabama during this time

By 1940 Huntsville was still a small quiet town with a population of only 13150 inhabitants This quickly changed with the beginning of World War II Huntsville was chosen as the location of Huntsville Arsenal with chemical and munitions manufacturing plants The Arsenal was almost closed in 1949 when it was no longer needed but it saw new life when Major General Holger Toftoy with support from Senator John Sparkman convinced the US Army to choose Huntsville as the location for its missile research program In 1950 General Toftoy brought German rocket scientist Wernher von Braun and his team to Redstone Arsenal to develop what would eventually become the United States space program

On September 8 1960 US President Dwight D Eisenhower formally dedicated the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville

The citys nickname is The Rocket City for its close history with US space missions Huntsville has been important in developing space technology Since the 1950s when the German scientists headed by Wernher von Braun brought to the United States at the end of World War II through Operation Paperclip managed to develop rockets for the US Army Their work included designing a rocket that carried the first US satellite and astronauts into space

The Saturn V used by the Apollo program manned Moon missions was developed at Marshall Space Flight Center Huntsville continues to play an important role in the United States Space Shuttle and International Space Station programs

Huntsvilles economy was nearly crippled and growth came to a near standstill in the 1970s following the closure of the Apollo program The emergence of the Space Shuttle and the ever expanding field of missile defense in the 1980s helped give Huntsville a resurgence that has continued into the 21st century

Ratification is the confirmation of a treaty

Treaties are signed by members of the government of a country Many treaties make a country do something or change the law of the countries which agree to it Therefore some countries can only ratify a treaty if it is confirmed by the legislature of the country or by a referendum

In the past treaties were signed by delegates chosen by the ruler of a country To make sure that the treaty was acceptable to the ruler the treaty would not take effect until it was ratified by the ruler

The United States is only bound by a treaty if the Senate agrees So although President Woodrow Wilson signed the Treaty of Versailles which ended the First World War with Germany and set up the League of Nations the treaty never took effect for the USA because the US Senate never gave its advice and consent to the treaty This is why there was a separate peace treaty between Germany and the USA

In the United Kingdom the government ratifies treaties it does not need the agreement of the House of Commons However if the treaty is going to change the law then a separate act of parliament is needed For example before Britain entered the European Union in 1973 the European Communities Act had to be passed to make the changes to the law that were needed

In 1645 during the English Civil War he published Poems of Mr John Milton in which there were his famous poems LAllegro and IlPenseroso which was mostly ignored Om 1649 during the trial of Charles I Milton wrote Of the Tenure of Kings and Magistrates arguing that kings can rule only when the people allow them to He then became secretary to the Council of State and wrote in Latin Eikonoklastes in 1649 That was last big writing project he did before he began to become blind In 1652 he became completely blind and was very unhappy However in 1667 he published the famous Paradise Lost one of the greatest English language epics Four years later he wrote Paradise Regained a story about how men became sinful and how Jesus Christ won the battle with the devil The last work that was published while he was alive was Samson Agonistes He died probably because of gout on November eighth 1674

A wedge is a portable inclined plane used either to separate two objects or portions of objects lift an object or hold an object in place by the application of force to the wide end which the wedge converts to force perpendicular to the inclined surfaces The mechanical advantage of a wedge depends on the ratio of its length to its thickness Where a short wedge with a wide angle does the job faster it requires more force than a long wedge with a smaller angle

The origin of the wedge is unknown because it has been in use as early as the Stone Age Circa 3000 BC in Ancient Egypt quarrys bronze wedges were used to break away blocks of rock used for construction Wood wedges that swelled after being wet were also used Some Native American tribes used antler wedges as a means of splitting and working wood to make canoes houses and other wood objects

Examples include axes splitting mauls and splitting wedges Wedges can also be used to lift heavy objects or finely adjust the height of objects essentially separating them from the surface they rest on These may also be referred to as shims Knives scissors chisels and even teeth can sometimes be used as wedges however they are more fundamentally cutting implements

Wedges can also be used to hold objects in place such as engine parts bicycle parts and doors

A door stop is a wedge and its main function is to generate friction between the bottom of the door and the ground

A fork or nails can also be considered a type of wedge While a nail will slice into wood when hammered a bolt will not be pushed in This is because a nail is a wedge and a bolt is not A nail is tapered to a point at its end then gets thicker farther up towards the head of the nail

The more acute the angle of the wedge the more mechanical advantage it will have

Despite this one reason that many splitting wedges have a wide angle is that an elastic material such as wood will bind a narrow wedge more readily than a wide wedge This is why splitting mauls have a much larger angle than an axe

The Bundesregierung sometimes called the Bundeskabinett or Federal Cabinet is the government of the Federal Republic of Germany and it consists of the Chancellor and the Federal Ministers

The job of the cabinet is listed in the articles 62 to 69 of the constitution This also has the oath of office that the minister must take

The Chancellor is responsible for the administrative work of the Federal Government but the work is delegated to the Head of the Federal Chancellery

The Chancellor sets the general policy of the Federal Government and what each ministry should do The Federal Ministers are responsible for what happens in their own departments and for making sure that the ministry keeps to the general ideas of the Chancellor This is known as the departmental principle

If two Federal Ministers disagree about what should be done or about who is to do it or how it is to be done the Federal Government decides with a majority decision The is called the cooperative principle

The Federal Minister Law says that a retired member of the Federal Government can have a retirement pension if they have been a minister for at least two years Time as a junior minister who in Germany are called parliamentary permanent secretaries is counted and so is previous membership in a Land government

Parliamentary permanent secretaries and state ministers are not members of the Federal Government but do help them in their job

As a rule the Federal Cabinet meets in the Federal Chancellery every Wednesday at 930 am

Only members of the CDUCSU and FDP are in the current Federal Government Eleven of the 16 members of the Federal Government are members of the Bundestag

 22 of the Standing Orders of the Federal Government controls the seniority in meetings of the Federal Government If the Chancellor is absent the Deputy Chancellor is the chairman of the Federal Government If the deputy is also absent the longest serving or the oldest minister chairs the meeting

These rules mean that the order of seniority is in this table

This table lists the number and percentage of members of the federal government who were lawyers In Germany the time between elections is called a legislative period In the United Kingdom this would be called a Parliament or in the United States a Congress

Manuel Jos Quintana y Lorenzo poet was born at Madrid Spain

In 1801 Quintana wrote a tragedy El Duque de Viseo written about a patriotic theme which was successful

The first book of his Vidas de Espaoles clebres about the lives of Spanish heroes helped to promote Quintana the post of secretary to the Cortes during the French invasion But on the return of Ferdinand VII he was put in prison at Pamplona from 1814 to 1820 He was finally given a small post in the civil service became tutor to Queen Isabella II and was nominated senator

Quintana died at the age of 84 Philanthropy and patriotism helped him write The thought he put into his poems is not deep but his faith to Spain attracted people to read them

Fortran is a programming language first created in the 1950s It is still in use today It is a procedural language mainly used for scientific computing and numerical analysis

The first FORTRAN compiler was created in 1954 57 by a team at IBM led by John W Backus This compiler was the first compiler for any High level language The authors were worried that no one would use the language if programs written in it did not run nearly as fast as programs written in assembly language So they made it an optimizing compiler

Because of the heavy use by scientists doing numerical work the language grew in ways that encouraged compiler writers to produce compilers that generated high quality code There are many high performance compiler vendors Much work and research in compiler theory and design was caused by the need to generate good code for Fortran programs

Several revisions of the language have appeared including the very well known FORTRAN IV FORTRAN 77 and Fortran 90 The most recent formal standard for the language was published in 1997 and is known as Fortran 95

Initially the language relied on precise formatting of the source code and heavy use of statement numbers and goto statements

Every version introduced modern programming concepts such as source code comments and output of text IF THEN ELSE recursion and parallel constructs while trying to maintain Fortrans lean profile and high performance

The name Fortran is short for Formula Translation The language was formerly known as FORTRAN Since Fortran 90 the capitalization has been abandoned The published formal standards use Fortran

The two standards below reflect the current Fortran implementations 

William Butler Yeats was an Irish poet dramatist and mystic He was born in Dublin on 13 June 1865 He spent most of his time in Sligo and some time in London

Yeats early poetry drew heavily on myth and legend His later work had more to do with contemporary issues One of his famous poems is called Leda and the Swan

With Lady Gregory and others he was one of the people who founded the Irish Literary Theatre and the Abbey Theatre

He was also interested in Hermeticism and Theosophy He was a member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn

90 Antiope is an asteroid found on October 1 1866 by Robert Luther The 90th asteroid to be found it is named after Antiope from Greek mythology though it is disputed as to whether the namesake is Antiope the Amazon or Antiope the mother of Amphion and Zethus

Antiope orbits in the farther third of the core region of the main belt and is a member of the Themis family of asteroids Like most bodies in this region it is of the dark C spectral type indicating that it is made of carbonaceous chondrite

One seen stellar occultation by Antiope has been reported on June 11 1980

The most remarkable feature of Antiope is that it has two asteroids of almost equal size making it a truly double asteroid Its binary nature was found on 10 August 2000 by a group of astronomers using adaptive optics at the Keck Telescope on Mauna Kea The secondary is designated S2000 1

Each asteroid is about 861 km across with their centers separated by only about 170 kilometers This means that the space separating the two halves is only 60 km or so The two bodies orbit around the same center of mass which lies in the space between them The orbital period is about 1650 hours the eccentricity below 003 Every several years a period of mutual occultations occurs when the asteroid is viewed from Earth Using Keplers third law the mass and density of the asteroids can be derived from the orbital period and asteroid sizes

The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn was a magical order founded in London in 1888 by Dr William Wynn Westcott and Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers It ceased to exist under that name in 1903 However two spin off groups were created at that time the Stella Matutina and the Alpha et Omega

While it was popular many well known people joined the Golden Dawn Some of its members included

A plan is an orthographic projection of a 3 dimensional object from the position of a horizontal plane through the object In other words a plan is a section viewed from the top In such views the portion of the object in above the plane is omitted to reveal what lies beyond In the case of a floor plan the roof and upper part of the walls may be left out

A floor plan in architecture and building engineering is a diagram usually to scale of the relationships between rooms spaces and other physical features at one level of a structure

Similar to a map the orientation of the view is downward from above

107 Camilla is one of the biggest main belt asteroids It orbits within the Cybele Group beyond most of the main belt asteroids It has a very dark surface and is made of carbonate It was found by N R Pogson on November 17 1868 and named after Camilla Queen of the Volsci in Roman mythology

Study of its light curve shows that Camillas pole probably points towards ecliptic coordinates with a 10 uncertainty which gives it an axial tilt of 29

On March 1 2001 a moon of Camilla was found by A Storrs F Vilas R Landis E Wells C Woods B Zellner and M Gaffey using the Hubble Space Telescope It has been labelled S2001 1 but it does not yet have an official name

Later sightings in September 2005 with the VLT allowed scientists to work out its orbit Apart from data in infobox the inclination was found to be 3 1 with respect to an axis pointing towards Given the 10 uncertainty in the actual rotational axis of Camilla the orbits inclination probably is less than 10

Scrabble is a game that is played by 2 3 or 4 people It uses a board with squares on it and a large number of letters on small tiles Each player when it is his turn has to put a word on the board using any of the seven letters that they have in front of them Their word must join on to what is already on the board

The players decide who is going to start by taking one letter from the bag The person with the letter closest to the beginning of the alphabet may start

Each player takes seven tiles from the bag The player puts these tiles on a rack in front of him so that he can see them but the others cannot see which letters he has After each turn a player can take some new letters out of the bag so that he has seven letters again for his next turn 

The first player puts a word on the board using some or all of his seven letters as possible He must include the square in the middle It is then the next players turn His word must join on somewhere to what the other player has already put Sometimes it is possible to make two or more words in one turn by touching other letters but each word on the board reading horizontally or vertically must be a proper word but abbreviations are allowed 

Each tile has a number of points The common letters such as A B T etc are worth one point Unusual letters such as Q and Z are worth 10 points There are also two blank tiles which can be used for any letter A player must say what the letter is when he puts it down eg he might say that C A Blank spells CAT During the rest of the game that blank tile must be treated as a letter T

There are several squares on the board where a player can get extra points Some squares allow the player to count that letter twice or three times other squares allow him to count the whole word twice or three times

The aim of the game is to get as many points as possible A long word will not always get as many points as a shorter word It depends which letters are used It is also a good idea not put a word which will let the next player make a high score

There are special Scrabble dictionaries available in which all allowable words are listed When playing according to the proper rules one is not allowed to use a dictionary to find a word However if one of players challenges another then the players may check it in the dictionary If the word does not exist the player must take his letters back and he loses his turn

After a while there are no more letters in the bag The game finishes when one player has no more letters The other players have to count the points for the letters they still have in front of them and take them away from their total score

Scrabble is available in many languages Even if a language uses the same letters as English some of the common English letters may be unusual in another language and common letters there may be unusual in English There are versions in languages with other alphabets such as Russian

Scrabble was invented in 1938 by an architect named Alfred Mosher Butts He had previously invented a similar game called Lexiko He worked out how many points should be given for each letter by looking at books and newspapers and counting how often particular letters are used in the English language He called the game Criss Crosswords However he was not successful in selling the game In 1948 a lawyer called James Brunot bought the rights to make to game Brunot made some of the rules easier and changed the name to Scrabble which is a real word meaning to scratch around frantically Soon other firms around the world were buying rights to make the game It had become so popular by 1984 that it was made into a daytime TV show on NBC television

The name Scrabble today is a trademark of Hasbro Inc in the US and Canada and of J W Spear Sons PLC in other countries

All over the world people play Scrabble in clubs and tournaments People who play in serious tournaments are given a time limit They lose points if they spend too long thinking about their moves

There are websites where one can play Scrabble online

On Facebook there is a version of Scrabble called Scrabulous

There were two sets of Nuremberg Trials

The first and most well known were the trials of the leaders of Nazi Germany This was organized by the International Military Tribunal The judges and prosecutors were from the four wartime Allies France the USSR the United Kingdom and the United States

The second set of trials were the 12 follow up trials These trials were of groups of lower ranking Nazis like doctors and officials of the German Foreign Office Although the follow up trials were held in the same courtroom as the IMT trials they were run by the Americans alone mainNuremburg Follow up Trials

The original plan was for the IMT to hold several trials and the Allies to hold their own trials of local officials as well Cooperation between the Soviet Union and the Western Allies quickly broke down The IMT only held the one big trial So the US held trials of the next most important Nazis themselves

The International Military Tribunal was opened on October 18 1945 in the Supreme Court Building in Berlin The first session was presided over by the Soviet judge Nikitchenko The prosecution brought charges against 24 major war criminals and six criminal organizations the leadership of the Nazi Party the Schutzstaffel and Sicherheitsdienst the Gestapo the Sturmabteilung and the High Command of the German armed forces

The indictments were for

The 24 accused were

I indicted   G indicted and found guilty   O Not Charged

  

I indicted   G indicted and found guilty   O Not Charged

The death sentences were carried out on 16 October 1946 by hanging using the inefficient American standard drop method instead of the long drop The executioner was John C Woods The French judges suggested the use of a firing squad for the military condemned as is standard for military courts martial but this was opposed by Biddle and the Soviet judges They said that the military officers acted so badly they did not deserve to be treated as soldiers The prisoners sentenced to jail were transferred to Spandau Prison in 1947

The definition of what constitutes a war crime is described by the Nuremberg Principles a document which was created as a result of the trial The medical experiments conducted by German doctors and prosecuted in the so called Doctors Trial led to the creation of the Nuremberg Code to control future trials involving human subjects

Four organisations were charged as being criminal Only the SS was found guilty These organisations were found not to be criminal

A Non profit organization is an organization that is not allowed to distribute any money that it makes to its owners as profit It usually does not even repay them money they provide which is called a donation In England this is more often referred to as not for profit and includes local and national government Non profit organizations are allowed to pay their workers but many workers at non profit organizations are volunteers who do not get paid for their work

Sometimes a non profit may make money to help other people which might include helping them start their own business or providing them with food clothing or shelter Some non profits try to help endangered animals or the environment Some non profits are small groups of people such as a block association or community group Others such as trade unions universities or religions are large and well established with many assets and many paid workers 

An organization that is non profit is usually called a non profit organization When it deals with politics or international issues it can be called a non governmental organization or NGO 

The Wikimedia organization which runs Wikipedia is a non profit It is based in Florida in the United States It is also a corporation known as a not for profit corporation

An organization that is trying to make a profit and failing is called unprofitable and may go bankrupt  but this does not make it a non profit A non profit may be profitable just as any business but the profits are used to further the purpose not to make the people who started it or who work there rich

Mariano Jos de Larra was a Spanish romanticist writer noted for satire and perhaps the best prose writer of 19th century Spain

He was born in Madrid his father served as a regimental doctor in the French army and as an afrancesado was compelled to leave the Peninsula with his family in 1812 In 1817 Larra returned to Spain knowing less Spanish than French His nature was disorderly his education was imperfect and after futile attempts to obtain a degree in medicine or law he made an imprudent marriage at the age of twenty broke with his relatives and became a journalist

On the 27th of April 1831 he produced his first play No ms mostrador based on two pieces by Scribe and Dieulafoy Though wanting in originality it is brilliantly written and held the stage for many years On the 24th of September 1834 he produced Macas a play based on his own historical novel El doncel de don Enrique el Doliente

The drama and novel are interesting as experiments but Larra was essentially a journalist and the increased liberty of the press after the death of Ferdinand VII gave his caustic talent an ampler field He was already famous under the pseudonyms of Juan Prez de Mungua and Fgaro which he used in El Pobrecito Hablador and La Revista Espaola respectively Madrid laughed at his grim humour ministers feared his vitriolic pen and courted him assiduously he defended Liberalism against the Carlist rebellion he was elected as deputy for vila and a great career seemed to lie before him But the era of military pronunciamientos ruined his personal prospects and patriotic plans His writing took on a more sombre tinge domestic troubles increased his pessimism and in consequence of a disastrous love affair he committed suicide in February 1837

Larra lived long enough to prove himself the greatest prose writer that Spain can boast during the 19th century He wrote at great speed with the constant fear of the censor before his eyes but no sign of haste is discernible in his work and the dexterity with which he aims his venomous shafts is amazing His political instinct his abundance of ideas and his forcible mordant style would have given him a foremost position at any time and in any country in Spain and in his own period they placed him beyond all rivalry

Luis de Molina was a Spanish Jesuit and writer

At the age of eighteen Molina became a member of the Society of Jesus He studied theology at Coimbra After this he became professor in the university of vora Portugal From this post he was called at the end of twenty years to the chair of moral theology in Madrid

Besides other works he wrote De liberi arbitrii cum gratiae donis divina praescientia praedestinatione et reprobatione concordia a commentary on the first part of the Summa Theologiae of Thomas Aquinas and a treatise De jure et justitia

He published Der Strmer newspaper became a part of the Nazi propaganda machine His publishing firm released three anti Semitic books for children including the 1938 Der Giftpilz one of the most widespread pieces of propaganda The book said that Jews were dangerous just like an attractive yet deadly mushroom After the war he was convicted at the Nuremberg Trials of crimes against humanity and executed

Streicher was born in Fleinhausen Bavaria He was an elementary school teacher until joining the German Army in 1914 Streicher won the Iron Cross and was a lieutenant by the time the Armistice was signed in 1918 In 1913 Streicher married Kunigunde Roth a bakers daughter in Nrnberg They had two sons Lothar and Elmar

In 1919 Streicher was active in the Schutz und Trutz Bund an anti Semitic organization In 1920 he turned to the newly formed German Socialist Party This party had nearly the same ideas as the Nazi Party Streicher wanted to make it more anti Semitic Most members of the German Socialist Party did not want this so Streicher and his followers moved to the German Working Community in 1921 This community wanted to unite the various anti Semitic movements In 1922 Streicher joined his followers with those of Adolf Hitler almost doubling the membership of the Nazi Party and earning Hitlers lifelong gratitude Streicher took part in the Munich Beer Hall Putsch in 1923 Later he had the privilege of marching at the front of the annual reenactment of the putsch after the Nazi takeover of power in 1933

In 1923 Streicher founded the racist newspaper Der Strmer He was also the editor Streicher used the newspaper to stir up a deep hatred of everything and everyone Jewish Eventually the newspaper reached a peak circulation of 480000 in 1935

Streicher argued in the newspaper that the Jews had contributed to the depression unemployment and inflation in Germany which afflicted the country during the 1920s He claimed that Jews were white slavers and were responsible for over 90 percent of the prostitutes in the country

After the refounding of the Nazi party Streicher became Gauleiter of Franconia After 1933 he practically ruled the city of Nuremberg and was nicknamed King of Nuremberg and the Beast of Franconia In 1940 he was stripped of all party offices after being involved in major financial scandals involving Jewish property seized after the anti Semitic outburst of Kristallnacht in November 1938 and also for spreading untrue stories about Hermann Gring several attacks on other Gauleiters and unconcealed adultery Streicher however remained on good terms with German dictator Adolf Hitler until the latter committed suicide on April 30 1945 On May 23 two weeks after Germanys surrender Streicher was captured by the Americans

Streichers wife Kunigunde Streicher died in 1943 after 30 years of marriage Streicher was married to his former secretary Adele Tappe just days before his arrest

Julius Streicher was found guilty of crimes against humanity at the Nuremberg War Crimes Trial and sentenced to death on 1 October 1946

Streicher was not a member of the military and was not part of planning the Holocaust the invasion of Poland or the Soviet invasion But because he encouraged so much support for the hatred and extermination of Jews the prosecutors decided to include him in the indictment

His last words on 16 October 1946 were Heil Hitler and The Bolsheviks will hang you one day He is also reported to have cried out Purim Fest 1946  ie Streicher thought that Jews would start a new Holiday on the date of the hanging of himself and his fellow Nazis just as they had started Purim to mark the execution of Haman 

The hanging of Julius Streicher was not as planned Most eyewitnesses say that he died by slow strangulation rather than by the quick death from breaking the neck Streicher was not the only Nazi this happened to It was because of the type of hanging used at Nuremberg It is thought that the executioner had to intervene under the gallows to silence and finish Streicher who was still groaning and swinging on the rope some time after the release of the trap door

121 Hermione is a very big asteroid of the dark C spectral type orbiting in the Cybele group in the farther part of the main belt As a C type it is probably made of carbonate

Hermione was found by J C Watson on May 12 1872 and named after Hermione daughter of Menelaus and Helen in Greek mythology Hermione is a Cybele asteroid and orbits beyond most of the main belt asteroids

The asteroid has an odd shape as evidenced by adaptive optics images the first of which were taken in December 2003 with the Keck telescope Of many proposed shape models that agreed with the images a snowman like shape was found to best fit the seen precession rate of Hermiones moon 

Observation of the moons orbit has made possible a correct determination of Hermiones mass For the best fit snowman model the density is found to be 18 02 gcm This gives a porosity of the order of 20 This could be because the main asteroids are fractured solid bodies but not a rubble pile

Occultations by Hermione have been successfully seen three times so far the last time in February 2004

Hermione can mean different things

ENIAC was a computer built in 1943 It was designed by two people called John Mauchly and J Presper Eckert The machine was built out of nearly 17500 vacuum tubes 7200 diodes and many miles of wire It took up convert1800sqftm2lkon of space which is the size of a large room 

Because the computer was built out of vacuum tubes it often broke This meant that someone had to find the broken tube take the broken tube out and put a working tube in

Making programs for the computer was hard Making the computer ready for one single program could take many days or even weeks This was because the programming had to be done by pulling wires from one place to another This was not hard for small programs but if a large program was wanted it was very hard work Programming by pulling wires was used until 1948 when a special type of memory was added After that programming was done by using switches meaning that the time to make a program was reduced to hours instead of days

The ENIAC was first designed to print firing tables for the US Navy but the war had finished before the machine was completed

When it was asked if it was possible to make a hydrogen bomb ENIAC gave the answer in 20 seconds ENIAC took 70 hours to work out pi to 2000 decimal places A modern PC with a CPU of the size of 2x2 cm is much faster than ENIAC which used up a whole room of space For an example a modern PC can work out a million decimal places of pi in about ten seconds

ENIAC was shut down forever on October 2 1955 Now only about 10 panels of the 40 exist 

The National Democratic Party is a right wing political party in Germany It is usually just called the NPD It started after the Deutsche Reichspartei dissolved in 1964

It is not the same as the old Hessian Nationaldemokratischen Partei That was one of the parties which joined to form the Deutsche Reichspartei in 1949

The German government tried to get the NPD banned in 2003 but the Bundesverfassungsgericht threw the case out when some of the leaders of the party turned out to be agents or informers of German security services including the Bundesamt fr Verfassungsschutz the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution which still lists the NPD as a dangerous organisation because its policies are a threat to the peace and stability of Germany and the constitution The NPD is also referred to as being Neo Nazi as it openly opposes Turks blacks gays and Jews

130 Elektra is a very big farther main belt asteroid It was found by C H F Peters on February 17 1873 and named after Electra an avenger in Greek mythology

Its spectrum is of the G type so it is probably made up like Ceres Spectral signatures of organic compounds have been seen on Elektras surface 

Recent optical sightings have found a moon Using its orbit Elektras mass can be found more correctly The value of 13e19 kg indicates an unusually high density of 38 03 gcm Optical sightings have also determined that Elektras shape is quite non spherical as well as giving indications of albedo differences of 5 15 on its surface

Absinthe also known as absinth absynthe or absenta is a drink It is distilled from herbs including the flowers and leaves of the medicinal plant Artemisia absinthium It is a very alcoholic drink Absinthe is usually green Sometimes colors are added to change the color It is often called la Fe Verte or The Green Fairy 

Absinthe came from Val de Travers Switzerland It was very popular in late 19th and early 20th century France Parisian artists and writers were supposed to drink it The romantic associations with the drink still linger in popular culture At the end of 1900 the French were drinking over 2 million litres of absinthe a year By 1910 this had increased to 36 million litres

In the 19th century hotel owners often put bad things into absinthe such as sulfur to change its color Absinthe was seen as a dangerous drink with mind altering effects After the Lanfray murders in 1906 a petition was given to the Swiss government to ban absinthe in Switzerland Absinthe became banned in other countries Since 1915 it was banned in a number of European countries and the United States

The word comes from the Latin word absinthium This is from the Greek word Wormwood Absinth is a way of spelling absinthe that is often seen in central Europe

Traditionally absinthe is put into a glass A sugar cube is then placed in the bowl of a special spoon Ice cold water is poured or dripped over the sugar until the drink is diluted During this process the parts that are not soluble in water make the liquid cloudy The resulting milky opalescence is called the louche

The main herbs used to produce absinthe are green anise florence fennel and grande wormwood often called the holy trinity Many other herbs may be used as well such as hyssop melissa star anise petite wormwood angelica root Sweet Flag dittany leaves coriander veronica juniper nutmeg and various mountain herbs

The herbs are first soaked a step called maceration Heat is added in the process of distillation which extracts a pure liquid Wormwood anise and Florence fennel produce a colorless liquid or distillate that is about 72 alcohol The distillate can be bottled clear to produce a Blanche or la Bleue absinthe A second step can add color to the liquid using artificial or natural coloring 

Traditionally the natural coloring step is done by steeping petite wormwood hyssop and melissa among other herbs in the liquid Chlorophyll from these herbs give it its famous green color This green absinthe is known as a verte After this process the liquid is mixed with water to reach the desired amount of alcohol Historically most absinthes contain between 60 and 75 alcohol Sometimes absinthe can be colored red called a rouge or rose This made by using a red flowerherb It is possible to create a naturally colored absinthe of any color by using the correct plant material 

Historically there were five grades of absinthe ordinaire demi fine fine suprieure and Suisse These were graded in increasing alcoholic strength and quality A suprieure and Suisse would always be naturally colored and distilled Suisse did not mean it came from Switzerland Ordinaire and demi fine could be artificially colored and made from oil extracts

Absinthe should be stored in a cool room temperature dry place away from light and heat 

The precise origin of absinthe is unknown Wormwood has been in medical use since 1500 BC In 1797Henry Louis Pernod opened the first absinthe distillery called Dubied Pre et Fils in Couvet In 1805Pernod built a second distillery in Pontarlier France

Absinthes popularity grew slowly In the 1840s absinthe was given to French soldiers as a malaria treatment When the troops returned home they started to drink absinthe with water It became popular at bars and bistros After the 1860s absinthe had become so popular that it was for sale in most cafs and cabarets By the 1880s the price had dropped a lot the market got bigger and absinthe soon became the drink of France By 1910 the French were drinking 36 million litres of absinthe per year 

Absinthe was often linked with violent crimes supposedly committed under its influence Combined with hard liquor use and the low price absinthe became a social problem in France Wine makers groups often publicized problems with absinthe Journalists blamed absinthe for many social problems

In 1900 absinthe was banned in Switzerland The banning of absinthe was even written into the constitution in 1907 following a popular initiative The Netherlands banned absinthe in 1909 followed by the United States in 1912 and France in 1915 Around the same time Australia banned the liquor too After the absinthe prohibition wine and whiskey makers had a big increase in sales

In the 1990s an importer George Rowley discovered that there was no UK law banning the sale of absinthe It had never been banned in the UK other than the normal laws covering alcoholic beverages Hills Liquere a Czech Republic distillery founded in 1920 began manufacturing Hills Absinth This was a Bohemian style absinthe which started a modern rebirth in absinthes popularity

It has never been banned in Spain or Portugal where it continues to be made France never changed the law of 1915 In 1988 a new law was passed This bans only drinks that call themselves absinthe and drinks that do not meet with European Union laws on thujone Thujone is the chemical which was thought to cause the hallucinatory effect of absinthe

In the Netherlands the old law banning absinthe was successfully challenged by the Amsterdam wine seller Menno Boorsma In July 2004 it became legal to make absinthe again

In Switzerland the constitutional ban on absinthe was removed in 2000 during an overhaul of the national constitution The ban was written into ordinary law instead Absinthe is now not only sold in Switzerland but is once again distilled in its Val de Travers birthplace

In the United States the laws banning absinthe are hard to understand In some states it is legal have a bottle of absinthe but not to buy or to produce it The export and import of absinthe is probably illegal

After getting his abitur in 1907 at the Gymnasium in Leer he went to Marburg to study philosophy and social sciences In 1909 he moved to the university in Munich In Munich he first came in touch with the ideas of socialism He returned to Marburg in the autumn of 1910 and in 1912 took the state examination there

The Lake Zug is one of the lesser known Swiss lakes on the outskirts of the Alps and north of Lake Lucerne It is fed by the Aa which descends from the Rigi and enters the south end of the lake The Lorze feeds the lake at the northern shore

For the most part the lake is in the Canton of Zug but the southern end is up to 10km in the canton of Schwyz while the Canton of Lucerne stretches over a 2km area by the Immensee 

At its northern end the shores are nearly level while on the west shore the wooded promontory of Buonas projects picturesquely into the waters The principal place on the lake is the town of Zug Three railways follow the shore of the lake one from Zrich via Zug and Arth Goldau to the St Gotthard one from Lucerne via Arth Goldau to the St Gotthard and one from Zrich via Zug to Lucerne

Many fish are taken from the lake which is especially famous for an endemic kind of trout Because of farming runoff it is not one of Switzerlands cleanest lakes

In 1911 a railway was built around the lake

The first steamer was placed on the lake in 1852

Benny Goodman born Benjamin David Goodman was an American jazz musician who played the clarinet He was called The King of Swing Patriarch of the Clarinet The Professor and Swings Senior Statesman

Goodman was the son of poor Jewish immigrants in Chicago Illinois They lived in Chicagos Maxwell Street neighborhood He learned to play clarinet in a boys band run by a charity He became a strong clarinet player at an early age and began playing professionally in bands while still wearing in short pants

His early influences were New Orleans jazz clarinet players in Chicago such as Johnny Dodds Leon Ropollo and Jimmy Noone 

Goodman joined one of Chicagos top bands the Ben Pollack Orchestra at the age of 16 He made his first recordings with them in 1926 He started making records under his own name two years later

Goodman left for New York City He became a good session musician during the late 1920s and early 1930s He was known as a solid player because he was prepared and reliable He played with the nationally known bands of Red Nichols Isham Jones and Ted Lewis Then he formed his own band in 1932 

In 1934 he tried out for the Lets Dance radio program Since he needed new charts every week for the show his friend John Hammond suggested that he buy some jazz charts from Fletcher Henderson who had New Yorks most popular African American band in the 1920s and early 1930s The combination of the Henderson charts his strong clarinet playing and his band that practiced well made him a rising star in the mid 30s 

He performed at the Palomar Ballroom in Los Angeles on August 21 1935 Because of this show he became known across the United States His radio broadcasts from New York were too late at night for many people on the East Coast to hear them but Goodman had many fans in California and a very excited crowd greeted Goodman This got a lot of attention across the nation and made the Goodman Band popular very fast Some writers have said that this was the start of the Swing Era

Goodman continued his fast rise throughout the late 1930s with his big band his trio and quartet and a sextet On January 16 1938 his band made a famous appearance at Carnegie Hall By the mid 1940s big bands became less popular Some reasons for this are that talented musicians were entering the military or getting better paying factory jobs gasoline and rubber rationing during WWII two long musician recording strikes and the rise of popular singers like Frank Sinatra 

Goodman continued to play on records and in small groups He would sometimes organize a new band and play in a jazz festival or go on a tour playing in other countries He continued to play the clarinet until he died in 1986 in in New York New York

Goodman also helped racial integration in America In the early 1930s black and white jazz musicians could not play together in most clubs or concerts In the Southern states racial segregation was enforced by law Benny Goodman broke with tradition by hiring Teddy Wilson to play with him and drummer Gene Krupa in the Benny Goodman Trio In 1936 he added Lionel Hampton on vibes to form the Benny Goodman Quartet Goodman was so famous that his band could afford to not go on tour in the southern states where the people in his band might have been arrested because of their race

Artie Shaw is considered to be one of the best jazz musicians of his time He was a jazz clarinet player composer and bandleader He also wrote both fiction and non fiction writings

He was born Arthur Jacob Arshawsky in New York New York He began learning the saxophone when he was 15 By age 16 he began to tour with a band He returned to New York City and became a session musician During the Swing Era his big band was very popular with hits like Begin the Beguine

Shaw was married eight times Jane Cairns Margaret Allen Lana Turner Betty Kern daughter of songwriter Jerome Kern Ava Gardner Forever Amber author Kathleen Winsor Doris Dowling and Evelyn Keyes He had two sons by Kern and Dowling

In 1953 Shaw was brought up before the House Un American Activities Committee for his leftist activities The committee was investigating a peace activist organization the World Peace Congress which it considered a communist front

Throughout his musical career Shaw would take time off He would quit the music business and pursue his writing career In 1955 Shaw stopped playing the clarinet After that he focused on writing especially semi biographical fiction

In 1981 he organized a new Artie Shaw Band with clarinetist Dick Johnson as bandleader and soloist Shaw himself would guest conduct from time to time ending his self imposed retirement

In 1991 Artie Shaws band library and manuscript collection was donated to the University of Arizona In 2004 he was presented with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award

In his later years Shaw lived and wrote in the Newbury Park section of Thousand Oaks California Shaw had adult onset diabetes In December 2004 he died due to the disease at age 94

Edward R Ed Murrow was an American journalist and television and radio figure He first became known for a series of radio news broadcasts during World War II These broadcasts were followed by millions of listeners in the United States and Canada Many historians think he was one of journalisms greatest figures Murrow hired the best war correspondents He was known for his honesty and integrity in delivering the news He was a pioneer of television news broadcasting 

Murrow produced a series of TV news reports that helped lead to the censure of Senator Joseph McCarthy This was portrayed in the 2005 movie Good Night and Good Luck

The movie although released in black and white was filmed on color film stock but on a grayscale set It was later color corrected to black and white during post production It focuses on the theme of media responsibility It also addresses what occurs when the media offer a voice of dissent against the government The movie takes its title from the line with which Murrow routinely closed his broadcasts 

Taglines They took on the government with nothing but the truth We will not walk in fear of one another

Joseph Conrad was a Polish writer regarded as one of the greatest English language novelists This is very remarkable because he did not learn to speak English well until he was in his 20s and therefore always had a Polish accent 

People think Conrads prose style is one of the best of all English novelists He also is seen as important for paving the way to modernist literature His narrative style and anti heroic characters have influenced many modern writers and inspired such films as Apocalypse Now 

Conrad lived in the time of the British Empire and worked in the British Merchant Navy So he had experience enough to write novels and short stories about empire and navy

Modernist literature is the literary form of Modernism and especially high modernism it should not be confused with modern literature which is the history of the modern novel and modern poetry as one There is a separate section on modernist poetry

Hurricane Helene was one of the strongest hurricanes of the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season It is tied with Hurricane Gordon which was also very strong It was the ninth tropical storm fourth hurricane and second strong hurricane of the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season

Helene was a long Cape Verde type hurricane that formed in the extreme southeastern part of the North Atlantic Ocean When it was at its strongest it was a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir Simpson Hurricane Scale It reached this level as it travelled across the central Atlantic It never hit land until the very end of its life as a weak extratropical cyclone It only had a small effect in the northern British Isles

In the second week of September a strong tropical wave started moving off the coast of Africa It was well organized from the start and on September 11 even before it entered the Atlantic the National Hurricane Center believed that it could quickly turn into a tropical depression That is what happened and it became Tropical Depression Eight on the morning of September 12

Because the depression was so big it was quite slow to develop combined with some easterly wind shear in the eastern Atlantic and because of the Saharan Air Layer to the north as it moved south of the Cape Verde islands The actuual strengthening was slowed down because convection was very slow However on September 13 the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Helene The storm slowly strengthened over the warm waters of the eastern Atlantic thereafter as it tracked west northwest

Some dry air from the Saharan Air Layer kept slowing Helenes strengthening on September 14 as Helene was still a weak tropical storm However an sudden strengthening happened on September 15 as shear got lower

On the morning of September 16 the storm began to make a ragged eye and strengthened to Hurricane Helene The intensity stayed the same for a while as a weak Category 1 hurricane as the strengthening was slowed down by medium wind shear even though there was not a lot of dry air Late that evening the storm began to slowly get stronger once again

On September 17 the strengthening became faster and Helene quickly became a Category 2 hurricane that morning as the eye became clearer and surrounded by deeper convection Helene also turned more northward and slowed down in the central Atlantic which was because of a weakness in the subtropical ridge farther north created by Gordon Because Helene turned north the hurricane was moved away from any land areas The strengthening kept going through the afternoon and that evening Helene strengthened into a large hurricane with 115 mph and a minimum central pressure of 962 mbar As shear stayed low and the oceans stayed warm Helene got a little bit stronger At the most it was a strong Category 3 hurricane with 120 mph winds early on September 18 At that time Helene and Gordon were at roughly the same longitude in the open ocean 

As Gordon moved eastward on the afternoon of 18th a narrow ridge built in forcing Helene westward The eyewall collapsed quite a lot and Helene weakened into a Category 2 hurricane where it stayed for about 48 hours until September 20 because of a long eyewall replacement cycle and a stretched out cloud pattern On the 20th Helene turned back to the northwest and weakened a bit because wind shear got a bit bigger That afternoon the hurricane was downgraded to a Category 1 hurricane which Helene stayed as until becoming extratropical

Early on September 21 the motion moved to the north as it moved along the northwest edge of the subtropical ridge That movement kept going throughout the day however Helene began to turn more to the north east that evening along the edge of the subtropical ridge east of Bermuda Because wind shear got lower and the water was quite warm at around 81F Helene stayed as a Category 1 hurricane without any big changes to its strength The strength stayed at around 80 mph before strengthening a bit late on September 22 even though it lost some tropical features as it sped up northeast in the north Atlantic When QuikSCAT analysed it early on September 23 they said that it was definitely a high end Category 1 hurricane with 90 mph winds

Helene turned into a hybrid storm with both tropical and extratropical features that afternoon with a deep warm core After that bigger shear weakened Helene once again although it stayed as a hurricane strength storm until it was fully extratropical on the morning of September 24 After becoming fully extratropical the storm weakened as it moved eastward becoming a gale center west of Ireland early on September 27 It eventually merged with a larger extratropical low near the northern end of the British Isles late on the 27th

While Helene was a tropical cyclone the storm never came close to land Three ships were caught in the outer part of Helene The strongest of these reported 56 mph winds early on September 23 in the north Atlantic Though it stayed far away from the island the hurricane made rough waves in Bermuda As a weakened extratropical system strong wind gusts were reported in Ireland and northern Scotland The strongest wind gust in Ireland was at the Valentia Observatory where 56 mph gusts were reported In Scotland the strongest gust was on South Uist Island in the Outer Hebrides where 74 mph gusts were reported No damage or deaths were reported because of Helene

South Uist is an island of the Outer Hebrides in Scotland In the 2001 census it had a usually resident population of 1818 There is a nature reserve and a number of sites of archaeological interest including the only location in Great Britain where prehistoric mummies have been found The population is about 90 Roman Catholic The island in common with the rest of the Hebrides is one of the last remaining strongholds of the Gaelic language in Scotland In 2006 South Uist and neighbouring Benbecula and Eriskay were involved in Scotlands biggest community land buyout to date In the north west there is a missile testing range

The Outer Hebrides often called the Western Isles make up an island chain off the west coast of Scotland It is also a parliamentary constituency 

The isles form part of the Hebrides and are separated from the Scottish mainland and from the Inner Hebrides by the stormy waters of the Minch the Little Minch and the Sea of the Hebrides 

Formerly the dominant language of the Islands Scottish Gaelic remains spoken even though it has now been largely supplanted by English in some parts

Sea transport is crucial and a variety of ferry services operate between the islands and to mainland Britain 

The Western Isles became part of the Sureyjar kingdom of the Norse who ruled for over 400 years until sovereignty was transferred to Scotland by the Treaty of Perth in 1266 Control of the islands was then held by clan chiefs 

Most of the islands have a bedrock formed from ancient metamorphic rocks and the climate is mild and oceanic The Gulf Stream runs nearby The 15 inhabited islands have a total population of about 26500 and there are more than 50 substantial uninhabited islands

Much of the archipelago is a protected habitat including both the islands and the surrounding waters There are 53 Sites of Special Scientific Interest of which the largest are Loch an Duin North Uist at convert 15100haacre and North Harris which is convert 12700haacre in extent

Loch Druidibeg on South Uist is a National Nature Reserve owned and managed by Scottish Natural Heritage The reserve covers 1677 hectares across the whole range of local habitats

Hurricane Gordon was a strong Category 3 hurricane that crossed the Azores as a Category 1 hurricane making it the first hurricane to directly impact the Azores since 1991 Gordons remnants also affected Western Europe It was the eighth tropical storm third hurricane and first major hurricane of the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season

The original development of this system can be linked to Hurricane Florence It began as a tropical wave just right behind Florence in the first week of September which at first was absorbed into the large circulation of then Tropical Storm Florence As Florence began to organize and move northwest the wave managed to break from the circulation again and slowly organize in spite of hostile conditions at first On September 10 it had organized enough to be declared Tropical Depression Seven northeast of the Lesser Antilles With Florence far away from the system conditions became more favorable for development and it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Gordon on September 11 while moving slowly westward

The conditions remained favorable as Gordon steered through a hole in the ridge near the Azores allowing it to avoid land It continued to strengthen becoming a hurricane on September 12 and rapidly organizing into a strong Category 2 hurricane less than 24 hours later The quick development continued on September 13 and by that evening it had strengthened into a major hurricane  the first of 2006  while maintaining a very small size Gordon would remain a major hurricane for over 24 hours before cooler water began to set in and Gordon gradually weakened beginning early on September 15

The steering currents would also weaken greatly and Gordon became nearly stationary for about 24 hours as well before a trough would come in and push Gordon northeastward By the morning of September 16 Gordon was barely a hurricane and was forecast to weaken over cooler waters However that did not happen and Gordon actually strengthened a little bit while moving northeastward and became better organized That trend continued for over 48 hours and Gordon increased in strength slowly becoming a Category 2 hurricane While the forecast constantly showed a weakening trend the resiliency suddenly meant that the Azores were threatened by Gordon Gordon reached its secondary peak of 105 mph on the morning of September 19 before weakening again

Nonetheless it remained a hurricane as it crossed the Azores Shortly after that it weakened and became extratropical The remnants of Gordon then began to interact with a large Atlantic low pressure area to the west of Ireland and an associated weather front extending south It tracked towards the north west of the Iberian Peninsula and then on September 21 turned northwards towards south west Britain and Ireland By the morning of September 22 it had become completely absorbed into the Atlantic low

With the onset of Gordon expected all nine Azores Islands were placed on red alert by the Portuguese government and residents were asked to take emergency precautions The Meteorological Service of the Azores gave out hurricane warnings for all of the islands The civil protection agency head Antonio Cunha closed all schools as a precautionary measure Fishermen were also ordered to stay on land Residents were warned to stay indoors close doors and windows clear storm sewers and move livestock to safe areas Forecasters warned of winds as high as 105 mph along with heavy rain and waves of up to 12 metres high lashing coastal areas

In Spain the region of Galicia was placed on red alert  the highest level  by authorities who were expecting the extratropical remnants of Gordon Classes on September 21 were also stopped by the regional education ministry 11 other regions of Spain including as far east as Madrid and as far south as Andalusia received lower levels of warning

Stormy conditions caused by the remnants of Gordon were expected to affect the 2006 Ryder Cup in Straffan County Kildare Ireland starting fears that the event may be greatly interrupted and delayed Strong gusts and heavy rain associated with another system had already caused some damages resulting both teams to delay their second practice rounds This led to concerns about the possible state of the course by the time the tournament proper was expected to start on September 22 leading to the possibility of further interruptions and possible changing of the normal rules As a result September 25 was set aside as an additional reserve day by organizers at the K Club 

On September 19 it was reported that the remnants of Gordon would cause high winds and rainfall in parts of the United Kingdom The UK Met Office stated that a period of very windy weather with exceptionally severe gales was expected for much of Northern Ireland and Scotland Northern Ireland was expected to receive the worst of the storm with severe gales as high as 80 mph expected There were also warnings of localised flooding with up to two inches of rain expected to fall In addition Wales and western England were warned of gusts of up to 50 mph

The Azores escaped a lot of severe damage There were only reports of toppled trees and power lines knocking out power to some communities particularly on Santa Maria Island

Gordon hit the northwestern province of Galicia while as a strengthening extratropical storm early on September 21 Gusts as strong as 101 mph were seen at Fisterra Even near Madrid reported winds of 65 mph raked Punto Navacerrada Heavy rainfall up to 258 at Canfranc fell across Spain The pressure plummeted to 9897 hPa at A Corua Waves as high as 7 metres were also reported Trees traffic lights containers and placards were all blown over by the strong winds One man was injured from a tree falling on his car Overall damage was light but some roads were blocked

On September 20 practice rounds for the Ryder Cup were temporarily delayed due to high winds but Meteorological Office charts showed these to be associated with a different Atlantic low pressure area rather than effects of Gordon itself

The remnants of Gordon caused stormy conditions late on September 21 with 1500 homes losing power The worst affected areas were on the east coast between Drogheda and Wexford and in the south around Cork and Limerick 

Earlier on the 21st a woman attending the Ryder Cup in County Kildare was injured after a tree branch fell near a golf buggy in which she was travelling Additionally the events media centre was evacuated because of high winds However the gates opened at 0600 on September 22 as originally planned and the tournaments first day went ahead without major disruption

The remnants of Gordon hit south west Britain late on September 21 A gust of 81 mph kmh was recorded and power lines were hit leaving more than 1000 homes without power in Truro Cornwall In Devon the rail line between Exeter and Plymouth was damaged by high surf at Dawlish causing disruption to services A section of seawall 10m long was also eroded near the track A tree fell onto a campervan in Yeoford but no injuries were reported 

Gusts of up to 75 mph affected Northern Ireland during the night of the 21st 22nd Up to 100000 houses lost power as tree branches fell on power lines Fallen trees caused widespread disruption in County Down several people had to be rescued from their vehicles after trees had fallen on them flooding was also reported at Rostrevor Several roads across the province were blocked by fallen trees including the M1 motorway and the main roads from Derry to Belfast and Coleraine The Foyle Bridge in Derry was also closed for two hours early on the 22nd due to high winds

In Scotland high winds led to the cancelling of ferry services from Stranraer and Cairnryan Lorries on the A715 road were forced to park on the roadside overnight due to dangerous driving conditions

One positive effect from the extratropical remnants of Gordon was observed in Newquay Cornwall where large waves and swells up to 25 m high made for excellent surf conditions 

Tropical Storm Debby was the fifth tropical storm of the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season Debby formed just off the coast of Africa on August 21 from a tropical wave After passing near the Cape Verde islands Debby moved generally northwestward for much of its life reaching a peak intensity of 50 mph Strong wind shear weakened the storm and Debby dissipated on August 27 over the northern Atlantic Ocean

Early in its life Debby was forecasted to pass through the southern Cape Verde islands as a tropical storm possibly causing life threatening flooding Most computer models consistently predicted Debby to move to the northwest throughout its lifetime though intensity was more of a problem for forecasters The National Hurricane Center continually predicted Debby to strengthen into hurricane status though strong vertical shear eventually prevented the storm from becoming a hurricane

A strong tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa late on August 20 and almost convective banding and a broad circulation A large area of low pressure formed within the wave the next day while located 260 miles southeast of the Cape Verde islands Though convection decreased early on August 21 the area of low pressure stayed well organized and the system developed into Tropical Depression Four late on August 21 Water temperatures remained warm enough for development while upper level shear was minimal as the depression moved west northwestward because of a ridge of high pressure to its north Original predictions by the National Hurricane Center also forecasted a turn to the northwest based computer model predictions as quoted by forecaster James Franklin The models have also been excellently wrong thus far

In spite of a decrease in convection shortly after forming the large depression remained well organized with a 575 mile wide wind field On August 22 as it passed 140 miles miles to south of the Cape Verde islands deep convection developed over the center of circulation and early on August 23 the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Debby about 300 miles southwest of Cape Verde Banding features continued to organize as the system slowly strengthened and on August 23 Debby reached its peak intensity of 50 mph over the open waters of the Atlantic Ocean Forecasters predicted Debby to continue to strengthen to reach hurricane status while its projected path placed the storm in an area of warm water temperatures and moderate upper level shear

Shortly after reaching its peak intensity Debby encountered an area of dry air and as a result weakened The low level circulation detached itself from the dying convection while the system as a whole continued west northwestward Convection redeveloped over a portion of the center while banding features redeveloped as well Organization continued and Debby again reached its peak intensity of 50 mph on August 24 Southerly wind shear displaced the convection to the north of the center and Debby weakened to a weak tropical storm on August 25 The center of the storm became asymmetric and elongated and on August 26 Debby weakened to a tropical depression Convection remained minimal and it quickly degenerated into a remnant area of low pressure The low turned to the north and north northeast ahead of an approaching trough and on August 28 the low dissipated

The government of the Cape Verde islands gave out tropical storm warnings at the same time with the issuance of the first advisory on Tropical Depression Four meaning tropical storm conditions were expected in the area within 24 hours The National Hurricane Center stated that heavy rainfall possibly as high as 10 inches in mountainous areas would be possible in the territory possibly causing life threatening flash floods and mudslides

However because of a reformation further to the south tropical storm warnings were discontinued as the depression passed away from the area While passing around 115 miles to the southwest of the southwestern most islands the depression produced a 35 mph wind gust at Fogo and some rainfall though no damage was reported

Long range forecasts brought the storm near Bermuda However Debby remained over 900 miles from the island at its closest approach

Though the storm was forecasted to remain far away from the Gulf of Mexico investors tracking the storm caused the price of crude oil to rise 60 cents a barrel due to the possible impact to oil installations

Fogo is a volcanic island in the Sotavento group of Cape Verde It is the most prominent of the group rising to nearly 3000 m above sea level at Mount Fogo

Hurricane Isaac was the final tropical cyclone of the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season It reached peak strength of Category 1 just before striking Newfoundland where it produced tropical storm force winds Isaac followed the path of the three previous storms in the Atlantic basin Florence Gordon and Helene Isaac formed in the central North Atlantic Ocean and moved eastward toward Europe

Hurricane Isaac formed off the coast of Africa on September 18 Intensification was partly suppressed by high wind shear and by cool sea surface temperatures in the wake of Hurricanes Gordon and Helene Isaac reached tropical storm strength on September 28 and entered a area of low wind shear allowing it to strengthen into an 85 mph hurricane Its intensity nearly matched forecasts made with the Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme

On October 1 Isaac turned northeast and struck Newfoundland as a tropical storm Two days later it merged with a newly formed baroclinic low off the east coast of the United States The merged system was forecast to move toward the area between Greenland and Great Britain Isaac produced rainfall over Newfoundland of up to 25 mm No deaths or damage were reported Isaac was the second storm to affect Newfoundland during the season the other being Hurricane Florence

Isaac started as a tropical wave that moved away from Africa on September 18 An area of disturbed weather began interacting with the tropical wave as deep convection increased on September 23 The convection began to organize and weather agencies to release the first Dvorak numbers on the system

The SHIPS models predicted that the system would become a hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 88 knots after 120 hours However the system was slow to organize and a Tropical Cyclone Formation Advisory was not issued by the National Hurricane Center until four days later The NHC however decided the convection was too ephemeral to justify classification as a tropical depression and the TCFA was discontinued Three days later on September 27 another TCFA was issued announcing the formation of the ninth tropical depression of the Atlantic season

The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Isaac on September 28 just twelve hours after the cyclones formation Deep convection was slow to form that day since the system remained over cold waters that had upwelled in the wake of Hurricanes Gordon and Helene The next day the cyclone moved west northwestward and started gaining subtropical characteristics while its convection deepened Vertical shear weakened as the system moved away from the cold upwelling waters and the core of Isaac started re developing Atmospheric conditions remained favorable and Isaac reached hurricane status on September 30 Isaac continued strengthening a little bit during the next day near Bermuda reaching its peak intensity with sustained winds of 85 mph and minimum central pressure of 985 mbar Isaacs winds quickly weakened to 80 mph but its central pressure did not change

Isaac encountered cooler waters as it approached Newfoundland on October 1 and weakened into a tropical storm on October 2 Isaac made landfall on the Avalon Peninsula as a weak tropical storm on October 2 and maintained tropical cyclonic structure and deep convection Soon after Isaac turned into an extratropical storm and merged with a larger extratropical system on October 3 off the Avalon Peninsula

A tropical storm watch was sent up on October 1 for the Avalon Peninsula The watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warning the next day Another watch was issued for the Burin and Bonavista peninsulas although it was quickly removed On October 2 all tropical cyclone watches and warnings were taken away Heavy rain and gusty winds were expected Because of this rainfall warnings were declared for parts of southern Newfoundland Wind and gale advisories were also given out over the Atlantic Ocean

On October 2 a ship called the Elektra reported winds of convert52mphkmhabbronlkon while it was located about convert170mikmabbron to the east of the center of the storm Two other ships many buoys and a few oil platforms also recorded strong winds Waves off the coast reached about convert16ftmabbronlkon heigh

Isaac did not have much impact on land No people were killed and there was no bad damage However some parts of the Avalon Peninsula had tropical storm conditions At Cape Race constant winds were as high as convert46mphkmhabbron with wind gusts of up to convert60mphkmhabbron The strongest winds remained offshore Since the storm was moving so quickly it did not drop much rainfall precipitation usually amounted to below convert1inmmabbron

In fluid dynamics the baroclinity is a measure of the stratification in a fluid A baroclinic atmosphere is one for which the density depends on both the temperature and the pressure contrast this with barotropic atmosphere for which the density depends only on the pressure In atmospheric terms the barotropic zones of the Earth are generally found in the central latitudes or tropics whereas the baroclinic areas are generally found in the mid latitudepolar regions

The traditional name of the ministry handling Germanys foreign affairs is the Foreign Office or AA It is responsible for the foreign policy as well as the German EU politics It is led by the federal Minister for Foreign Affairs

The Foreign Office is part of the foreign service of Germany The other part is the parts of the other agencies of the federal government based abroad

The Foreign Office handles contact between Germany and other countries or international organisations such as the United Nations This included trying to get a permanent seat in the Security Council of the United Nations as part of the proposed 2005 UN reforms The Foreign Office is near the old DDR Foreign Ministry in Berlin The big old building in the Werderschen Markt became the Reichbanks headquarters in 1940 and from 1959 the central committee headquarters of the SED The Foreign Office has a second headquarters on Adenauerallee in Bonn

Guido Westerwelle has been Foreign Minister since 2009

There are German embassies and consulates or consulates general in most capitals of the world as well as in larger towns of the countries

The Berlin headquarters job is to coordinate German diplomacy and study the information passed on from the embassies permanent representations and consulates These are the eyes ears and voice of the Federal Government abroad

The Foreign Office has 145 embassies 59 consulates general twelve permanent representations and ten offices abroad

There are also three German Information Centres with the job of giving information about Germany and the German language

The biggest GIC is in Washington DC after it moved from New York in 2003 A GIC in Cairo is for the Arabic speaking world The other GIC is in Paris for French speaking areas

There are also 356 honorary consuls These are often German businessmen who do some work for the Foreign Office

The Bonn office handles information technology particularly Every German agency abroad is connected to Bonn which can send the information to Berlin The Bonn office also arranges communications for the Foreign Minister and the Chancellorwhen they are abroad

Some people say that there is corruption in the way senir jobs are filled

This is because the Foreign Office does not publish the qualifications of its top diplomats anymore They stopped after terrorists used the information to attack the German embassy in Stockholm in 1975 and the RAF murdered diplomat Gerold von Braunmhl in 1986

The Foreign Office started in 1870 as a part of the North German Confederation It was headed by a permanent secretary just like the Foreign Office of the German empire There were ministers only since 1919 This was why it was called an Office not a ministry 

The Foreign Office of the German Empire was based in Berlin Wilhelmstrae 76

The empire tookover the Foreign Office of the North German alliance unchanged However the German federal states kept a considerable degree of independence in their own foreign policy

The AA had two departments

Higher politics personnel ceremonies budgets registeration of the schools and churches The head of this department was a permanent secretary who was also the permanent representative of the German Chancellor in the Foreign Office at the same time The German Chancellor had the topmost responsibility in foreign policy

The second department was responsible for trade traffic consulates national law civil law the art and science the private matters of Germans abroad also justice police and Post Office emigration ship matters This department was headed by the director of the Foreign Office

Legal matters were transferred to the new Department III in 1885 A colonial department was formed in 1890 it became the Imperial Colonial Office in 1907 Department IV was formed in 1915 to handle intelligence

The Foreign Office became a ministry in the Weimar Republic headed by a Reich Minister The permanent secretary no longerThe minister had the sole responsibility for the foreign policy now The name Foreign Office was kept out of tradition Gustav Stresemann was the most famous foreign minister of this time and moulded German foreign policy just like Bismarck had done during the empire

When the Nazis seized power the Foreign Office started following Nazi Party ideas However there was some resistance especially from people like Adam von Trott zu Solz and Ulrich von Hassell

The Foreign Office wrote a formal letter about the Jews and foreign policy in 1939 It said that giving the Jews a homeland in Palestine was dangerous to world peace This note is a big reason why the second set of Nuremberg Trials included officials from the Foreign Office

Also see Fritz Kolbe Kurt Georg Kiessinger

After the Second World War Germany stayed under allied control at least in part until 1955 This meant that there was no need for a Foreign Office until 1951 when the new Germany got more control overs its own affairs

The new Foreign Office was set up on March 15th 1951 in Bonn and kept the name of Office

Many of the senior officials of the AA were ex nazis in fact More ex party members were in charge parts of the Foreign Office than there were party members doing the same type of job during the Third Reich

Since 1966 the Foreign Minister has often been the leader of the smaller coalition partner in coalition governments The exceptions were the vice chancellorships of Jrgen Mllemann and Franz Mntefering

The Ministry for Foreign Affairs handled the foreign policy of the government of the DDR

Two Chancellors also Foreign Minister Konrad Adenauer as the first Foreign Secretary of the Federal Republic of Germany and Helmut Schmidt after FDP had left coalition and cabinet Hans Dietrich Genscher was Foreign Minister under both an SPD and a CDU chancellor

In Switzerland each Canton is free to decide its own internal organisation Because of this there many types and names for smaller administrative divisions in each canton The term District is used for these smaller divisions 

Most Cantons are divided into Bezirke Some are called mter Amtsbezirke district or distretto

The Bezirke generally only deals with administration and court organization The cantons Graubnden and Schwyz are their own legal entities They have the power to control taxes as well 

Ten of the 26 Cantons entirely dispense with the district level of government

Cape Race is a point of land at the southeastern tip of the Avalon Peninsula on the island of Newfoundland Canada Its name is thought to come from the original Portuguese name for this cape Raso or bare The Cape appeared on early sixteenth century maps as Cape Raso and may derive from a cape of the same name at the mouth of the Tagus River in Portugal

Hurricane Florence was the first Atlantic hurricane to produce hurricane force winds on Bermuda since Hurricane Fabian hit the island in September 2003 The seventh tropical storm and second hurricane of the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season Florence developed from a tropical wave in the tropical Atlantic Ocean on September 3 and followed the track of a Cape Verde type hurricane Because of unfavorable conditions the system failed to organize at first and as a result the storm grew to an unusually large size After several days Florence encountered an area of lesser wind shear and strengthened into a hurricane on September 10 It passed just west of Bermuda while recurving northeastward and on September 13 it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone

Florence produced wind gusts of up to 115 mph on Bermuda which caused several power outages and minor damage Florence then brought heavy rains across Newfoundland as an extratropical storm destroying one house and causing minor damage to several others There were no fatalities as a result of the hurricane

A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 29 It tracked slowly westward and first showed signs of development two days later On August 31 a second tropical wave exited the coast of Africa at a faster speed than its predecessor The two waves interacted and by September 2 combined to form a large area of disturbed weather across the eastern Atlantic Ocean Convection increased within the system and the large system developed a thick area of convection along with an organized low pressure area By late on September 3 the system maintained a large closed circulation and enough convective organization to be named Tropical Depression Six while located about midway between the Lesser Antilles and Africa

The 2006 unnamed tropical storm was a short lived tropical cyclone It was the second tropical storm of the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season It formed as an extratropical cyclone a type of weather system to the southeast of Nantucket Massachusetts It then moved to the northwest over warm water temperatures It turned into a tropical storm on July 17 when an area of thunderstorms formed near the center of the cyclone The storm quickly reached peak winds of 50 mph It moved into cooler waters and began to lose strength On July 18 it died out and what was left of the storm moved across Newfoundland Because the storm was weak no damage happened

A cold front moved off the east coast of the United States late on July 13 While it was over the western Atlantic Ocean it stopped moving The front then died out but it left behind two areas of low pressure The southern one was about 200 miles to the south of Cape Hatteras North Carolina The northern weather system was about 290 miles to the south southeast of Cape Cod Massachusetts The northern one became an extratropical cyclone a type of weather system on July 16 It moved to the northwest over warm water temperatures These temperatures were 8082 F A large group of thunderstorm formed near the center of the storm It turned into a tropical depression on July 17 when it was about 240 miles to the southeast of Nantucket Massachusetts

The storm moved to the northwest northeastward and it moved into an area that was good for strengthening It quickly became a tropical storm It continued to gain strength Late on July 17 the storm reached its peak winds of 50 mph At this time it was about 245 miles to the south of Halifax Nova Scotia The storm then moved into much cooler water temperatures after it left the Gulf Stream It quickly weakened as the convection quickly diminished and it died out on July 18 What was left of the storm moved over Newfoundland before turning to the east northeast

The storm was said to be a gale storm when it was active However several months later it was found that the storm did become a tropical cyclone There were several reasons for this change

When the storm came near Canada a buoy recorded winds of 36 mph It also recorded a wind gust of 44 mph The storm lost a large amount of strength before it moved over Newfoundland Because of this there was no damage The Atlantic Storm Prediction Centre sent out gale warnings for the storm

Every year the National Hurricane Center checks to make sure they did not miss any storms during the past tropical storm season They found this storm on December 15 2006 when they were studying the 2006 season If the storm was found when it was active it would have been called Tropical Storm Beryl It is guessed that the storm became a tropical cyclone at 391 N This was the farthest north that any Atlantic storm in July became a tropical cyclone This broke the past record that was set by Tropical Storm Arthur in 2002

Nantucket is an island 30 miles south of Cape Cod Massachusetts in the United States

Cape Hatteras is a cape on the coast of North Carolina It is the point that protrudes the farthest to the southeast along the northeast to southwest line of the Atlantic coast of North America making it a key point for navigation along the eastern seaboard So many ships have been lost around it that the area is known as the Graveyard of the Atlantic The nearby shoals are known as Diamond Shoals

Tropical Storm Alberto became a tropical storm farther north than any other Atlantic tropical cyclone The first tropical storm of the 1988 Atlantic hurricane season Alberto developed from a trough of low pressure off of the coast of South Carolina on August 5 It tracked quickly northeastward and intensified into a tropical storm at its record latitude on August 7 while located about 60 miles east of the Massachusetts island of Nantucket Alberto continued its fast forward motion and struck western Nova Scotia late on August 7 It became extratropical the next day and dissipated shortly thereafter to the north of Newfoundland Alberto produced light rainfall and gusty winds across its path No damage was reported

Tropical Storm Beryl was the third tropical storm of the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season Developing from a tropical disturbance on July 18 it tracked generally northward and strengthened to attain peak winds of 60 mph under generally favorable conditions After turning to the northeast Beryl weakened over cooler waters On July 21 it struck the island of Nantucket and shortly thereafter it became extratropical The extratropical remnants continued northeastward through Nova Scotia and on July 22 it merged with an approaching cold front

Beryl produced rough seas along the northeast United States coastline In Massachusetts its impact was limited to light rainfall and gusty winds with no reported damage Beryl later produced moderate rainfall and gusty winds across Atlantic Canada resulting in some localized power outages though little damage No deaths were reported

A cold front moved off the East Coast of the United States on July 16 and stalled off the coast of North Carolina It slowly decayed into a surface low pressure trough and developed into two disturbances one was centered 290 miles south southeast of Cape Cod and another was located 200 miles 320 km south of Cape Hatteras North Carolina The first low quickly organized into an unnamed tropical storm and the other area stayed broad and disorganized However by July 18 the system became much better organized with improved banding features and the area developed into Tropical Depression Two while located 220 miles south southeast of Cape Hatteras 

The depression moved slowly to the north northwest through a break in the subtropical ridge and as convective banding features became more visible the system strengthened into Tropical Storm Beryl Throughout much of its duration the storm tracked through an environment with light vertical wind shear and well established upper level outflow Shortly after becoming a tropical storm the low level circulation of Beryl became exposed with limited deep convection though deep convection re developed the following morning Outflow continued to improve and with warm sea surface temperatures Beryl slowly strengthened further to reach peak winds of 60 mph early on July 20 while located about 120 miles east of Nags Head North Carolina

Beryl maintained peak winds for about 18 hours as it paralleled the Mid Atlantic and New Jersey coasts during which an eye like feature developed in the center of the convection Late on July 20 it began a slow weakening trend after passing over cooler waters Steering winds ahead of an approaching mid level trough caused Beryl to speed up northeastward and early on July 21 the center of the storm crossed the island of Nantucket The convection diminished as it moved through progressively colder waters and shortly after 1200 UTC on July 21 Beryl became an extratropical cyclone a short distance east of Cape Cod Hours later it made landfall in southwestern Nova Scotia and on July 22 the extratropical remnants of Beryl merged with an approaching cold front over Newfoundland

Forecasters orginially predicted Beryl to brush the Carolinas as such a tropical storm watch was issued for the eastern coast of North Carolina from Cape Lookout northward to Currituck Beach Lighthouse When a more northeastward track became apparent a tropical storm watch was issued about 33 hours before moving ashore from Woods Hole to Plymouth Massachusetts including Cape Cod Nantucket and Marthas Vineyard About 22 hours before landfall the National Hurricane Center replaced the watch with a tropical storm warning for the same area and also issued a tropical storm watch from Woods Hole Massachusetts westward to New Haven Connecticut and for the eastern portion of Long Island from east of Fire Island to Port Jefferson Expecting for the storm the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency was activated as a trial run for the hurricane season Local Red Cross chapters were opened as well with two volunteer teams placed on standby to assist Across southeastern Massachusetts police departments maintained extra staff in preparation for any potential problems from the storm Many fishermen secured their boats while some business owners boarded up windows to prevent storm damage

Several days prior to the passage of Beryl through Atlantic Canada the Canadian Hurricane Centre issued gale warnings for the coastal waters off of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland In anticipation of heavy rainfall the agency also issued heavy rainfall warnings for western Nova Scotia including Halifax

The storm caused high waves along the East Coast of the United States with 19 foot seas in the open ocean Waves along the southern coast of Nantucket reached 10 feet in height as the storm approached the island resulting in four people being rescued by lifeguards from rip currents High surf was also reported along the southern coast of Massachusetts and Rhode Island Beryl also produced a storm surge of 09 feet on Nantucket Winds across southeastern Massachusetts were fairly light with no sustained tropical storm force winds and wind gusts peaking at 44 mph unofficially gusts reached 51 mph

Beryl dropped moderate precipitation just offshore though the maximum precipitation total in the United States was only 097 inches on Nantucket Rainfall along southeastern Massachusetts reached 033 inches at Chatham The only reported damage were some downed telephone poles and fallen tree branches Overall impact was minor there were no reported power outages deaths injuries or maritime emergencies in association with the storm

The remnants of Beryl dropped moderate precipitation in Atlantic Canada officially peaking at 28 inches in Scotts Bay Nova Scotia with an unofficially higher total of 35 inches in some locations 1 inch of rain fell in an hour Additionally a station in Fredericton New Brunswick reported 177 inches in 2 hours The rainfall caused some flooding with some overflown streams flooding some streets Moderate winds were reported along its path which peaked at 60 mph in southern Nova Scotia The winds downed some tree limbs and led to some power outages Overall damage was minor

The 1991 Halloween Noreaster also known as the Perfect Storm was an atypical noreaster which was extratropical absorbed one hurricane and ultimately evolved into a small hurricane late in its life cycle The unnamed hurricane of 1991 was the last tropical cyclone of the 1991 Atlantic hurricane season and its 4th hurricane By November 2 Atlantic Canada experienced the effects of a landfalling tropical storm Damage totaled 208 million and deaths climbed to 12 people Most of the damage occurred while the storm was extratropical The hurricane was the second costliest storm of the season behind only Hurricane Bob

A noreaster is a big storm along the East Coast of the United States A Noreaster is called that because the winds in a Noreaster come from the northeast especially in the coastal areas of the Northeastern United States and Atlantic Canada More specifically it is a low pressure area whose center of rotation is just off the East Coast and whose leading winds in the left forward quadrant rotate onto land from the northeast The precipitation pattern is similar to other extratropical storms Noreasters also can cause coastal flooding coastal erosion hurricane force winds and heavy snow Noreasters are associated with warm fronts cold fronts or occluded fronts Noreasters can occur at any time of the year but are mostly known for their presence in the winter Noreasters can be devastating and damaging especially in the winter months when most damage and deaths are from the cold Noreasters bring very cold air down from the Arctic Noreasters thrive on the converging air masses that is the polar cold air mass and the warmer ocean water of the Gulf Stream Noreasters will usually develop between 30 N and 35 N

The East Coast of the United States is a part of the United States It is also called the Eastern Seaboard or Atlantic Seaboard The East Coast refers or talks about the farthest east states of the US These states touch the Atlantic Ocean all the way up to Canada It is usually used to talk about the northern half of this region the thirteen original states plus Maine and Washington DC The southern half of this region is more often thought to be the South or Southeast

 Cape Lookout is southern point of the South Core Banks one of the natural barrier islands on the Atlantic coast of North Carolina USA It delimits Onslow Bay to the west from Raleigh Bay to the east An area of the banks to either side of it has been designated the Cape Lookout National Seashore

Cape Lookout stands at 343619N 763210W and is part of Carteret County 11 miles southeast of Beaufort NC

Marthas Vineyard is an island off the southern coast of Cape Cod both forming a part of the Outer Lands region It is often called just the Vineyard With a land area of 8748 square miles Marthas Vineyard is the 57th largest island in the United States It is located in the US state of Massachusetts in Dukes County which also includes Cuttyhunk and the other Elizabeth Islands as well as the island of Nomans Land

Carcinogens are substances that cause cancer Sometimes radiation or radionuclide are also considered carcinogens A common example of a carcinogen is tobacco smoke

Several radioactive substances are considered carcinogens The carcinogens in them are caused by the radiation they release such as gamma rays or alpha particles 

CERCLA says that all radionuclides are carcinogens How much of a carcinogen a radiation is depends on the type of radiation the type of exposure to it and its penetration For example alpha radiation has low penetration and is not a danger outside the body Alpha radiation is a carcinogen when breathed in or eaten

Thorotrast previously used in x rays is a human carcinogen Marie Curie one of the pioneers of radioactivity died of a cancer that was caused by the radiation she was exposed to during her experiments

Not all types of electromagnetic radiation are carcinogenic Radio waves microwave radiation infrared radiation and visible light are examples of this Higher energy radiation including ultraviolet radiation usually is carcinogenic if a person is exposed to it long enough

Recent research has shown that when food is cooked at high temperatures carcinogens may be formed in very small amounts Pre cooking meats in a microwave oven for 2 3 minutes before broiling shortens the time on the hot pan This could help stop the carcinogens from being made Certain kinds of foods like potato chips and French fries may have higher levels of carcinogens than others The charred residue on barbecued meats is a carcinogen too

This does not mean eating cooked foods is dangerous The gastrointestinal tract sheds its outer layer continuously to protect itself from carcinomas Because of this it has a good chance of shedding bad enzymes that could cause cancer

Foods that have been microwaved are not carcinogenic factdateJuly 2010 No radiation remains the same way no light remains in a lens

The A 10 Thunderbolt II is an attack aircraft made by Fairchild Aircraft It first flew in 1972 and was introduced in 1977 It is designed to drop bombs fire rockets missiles and its Gatling Gun at enemies on the ground It is named after the World War II P 47 Thunderbolt It is not as fast as most military jets but it is tough and can turn well The A 10 is also used as a CAS aircraft which involves flying slowly over a target area and destroying any targets in that area

The A 10 is 53 feet 4 inches long 14 feet 8 inches high has a wingspan of 57 feet 6 inches can go 420 miles per hour and can weigh 51000 pounds at heaviest It is armed with a GAU 8 Gatling gun and can have thousands of pounds of bombs or missiles It can also carry radar jamming pods so it cannot be seen on radar and chaff which can confuse missiles fired at the A 10 

While the A 10 has a lot of room on its wings to carry bombs and missiles its main weapon is the gun called the GAU 8 Avenger It is a very long and heavy gun called a Gatling cannon since it is a both an autocannon and Gatling gun The Avenger is so big that the A 10 had to be built around it which created the joke that the A 10 does not have a gun attached like other warplanes but it is the Avenger that has a plane attached The A 10 is the only airplane to use the Avenger other American planes instead use the smaller Vulcan which is also a Gatling cannon but with a smaller bullet

Because the Avenger fires such big bullets at such a fast speed many believe it can destroy any target very easily even tanks with thick armour such as the M1 Abrams This is wrong The bullet can go through thin metal on a car or truck but it cannot against the thick metal covering a tank It can only destroy them because most tanks only have thin metal on their top to make them lighter If an A 10 manages to shoot there then it is bad for the tank but if it shoots the front or side where the metal is thicker then the tank will not be damaged

Ulysses is a novel by James Joyce The complete book was first published in 1922 although parts of it had appeared elsewhere earlier

The story takes place on June 16 1904 and is about a man named Leopold Bloom who walks around Dublin The book also tells the story of Molly Bloom his wife and of Stephen Dedalus a school teacher

The book became famous for several reasons but mainly because it is written in a new style called stream of consciousness The book is now thought to be an important book of modernist literature Many professors and teachers teach this book in universities and colleges

Joyce first encountered Odysseus in Charles Lambs Adventures of Ulysses  an adaptation of the Odyssey for children which seemed to establish the Roman name in Joyces mind At school he wrote an essay on Ulysses as his favourite hero Joyce told Frank Budgen that he considered Ulysses the only all round character in literature He thought about calling Dubliners by the name Ulysses in Dublin but the idea grew from a story in Dubliners in 1906 to a short book in 1907 to the vast novel which he began writing in 1914

A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is a novel written by the Irish writer James Joyce It was first printed as a book in 1916 It tells the story of Stephen Dedalus a young man who is trying to be an artist in Dublin The story begins from his childhood and ends with him deciding to go to Paris and leave Dublin his hometown to become an artist

The book is written in a new style of writing called stream of consciousness Therefore the beginning of the book is very simple while the later parts become less simple It shows how when a person grows up the language he or she uses becomes more and more complex

Finnegans Wake is the last book written by the Irish writer James Joyce It was published in 1939

He started to work on this book in 1924 and published parts of it under the titles A New Unnamed Work and Work in Progress He did not complete until seventeen years later in 1939 During this time he faced many hardships such as having no money eye problems and family problems

Finnegans Wake is a very hard book to read even for people who read a lot of literature because Joyce uses several languages and creates new words that come from combinations of old and new English and other languages as well 

It can be understood as the story of Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker and his family But it is an experiment more than a story

Freerunning sleep can be sleep which is not adjusted entrained to the 24 hour cycle in nature Sleep which is entrained to 24 hours but is not artificially regulated by alarm clocks etc can also be called freerunning sleep

Animals which are kept in a laboratory for research in constant conditions that is in constant light or constant dark will freerun They live by their built in circadian rhythms Each day will be a little bit shorter or a little bit longer than 24 hours It will be shorter if the animals natural cycle is less than 24 hours long The animals sleep and are active as usual but their timing gets to be farther and farther off

Scientists let the animals freerun and then do experiments to see what sort of signals are most effective at entraining them They also experiment to see how long or short a cycle that animal can be entrained to Some animals can be entrained to a 22 hour day but they can not be entrained to a 20 hour day

Light is the most effective signal Some animals are quite easily entrained by the timing of meals Exercise is a signal for some animals Heat is not effective

Sometimes people stay in a laboratory for a few days in very low light without any knowledge of the time Such experiments show that adults both older and younger have a circadian cycle which is 24 hours and 11 minutes on average

Some people have a condition a circadian rhythm sleep disorder which makes them freerun all the time even if they get out into daylight and eat regular meals Many of these people are blind but some of them can see They have a long circadian cycle and they do not entrain Scientists do not yet know why

Some people believe they will be more healthy if they do not sleep on a regular schedule They try to go to bed only when they are sleepy They do not use alarm clocks They call this freerunning but since they are exposed to daylight and dark its not the same as freerunning as the scientists use the term

Religious debates over the Harry Potter series of books by J K Rowling are usually because people say the books have occult or Satanic parts These sayings come from some Protestant Catholic and Orthodox Christians It also comes from Muslims who argue against the series

A great number of people have replied to these claims People who support the series say that the magic in Harry Potter is not really like occultism They say it is more like fairy tales like Cinderella and Snow White They also suggest that it is more like the works of C S Lewis and J R R Tolkien Both writers are known for writing fantasy novels with Christian values Some argue that the Harry Potter novels try hard not to discuss religion at all

In the United States people tried to get the books banned in schools Their argument was that witchcraft is a registered religion so letting the books in schools went against the separation of church and state This then went to court to decide whether it was against the freedom of religion

However sometimes religion has supported the Harry Potter series At least as much as theyve been attacked from a theological point of view says Rowling the books have been lauded and taken into pulpit and most interesting and satisfying for me its been by several different faiths

Harry James Potter is the main character and the main protagonist of J K Rowlings Harry Potter fantasy series The books cover seven years in the life of the orphan who on his 11th birthday learns he is a wizard and the son of magical parents Lily and James Potter He goes to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to learn magic Harry soon learns that he is already famous in the world of wizards He also learns that his fate is connected to Lord Voldemort Voldemort was the evil wizard who killed Harrys parents but was believed to have died when he tried to use the Killing Curse on the baby Harry Rowling said that the idea for the Harry Potter character came to her while waiting for a train in 1990 She decided to make him an orphan following the death of her mother

According to author J K Rowling the idea for both the Harry Potter books and the character came while waiting for a delayed train from Manchester to London in 1990 JK Rowling said that in the hours she waited her idea for this scrawny black haired bespectacled boy who didnt know he was a wizard became more and more real to me Rowling also decided to make Harry an orphan at a boarding school called Hogwarts She explained Harry HAD to be an orphan  so that hes a free agent with no fear of letting down his parents disappointing them Hogwarts HAS to be a boarding school  half the important stuff happens at night Then theres the security Having a child of my own reinforces my belief that children above all want security and thats what Hogwarts offers Harry

The death of her mother on December 30 1990 led Rowling to write Harry Potter as a boy longing for his dead parents His pain became more deeper more real than in earlier versions because she related to it herself In a 2000 interview with The Guardian Rowling also said that the character of Wart in TH Whites novel The Sword In the Stone is Harrys spiritual ancestor In that book a boy called Wart meets the mysterious sorcerer Merlyn Merlyn helps the child grow into a noble powerful warrior who later becomes King Arthur She also said that Harry was born on 31 July and has the same birthday as herself However she says Harry is not directly based on any real life character he came just out of a part of me

Harry first appears in Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone as the books protagonist or main character When Harry was a little over one year old his parents were killed by the powerful Dark Wizard Lord Voldemort Harry survived Voldemorts Killing Curse after his mother died to protect him The Curse was turned back at Voldemort and ripped his soul from his body Because of this Harry has a lightning bolt shaped scar on his forehead Rowling has said that creating the story about Harry Potters past was a matter of reverse planning The basic idea is that Harry didnt know he was a wizard and so then I kind of worked backwards from that position to find out how that could be that he wouldnt know what he was When he was one year old the most evil wizard in hundreds of years attempted to kill him He killed Harrys parents and then he tried to kill Harry  he tried to curse him Harry has to find out before we find out And  so  but for some mysterious reason the curse didnt work on Harry So hes left with this lightning bolt shaped scar on his forehead and the curse rebounded upon the evil wizard who has been in hiding ever since

Harry is written as an orphan living unhappily with his only family left the cruel Dursleys On his eleventh birthday Harry finds that he is a wizard when Rubeus Hagrid tells him that he is to go Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry There he learns about his parents and his connection to the Dark Lord He is sorted into Gryffindor House by the Sorting Hat and becomes friends with classmates Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger Near the end of his first year at Hogwarts he stops Voldemorts attempt to steal the Philosophers Stone He also forms rivalries with characters Draco Malfoy a classmate from an elitist wizard family and the Potions teacher and head of Slytherin House Severus Snape Both feuds continue throughout the series In a 1999 interview Rowling stated that Draco is based on several schoolyard bullies she had known and Snape on a teacher of hers who abused his power

Rowling has said that the Mirror of Erised chapter in Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone is her favourite The mirror reflects Harrys deepest desire namely to see his dead parents Her favourite funny scene is when Harry accidentally sets a boa constrictor free from the zoo in the horrified Dursleys presence

In the second book Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Rowling pits Harry against Tom Marvolo Riddle a memory of Lord Voldemort locked up in a secret diary that Rons younger sister Ginny Weasley finds in a bathroom When mudblood students are found being petrified many think that Harry may be the one behind the attacks making him become more detached from his classmates At the height of the book Ginny Weasley is found to be missing To rescue her Harry battles Riddle and the monster he controls that is hidden in the Chamber of Secrets 

In the third book called Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Rowling uses time travel as the basis for the book Harry learns that his parents were sold out to Lord Voldemort by their friend Peter Pettigrew also accused of framing Harrys godfather Sirius Black for crimes he didnt make locking him up in the wizarding prison Azkaban When Black escapes to find revenge Harry and Hermione use a Time Turner to save him and a hippogriff named Buckbeak Pettigrew and the truth escape from Sirius causing him to be on the run from the authorities

In the previous books Harry is written as a child but Rowling states that in the fourth novel Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Harrys horizons are literally and metaphorically widening as he grows older Harrys developing maturity becomes apparent when he becomes interested in Cho Chang a pretty Ravenclaw student Tension mounts however when Harry is mysteriously chosen by the Goblet of Fire to compete in the dangerous Triwizard Tournament even though another Hogwarts champion Cedric Diggory was already selected It is actually an elaborate scheme by Lord Voldemort to lure Harry into a deadly trap During the Tournaments final challenge Harry and Cedric are teleported to a graveyard Cedric is killed and Lord Voldemort aided by Peter Pettigrew uses Harrys blood in a gruesome ritual to resurrect Voldemorts body When Harry duels Voldemort their wands magical streams connect forcing the spirit echoes of Voldemorts victims including Cedric and James and Lily Potter to be expelled from his wand The spirits shortly protect Harry as he escapes to Hogwarts with Cedrics body For Rowling this scene is important because it shows how Harry is brave and by finding Cedrics corpse he demonstrates selflessness and compassion Says Rowling He wants to save Cedrics parents additional pain She added that preventing Cedric Diggorys body from falling into Voldemorts hands is based on the classic scene in the Iliad where Achilles finds the body of his best friend Patroclus from the hands of Hector The author said That Iliad scene really really REALLY moved me when I read that when I was 19 The idea of the desecration of a body a very ancient idea I was thinking of that when Harry saved Cedrics body She also said that she cried while writing the scene when Harrys dead parents are drawn from Voldemorts wand the first time she cried while penning her story

In the fifth book Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix the Ministry of Magic has been waging a smear campaign against Harry and Dumbledore disputing their claims that Voldemort has returned A new character is introduced when the Ministry of Magic appoints Dolores Umbridge as the latest Hogwarts Defence Against the Dark Arts instructor Because the paranoid Ministry thinks that Dumbledore is building a wizard army to overthrow them Umbridge decides not to teach students real defensive magic She gradually gains more power eventually seizing control of the school As a result Harrys growing angry and erratic behaviour nearly estranges him from Ron and Hermione Rowling says she put Harry through extreme emotional stress to show his emotional vulnerability and humanitya contrast to his nemesis Voldemort Harry is a very human hero and this is obviously a contrast between him as a very human hero and Voldemort who has deliberately dehumanised himself And Harry therefore did have to reach a point where he did almost break down and say he didnt want to play anymore he didnt want to be the hero anymore and hed lost too much And he didnt want to lose anything else So that Phoenix was the point at which I decided he would have his breakdown At Hermiones urging Harry secretly teaches his classmates real defensive magic to thwart Umbridge and the Ministry but their meetings are found and Dumbledore is ousted as Headmaster Harry suffers another emotional blow when his godfather Sirius Black is killed during a battle with Death Eaters at the Department of Mysteries but Harry ultimately defeats Voldemorts plan to steal an important prophecy and helps uncover Umbridges sinister motives Rowling stated And now he Harry will rise from the ashes strengthened A sideplot of Order of the Phoenix involves Harrys romance with Cho Chang but the relationship quickly unravels Says Rowling They were never going to be happy it was better that it ended early 

In the sixth book Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince Harry enters a tumultuous puberty that Rowling says is based on her and her younger sisters own difficult teenage years Rowling also made an intimate statement about Harrys personal life Because of the demands of the adventure that Harry is following he has had less sexual experience than boys of his age might have had This inexperience with romance was a factor in Harrys failed relationship with Cho Chang Now his thoughts concern Ginny Weasley Rons sister a vital plot point in the last chapter when Harry ends their budding romance to protect her from Voldemort 

A new character appears when former Hogwarts Potions master Horace Slughorn returns to replace Severus Snape who takes over the Defence Against the Dark Arts post Harry excels in Potions by using an old textbook once belonging to a talented student known only as The Half Blood Prince The book contains many handwritten notes revisions and new spells Hermione however believes Harry using it is cheating Through private meetings with Dumbledore Harry learns about Lord Voldemorts orphaned youth his rise to power and how he splintered his soul into Horcruxes to achieve immortality Two Horcruxes have been destroyed and Harry and Dumbledore locate another although it is a fake When Death Eaters invade Hogwarts Snape kills Dumbledore As Snape escapes he proclaims that he is the Half Blood PrinceHarrys admired mentor is actually his hated enemy It now falls upon Harry to find and destroy Voldemorts remaining Horcruxes and to avenge Dumbledores death In a 2005 interview with NBC anchorwoman Katie Couric Rowling stated that after the events in the sixth book Harry has taken the view that they are now at war He does become more battle hardened Hes now ready to go out fighting And hes after revenge against Voldemort and Snape

In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Harry Ron and Hermione leave Hogwarts to complete Dumbledores task to search for and destroy Voldemorts remaining four Horcruxes and then find and kill the Dark Lord The three put themselves against Voldemorts newly formed totalitarian police state an action that tests Harrys courage and moral character According to JK Rowling a telling scene in which Harry uses Cruciatus and Imperius on Voldemorts servants shows a side to Harry that is flawed and mortal However she explains that He is also in an extreme situation and attempting to defend somebody very good against a violent and murderous opponent

Harry comes to recognise that his own single mindedness makes him predictable to his enemies and often clouds his perceptions When Severus Snape is killed by Voldemort later in the story Harry realises that Snape was not the traitorous murderer he believed him to be but a tragic anti hero who was loyal to Albus Dumbledore In Chapter 33 Snapes memories show that he loved Harrys mother Lily Evans but their friendship ended over his association with future Death Eaters and blood purity beliefs When Voldemort killed the Potters a grieving Snape vowed to protect Lilys child although he loathed young Harry for being James Potters son It is also revealed that Snape did not kill Albus Dumbledore but carried out Dumbledores prearranged plan Dumbledore who was dying from a slow spreading curse wanted to protect Snapes position within the Death Eaters and spare Draco Malfoy from completing Voldemorts task to murder him

To defeat Harry Voldemort steals the Elder Wand from Dumbledores tomb It is the most powerful wand ever created and he twice casts the Killing Curse on Harry with it The first attempt merely stuns Harry into a death like state In the chapter Kings Cross Dumbledores spirit tells Harry that when Voldemort failed to kill baby Harry and disembodied himself Harry became an unintentional Horcrux Voldemort could not kill Harry while the Dark Lords soul shard was within Harrys body Voldemorts second Killing Curse also fails because Voldemort used Harrys blood in his resurrection Voldemorts soul shard within Harry was destroyed because Harry willingly faced death In the next chapter The Flaw in the Plan it is established that Harry not Voldemort became the Elder Wands true master In the books climax the Elder Wand disobeys the Dark Lords command and rebounds the curse onto Voldemort killing him JK Rowling said the difference between Harry and Voldemort is that Harry willingly accepts mortality making him stronger than his nemesis The real master of Death accepts that he must die and that there are much worse things in the world of the living

After Voldemorts defeat Harry joins the Auror Office for a revolutionised Ministry of Magic Ten years afterwards Harry is appointed department head by new Minister of Magic Kingsley Shacklebolt Ron who helped George run the Weasley Wizarding Wheezes Joke Shop for a time is also an Auror In the end Rowling said his old rival Draco Malfoy has overcome his animosity after Harry saved his life three times in the seventh book

In the Deathly Hallows epilogue set nineteen years after Voldemorts death Harry and Ginny are married and have three children James Sirius the oldest Albus Severus and Lily Luna

In the eight Harry Potter movies from 2001 2011 Harry Potter has been played by British actor Daniel Radcliffe Radcliffe was asked to audition for the role of Harry Potter in 2000 by producer David Heyman while in at a play titled Stones in His Pockets in London The Harry Potter role has earned much money for Radcliffe As of 2007 he has an estimated wealth of 17 million

In a 2007 interview with MTV Radcliffe stated that for him Harry Potter is a classic coming of age character Thats what the films are about for me a loss of innocence going from being a young kid in awe of the world around him to someone who is more battle hardened by the end of it He also said that for him important factors in Harrys psyche are his survivors guilt in regard to his dead parents and his lingering loneliness Because of this Radcliffe talked to a bereavement counsellor to help him prepare for the role Radcliffe was quoted as saying that he wished for Harry to die in the books but he clarified that he cant imagine any other way they can be concluded After reading the last book where Harry Potter and his friends survive and have children Radcliffe stated to be glad about the ending and lauded author J K Rowling for the conclusion of the story

Radcliffe stated that the most often repeated question he has been asked is how Harry Potter has influenced his own life to which he regularly answers it has been fine and that he did not feel pigeonholed by the role but rather sees it as a huge privilege to portray the character of Harry Potter

According to author J K Rowling Harry Potter is strongly guided by his own conscience and has a keen feeling of what is right and what is wrong Having very limited access to truly caring adults Rowling said Harry is forced to make his own decisions from early age on He does make mistakes she conceded but in the end he does what his conscience tells him to do According to Rowling one of Harrys pivotal scenes came in the fourth book when he protects his dead schoolmate Cedric Diggorys body from arch villain Lord Voldemort because it shows he is brave and unselfish

Rowling also said that Harrys two worst character flaws are anger and occasional arrogance but that Harry is also innately honourable Hes not a cruel boy Hes competitive and hes a fighter He doesnt just lie down and take abuse But he does have native integrity which makes him a hero to me Hes a normal boy but with those qualities most of us really admire After the seventh book Rowling commented that Harry has the ultimate character strength being able to do what even Voldemort can not he is not afraid of death

Rowling has also maintained that Harry is a suitable real life role model for children The advantage of a fictional hero or heroine is that you can know them better than you can know a living hero many of whom you would never meet if people like Harry and identify with him I am pleased because I think he is very likeable

Rowling also gave Harry Potter an uncanny outward appearance Throughout the entire series Harry sports his fathers perpetually untidy black hair his mothers green eyes and a lightning bolt shaped scar on his forehead because of his encounter with Lord Voldemort and round thick eyeglasses She explained that this image simply came to her when she first thought up Harry Potter seeing him as a scrawny black haired bespectacled boy

In the books Harrys scar serves as an indicator of Voldemorts presence it burns when the Dark Lord is near or feeling particularly murderous or exultant According to Rowling by attacking Harry when he was a baby Voldemort gave him tools no other wizard possessed the scar and the ability it conferred provided a magical window into Voldemorts mind Asked why Harrys forehead scar is lightning bolt shaped Rowling said to be honest because its a cool shape and joked I couldnt have my hero sport a doughnut shaped scar

In the books Harry is categorised as a half blood wizard in the series because although both his parents were magical his mother Lily Evans was Muggle born According to Rowling to characters for whom wizarding blood purity matters Lily would be considered as loathsome as a Muggle and derogatively referred to as a Mudblood

Throughout the series Rowling wrote Harry Potter as a gifted wizard apprentice She stated in a 2000 interview with South West News Service that Harry Potter is particularly talented in Defence Against the Dark Arts and also good in Quidditch Rowling said in the same interview that until about halfway through the third book his good friend Hermione Granger written as the smartest student in Harrys year would have beaten Harry in a magical duel From the fourth book onwards Rowling admits Harry has become quite talented in the Defence Against the Dark Arts and would beat his friend Hermione in a magical duel His power is evident from the beginning of the series specifically Harry shows immediate command of a broomstick produces a Patronus at an early age and survives several confrontations with Voldemort Harry is able to speak and understand Parseltongue a language associated with Dark Magic which according to Rowling is because he harbours a piece of Lord Voldemorts soul After Voldemort destroys that soul piece in the seventh books climax Harry loses the ability to speak Parseltongue Harry is very glad to have lost this gift 

According to Rowling Harrys favourite book is Quidditch Through the Ages an actual book that Rowling wrote for the Comic Relief charity

When Harrys parents were murdered by Lord Voldemort they left behind a large pile of wizards gold used as currency in the world of magic in a vault in the wizarding bank Gringotts This becomes Harrys source of paying for all of his Hogwarts textbooks wizarding clothing and spending money

As is the case with most wizards in the Harry Potter series his wand is among his most valued magical items Harrys is made of holly a wood Rowling chose because it is said to get rid of evil It forms a deliberate contrast to the wand of his nemesis Lord Voldemort whose wand is made of yew which symbolises death Rowling states she later learned that in the Celtic calendar a type of wood is assigned to each month and Harrys fictional birthday is linked to holly Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger also happened to get wands made from the appropriate woods identified the Celtic calendar according to their fictional birth months

Another valued and useful possession is Harrys Cloak of Invisibility In his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry he gets it anonymously as a Christmas gift He later learns it was given by Albus Dumbledore who had it in turn from Harrys father

Harry also owns half of a pair of two way mirrors given by his godfather Sirius Black as a means of maintaining covert communications In Book 7 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows when Harry and several friends are captured at Malfoy Manor which Lord Voldemort was using as his headquarters Harry uses the mirror to communicate with Aberforth Dumbledore who sends rescue in the form of Dobby the House Elf

After Sirius death all of his remaining possessions were passed along to Harry This included the Black family residence located at Number Twelve Grimmauld Place and all the contents and furnishings of the house including Kreacher Harry also inherited the remainder of Sirius wealth in wizards gold at Gringotts

Another notable possession of Harrys is a magical knife given to him by Sirius Black The knife has the power to open most mechanically locks and magical seals The knife was destroyed when Harry attempted to use it on a lock in the Department of Mysteries when instead of opening the desired lock an enchantment destroyed the knifes blade

Tropical Storm Chris was the fourth tropical storm of the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season Forming on July 31 in the Atlantic Ocean east of the Leeward Islands from a tropical wave Chris moved generally to the west northwest skirting the northern fringes of the Caribbean islands Chris was a relatively short lived storm reaching a peak intensity with winds at 65 mph on August 2 while positioned north of St Martin The storm gradually weakened before finally dissipating on August 5 near eastern Cuba

Overall impact was minimal amounting to moderate amounts of rainfall throughout its path No deaths were reported

A tropical wave moved westward off the coast of Africa on July 27 At first deep convection was spread throughout the wave axis though dry air greatly decreased the convection on July 28 The wind field remained well defined as it continued westward and deep convection increased two days later along the northern end of the wave axis Dvorak classifications began on July 30 in response to an increase in vertical depth and organization of the convection On July 31 a buoy recorded a change of wind direction from northeast to west indicating a small low pressure area formed Convective organization rapidly increased as it turned to the northwest and the system developed into Tropical Depression Three on August 1 while located about 235 miles east southeast of Barbuda

Forecasters originally predicted wind shear from an upper level low would prevent strengthening and cause dissipation within three days However the depression continued to organize as deep convection continued to develop near the circulation despite moderate amounts of wind shear and the system strengthened into Tropical Storm Chris six hours after developing The convection slowly covered the entire system and by late on the 1st Chris reached winds of 60 mph while passing 50 miles north of the northern Leeward Islands The structure of Chris continued to improve and become more symmetrical and an upper level eye feature developed early on August 2 Outflow improved in all quadrants as well and the storm reached a peak intensity of 65 mph shortly thereafter while located 120 miles east of St Thomas Ins pite of the initial predictions of Chris intensifying to a hurricane as a ridge of high pressure forced it west northwestward upper level shear dissipated the well defined inner core of the storm and Chris started to weaken

Early on August 3 strong wind shear over Chris removed the deep convection from the low level circulation while a building ridge to its north turned the storm towards the west into an area of drier air By mid day on the 3rd the circulation was devoid of any convection within 85 miles while the deeper convection spread across Puerto Rico and Hispaniola Late on August 3 deep convection developed over the center of circulation again though persistent vertical shear weakened Chris to a tropical depression on August 4 Because of computer models predicting lesser amounts of shear forecasters mentioned the possibility of moderate strengthening in the Gulf of Mexico to a 60 mph storm However convection remained minimal and Chris degenerated into a remnant area of low pressure late on August 4 Late on August 5 convection increased in the remnants of the storm and forecasters indicated the potential for slow development over the Gulf of Mexico due to marginally favorable conditions The redevelopment never happened and the remnant circulation dissipated near Havana Cuba on August 6

When the National Hurricane Center published its first advisory on Tropical Depression Three the governments of Antigua and Barbuda Anguilla Saint Kitts and Nevis and the British Virgin Islands also gave out Tropical Storm Warnings for their respective territories When the depression strengthened to Tropical Storm Chris Tropical Storm Warnings were also issued for Saba Sint Eustatius Saint Barthlemy and Saint Martin Three Royal Caribbean cruise ships changed their paths to avoid the storm FEMA representatives coordinated with local emergency management officials in the United States Virgin Islands to determine if preparation necessities would be needed such as hospital usage shelters and sand bags In St Thomas all jet flights were cancelled in and out of the island though small airlines were permitted to fly during the storm Ferry service from Saint Martin to Anguilla was cancelled for a short period of time Saint Martin officials recommended citizens to secure all loose items for coastal residents to prepare for high surf and for construction sites to secure all loose equipment A small craft advisory was also issued for coastal waters of Saint Martin due to strong waves from the storm

On August 1 officials in Puerto Rico issued a tropical storm warning for the island The next day approximately 600 tourists evacuated the islands of Vieques and Culebra Citizens in Puerto Rico prepared for the storm by stocking up on supplies and visiting gas stations On August 2 the government of the Bahamas issued a Hurricane Watch for the Turks and Caicos Islands the Acklins and Crooked Islands Ragged Island Inagua and Mayaguana In response to the threat officials urged citizens to stock up on hurricane supplies while boat owners in Staniel Cay secured their boats in preparation for the storm

In response to the storms projected path into the Gulf of Mexico prices for crude oil rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange at branch offices in London Natural gas prices rose considerably in New York Mercantile Exchange electronic trading on August 2 Anticipation of a threat to supply by a potential Hurricane Chris coupled with high demand during an ongoing heat wave were cited as part of the reasons in the price move In New Orleans officials including Mayor Ray Nagin prepared for a possible evacuation of the city if Chris entered the Gulf of Mexico as a hurricane The evacuation plan included moving all residents out of the city as a worst case scenario intended to avoid a re occurrence of Hurricane Katrina around 1 year prior Florida Emergency Management requested 10 mobile recovery centers and placed hospitals in the Florida Keys on standby for evacuation Officials in Mississippi identified the need for 110 to assist in an evacuation process in case of a possible landfall Both Louisiana and Texas emergency operation centers monitored the progress of the storm though did not execute any preparation action

Damage caused by Tropical Storm Chris was minor and limited to just local flooding

St Thomas received brief amounts of heavy rain with totals of over 3 inches Anguilla reported light rain and wind gusts of up to 21 mph In St John the storm caused peak wind gusts of 23 mph along with moderately heavy rainfall of nearly 3 inches along with reports of lightning near the storms center Though impact was minimal in Saint Martin Governor Franklyn Richards recognized the storm preparations served as a wake up call for citizens who were not ready for the hurricane season In San Juan Puerto Rico the storm caused very little wind or rain Convection dissociated from the center of the storm produced 30 mph wind gusts and over 13 inches of rain in Culebra Rainfall peaked at 309 inches in Fajardo Rainfall from the storm caused the Fajardo River to overflow its banks The overflown waters temporarily closed a highway in the northeastern portion of the island

Rainfall reached up to 2 inches across portions of Hispaniola the Turks and Caicos the Bahamas and eastern Cuba and reached 4 inches in some mountainous areas In Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic heavy rainfall caused severe flooding Las Amricas reported 501 inches127 mm of rainfall from Chris Several people were left temporarily homeless from the flood waters entering their households The flooding left many roads impassable near the capital city and also resulted in landslides The flooding also covered rice fields in the northeastern portion of the country The National Office of Meteorology issued flood warnings for residents in low lying areas and near rivers in the northeast and southeast portions of the country Despite the flooding overall damage was minor and there are no casualties associated with Chris

They also exchange mandarin oranges for good luck

The last day of the New Year celebration is called the Lantern Festival or the Yuanxiao On this day families cook dumplings made of sticky rice They eat them in a sweet soup There are also many beautiful lanterns that decorate the streets in China and Chinatowns Traditionally on this day adults can choose a partner Long ago in China this would have been one of the few days when women of rich families were allowed to go outside their houses with their maids

An angstrom or ngstrm is a non SI unit of length that is internationally recognized It equals 01 nanometer It can be written in scientific notations as 11010 m or 1 E 10 m both mean 110000000000 meters It is sometimes used to express the sizes of atoms lengths of chemical bonds and visible light spectra and dimensions of parts of integrated circuits 

The ngstrm is named after the Swedish physicist Anders Jonas ngstrm one of the founders of spectroscopy who is known also for studies of astrophysics heat transfer terrestrial magnetism and the aurora borealis 

In 1868 ngstrm created a spectrum chart of solar radiation that expresses the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum in multiples of one ten millionth of a millimetre or 1e10 metres This unit of length later became known as the ngstrm 

The visual sensitivity of a human being is from about 4000 ngstroms to 7000 ngstroms so the use of the ngstrm as a unit provided a fair amount of discrimination without resort to fractional units Because of its closeness to the scale of atomic and molecular structures it also became popular in chemistry and crystallography

Today the use of the ngstrom as a unit is less popular than it used to be and the nanometre is often used instead

The origin of life is a scientific problem which is not yet solved There are plenty of ideas but few established facts

It is generally agreed that all life today evolved by common descent from a single primitive lifeform We do not know how this early form came about but scientists think it was a natural process which took place perhaps 3900 million years ago This is in accord with a philosophy called naturalism In this philosophy only natural causes are admitted

We do not know whether metabolism or genetics comes earlier The main hypothesis which supports genetics first is RNA world hypothesis and the one which supports metabolism first is Protein world hypothesis

Another big problem is how cells develop All existing forms of life are built out of cells

The Nobel Prize in Chemistry winner Melvin Calvin wrote a book on the subject that was published in 1969

In this hypothesis RNA is said to work both as an enzyme and as a container of genes Later DNA took over its genetic role

There are some evidences which supports this idea

This idea suggests that proteins worked as enzymes first and after that DNA and RNA began to work as containers of genes

This idea also has some evidences which supports this

Some also deny this idea because of this reason

Beatles lead guitarist George Harrison was pleased to have three of his own songs included on Revolver Taxman Love You To and I Want to Tell You Most Beatles albums only had one or two Harrison songs Love You To did not feature guitars but Harrison instead played a sitar World famous sitarist Ravi Shankar heard the song but did not like it and offered to teach Harrison to play sitar properly Shankar and Harrison went on to become lifelong friends

Early recording studios were not much different from radio studios and the techniques used were broken wikt linkinterchangeableinterchangeable but this changed over the years Recordings could present sounds in ways radio could not carry and radio did not play only recordings so the shift was natural When broken wikt linkmultitrackmultitrack recording was developed in the 1950s radio stations did not need multitrack equipment for example

After effects broken wikt linkprocessorprocessors were developed the natural sound of a recording space was ignored by many new studios The people who operated them depended on effects to create the sound they wanted Today the trend is back toward good natural sounds with less processing

253 Mathilde is a main belt asteroid found by Johann Palisa in 1885 It has a fairly elliptical orbit that takes more than four years to circle the Sun This asteroid has an unusually slow rate of rotation taking 174 days to complete a 360 revolution about its axis It is a primitive C type asteroid which means the surface has lots of carbon giving it a dark surface that reflects only 4 of the light that falls on it

This asteroid was visited by the NEAR Shoemaker spacecraft during June 1997 on its way to asteroid 433 Eros The spacecraft took pictures a hemisphere of the asteroid finding many big craters that have gouged out depressions in the surface It is currently the biggest asteroid to be visited by a spacecraft and the first C type asteroid to be so explored

253 Mathilde is very dark The asteroid has a number of very big craters with the individual craters being named for coal fields and basins around the world The two biggest craters Ishikari and Karoo are as wide as the asteroids average radius The impacts appear to have blown big volumes off the asteroid as suggested by the angular edges of the craters

The density measured by NEAR Shoemaker 1300 kgm is less than half that of a normal carbonaceous chondrite this may indicate that the asteroid is very loosely packed rubble pile The same is true of several C type asteroids studied by ground based telescopes with adaptive optics systems Up to 50 of the volume inside of 253 Mathilde has open space However the existence of a 20 km long scarp may indicate that the asteroid does have some structural strength so it could contain some big internal components The low interior density is an inefficient transmitter of impact shock through the asteroid which also helps to preserve the surface features to a high degree

Mathildes orbit is eccentric taking it to the farther reaches of the Main belt Nonetheless the orbit lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter it does not cross the planetary orbits It also has one of the slowest rotation periods of the known asteroids most asteroids have a rotation period in the range of 2 24 hours Because of the slow rotation rate NEAR Shoemaker was only able to take pictures of 60 of the asteroids surface The slow rate of rotation may been accounted for by a moon orbiting the asteroid but a search of the NEAR images revealed none bigger than 10 km in diameter out to 20 times the radius of 253 Mathilde

Ned Flanders and his son Todd first appeared in the season one episode Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire which was the series first episode The first episode in which Flanders and his family were seen is season twos Dead Putting Society which also showed the first appearance of Maude and Rod Flanders 

Flanders was named after Flanders St in Portland Oregon the hometown of Simpsons creator Matt Groening Groening wanted Flanders as just a guy who was truly nice that Homer had no justifiable reason to loathe but then did It was not until after the first few episodes that it was decided Flanders would be a faithful Christian Mike Scully said that Flanders is everything Homer would love to be although hell never admit it Flanders had originally been meant to just be a neighbor that Homer was jealous of but Harry Shearer used such a sweet voice and Flanders was planned to become a Christian and a sweet guy that someone would choose to live next to over Homer

Neds unbearable niceness has been described as The Simpsons worst comment about religion Although Flanders was meant to be only a character making fun of Christian right he has since become a favorite of many Christian viewers He has been described as The United States most well known evangelical Dr Rowan Williams the Archbishop of Canterbury declared himself as a Simpsons fan and likes Flanders

 The Christian right is the name for right wing Christian political and social movements Though they exist in several Christian countries such as Canada it is most commonly used to talk about the United States These groups are characterized by their strong support of conservative social and political values Usually this comes from a belief that the United States was founded on a strong belief in God and that American laws and policies should be based on what is in the Bible Though members of the Christian right can be from any branch of Christianity including Catholicism the religious right is most often used with Evangelical Christians Fundamentalists and Mormons About 15 of Americans say they are part of the Christian or religious right

People who have been conservative due to their religion have been in the United States for hundreds of years For example the people who put John Scopes on trial would be called as members of the religious right However the term first came into use in the 1970s by Jerry Falwell He and others felt that the country and its institutions were run by left wing intellectuals who did not believe in God and that in reality most people believed in God and did not care for left wing intellectuals The fight between left wing intellectuals and the religious right is often called the culture wars

Though Presidents Ronald Reagan and George HW Bush were elected in part due to support from the religious right the only President who was a member of the religious right was George W Bush

In addition to the Christian right there is something known as the Christian left but it is not as well known or powerful

Here are some issues that the Christian right feel strongly about 

The Christian right largely came back into being in the 1970s under Falwell due to abortion in response to the Roe v Wade decision made by the US Supreme Court Most members of the Christian right feel that life begins at conception killing a fetus is murder and therefore abortion should be illegal in most or all cases This is called being pro life Though the right has not been able to get rid of Roe they have been successful in making it harder to get abortions in some states 

Many members of the Christian right believe that the Bible says it is bad to be homosexual gay or lesbian They used to support sodomy laws Nowadays they are mostly against allowing gay marriage They have gotten many laws and initiatives passed to stop gays from marrying but some of these have been found to be unconstitutional in the courts To make stopping gay marriage constitutional many have pushed for an amendment to the United States constitution to ban gay marriage 

Many members of the Christian right do not believe in evolution because it goes against the creation story of the Bible They instead favor creationism or intelligent design Most biologists believe that evolution is true and that arguments against evolution are weak In a few places they have been successful in teaching intelligent design alongside evolution in public schools

Many members of the Christian right want to allow prayer in public schools and display of things related to Christ in public or government places As with gay marriage this has been questioned in the courts usually due to the freedom of religion clause in the First Amendment

Short subject is a format description originally coined in the North American film industry in the early period of cinema The description is now used almost interchangeably with short film either term is often abbreviated to short Although the North American definition generally refers to movies of between 20 and 40 minutes long the definition refers to much shorter movies in Europe Latin America and Australasia In New Zealand for instance the description can be used to describe any movie that has a duration longer than 1 minute and shorter than 15 minutes The North American definition also tends to focus much more on character whereas the European and Australasian forms tend to depend much more on visual drama and plot twists In this way the North American form can be understood to be a derivation of the feature movie form usually acting as a platform for aspirant Hollywood directors Elsewhere short films tend to work as showcases for cinematographers and commercial directors

Trans fat is an artificial food Most of it is made in factories Trans fat occurs in nature only very rarely When oils are heated or when they are hydrogenated trans fats are made Hydrogenation is the process of bubbling hydrogen gas through the oil to change its consistency The bubbling raises the melting point of the oil As the hydrogen passes through the oil begins to become solid By stopping the hydrogenation part of the way through manufacturers obtain partially hydrogenated oil This is similar to butter but much cheaper to produce It is sold as margarine oleo or vegetable shortening The process allows cheaply adding a butter like consistency to food products

Trans fat is bad for human health and has been tied to a number of problems including coronary heart disease cancer diabetes obesity liver dysfunction and infertility There has yet to be a study which shows that trans fat is good for human health in any way

For now the US governments Food and Drug Administration has allowed makers of food products to label their products as having 0 grams of trans fat per serving as long as the amount of trans fat in the food product falls below 05 grams per serving Since partially hydrogenated oils are the major source of trans fat reading the ingredients label is the safest way to ensure that a food does not contain any trans fat at all Fried foods will likely but not necessarily contain trans fat since fried foods are produced by using very hot oil 

Healthy oils are always liquid at the temperature of blood Saturated and trans fats are not

Now that we know the health issues related to eating trans fats trans fats are being used less but there are still some in commercial food products

The integumentary system is everything covering the outside of our bodies This means skin hair scales nails sweat glands and their products The name comes from the Latin integumentum which means a covering

Skin hair scales feathers and nails make up the integumentary system

There are two layers of skin 

There are four types of glands

The integumentary system has lots of different functions it

Here is a list of skin problems

There are other skin problems that are less common

The auditory system is the sensory system for the sense for hearing

The outer ear is the folds of cartilage surrounding the ear canal They are called the pinna 

Sound waves travelling through the ear canal will hit the tympanum or eardrum The malleus incus and stapes These bones convert the waves to high pressure vibrations They are then converted to nerve impulses in the cochlea

The inner ear is made mostly of the cochlea 

The cochlea is made up of three pieces and is filled with liquid It transforms sound waves to electric signals in neurons

The northbridge is one of two basic chips on the motherboard of a computer The other basic chip is the southbridge and together they create the computer chipset Usually north and southbridge are on different ICs rarely they are both on one chip

Northbridge supports communication between CPU RAM memory AGP port or PCI Express bus and also supports connection with southbridge There exist some chipsets which support two types of RAM memory and which are accessible during transition to new standard 

Northbridge is a basic part of motherboard which establishes speed types of processors quantity of processors and kind of RAM memory Other important factors are for example voltage regulation and number of connectors

Sequencers of RAM memory was in AMD64 architecture shifted directly into processor Other producers also incorporated this change into their new processors

A perspective to the future is SOC With it will also decrease the number of components on the motherboard But bigger chips hold under universality of solution they have more pins and they are more difficult Present high speed buses are series and they decline the complexity In the future we can expect return to the standard interface of other circuits using bus and maybe they will be connected to the single Super IO sequencer Saved lads can be used for another integrated turn like SATA USB IDE SDIO scanner of cards and sequencers of PCI

Appenzell Ausserrhoden is a canton of Switzerland Appenzell Ausserrhoden is in the northeast of Switzerland next to the cantons of St Gallen and Appenzell Innerrhoden

Settlement in Appenzell began in the 7th and the 8th century alongside the river Glatt In 907 Herisau is mentioned for the first time the canton is named first in 1071

The canton witnessed a number of battles including the Battle of Vgelinsegg and the Battle at the Stoss

In 1513 Appenzell joined the Swiss confederation as the 13th canton In 1597 the Protestant canton was divided for religious reasons from the former canton Appenzell with the Catholic Appenzell Innerrhoden being the other half

From the 16th century onwards linen production was established little by little Larger textile businesses established themselves later diversifying into weaving and embroidery The textile industry collapsed between 1920 and 1939

In 1834 for the first time a constitution was adapted undergoing reforms in 1876 and 1908 The construction of numerous railway lines between 1875 and 1913 helped the local industry and the population grew to a maximum of 57973 people in 1910

In 1934 Johannes Baumann was the first citizen from Appenzell Ausserrhoden to become a federal councilor Womens right to vote was introduced in 1972 on a local level but only in 1989 on a canton wide level In 1994 for the first time two women were elected into government The open assembly was abolished in 1997 The right of foreigners to vote is determined by each municipality

The electric eel Electrophorus electricus is a species of fish It is capable of generating powerful electric shocks The animal uses these shocks both for hunting and to defend itself It is an apex predator in its South American range This means that usually it has no enemies except other animals of its own species Despite its name it is not an eel at all but rather a knifefish 

The Gymnotiformes is a lineage of electric fishes Common names include the Neotropical electric fishes South American electric fishes or American knifefishes They are primarily freshwater inhabitants They have organs adapted to the generation of electric fields 

Perhaps the best known species is the electric eel which uses powerful electric shocks for hunting and self defense Other species familiar in the aquarium trade are the black ghost knifefish the glass knifefish and the banded knifefish Gymnotus carapo 

An Electric fish is a fish that can make electric fields Fishes that can generate such fields are said to be electrogenic those that can detect them are called electroreceptive Most electrogenic fish are also electroreceptive Many fish for example sharks rays and catfishes are electroreceptive They cannot generate electric fields though and are therefore not classified as electric fish Most bony fish are neither electrogenic nor electroreceptive 

Electrogenic fish have a special organ that can generate electricity This organ is usually called electric organ It is usually located near the tail of the fish It is made from specialised muscle or nerve cells When the organ produces electricity that is released this is called Electric Organ Discharge

Based on the strength of the EOD the electrogenic fish can be classified into two types

In total there are 348 known species of electric fish in about 56 genera The only known species that lives in salt water are the electric rays with 23 species

Sergeant is a rank used in most militaries police forces and other uniformed organizations around the world The word comes from the Latin serviens one who serves through the French term Sergent

A sergeant in the British Army wears three point down chevrons or checks on their sleeve They usually serves as a platoon troop or group sergeant or in a specialist position

A Lance Sergeant was originally a Corporal doing the work of a Sergeant The job is now used mostly in the Guards where it is given to all Corporals A Lance Sergeant in the Guards and Honourable Artillery Company wears three chevrons and is considered senior or higher up to normal Corporals For most purposes he still remains a Corporal rather than an acting Sergeant In the Household Cavalry the same rank is Lance Corporal of Horse

The official spelling was Serjeant until after World War II although the modern spelling had already been in common use for many years

Gourgen Yanikian was an Armenian author and engineer who killed two Turkish consular officials in California in 1973 His stated purpose was to demand justice for the Armenian Genocide

Armenians hoped Yanikians trial would provide a vehicle for proving the massacres in a court of law while there were still surviving witnesses Yanikian took the Armenian Genocide witness stand accompanied by his friend and interpreter Santa Barbaran Aram Saroyan the uncle of famous author William Saroyan Yanikian told of his 26 family members killed in the massacres and how he watched in hiding as marauding Turks slit his brothers throat Finally he said that he killed the Turkish diplomats as representatives of the government that had massacred his people

He was sentenced to life in prison in July 1973 and paroled in 1984 over the objection of the Turkish government 

After Yanikians death District Attorney David D Minner wrote Looking back I regret that I did not allow the genocide to be proven Not because Yanikian should have gone free but because historys darkest chapters  its genocides  should be exposed so their horrors are less likely to be repeated

In information technologies we use the term DDR2 SDRAM for a Double Data Rate memory module of the second generation This technology is used for high speed storage of the working data

The main difference between DDR and DDR2 modules is that the bus on which the DDR2 memory modules are working is clocked at twice the speed of the memory cells In practical terms we can say that four words of data can be transferred during one memory cell cycle To sum it up DDR2 can effectively operate at twice the bus speed of DDR

For use in PCs DDR2 SDRAM is supplied in DIMMs with 240 pins and a single locating notch DIMMs are identified by their peak transfer capacity

Organic light emitting diode is a type of light emitting diode The part of the OLED that creates light is made of a very thin layer of organic compounds One of the uses of OLED technology is for thin display panels used in notebooks Because of the way they are made OLEDs can be used to make displays that can bend These can be used in many different ways For example they can be used in clothing

In some ways OLEDs are better for display devices than LCDs There are also ways LCDs are better OLEDs can make more different colors at different levels of brightness than LEDs Unlike LCDs their colors do not change when viewed at an angle They are also much cheaper to make Most LCDs have to have an LED or Cold Cathode Fluorescent Light used as a backlight to be visible LCDs also need to use filters to work properly These filters block much of the light created by the LEDCCFL Because of backlighting and filtering OLEDs use far less power than LCDs for the amount of light made OLEDs also react faster to changes in electricity They turn on and off much faster than LCDs

LEDs will last longer than OLEDs This is the biggest problem with OLEDs Currently most OLEDs used in displays will work for about 5000 hours of use LEDs normally work for 60000 hours This may change as experiments in 2007 created a type of OLED that worked for 198000 hours The organic compounds that make up OLEDs are also more easily damaged by water 

OLED technology is currently patented by the Eastman Kodak company and several other companies Because of this a company must pay to be allowed to use it in their product

There are several parts to an OLED

The emissive and conductive layers are made of special organic molecules that conduct electricity The anode and cathode connect the OLED to the source of electricity

When electricity is applied to an OLED the emissive layer becomes negatively charged and the conductive layer becomes positively charged Electrostatic forces cause electrons to move from the positive conductive layer toward the negative emissive layer This causes a change in the electrical levels and makes radiation that has a frequency in the range of visible light

OLED as with all diodes can only work if electricity flows through them in the correct direction The Anode connected to the emmisive layer must be at a higher electrical potential than the cathode connected to the conductive layer for the OLED to work

279 Thule is a very big Main belt asteroid It is classified as a D type asteroid and is probably made of organic rich silicates carbon and anhydrous silicates

The orbit of Thule is unusual It appears to orbit in the farthest edge of the Main belt in a 34 orbital resonance with planet Jupiter Unlike the Hilda asteroids whose eccentricity is fairly common of main belt asteroids Thule has a very low eccentricity  actually much lower than that of Jupiter itself and only a bit higher than that of Earth Why it has this orbit is not clear as is the reason for the absence of smaller bodies in similar 43 resonances with Jupiter

Some astronomers have argued that Thules present orbit is the natural result of the force of Jupiter on a body orbiting at exactly the distance from the Sun Thule does in the same way as the Kirkwood gaps in the more closer parts of the asteroid belt It could thus be that the resonance which holds Thule in a very low eccentricity orbit serves to eject other smaller bodies whose distance from the Sun is only a bit different from that of Thule itself

It is the main member of the Thule dynamical group

It was found by Johann Palisa on October 25 1888 in Vienna and was named aptly after the ultimate northern land of Thule

Mlodie is the French word for melody The word is used in music to mean songs written by French composers of classical music from the mid 19th century to the present The mlodie in French music is similar to the Lied in German music Mlodie is not the same as chanson  The word chanson is used for folksongs or popular songs

In Germany composers of classical music had been writing great songs from about 1800 but in France the mlodie became important about 50 years later While some German Lieder were based on folksong the texts of the mlodies were usually poems by serious poets 

Hector Berlioz was the first composer to call some of his compositions mlodies His Les Nuits dt is one of the greatest of all song cycles Charles Gounod wrote about 200 mlodies He used texts by famous poets such as Hugo

Gabriel Faur wrote some of the greatest of all French song composers He wrote more than 100 mlodies many based on poems by Verlaine

Henri Duparc wrote 13 very famous mlodies although he wrote nothing else of any importance 

Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel were very famous composers who wrote a lot of music including mlodies that are often sung today Ravels melodies are unusual because they are often based on folksong Other composers of mlodie at the time include Albert Roussel Reynaldo Hahn and Andr Caplet

Mlodies continue to be composed today though perhaps the last really popular composer of them was Francis Poulenc who died in 1963

In the French mlodie the poets feelings are often suggested or hinted at rather than stated in an obvious way There is a very close relationship between the text and the melody To sing mlodie really well a singer must know the French language very well and understand a lot about French poetry The rules about singing in the French language can be quite complicated It is important to know when to let the last sound of a word run into the next word Several books have been written about this

Although many famous singers are well known for singing French mlodie the most famous singer from the past was Pierre Bernac He gave many song recitals with the composer Francis Poulenc who accompanied him on the piano He wrote a book on how to sing mlodies

Deuteronomy is a book in the Bible It is the last of the five books of Moses meaning it deals with Moses the Israelites and their ancestors and their relationship with God It is part of the Torah The Hebrew name of the book is Dbariym which mean people of the Word

The book begins with the words Moses spoke to the Israelites in wilderness east of the Jordan He told them that they had been very rebellious towards God so God made them travel from place to place before reaching the land he promised them This was then the fortieth year they travel

Moses told the Israelites what had happened throughout their journey He scolded them for disobeying God who made them go through a very hard journey Moses then gave them the Law teaching them what must be done and what cannot be done These laws were given to him by God The Law warns against worshipping other gods and tells that all Israel every one must obey God alone He warned them against worshipping idols and commanded them to treat the poor the foreigner and the orphans well If the Israelites obey God they will prosper But God predicted that the future generations will suffer because of their disobedience One day however the Israelites would return to God

God then commanded Moses to write the Law on stone tablets for the Israelites to remember Then Moses formally made Joshua son of Nun the new leader over the Israelites God gave Moses a song to sing and asked him to teach it to the Israelites The song would remind them how they have gone against God in the future

Moses was very old  120 years  during that time He knew he was going to die because God had told him it will happen Therefore before he died he gave a blessing to all the twelfth tribes of Israel

Finally God made Moses climb Mount Nebo and showed him all the land he is giving to Israel Because Moses and his brother Aaron disobeyed God earlier on Moses was not allowed to enter the land but just to see it Moses died on Mount Nebo and the Israelites mourned for him for thirty days After that Joshua began to lead Israel under Gods command

SRAM has many differences to Dynamic RAM The first of all is duty to refresh memory many time per second to hold its data contents The second one is that SRAMs are also used for specific applications within the PC where their strengths outweigh their weaknesses compared to DRAM

RAM normally requires refreshing circuitry to keep the information contained on the chip from being lost SRAMs do not require constant processes to keep the contained data intact while the RAM has power 

Changing Static RAM is also faster than DRAM

A SRAM is more expensive than DRAM SRAMs take up much more space than DRAMs That is the reason why is SRAM more expensive then DRAM

Discussion of how processors are manufactured this process is similar for making memory circuits

SRAM is manufactured in a way rather similar to how processors are highly integrated transistor patterns photo etched into silicon Each SRAM bit is composed of between four and six transistors Which is why SRAM takes up much more space compared to DRAM To compare with DRAM DRAM has only one transistor plus a capacitor SRAM chip is comprised of thousands or millions of identical cells Because is much easier to make than a CPU RAM chips are far less expensive than processors

SCSI is a set of standards for physically connecting and transferring data between computers and peripheral devices such as a CD or DVD drive

SCSI is realized by a bus slot on the motherboard Just to put a card called host adapter to the motherboard From this card is a managed data cable This cable connects individual SCSI peripherals Each of this peripherals has its own sequencer which is functional independent Operation on data cable is controlled by the host adapter There is also a possibility to install internal or external components Transferring data on the SCSI bus is managed by the host adapter The CPU is not loaded by transferring data

Each peripheral has its own sequencer and host adapter They can be used for communication with devices by a defined computer language They could also cooperate with arbitrary peripherals of SCSI At present there are hard disks optical drives tape adapter units ZIP drives scanners and printers using SCSI 

SCSI is not restricted by conditions One of the main advantages of SCSI is a possibility to daisy chain devices There is some device on the bus SCSI which controls this 

For example hard disk defines heads of operations etc At the same moment the other device could send data to other devices Operations of other device are not cancelled with origin connection After transferring data to scanner device could continues with transferring data to hard disk SCSI is faster because of this fact even maximal speed of transferring is not so different to EIDE

Each peripheral of SCSI has to be identified That is the reason why every peripheral must have a unique ID This number is set by bond or shunt located on the case of components In terms of a bus is enumerate from 0 hostname has as a rule ID 7 There cannot be two devices on the same bus with the same ID

Buses have to be finished with resistances in terminology called terminators On the last devices is necessary to install terminators

Host adapter has to be in connection with to assign system resources

SCSI has a long progression That is why there are many kind of SCSI in the present day They are different in data width and working frequency With 8 bit data width the parallel SCSI bus can be connected to 8 devices with 16 bits the SCSI bus can be connected to 16 devices

The Near East is a term used for Middle East by archaeologists geographers and historians 

The term Near East came into use in the 1890s when European powers had to do with two critical situations in the east The Sino Japanese War in 18941895 in the Far East and the Armenian Genocide in the Near East 

British archaeologist DG Hogarth published The Nearer East in 1902 which helped to define the term and its extent including Albania Montenegro southern Serbia and Bulgaria Greece Egypt all the Ottoman lands the entire Arabian peninsula and western parts of Iran

The term Far East means countries of East Asia It became used in the English language during the period of the British Empire for lands to the east of British India 

Before World War I the Near East meant relatively nearby lands of the Ottoman Empire Middle East northwestern South Asia and Central Asia and Far East countries along the western Pacific Ocean and countries along the eastern Indian Ocean Many European languages have analogous terms such as the French Extrme Orient Spanish Extremo Oriente Portuguese Extremo Oriente German Ferner Osten Italian Estremo oriente and Dutch Verre Oosten 

Far East is never used for the culturally Western nations of Australia and New Zealand which lie even farther to the east of Europe than much of East Asia

Philosophy is exploring wether scientific results are actually the study of truthPhilosophy of science is the part of philosophy that studies sciences Philosophers who are interested in philosophy of science try to explain how a human knowledge that means all that we are able to understand could be a science what kind of explanation is science and what exactly science could teach us about nature and universe

The word science is used in everyday life language in a lot of domains that do not seem to concern directly philosophy of science For example when one says that science proves something one means that this thing is absolutely true Advertising uses the word science to give to some object more value because one believes that if science says that a product has a certain property then it must have this property

More generally science is conceived like something as a knowledge about the world that we must believe And we think usually that such a belief is right because scientifical truths are proved by direct observation of the facts In this view a scientist simply describes what he observes by the means of his senses that is to say what he can observe in experience

According to common sense then science begins with observations all scientific knowledges come from the facts of experience and theories are produced by the observation of this facts and could then be tested by prediction

Here is a schema of this idea of science that some philosophers call a naive conception of science 

Although the majority of philosophers do not think that this conception could be true it shows to us essential notions of philosophy of science fact induction law and so on The aim of the philosophy of science is to understand what we really mean by those notions and how we could define them for justify the scientifical knowledge

All men can observe in everyday life that there is some regularities in the world or in others words that there is some facts that are always linked to some others facts that are always the same for example 

If such a regularity is observed at all times and all places it is then expressed in a form called universal law A universal law says to us that when something is at any times and any places then an another thing must be For example if fire is hot is a universal law when there is fire in a place of the universe its absolutely certain that in all cases fire is hot

For express in a simple and clear way the form of this kind of regularities that are universal symbolic expressions are used 

In this logical expression means all x that is to say in any case where there is a x x itself is what is called a variable that is to say that it can refer to a lot of things for example some material body Px means that x is P or has the property P and Qx means that x is Q or has the property Q The symbol links Px to Qx and corresponds to the English if then We can then read the expression in this way if x is P then x is also Q

Rudolf Carnap gives the following illustration for understand this logical expression For every body x if that body is heated that body will expand This illustration is the law of thermal expansion Of course this sentence is a very simplified formulation of this law

A universal law can then be describe as a law that says that if there is a x and if x is P then x is Q Such a description is the simplest one but does not describe all kind of scientific laws

However even in such a case a kind of law is sometimes possible Indeed by counting boys and girls we know that about half of the children born each year are girls Therefore there is a measure of the fact that each child is a boy or a girl and this measure is a law that is called a statistical law

What teachs us exactly a statistical law It teaches us that a fact happens a certain number of times what is called a frequency and it defines the probability that the fact happens Therefore if x is a child if we do not know if this child is a boy or a girl however we know that half a time a child is a boy

When we know a universal or a statistical law we think that we have some knowledge about objects of the world Both kind of laws learn us something about what is called facts A fact is a singular thing or a singular event for example this morning the sun rose is a fact and we can express this fact by a sentence When we know a fact we have only the knowledge of this fact in this singularity and therefore such a sentence do not tell us why that is so

By contrast if we know why day follows night we express it by laws Therefore scientifical laws are explanations about facts and by the means of those explanations we can predict some new facts or some repetitions of a fact It can be formalised in this way 

1 is the universal law we want to apply to a a is a particular object

2 means that a has the property P for example we have observe that a is P

3 is the deduction that logically follows 1 and 2 if a has the property P then a has the property Q Therefore if we know 1 and 2 we can predict 3 and explain it by 1

Scientific laws allow men to discover and predict new facts But a more fundamental question for philosophers and for scientists is to understand how we can generalize our observations and if this kind of generalisations that we call laws are really valid

As we have seen for the naive conception of science laws come directly from facts of experience If we observe a lot of times a fact A in various situations and if we observe that all A we have seen have the property B then we could conclude that all A must have the property B This is the basic formulation of the principle of induction

Volterra is a city in the Tuscany region of Italy The city is in the province of Pisa

Dynamic random access memory is the most used form of RAM

DRAM is called dynamic because it must be refreshed all the time or it will lose the data which it is supposed to be storing Thats why it is called volatile If something is volatile it runs away quickly

Refreshing DRAM means reading the data from the DRAM and directly writing them back to the DRAM DRAM is made up of large data fields of very small capacitors Each of these capacitors slowly lets energy out and if the DRAM is not refreshed in the end one or more of the capacitors will let so much energy out that for example a 1 will become a 0 so data will be lost or corrupted

DRAM is often compared to SRAM SRAM is able to store data as long as powerenergy is used There is no need to refresh it SRAM can also be faster than DRAM But SRAM is much more expensive than DRAM Also SRAM heats up much faster than DRAM DRAM and SRAM lose the data when the power to them is turned off

A touchpad is an area that imitates functions of a computer mouse There is no need of an external device like a mouse The user just runs over the small sensitive pad with one or more fingers

Touchpads are mostly found on laptop computers They are also more and more used on devices like mp3 players and mobile phones as well

It is good to have the touchpad because when the user is travelling sometimes he can not use a mouse When the laptop is used at home the user is able to attach a separate mouse

New models of touchpads often have more functions because they are pressure sensitive Many have the function to scroll up and down a page or the volume field Most touchpads have the function of tapping which imitates the left click button on a mouse The user can choose and change which functions happen if the user does certain moves Example The normal function for tapping on the pad is the left click on the mouse The user can change it in the settings section to the right click of the mouse if the user likes it better

Fingerprint scanners are security systems of biometrics They are now used in police stations security industries and most recently on computers

Every person has marks on his or hers fingers They can not be removed or changed These marks have a pattern and this pattern is called the fingerprint Every fingerprint is special and different from any other in the world Because there are countless combinations fingerprints have become an ideal means of identification 

There are two types of fingerprint scanners the optical scanner and the capacitance scanner The basic function of these two types of scanners is to get an image of a persons fingerprint and find a match for this print in the database The capacitance scanner is better because the images are more exact and precise Scanners are used for scanning

There are two construction forms the stagnant and the moving fingerprint scanner

Stagnant The finger must be dragged over the small scanning area This form is not as good as the moving form but its cheaper The image is not very good because maybe the finger is not regularly dragged over the scanning area

Moving The finger lays on the scanning area while the scanner runs underneath Because the scanner runs regularly over the fingerprint the images are better

324 Bamberga is the 16th biggest asteroid in the Main asteroid belt It was found by Johann Palisa on February 25 1892 in Vienna making it one of the last big asteroids found Apart from the near earth asteroid Eros it was the last asteroid which is ever easily visible with binoculars to be found

Although its very high orbital eccentricity means its opposition magnitude varies a lot at a rare opposition near perihelion Bamberga can reach a magnitude of 80 which is as bright as Saturns moon Titan Such near perihelion oppositions happen on a regular cycle every twenty two years with the last happening in 1991 and the next in 2013 Its brightness at these rare near perihelion oppositions makes Bamberga the brightest C type asteroid about one magnitude brighter than 10 Hygieas maximum brightness of around 91 At such an opposition Bamberga can in fact be closer to Earth than any main belt asteroid with magnitude above 95 getting as close as 078 AU For comparison 7 Iris never comes closer than 085 AU and 4 Vesta never closer than 113 AU when it becomes visible to the naked eye in a pollution free sky

Overall Bamberga is the tenth brightest main belt asteroid after in order Vesta Pallas Ceres Iris Hebe Juno Melpomene Eunomia and Flora Its high eccentricity though means that at most oppositions other asteroids reach higher magnitudes

It has an unusually long rotation period among the big asteroids Its spectral class is between the C type and P type asteroids

An occultation of Bamberga was seen on 8 December 1987 and gave a diameter of about 228 km in agreement with IRAS results

Giaches de Wert was a Flemish composer who lived and worked in Italy He was one of the most important composers of madrigals in the Renaissance period

We know very little about his childhood Even some of the things about his adult life we are not sure about He was born in Flanders possibly in Ghent When he was a boy he was taken to Italy and he stayed there for the rest of his life

As a boy he was a singer in the household of Maria di Cardona Marchesa of Padulla near Naples As a young man he lived in Novellara He married there and he had at least six children

Later he went to live in Milan where he had the job of maestro di capella He stayed there until 1565 Some letters he wrote during that time have survived They describe life at the court where he worked

In 1565 he went to work for the Gonzaga in Mantua and became choir master at the ducal chapel of S Barbara where he stayed until 1592 A lot of people were jealous of his good job especially a man called Bonvicino who made life difficult for him It was then found that Bonvicino was having a love affair with de Werts wife so she had to go back to live in Novellara

De Wert was becoming a very well known composer He was offered a job at the emperors palace in Prague but he did not take it He travelled to work in various places such as Parma and Novellara In Novellara his wife was found to have been plotting against the Gonzaga of Novellara She was put in prison where she later died There were long arguments in the law court about who should have her property In the end de Wert was given a third of her possessions and he was given the right to let his children inherit the money

He worked in Ferrara where he had a love affair with a lady who was of aristocratic birth Since he was only a musician he was only a servant so the lady was sent away from the court

In his later years he worked for the court at Mantua where the music had become very good because the new ruler Vincenzo Gonzaga was very interested in music De Wert composed music for the theatre His health became poor He suffered from malaria during the early 1580s He died in Mantua and was buried in the crypt at S Barbara

De Wert wrote over 230 madrigals and other secular works These were later published in 16 volumes He also wrote over 150 sacred pieces which showed how well he could write counterpoint 

His madrigals were very modern for their time The music was very daring in the way it described the words He sometimes used small groups of singers to contrast with one another like a musical conversation  He was a great influence on later madrigal composers such as Monteverdi and Gesualdo

The New Musical Express is an Indie and pop music magazine in the United Kingdom It has been published every week since March 1952 It was the first British magazine to include a singles chart

The magazines first issue was published on 7 March 1952 It was first published in a non glossy tabloid format on standard newsprint

During the 1960s the magazine championed the new British groups emerging at the time The Beatles and The Rolling Stones were frequently on the front cover a lot These and other artists would also appeared at the NME Poll Winners Concert an awards event that featured artists voted as most popular by the NMEs readers The concert also featured an awards ceremony where the poll winners would collect their awards

The later part of the 1960s the magazine began to report about psychedelia as well as the continuation of articles about British groups of the time

In early 1972 with the magazine on the verge of closure by its owners But a new person becoame editor and the papers coverage changed radically from an uncritical to something intended to be smarter hipper more cynical and funnier than any mainstream British music paper had previously been an approach influenced mainly by writers

In mid 1973 the paper was selling nearly 300000 copies per week and was outselling its other weekly rivals Disc Record Mirror and Sounds

The year 1976 saw Punk Rock arrive on the music scene and NME like other specialist publications was slow in reporting and covering this new music phenomenon In an attempt to boost sales the paper advertised for a pair of hip young gunslingers to join their editorial staff This resulted in the recruitment of two journalists who made sure the magazine was completely up to date on this new music style Bands who a few months previously had been criticising the NME were now eager to be included

The magazine also became more openly political during the time of Punk Its cover would sometimes feature youth oriented issues rather than a musical act

Sales were dropping and by 1985 NME had hit a rough patch and was in danger of closing again During this period the editors at the magazine were split between those who wanted to write about hip hop a genre that was relatively new to the UK and those who wanted to stick to rock music Sales were apparently lower when photos of hip hop artists appeared on the front and this led to the paper suffering as the lack of direction became even more apparent to readers

The late eighties and early nineties had a generally weak rock scene in the UK and the paper was forced into giving a high profile to long forgotten bands like Kingmaker and the Railway Children

By the end of 1990 although the magazine still supported new British bands the paper was dominated by American bands because that was what the music scene in general was about

Although the period from 1991 to 1993 was dominated by American bands like Nirvana this did not mean that British bands were being ignored The NME still covered the Indie scene a lot

By 1992 some new British bands were beginning to appear Suede were quickly hailed by the paper as an alternative to the heavy Grunge sound and hailed as the start of a new British music scene Indie however was still the dominant force but the rise of new British bands would become something the paper would focus more and more upon

In April 1994 Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain was found dead a story which affected not only his fans and readers of the NME but would see a massive change in British music Grunge was about to be replaced by Britpop a new form of music influenced by British music of the 1960s and British culture The phrase was coined by NME after the band Blur released their album Parklife in the same month of Cobains death Britpop began to fill the musical and cultural void left after Cobains death and Blurs success along with the rise of a new group from Manchester called Oasis saw Britpop gather popularity for the rest of 1994 By the end of the year Blur and Oasis were the two biggest bands in the UK and sales of the NME were increasing thanks to the Britpop effect 1995 saw the NME cover many of these new bands and saw many of these bands play the NME Stage at that years Glastonbury Festival where the magazine had been sponsoring the second stage at the festival since 1993

The new millennium saw the NME focus on new British bands such as Franz Ferdinand and the Kaiser Chiefs who emerged as indie music continued to grow in commercial success This commercial success has led to bands such as the Arctic Monkeys being both successful in the extreme and being championed by the NME a phenomenon not seen since Britpop

In December 2005 accusations were made that the NME end of year poll had been edited for commercial and political reasons These criticisms were rebutted by McNicholas who claimed that webzine Londonistcom had got hold of an early draft of the poll

In 2006 NME won the CocaCola best magazine this century award

Its first editor was Brendan Fitzgerald Later Anthony Thornton redesigned the site focusing on music news The website was awarded Online Magazine Of The Year in 1999 and 2001 and Anthony Thornton was announced as Website Editor Of The Year on three occasions

It was awarded Best Music Website at the Record Of The Day awards in October 2005 In 2006 NMECOM celebrated with a party at Londons KOKO featuring Leicester band Kasabian and was subsequently awarded the BT Digital Music Award for Best Music Magazine and the first Chairmans Award from the Association of Online Publishers awarded by the Chairman Simon Waldman

In 2007 NMECOM was launched in the USA with additional staff and plans to launch its Breaking Bands contest and the NME Awards across the Atlantic

The site now provides news reviews gig listings and videos as well as featuring downloads merchandising and message boards

The Website over the last year has shifted it focus to also include tabloid gossip alongside its traditional music news With regular news articles entitled Daily Ligger and Tabloid Hell

In 2007 NMEcom had a free download from the verve and it was the first songs the verve released since they got back together

Pedernales is a Dominican province it is in the southwestern part of the country on the border with Haiti Its capital city has the same name Pedernales

It was created on 16 December 1957 It was a municipality of the Barahona province before being elevated to the category of province

Pedernales is bordered to the north by the province of Independencia to the northeast by Barahona to the east and south by the Caribbean Sea To the west Pedernales borders the Republic of Haiti

The province was named after the River Pedernales this river is the southern border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic And the river is named Pedernales because the mineral flint is common in the region

Some native groups lived close to the coast and the River Pedernales before the conquest of the island by European people But very few people has lived in the region for most of its history because it is a very dry region

In his second travel to America Christopher Columbus discovered and named part of the present island including the Beata and Alto Velo islands

Until the 20th century the only people living here were Haitians and many places have French names Sometimes during the Dominican Haitian War Haitian soldiers came across this region because there were not Dominican soldiers The only fight between soldiers of the two countries in the territory of the present province was close to the El Can bay near the town of Juancho on 6 January 1856

Since colonial times the territory was part of the Azua province until it was changed to the Barahona when this province was created in 1881 The dictator Rafael Trujillo created the Pedernales province in 1957

Pedernales has a total area of 207453 km It has 43 of the area of the Dominican Republic and it is ranked as the 7th largest province

There are two municipalities and two municipal districts in the province The municipalities and their municipal districts are

In 2002 there were 21207 people living in the Pedernales province and 14450 living in towns and cities The population density was 102 personskm the lowest in the country

The province is in the Barahona Peninsula Sierra de Bahoruco is in the northern half of the province its highest mountain and the highest mountain of the province is Loma del Toro in the limits with the Independencia province

The rest of the province is formed by savannas and plains of limestone rocks The savannas are close to the coast as the Sansn Savanna in Oviedo and the Pedernales Savanna around the city of Pedernales

Several small islands belong to the province The main islands are Beata and Alto Velo

The only important river is the River Pedernales with its tributary River Mulito The River Pedernales marks the Dominican Haitian border

There are several lagoons with brackish water The most important is the Laguna de Oviedo on the eastern coast and near the town of Oviedo with an area of 28 km On the western coast the most important lagoon is Laguna Salada with an area of 18 km

The climate of the province is tropical hot most of the year but it is cooler on the mountains It is very dry in the savannas and plains with long droughts but rains are common in the high mountains

As in all border provinces in the Dominican Republic there is little economic development The trade with Haiti is important above all in the capital city On the mountains coffee and beans are important products Potato cabbage and other vegetables are produced in the Sierra de Bahoruco

Fishing is also an important activity in the province mainly close to the Beata Island where lobster conch and several kind of fishes are caught

Because of the beautiful beaches of the western coast of the province like Baha de las guilas tourism is becoming an important economic activity There are two of the largest national parks of the country the Jaragua National Park and the Sierra de Bahoruco National Park

The development of the province was produced by the mining of bauxite but since 1984 it has changed to the mining of limestone to send to other countries and for a cement factory

In an interview from 2007 Chris Thile described what he had in plan for Deceiver cquoteI had to get that record out of my system I think I really love pop music I really love well made pop music I needed to try making a pop record before I could move on and do what I really think I actually should be doing That last record was like exploring pop music not as an influence of mine but as the desired result Sometimes it works but that ultimately Im just not a pop musician I love pop music I think its a very noble calling But its not my calling And thats kinda how I feel about that record I feel like I hit the nail on the head about maybe two or three out of ten Which is not a high enough percentage That being said Im proud of that record because I think it helped me get that out of my system I also like the control thing I realized I dont want that much control Thats just too much control for any one musician to have And its not necessarily conducive to the best music making 

All songs on Deceiver were written by Chris Thile

The Anti submarine boom net was used to stop enemy submarines entering Sydney Harbour during World War II The net went all the way across the harbour from Green Point Watsons Bay to Georges Head on the other side The boom was part of the Sydney Harbour defences which also included artillery batteries and patrol boats 

In January 1942 the Australian defence forces began to build the anti submarine boom net it was finished in August 1942 For more than three years entry by boats ships and ferries into Sydney Harbour was through one of three different gates that were a part of the anti submarine boom net

On 31 May 1942 during WWII three Japanese submarines tried to get into the harbour The first submarine to try and come in was the M27 Lieutenant Jahai Chuma was the man in charge of this submarine The M27 followed a Sydney ferry through the gate on its way to Manly but it got caught in the western end of the nets middle section Lieutenant Chuma tried to free his submarine by using a special tool that cuts metal but this only made things worse By 830pm the watchman for the Maritime Service Board James Cargill went to see what was happening He used a boat to row across to where the submarine was stuck Very surprised at finding a Japanese submarine Cargill called naval headquarters with his two way radio At first the navy did not believe that there was a Japanese Midget submarine caught in the boom net It took him two hours to get them to believe him

By 1027pm Chuma knew that he had been discovered so he blew up the submarine using bombs killing himself and his crew The two other submarines got through the boom net which at the time was not quite finished They attacked shipping for many hours before they were destroyed as well

In August 1945 the boom net was taken away By early 1946 only the dolphin structure was left The base of the winch house is the only remaining part of the anti submarine boom net It can still be seen at Green Point

Hair straightening is when a person makes their hair straighter Their hair may be curly wavy or almost straight There are methods to make even very curly hair straighter

There are two different types of straightening temporary and permanent Temporary hair straightening keeps the hair straight until it gets wet or damp again so only lasts for up to a few days Permanent hair straightening keeps the hair straight for up to a few months even when the hair gets wet

A person can temporarily straighten their hair using

A person can permanently straighten their hair using

A hair iron or hair tong is something people use to change the shape of the hair by heating it There are three types of hair iron 

In 1872 Marcel Grateau used heated rods to straighten or style hair 

Simon E Monroe patented a hair straightener in 1906 that was like a metal comb

In 1909 Issac K Shero patented a hair straightener made of two irons that are heated and put together around the hair

Years later Sharrell made heated metal tools for example hot combs The hot metal straightener went easily through the hair making less damage and dryness than the earlier methods Later ceramic and electrical straighteners were made meaning people could adjust the heat settings and straightener size

Another method of hair straightening is Japanese hair straightening which was invented in Japan and works like a perm but to straighten instead of curl the hair It is now given at many salons but is quite expensive and must be re done after it stops working

Some better hair straighteners today have ceramic coated heating parts which harm the hair less and heat up faster than non ceramic coated heating parts Cheaper brands do not often have ceramic but some have a paint like coating that looks like ceramic plating

Lots of more expensive hair straighteners use ionic and infra red technology which helps to keep moisture and oils in the hair and to stop static and frizz 

Depending on the hair type repeated use of hair straighteners like most other heat styling tools can cause varying amounts of damage such as split ends thinning of the hair shaft and even causing hair to become brittle and prone to breakage Generally after extensive damage hair will show signs of dryness and display an unhealthy appearance However many companies such as LOral and Tresemm have began to manufacture heat protection sprays and cream which aim to reduce the amount of damage that is caused by the use of straighteners

Hair straighteners should only be used on dry hair unless they are specially made with vents to let the moisture out These sort of irons are usually called Wet Dry irons

Based on the materials used in the heating plates hair irons can be classified as ceramic tourmaline and traditional metal flat iron Ceramic hair irons are believed to be gentle to the hair

Hair straighteners work by breaking the hairs hydrogen bonds which are what make the hair curly After the bonds are broken the hair is stopped from going back to its original natural curly form The hydrogen bonds can re form if moisture touches them such as water or dampness

Intel Core is the name of a family of 32 bit dual core microprocessors It was made by the technology company Intel Intel Core processors are based on Pentium M technology Those processors are more advanced than Intel P6 processors This architecture or way to build a processor is now replaced by Core 2 microarchitecture In the Core family there are two groups the Duo and Solo The Solo line replaced the Pentium M one core processor

September 2006 and January 4 2008 were times when many Core CPUs stopped selling

Yonah is a company name for Intels first generation of microprocessors for mobile computers The Core Duo was released on 5 January 2006 It was the first Intel processor to be used in Apple Incs Macintosh computers Yonah does not have 64 bit function

The Intel Core Duo has two cores 2 Mebibytes of L2 cache for both cores and an arbiter bus that controls the L2 cache and front side bus access

The Intel Core Solo uses two cores die as a Core Duo but one core is turned off

The duo version of Intel Core has two cores which give performance per watt almost as good as single core processors In computer machines operating with batteries this means getting as much total work done in one battery charge like in old computers

The shortcomings of Intel Core are

Core based processor Intel Xeon Sossaman LV for servers also does not have the Intel 64 bit function All new server systems have support for x86 64 and Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 even requires a 64 bit processor to run

On July 27 2006 Intel released newer Core version Intel Core 2

A geographer is a scientist whose area of study is geography

That is the study of Earths physical environment and human habitat 

Geographers are historically known as people who make maps Nowadays map making is the field of study of cartography a subset of geography The geographer studies not only the physical details of the environment He looks at the influence of this physical environment as well Therefore he looks at human and wildlife ecologies weather and climate patterns economics and culture He will concentrate on the influence space has for relationships between these elements 

The National Geographic Society sees five broad key themes for geographers

The Maltese people or Maltese are a nation and ethnic group native to Malta an island country made of a group of seven islands in the Mediterranean Sea

People have lived in Malta since around 5200 BC with the first people living there coming from Sicily An important prehistoric Neolithic culture marked by Megalithic structures was on the islands which were made a 1000 years before the Pyramids of Giza which means they were very old The Phoenicians in the Mediterranean took over Malta from about 1000 BC using the islands to expand their sea explorations and trade in the Mediterranean until the Carthaginians took over and also expanded in the Mediterranean but these were also defeated by the Romans in 216 BC

Malta was then ruled by Byzantine a Greek group that took over almost all of the Mediterranean from the 4th to 9th century Sometime around this point the Vandals a German tribe ruled the islands The islands were at one point invaded by the Arabs in AD 870 They allowed the people to believe in Christianity and did not have children with the population so they did not change much on the island but they showed them citrus fruits and cotton and water moving systems They hardly had any effect on the island or its people while they were there but one thing that they did effect was the language The Maltese language gained a lot from this

From the advent of the Normans in 1090 to 1530 Malta was part of the Kingdom of Sicily This means that from 1091 to 1530 when the Order of St John came to Malta the original Sicilian population that moved there from Sicily in the beginning got bigger

The French under the rule of Napoleon took over Malta in 1798 The British helped the Maltese to stop the French control two years later The people of Malta were very happy that the British did this and wanted Britain to rule it As part of the Treaty of Paris Malta became a colony in the British Empire

Malta became a separate country from everyone on 21 September 1964 Under the 1964 rules Malta originally kept Queen Elizabeth II as the Queen of Malta with a Governor General working on her behalf in Malta On 13 December 1974 it became a republic within the Commonwealth with the President as head of state Malta joined the European Union on 1 May 2004 and joined the Eurozone on 1 January 2008

Historians and Geneticists currently do not know where the Maltese people came from The answer is difficult to find because of several things such as Maltas invasions with long parts in time where the population got smaller before other people from the Mediterranean moved to Malta and married the Maltese One unusual example of this is the exile to Malta of all of the male population from the town of Celano in 1223 the stationing of a Norman and Sicilian garrison on Malta in 1240 the expulsion from Malta of Arabs commencing in 1245 the arrival of several hundred Catalan soldiers in 1283 the European repopulation of Malta that began in the 13th century the settlement in Malta of noble families from Sicily and Aragon between 1372 and 1450 the arrival of several thousand Greek and Rhodian sailors soldiers and slaves with the Knights of St John the introduction of several thousand Sicilian labourers in 1551 and again in 1566 the emigration to Malta of some 891 Italian exiles during the Risorgimento in 1849 and the posting of some 22000 British servicemen in Malta from 1807 to 1979

Historical and ethnic studies published and promoted by the various ruling classes during their governance over Malta provide little if any valuable guidance on the question of Maltese ethnicity given that their conclusions appear to have been driven in large part by political expediency Hence Maltese history books published during the rule of the Knights of St John at a time when Malta and Gozo suffered repeated razzias at the hands of the Ottomans and Barbary corsairs promoted the myth of a continuous Roman Catholic native Maltese population that somehow survived despite the Arab conquest of Malta and the depopulation that followed Studies and reports published during the British colonial period promoted the theory of Phoenician origins in an attempt to distinguish the Maltese from their Sicilian and Italian neighbours or in the case of the Catholic Church to distinguish the Maltese from the Arab peoples that controlled Malta prior to the liberation of Malta by the Normans  By contrast history books published during the Mintoff years following Independence began to question the earlier beliefs in a continuous indigenous population of Christian Maltese and in some cases quietly promoted the theory of closer cultural and ethnic ties with North Africa This new development was noted by Boissevain in 1991

 the Labour government broke off relations with NATO and sought links with the Arab world After 900 years of being linked to Europe Malta began to look southward Muslims still remembered in folklore for savage pirate attacks were redefined as blood brothers 

This latter development coincided with and reflected dramatic new developments in Maltese foreign policy Western media reported that Malta appeared to be turning its back on NATO the United Kingdom and Europe generally Libya had loaned several million dollars to Malta to make up for the loss of rental income which followed the closure of British military bases in Malta Malta and Libya had entered into a Friendship and Cooperation Treaty in response to repeated overtures by Gaddafi for a closer more formal union between the two countries and for a brief period Arabic had become a compulsory subject in Maltese secondary schools

Some recent studies carried out by geneticists Spencer Wells and Pierre Zalloua of the American University of Beirut collected samples of Y chromosomes from men living in the Middle East North Africa southern Spain and Malta places the Phoenicians are known to have settled and traded According to the study more than half of the Y chromosome lineages that are seen in todays Maltese population could have come in with the Phoenicians As to why there is such a significant genetic impact Wells could only speculate but the results are consistent with a settlement of people from the Levant within the past 2000 years and that points to the Phoenicians 

The Phoenician background of the Maltese suggests possible tenuous cultural religious and linguistic links to Lebanese Maronites who speak a variety of Arabic and are Christian 

This Phoenician origins theory has been contradicted by at least one major study which found that that the contemporary males of Malta most likely originated from Southern Italy including Sicily and up to Calabria and that there is a minuscule amount of input from the Eastern Mediterranean with genetic affinity to Christian Lebanon One of the authors of this study commented as follows on the WellsZalloua study

 We are aware of conflicting conclusions published as an interview in the popular National Geographic magazine Despite an intensive search we cannot find them reproduced in the mainstream scientific literature We consider that data somewhat flawed and furthermore unsound National Geographic is not a peer reviewed academic journal and thus the weight of the evidence is poor compared to other peer reviewed academic journals that are also in the public domain One cannot be comfortable with data that have not passed the scrutiny of peer review 

 It seems to me that the simplest explanation that cannot be excluded by any of the scientific data thus far available is that Malta was indeed barely inhabited at the turn of the tenth century 

 Repopulation is likely to have occurred by a clan or clans from neighbouring Sicily and Calabria Possibly they could have mixed with minute numbers of residual inhabitants with a constant input of immigrants from neighbouring countries and later even from afar There seems to be little input from North Africa 

A permanent wave commonly called a perm is the chemical treatment of hair to produce broken wikt linkcurlcurls 

The first chemical treatment for curling hair that was suitable for use on people was invented in the year 1906 by the German hairdresser Karl Nessler He used a mixture of cow urine and water The first public demonstration took place on October 8 1906 but Nessler had been working on the idea since 1896 Previously wigs had been set with caustic chemicals to form curls but these recipes were too harsh to use on human skin 

An audiophile is a person who cares about how good music sounds on a stereo or other high fidelity sound system An audiophile is interested in how to improve the sound quality of sound recordings such as vinyl records and Compact Discs as well as the equipment used to listen to recordings such as CD players amplifiers and loudspeakers

Audiophiles are always looking for ways to improve their sound system There are discussion forums magazines and clubs for audiophiles to share their ideas 

Some audiophiles believe that differences should be able to be measured in a scientific way This type of audiophile is called an objectivist

Other audiophiles believe that what sounds better or more musical may not be measurable They rely mostly on their own ears and preferences This type of audiophile is called a subjectivist

Audiophile is also used as an adjective in descriptions of audio equipment and recorded music where it is intended to imply high quality

Barbelo is a goddess in Gnosticsm She is also called Thought Providence Forethought or Foreknowledge She is believed to be the first emanation of Bythos

In the Apocryphon of John a writing in the Nag Hammadi Library Barbelo is described as The first power the glory Barbelo the perfect glory in the aions the glory of the revelation

In Buddhist thought bodhicitta is the motivation of a bodhisattva The word bodhicitta combines the words for enlightenment and mind It is sometime translated as mind of enlightenment

Bodhicitta is taught to be the intent to become enlightened not for oneself but for the benefit of all beings

In Hinduism and Buddhism a dakini is a female being like a goddess They are mostly found in Tibetan Buddhism The dakini inspires spiritual practice A dakini is often depicted as beautiful and naked The nakedness represents the freedom of the mind

The Chinese and Tibetan terms for dakini literally mean she who travels in the sky this is sometimes written poetically as sky dancer Their bodies are depicted curved in sinuous dance poses

Dakinis are associated with energy They are linked with the revelation of the path of transformation They help people to change the energy of negative emotions called poisons into enlightened awareness

Images tend to show the dakini as a young naked figure in a dancing posture often holding a skull cup filled with menstrual blood or the elixir of life in one hand and a curved knife in the other She may wear a garland of human skulls with a trident staff leaning against her shoulder Her hair is usually wild and hanging down her back and her face often wrathful in expression as she dances on top of a corpse which represents her complete mastery over ego and ignorance

Tibetan Buddhists believe that a Dakini gave a black hat to the third Karmapa Rangjung Dorje when he was three years old The Black Crown became the emblem of this Tibetan lineage known as the Karma Kagyu

Dattatreya is considered by some Hindus to be God who is an incarnation of the Divine Trinity Brahma Vishnu and Siva The word Datta means Given Datta is called so because the divine trinity have given themselves in the form of a son to the sage couple Atri and Anasuya He is the son of Atri hence the name Atreya

In the Nath tradition Dattatreya is seen as an Avatar or incarnation of the Lord Shiva and as the Adi Guru of the Adi Nath sampradaya of the Nathas Although Dattatreya was at first a Lord of Yoga with Tantric traits he was adapted and assimilated into the more devotional cults while still worshiped by millions of Hindus he is approached more as a benevolent God than as a teacher of the highest essence of Indian thought

Though the Dattatreya of the Natha tradition coexisted and intermingled with the Puranic Brahmanical tradition of the Datta sampradaya here we shall focus almost exclusively on the earlier Tantric manifestation of Datta Shri Gurudev Mahendranath had no doubt that Dattatreya was an historical figure He stated that Datta was born on Wednesday the fourteenth day of the full moon in the month of Margasirsa though he does not mention the year

Dattatreya left home at an early age to wander naked in search of the Absolute He seems to have spent most of his life wandering in the area between and including North Mysore through the Maharashtra and into Gujarat as far as the Narmada River He attained realization at a place not far from the town now known as Ganagapur The original footprints of Datta are believed to be located on the lonely peak at Mount Girnar The Tripura rahasya refers to the disciple Parasurama finding Datta meditating on Gandhamadana mountain

The Tripura rahasya is believed to be an abbreviated version of the original Datta Samhita or Dakshinamurti Samhita traditionally ascribed to Dattatreya This more lengthy work was summarized by Dattatreyas disciple Parasurama whose disciple Sumedha Haritayana scribed the text Thus this text is sometimes referred to as the Haritayana Samhita

The Tripura rahasya is divided into three parts The first part the Mahatmya Khanda or section on the goddess is concerned with the origin mantra and yantra of the Goddess Tripura also known as Lalita or Lalita Tripurasundari The Jnana Khanda or section on knowledge elaborates on the themes of consciousness manifestation and liberation The last part Charya Khanda or section on conduct has been lost and some believe destroyed

Another work the Avadhuta Gita is a wonderful compete compilation of the highest thought given to and recorded by two of Dattatreyas disciples Swami and Kartika Swami Vivekananda held it in high esteem Originally a work of seven chapters a spurious and misogynistic eighth chapter may be a later attempt to append sexual morality to the Natha tradition by a conservative ascetic Some of the ideas in this Gita are however common to both Shaivite and Buddhist Tantras

The Markandeya Purana reports that Dattatreya to free himself of all attachments dove into a lake where he stayed for many years By doing so he also hoped to evade an assembly of Munis who remained on the banks of the lake awaiting his return Datta emerged from the water naked in the company of a beautiful woman The text relates that he made love with her drank liquor and enjoyed singing and music In spite of this the Munis did not abandon him and Dattatraya accompanied by his shakti continued to engage in these practices and was meditated on by those longing for moksha

In the Bhagavata Purana Dattatreya enumerates a list of his twenty four gurus earth air sky ether water fire sun moon python pigeons sea moth bee bull elephant bear deer fish osprey a child a maiden a courtesan a blacksmith serpent spider and wasp The image of the Natha ranged from that of a siddha living in the woods with animals to that of a frightening even demonic being

In The Pathless Path to Immortality Shri Gurudev Mahendranath writes

Shri Dattatreya was a dropout of an earlier age than the period when Veda and Tantra merged to become one simple cult It was men like Dattatreya who helped to make this possible Three of his close disciples were kings one an Asura and the other two both belonging to the warrior caste Dattatreya himself was regarded as an avatar of Maheshwara but later was claimed by Vaishnavites as the avatar of Vishnu Not such a sectarian claim as it appears Hindus regard Shiva and Vishnu as the same or as manifestations of the Absolute taking form

Indeed the Dattatreya Upanisad which opens proclaiming Dattatreyas identity with Vishnu ends with the mantra Om Namah Shivaya identifying Datta with Shiva In the last portion of the third chapter Mahesvara alone is said to pervade reality and shine in every heart of man He alone is in front behind to the left to the right below above everywhere the center Finally Mahesvara is identified with Dattatreya depicting the latter as an Avatar of Shiva

Dattatreya is usually depicted with three heads symbolising Brahma Vishnu and Shiva past present and future and the three states of consciousness waking dreaming and dreamless sleep He is portrayed sitting in meditation with his shakti beneath the audumbara tree In front of him is a fire pit and around him are four dogs These are sometimes said to symbolise the four Vedas

Gnosticism comes from the gnosis which means knowledge

Some religions and sects mostly in the few hundred years before and after Christ are said to be gnostic or practice gnosticism

This is because these religions believe that there is a special hidden knowledge that only a few people may have

There are two problems finding out a lot about believers in gnosticism

Gnosticism says that humans are divine souls trapped in the ordinary physical world They say that the world was made by an imperfect spirit called the demiurge

The demiurge is thought to be the same as the God of Abraham The demiurge may be seen as evil or sometimes just not perfect but doing the best it can 

The real God who is good is distant and not easy to know In order to get free from the material world a person has to get gnosis That is the special secret knowledge given only to a few special people 

Some Gnostic groups saw Jesus as sent by the supreme being to bring gnosis to the Earth

Grigori Yefimovich Rasputin also known as the Mad Monk was not a monk but a Russian religious pilgrim He was believed to have been a faith healer Rasputin played a part in the lives of the Tsar Nicholas II who was the leader of Russia his wife the Tsarina Alexandra and their only son the Tsarevich Alexei Alexei was often sick and Rasputin seemed to be the only person who could heal him Because of this the Tsar and his family began to trust Rasputin more with important decisions Rasputin made some very bad decisions including telling the Tsar to go out and personally lead his countrys army which was fighting in World War I Some Russians became very worried about what Rasputin was doing to Russia with his decisions and killed him

Hermeticism is the study and practice of occult philosophy and magic The name comes from the fact that the first books about Hermeticism are said to have been written by the god Hermes Trismegistus who combines aspects of the Greek god Hermes and the Egyptian god Thoth 

Hermeticism is also connected with astrology and alchemy These beliefs were strong in Europe during the Renaissance The Hermetic Corpus was translated by Marsilio Ficino in 1463 and published in 1471 At this time the Hermetic Corpus was thought to be older than both Plato and Pythagoras

In 1614 Isaac Causabon showed that the texts were actually written sometime between 200 and 300 AD This view was based on careful study of the way language was used in the original writings

Hermeticism was revived in the 19th century in Western Europe The most famous group involved in this revival was the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn

Stonewall UK is a gay rights organisation in the United Kingdom which was named after the Stonewall riots 

It was created in 1989 by Labour Party members who were trying to change section 28 of the Local Government Act Many famous people such as Sir Ian McKellen and Michael Cashman were among those who made it Stonewall is in London Stonewall Scotland has offices in Edinburgh and Glasgow and Stonewall Cymru is based in both Cardiff and Bangor in North Wales

Stonewall showed ideas for change to the government It did not start out as a membership organisation Since Labour came into power in 1997 however it has now become active in developing policy to protect the rights of lesbian gay bisexual and transgender people

Some of Stonewalls best known early work was backing legal test cases in the European Court of Human Rights These included

In the last few years it was successful in parliamentary lobbying Its previous director Angela Mason was awarded an OBE for services to homosexual rights Under her direction Stonewall persuaded parliament to change the 2002 Adoption and Children Bill so that lesbian and gay couples were treated the same as heterosexuals Under its current Chief Executive Ben Summerskill it was closely involved in successful parliamentary campaigns to repeal Section 28 of the Local Government Act make attacks on gay people separate crimes through the Criminal Justice Act 2003 introduce the Civil Partnership Act 2004 giving gay and lesbian couples civil union almost the same as a civil marriage and introduce the 2007 Sexual Orientation Regulations under the Equality Act 2006 to stop discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation

Stonewall helps 300 big employers across Britain by giving advice and support to lesbian and gay staff These companies include IBM Credit Suisse the Inland Revenue and the Royal Navy 

The Education for All campaign was started in 2005 Stonewall and 70 other organsiations help to stop homophobic bullying in British schools Section 28 of the Local government Act made any sort of teaching about homosexuality difficult and the Education for All campaign started after section 28 was repealed

Grass roots activists such as Peter Tatchell have accused Stonewall of allowing discrimination by holding regular meetings of celebrities and politicians The meetings were supported by big businesses such as HSBC even though HSBC is accused of dismissing someone because of their sexual orientation 

Stonewall supported the Civil Partnership bill Many other groups did not and they formed a group called the Coalition for Marriage Equality saying that the new Civil Partnership Bill made a separate yet equal system not unlike apartheid Many LGBT people who were not part of these groups liked the bill and Stonewall got a lot of new members Now Stonewall gets more money from its 10000 individual supporters than it does money from its business supporters

Adrian Willaert was a Flemish composer in the Renaissance period He was one of the most important composers of his time He went to Italy when he was young and spent the rest of his life there He belonged to the group of composers who lived and worked in Venice at the time and who were known as the Venetian School 

He may have been born in Bruges which is now in Belgium although we are not sure One of his students Gioseffo Zarlino who became a well known music theorist said that Willaert went to Paris first to study law but then decided to study music In Paris he met Jean Mouton the main composer of the French royal chapel and studied with him Mouton taught him to write music in the style of Josquin whose music was very polyphonic with the voices imitating one another a lot

Sometime around 1515 Willaert first went to Rome There is a story which is probably true that Willaert was surprised to find the Popes choir singing something he had composed The choir thought it had been composed by Josquin who was very famous by then When the young Willaert told them that he himself was the composer the choir did not believe the young man and refused to sing it again

In July 1515 Willaert worked for the Cardinal Ippolito I dEste of Ferrara Ippolito liked to travel and he often took Willaert and other musicians with him to places such as Hungary where he probably spent two years from 1517 to 1519 When Ippolito died in 1520 Willaert worked for Duke Alfonso dEste of Ferrara In 1522 Willaert had a job at the court chapel of Duke Alfonso he stayed there until 1525

Willaert then got the most important musical job in the whole of Europe at that time he became maestro di cappella at the church of St Marks at Venice The director who had been there before had not been very good so Willaert made the music in that church really great again He stayed in that job until his death He was very famous and young composers came from all over Europe to study with him and learn how to be a composer

Willaert was one of the greatest composers of the Renaissance and the most important composer in Europe between the death of Josquin and the time of Palestrina

He wrote music in lots of forms especially church music madrigals and instrumental pieces called ricercar

Franco Flemish composers is the term used for composers between about 1430 and 1600 who came from the Low Countries These are the areas which are now northern France Netherlands Belgium and northwestern Germany There may be some overlapping

Yantra literally means loom instrument or machine In actual practice a yantra is a symbol which represents aspects of the divine such as the Mother Goddess or Durga It is made of interlocking geometric figures circles triangles and floral shapes that form a pattern Though drawn in two dimensions a yantra can represent a three dimensional sacred object The yantra is primarily a meditation tool Yantras function as revelatory symbols of cosmic truths

A tulku is a Tibetan Buddhist lama who has achieved the ability to consciously determine to be reborn often many times in order to continue their Bodhisattva vow The most famous example is the lineage of Dalai Lamas who are said to be reincarnations of the previous thirteen Dalai Lamas beginning with Gendun Drup It is held in the Vajrayana tradition that the oldest lineage of tulkus is that of the Karmapas which began with Dsum Khyenpa

In addition to Tibetans and related peoples Tibetan Buddhism is the traditional religion of the Mongols and their relatives The Mongolian word for a tulku is qubilan though such persons may also be called by the honorific title qututu or hutagt in the standard Khalkha dialect

The gustatory system is the sensory system for the sense of taste

The human body can be stimulated by certain things This stimuli is measured by sensory receptors and the energy is converted to something our brain can understand There are receptors in our tongue which can measure four main things

This is the simplest receptor found in the mouth

Sour tastes are usually received from acidic compounds

Bitter tastes are important since poisons are usually bitter and therefore we need to know whether or not to spit a bitter food out This is the most complicated receptor found in the mouth

Food which has a lot of carbohydrates such as glucose are sweet

The olfactory system is the sensory system used for olfaction or the sense of smell

In mammals the olfactory system gets smells through the nose When the smell is breathed in through the nose it stimulates sensory receptors These can tell if the smell is new or old

Cipriano de Rore was a composer who lived in the Renaissance period He was Flemish but spent all his adult life in Italy The name de Rore is a proper Flemish name not a name that has been changed to look Italian He was one of the most important composer of madrigals in the 16th century

There is very little known about Rores early life He was born in a small town called Ronse in what is now Belgium It is possible that he had music lessons in Antwerp We think that he was taken to Italy by Margaret of Parma in 1533 as one of her servants Margaret who was an illegitimate daughter of Charles V was very wealthy and she married into the Medici family Rore probably continued to learn about music in Italy

In his music publications de Rore is called a disciple of Adrian Willaert We do not know whether this means that he had lessons from Willaert or just that he learned to compose by studying Willaerts music His first book of madrigals was published in 1542 and then two books of motets were published 

In 1546 Rore went to Ferrara where he was maestro di cappella He wrote a great deal of music in Ferrara He worked for the Duke Ercole II dEste He composed masses motets chansons and lots of madrigals some of which were about things that happened in the court at Ferrara The duke awarded him an important honour Rore also wrote music for Albrecht V of Bavaria who lived in Munich

He left his job in Ferrara and went back to Flanders where he found his home town Ronse had been destroyed in a war He went back to Ferrara but could not get his old job back After another visit to Flanders he returned to Italy and got a job in Parma but the music in that town was not very good For a short time he had a very important job of maestro di cappella at St Marks Adrian Willaert had just died However Rore only kept this job for a year returning to Parma in 1564 and dying there the next year

Rore is best known for his Italian madrigals but he also wrote a lot of church music including masses and motets He learned from studying the music of Josquin His madrigals are based on the style of Willaert He enjoyed writing thick counterpoint and making the voices imitate one another a lot Most of the words he set were serious words not lighthearted and amusing He often used chromaticism He developed his musical style a lot during his lifetime His music was very important in the development of the Italian madrigal and it led the way to the madrigals of Monteverdi

The 1965 Yerevan Demonstrations were a 24 hour mass protest in Yerevan Armenian SSR on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Armenian genocide It is said that this event constitutes the first step in the struggle for the recognition of the 1915 genocide

On April 24 1965 for the first time for any such demonstration in the entire Soviet Union one million protesters held a 24 hour demonstration in front of the Opera House and demanded that the Soviet Union government officially recognize the Armenian Genocide committed by the Young Turks in the Ottoman Empire and build a memorial in Armenias capital city of Yerevan to perpetuate the memory of the victims of the Armenian Genocide

Many committed intellectuals such as Silva Kaputikyan had made impassioned pleas to the authorities in Moscow The memorial on Tsitsernakaberd hill was completed in 1967

Following the example of this high profile demonstration similar protests were made throughout the world in whichever country the Armenian Diaspora exists Since the day of the protests Armenians to this day visit the memorial and make protests around the world to gain acceptance of the Armenian Genocide by Turkey

The Armenian Revolutionary Army was a paramilitary organization Its last attack occurred in 1985

In a message dropped in the mailbox of The Associated Press office in Lisbon the group said We have decided to blow up this building and remain under the collapse This is not suicide but rather our sacrifice to the altar of freedom The group said the attack had been carried out because Turkey and its allies refused to acknowledge the genocide of Armenians

A thin film transistor liquid crystal display is a technology which is used in LCD monitor and television displays TFT technology can be used to give one of the clearest pictures of any flat screen display and it uses much less electricity than older screens TFT displays are very fragile because they are made as thin and light as possible but this means they need far less space than the older CRT displays

TFT displays are also known as flatscreen flat panel and liquid crystal display but these types are not always TFTs

TFT displays are made with a special chemical technology called chemical vapor deposition With this special technology very thin glass can be coated with electrically broken wikt linkconductiveconductive metal and still be transparent Chemical vapor deposition makes the thinnest computer and television display screens possible

Widescreen Displays are becoming the most popular form of television and monitor displays Standard format was the most popular for a long time 

The number of pixels in a display screen is called the resolution The word resolution means the solution of a problem Better resolution on a display screen describes how detailed a picture can be displayed Each pixel is another detail on the screen This is normally described as two numbers x

Most display screens have hundreds of thousands of pixels Each pixel has to be set to the right colour To make a clear picture the screen might need to make millions of calculations Any group of pixels that change to the same colour can be changed with one calculation making the calculations much smaller For example if the picture to display was just a white screen the screens processor would only calculate the colour once and use the same calculation for the whole screen Changing one pixel at a time would take many more calculations If the same picture was shown many times on the screen the processor would calculate the picture once and then repeat it in whatever position and in different sizes if needed The processor can make very complicated calculations but in the end it does less work This is called rendering technology Rendering technology in the most modern displays is like making a broken wikt linkmosaicmosaic

A display with a resolution of 1600 x 1200 pixels has four times the number of pixels in an 800 x 600 resolution Without rendering technology the 1600 x 1200 display would do four times as much work as an 800 x 600 display so rendering technology is very useful to make a bigger display with some of the same parts used to make a smaller display

The response time is the length of time it takes between the processor receiving a signal from the computer or the television station and displaying something on the screen Todays displays have a very low response time It is hard to see response times but they can affect a clear picture A low response time is best for clear pictures when playing games and watching movies on the screen For office work and internet broken wikt linkbrowsingbrowsing a fast response time is less important

TFT response time is measured as the average time it takes to change the pixels from one shade of grey to another shade of grey

Changing a pixel between colours takes more time than changing from black to white on a display screen TFT is very fast for changing between colours which is more important for movies and games

Body dysmorphic disorder is a mental problem where people think they look different to how they really look People are usually said to have BDD if they are extremely critical of their body even though there may be nothing noticeably wrong with it If there is something wrong with their body it is usually so small that a person without BDD would not be unhappy about it at all

Most people without BDD may not like some parts of their body but people with BDD believe that they are so ugly even though they are not that they find it difficult to talk or exist with other people or live normally scared that other people will be mean to them because of the way they look People with BDD often do not look for help because they are afraid others will think they are just vain or they may feel too embarrassed to talk to other people as they think they are so ugly

BDD has obsessive and compulsive parts so it is an Obsessive compulsive disorder People with BDD may look at themselves in the mirror too much or some people with BDD may actually try not to look in the mirror Both of these are possible for a person with BDD They usually think about their body for more than one hour per day and in bad cases can stop talking to other people and may stay at home People with BDD often have very low self confidence because they believe that a persons value is linked to what they look like and because they do not think that they are beautiful themselves they do not think they have much value

Sigmund Freud had an important Russian person with him in the past who would have been classified as having the disorder in modern times Freud named him The Wolf Man to protect Pankejeffs identity Pankejeff was so unhappy with his nose that he could not live a normal life

It is unknown what the full cause of BDD is However research shows that a number of things may be the cause

The chemicals in the brain If the amount of serotonin is too low one of the brains neurotransmitters which gives us mood and pain may help cause body dysmorphic disorder Scientists can not explain this chemical problem in the brain but it may be hereditary

Obsessive compulsive disorder People with BDD also have OCD where the person does things without wanting to If people have had or have a genetic link to OCD the person may be more likely to have BDD

Generalized anxiety disorder People with BDD may also have generalized anxiety disorder This disorder is where the person worries about things a lot which makes them have anxiety about things in their life for example about their body as in BDD

BDD usually develops in adolescence a time when people usually worry about their appearance the most However many people with BDD suffer for years before they look for help When they do look for help to Doctors people with the problem often say they have other problems for example depression social anxiety or obsessive compulsive disorder but do not say their real problem is with the way they look Most patients can not be convinced that the problem they have with their body is only imagined and that they are seeing a changed view of their because people do not know much about BDD compared to other mental problems for example OCD or others

The DSM IV says that a person must have the things written below if they have BDD

A person with BDD will often do these things

Dr Katharine Philips did research with more than 500 people with BDD on the percentage of patients unhappy with the most common parts of the body

source The Broken Mirror Katharine A Philips Oxford University Press 2005 ed p56

However people with BDD often are unhappy about more than one part of their body

A German study has shown that 1 2 of the population has complete BDD but a bigger percentage of people show some of the effects

The number of men and women with BDD is around the same but there are slightly more women with it However the number of men and women who go to the doctor with it are the same

Studies show that BDD is common non clinical places and clinical places Research was done on 200 people with DSM IV BDD These people were aged 12 and older They were interviewed The people with BDD were found from mental health doctors advertisements their friends and family and non psychiatrist physicians 53 of the 200 people were receiving medication 33 were receiving psychotherapy and 48 were receiving both medication and psychotherapy How bad each persons BDD was was assessed using the Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale modified for BDD Symptoms were assessed with the Body Dysmorphic Disorder Examination Both tests were made just for BDD The results showed that BDD is in 07  11 of community samples and 2 13 of non clinical samples 13 of psychiatric patients had BDD Research also found that some of the patients who were firstly diagnosed with OCD also had BDD 53 patients with OCD and 53 patients with BDD were compared to each other in research Clinical features comorbidity family history and population features were compared between the two groups 9 of the 62 subjects of those with OCD also had BDD

In most examples BDD is not found even when people have it In research done on 17 patients with BDD BDD was found in only five patients and none of the patients had a proper diagnosis of BDD even though they all in fact had BDD

BDD can cause only a few problems for some people However for other people it can cause many problems

It can make it very difficult to have a normal job or family life People who have a job or a family to care for would definitely find life easier and better if they did not have BDD The love partners of BDD people can also suffer as they may sometimes lose their loved one to suicide Friendship romance and family is very hard to hold for a person with BDD as the unhappiness with the looks of the person takes over their life so they often do not bother with the other aspects of life as much Also the BDD stops the person from making these bonds with people as they always feel scared about the way they look and therefore find it difficult to be themself with other people

People with BDD may often have little motivation for anything This means that BDD people can appear to take a long time to get everything done However this is not exactly true because BDD sufferers will often just stop what they were doing for a long time so it is not just that they are slow but find it difficult to concentrate on what they are doing without being able to actually motivate themselves until it becomes completely necessary to get back up This low amount of motivation can be in all parts of a persons life for example school friends love family or work

However when the person is trying to do things to the way they look such as combing their hair or choosing clothes it is common for the person to have an extreme motivation Therefore people with BDD can sometimes not feel motivated for anything in their life but when they are working on their looks they will have an extreme motivation that is not normal either

People with BDD have a very high suicide rate compared to all mental problems

Phillips Menard did a lot of research in 2006 about BDD suicides

Some people say that there is a link between undiagnosed BDD and a higher than average suicide rate with people who had cosmetic surgery

Another condition Gender identity disorder where the person finds his or her gender as a male or female uncomfortable often has BDD like feelings that are only directed at the primary andor secondary sex characteristics on their body which disagree with the persons perception of their own gender since birth People with GID may also have BDD like traits or their condition may be mis diagnosed as BDD Most studies reported a pre transition GID suicide attempt rate of 20 or more The suicide attempt rate for patients with BDD is 15 No studies are available showing overlap between GID and BDD suicide rate because BDD is excluded as a condition prior to GID diagnosis 

BDD and GID are different conditions One of the key differences is the fact that BDD responds to psychopharmacology whereas GID does not Furthermore psychopharmacology or psychotherapy are often successful in convincing the BDD sufferer that their perceptions are distorted Those with GID are rarely convinced that they are mistaken GID also often manifests during early childhood rather than during adolescence It is standard practice in treating BDD to convince sufferers that surgical procedures are not necessary because eradicating their first perceived defect through surgery will only make them start obsessing about their next perceived defect whereas those people properly diagnosed as transsexual under GID benefit greatly from surgical procedures specifically targeted at their primary or secondary sex characteristics However a person with GID may also have BDD if they obsess over perceived defects on their body that contradict or go beyond their gender identity 

BDD is often wrongly thought of as a vanity obsession but it is actually the opposite because people with BDD believe they are very ugly even though people without BDD do not think they are There is not usually actually anything wrong with the way the person with BDD looks but to that person there is A person with BDD can spend hours looking in the mirror but they are not being vain as they do not think they are attractive People with BDD usually realize that worrying about their looks so much is bad but they can not help it

Research found that talking as therapy has not worked to stop BDD However Cognitive Behavior Therapy has been found to be more effective In a study of 54 patients with BDD some of them had Cognitive Behavior Therapy and some had no treatment BDD symptoms decreased a lot in those patients undergoing CBT BDD was eliminated in 82 of cases at post treatment and 77 at follow up Due to low levels of serotonin in the brain another commonly used treatment is SSRI drugs 74 subjects were enrolled in a placebo controlled study group to evaluate the efficiency of fluoxetine hydrochloride a SSRI drug Patients were randomized to receive 12 weeks of double blind treatment with fluoxetine or the placebo At the end of 12 weeks 53 of patients responded to the fluoxetine

Body Dysmorphic Disorder is a chronic disease that has symptoms that never subside Instead they get worse as time goes on Without treatment BDD could last a lifetime In many cases as illustrated in The Broken Mirror by Katharine Phillips the social lives of many patients disintegrates because they are so preoccupied with their appearance

Accommodation is the way the eye increases optical power This is necessary to produce a clear image on an object when it draws near the eye The young human eye can change focus from distance to seven centimeters from the eye in 350 milliseconds The eye focuses on a given object by changing the shape of the eye lens through accommodation This is controlled by ciliary musclewhich is attached to the lens 

In geometrical optics a focus is the point where light rays that come from a point on the object converge

In reality the focus is never a point but a small spot called the blur circle

An image or image point or region is in focus if light from object points is converged almost as much as possible in the image and out of focus if light is not well converged

The Old Kingdom is the name for Egypt during the 3rd millennium BC when the civilization of Egypt had its first peak It was the first of three so called Kingdom periods which mark the high points of civilization in the lower Nile Valley 

Old Kingdom was the best by the Third Dynasty through to the Sixth Dynasty Many Egyptologists also include the Memphite Seventh and Eighth Dynasties in the Old Kingdom as a continuation of the administration centralized at Memphis The Old Kingdom was followed by a period of disunity and relative cultural decline that is called the First Intermediate Period by Egyptologists 

The royal capital of Egypt during the Old Kingdom was Memphis During the Old Kingdom era the great pyramids were built to be burial tombs for the Pharaohs Because Pharaohs were believed to be given authority from heaven they wished to walk to Ra their Sun god after death King Zosers adviser Inhotep designed the pyramid hoping to easily reach Ra The tombs were built on the west bank of the Nile where the sun seemed to set For this reason the Old Kingdom is sometimes called The Age of the Pyramids

Khufu called Cheops was the Pharaoh who built the Great Pyramid at Giza near Cairo He believed his soul never died so they stored food clothes and things he owned in the rooms of the pyramid The Great Pyramid is one of the Seven Wonders of the World tall as a forty story building it took a hundred thousand men twenty years to build With only ramps and physical energy they had to move and lift into place 2300000 blocks of limestone that were about two and one half tons apiece Slaves farmers and gangs of men had to work on the Great Pyramid and were paid with valuable things not coins

To guard the pyramids a huge stone statue called the Great Sphinx was created and placed nearby The Great Sphinx has a mans head and a lions body with paws 50 ft long

At last the priests overthrew the Pharaohs Then the nobles and priests ruled

Memphis was the ancient capital of the first nome of Lower Egypt and of the Old Kingdom of Egypt from its foundation until around 2200 BC and later for shorter periods during the New Kingdom It was an administrative centre throughout ancient history 

Its ancient Egyptian name was Ineb Hedj The name Memphis is the Greek broken wikt linkdeformationdeformation of the Egyptian name of the pyramid of Pepi I which was Men nefer and became Menfe in Coptic The modern cities and towns of Mit Rahina Dahshur Saqqara Abusir Abu Gorab and Zawyet elAryan south of Cairo all lie within the administrative borders of historical Memphis 

Memphis was also known in Ancient Egypt as Ankh Tawy because of the strategic position of the city between Upper and Lower Egypt

The ruins of Memphis are 20 km south of Cairo on the west bank of the Nile

In the Bible Memphis is called Moph or Noph

This is a list of formulas which predict textual difficulty

These are method of finding out how hard a piece of writing is

Edgar Dale a professor of education at Ohio State University was one of the first critics of Thorndikes vocabulary frequency lists He claimed that they did not distinguish between the different meanings that many words have He created two new lists of his own One his short list of 769 easy words was used by Irving Lorge in his formula The other was his long list of 3000 easy words which were understood by 80 of fourth grade students In 1948 he incorporated this list in a formula which he developed with Jeanne S Chall who was to become the founder of the Harvard Reading Laboratory 

To apply the formula

Finally to compensate for the grade equivalent curve apply the following chart for the Final Score

Correlating 093 with comprehension as measured by reading tests the DaleChall formula is the most reliable formula and is widely used in scientific research Go to the Okapi Web site for a computerized version of this formula Okapi

In 1995 Dale and Chall published a new version of their formula with an upgraded word list

Uses affixes Personal Pronouns

The Gunning Fog sometimes Fog index is a formula developed by Robert Gunning It was first published in his book The Technique of Clear Writing in 1952 It became popular due to the easy which the score is calculated without a calculator

The formula has been criticized since it weights or uses sentence length The critics argue that texts created with the formula will use shorter sentences without using simpler words

Where

The Spache method compares words in a text to a list of words which are familiar in everyday writing The words that are not on the list are called unfamiliar The number of words per sentence are counted This number and the percentage of unfamiliar words is put into a formula The result is a reading age Someone of this age should be able to read the text It is designed to work on texts for children in primary education or grades from 1st to 7th

The SMOG formula is a way of estimating the difficulty of writing It was developed G Harry McLaughlin in 1969 to make calculations as simple as possible It has a high correlation 0985 or 097 accuracy of the score to the actual grade at which students where able to fully understand the piece of writing

Like Gunning Fog the formula uses words which have 3 or more syllables as an indicator for hardness these are said to be polysyllabic

McLaughlin has made directions for a version which could be done with just mental math 

A nome was a administrative part of ancient Egypt 

The division of ancient Egypt into nomes happened before 3100 BC These nomes originally existed as autonomous city states but later began to unify According to ancient tradition the ruler Menes completed the final unification

The nomes remain in place for more than three millennia 

Lower Egypt from the Old Kingdom capital Memphis to the Mediterranean Sea had 20 nomes The first was based around Memphis Saqqara and Giza in the area occupied by modern day Cairo The nomes were numbered in a more or less orderly fashion south to north through the Nile delta The numbering startef in the west and continued with the higher numbers in the east Alexandria was in the Third Nome Bubastis was in the Eighteenth

Upper Egypt was divided into 22 nomes The first of these was centered around Elephantine close to Egypts border with Nubia at the First Cataract the area of modern day Aswan From there the numbering progressed downriver in an orderly fashion along the narrow fertile strip of land that was the Nile valley Waset was in the Fourth Nome Amarna in the Fourteenth and Meidum in the Twenty First

The nomes are listed in separate tables for Upper and Lower Egypt

The cataracts of the Nile are shallow stretches between Aswan and Khartoum where the waters surface is broken by numerous small boulders and stones that lie on the river bed as well as many small rocky islets 

The six first cataracts of the River Nile were the main obstacles for boats sailing on the Nile in antiquity Counted upstream the First Cataract is in modern Egypt the rest are in Sudan 

The word cataract comes from the Greek word kataraktes meaning waterfall 

In ancient times Upper Egypt extended from the Nile Delta to the first cataract while farther upstream the land was controlled by the ancient Kush civilization that would later take over Egypt

Josquin des Prez was a French composer He was one of the greatest composers of the Renaissance He changed music from the sound of medieval compositions and developed the style which led to the great compositions of the 16th century Renaissance composers such as Adrian Willaert Palestrina Lassus and Byrd

Josquin was born ca 1450 55 and died in 1521 The name Josquin was a common name in Northern France and Flanders at that time It was the name of a Breton saint who had lived in that area in the 7th century The name Des Prez started off as a nickname in the family and gradually it became the family name The name Josquin des Prez is spelt in several different ways in old documents He is often simply called Josquin

We know very little about his life We know very little about what people thought about him during his life although after his death many people admired his music Even his birthplace is uncertain We do not know where he got his musical training He was described as a pupil of Ockeghem but that may just mean that he studied Ockeghems music

We know that he became a singer in the chapel of Aix en Provence the chapel of the Duke of Anjou After the dukes death in 1480 he worked for King Louis XI of France until he too died in 1483 We do not know where he worked after that but he had some music published including six chansons He probably worked for some time in Milan

In 1489 Josquin went to Rome and worked in the popes chapel He stayed there at least until 1495 possibly later There he wrote music for the chapel including some motets His music was becoming well known in some parts of northern Italy It was a time of war in Italy Several times the king of France invaded parts of Italy Josquin seems to have written several pieces for the French royal court including some funeral music on the death of King Louis XII in 1515

For a year he was maestro di cappella in Ferrara He may have left that job because of an outbreak of the plague A few months after he left the famous composer Jacob Obrecht took over the job Obrecht was only paid half the salary that Josquin had been given Very soon afterwards Obrecht died of the plague

From 1504 until his death in 1521 Josquin was back in Northern France where had the job of provost in Cond sur lEscaut which may possibly have been his birthplace The church was a very important one and it had an excellent choir

Before he died Josquin paid a lot of tax to make sure that after his death his property did not go to the local lord of the manor but would be given to his church After his death his house was sold and the money was used for special church services to remember him There was a statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary on the wall of his old house and when church processions passed by they stopped in front of it and sang Josquins motets Pater Noster and Ave Maria

His music is nearly all choir music It consists mainly of church music motets and masses although he also wrote some secular music including some chansons and some instrumental music One popular song is called El Grillo It means the cricket and it describes the sound of a cricket singing in the grass

Josquin was a master of polyphony His name had become so famous that after his death many publishers printed music by other composers and pretended it was by Josquin so that more people would buy it During recent years musicologists have studied many of these manuscripts very carefully and tried to decide which ones were really by Josquin

This article is about cultural information in general For memes related to the internet see Internet meme

A meme is a way of describing cultural information

One theory is that culture develops in the same way similar to living things Genes move from one organism to another as a unit of genetic information and of biological evolution A meme moves from person to person and changes and develops as many people use it

Illegitimacy is a word that used to be used to describe someone whose parents were not married Such a person was called illegitimate The word illegitimate literally means not legal

Peoples attitude towards illegitimacy has varied a lot in different parts of the world In the Western world especially in countries which were very religious it was thought to be very bad for parents to have a child if they were not married It was thought to be a sin Illegitimate children were often called bastards In older times such children were often brought up by other people sometimes by relatives

Today peoples attitude has changed a lot and the laws have changed so that people born to unmarried parents are not discriminated against unfairly In the United States people are not described any longer as illegitimate but as born out of wedlock In the United Kingdom the idea of illegitimacy was stopped by law in 1991 Fathers now have a responsibility to their children even if they were born out of wedlock

Many religions still think that sex outside marriage is a sin although they no longer say that the child lives in a state of sin

After the American Revolutionary War West Florida south of the 31st parallel became a part of Spain while most of the rest was put in the Mississippi Territory The territorial assembly established some of the earliest county divisions which have survived to the present In 1817 the western part of the territory became the State of Mississippi and the remainder the Alabama Territory The Alabama territorial legislature made some more counties

Alabama became the 22nd state of the United States in 1819 The Alabama state legislature made more counties from former Indian lands as the Indian Removal Act took effect and settlers populated different areas of Alabama

In 1820 Alabama had 29 counties By 1830 there were 36 with Indians still occupying land in northeast and far western Alabama By 1840 49 counties had been created 52 by 1850 65 by 1870 and the present 67 counties by 1903

A legume is a type of dry fruit Legumes can be a variety of fruits peas and beans are types of legumes

Legumes grow from the carpel the female reproductive part of a plant The fruit of a legume is found inside a pod that can be split on both sides However there are some foods that grow inside pods that are not legumes

Legumes contain many healthy nutrients such as protein They are good source of protein for vegetarians and vegans people who do not eat meat They also contain fibre which promotes a healthy digestive system However they contain some nutrients which humans struggle to digest It is recommended that a legume is soaked in a weak acid for about 10 hours before cooking to destroy these nutrientsfact Some amino acids such as methionine are not abundant in some legumes but are needed to help the body use protein

India imports the most legumes This may be because a lot of Indians follow the religion of Hinduism which does not approve of people eating meat Legumes are a cheap and plentiful source of food in a country were around 22 of the population are in poverty The top four producers and exporters of legumes are

The USA uses legumes for a variety of reasons and is the highest producer It uses soybeans to feed cattle and make vegetable oil Peanuts are a popular snack food in the USA and these are also a type of legume

A lightning rod or lightning conductor is a metal rod that is used to make lightning strike it rather than strike something else It is part of a lightning protection system Such a system is made of many such rods These rods are usually placed at high points of buildings and structures In addition paths are made the electricity can take from the rooftop to the ground 

Lightning can damage structures made of most materials The huge currents involved can heat materials and especially water to high temperatures This will cause fire loss of strength and explosions from superheated steam and air

The church tower was usually the highest structure or building in medieval European towns and villages It was also the building very often hit by lightning Early on Christian churches tried to prevent the damage of lightning by prayers Priests prayed

Peter Ahlwardts said people who sought to protect themselves from lightning should go anywhere except in or around a church 

In Europe the lightning rod was invented by a theologian and natural scientist Vclav Prokop Divi between 1750 and 1754 He is the inventor of the first grounded lightning rod which he erected on 15 July 1754 in the garden of his home in Pmtice u Znojma It consisted of 400 sharp metal spikes attached at the top of a 42 m tall supporting pylon The structure was fastened by three metal chains conductively attached to the iron grounding cones buried in the packed down soil He described his weather machine in the treatise Descriptio machinae meteorologicae The original idea was to continually sap the electricity out of the clouds and so actually prevent the lightning and the storms only in case this failed the machine should have also been able to directly attract the lighting and channel it to the ground He proposed his machine to be used on church towers and ships He was sending his observations regarding the machine operation to Jan Antonn Scrinci the physics professor at the Charles University in Prague who published them in Prager Postzeitungen Brnner Intelligenz Zettel and in Stuttgartisches Journal The machine is also mentioned by Leonhard Euler in Lettres une Princesse d Allemagne In 1755 Divi asked the Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria to let him build more machines on several places for the welfare of the people The emperor let the mathematicians in Vienna judge the proposal but they refused it Abb Marci court mathematician and Divi friend commented Blasphemant quae ignorant In 1756 the machine was damaged by wind and then rebuilt and then on 10 March 1760 angry villagers of Pmtice tore down the structure blaming Divi for drought which struck the region that year Later in the year after the summer during which the thunderstorms did a lot of damage to the fields and vineyards the people besought him to rebuild the machine which he did in the precinct of Loucky monastery and built another one on the top of the church tower in Pmtice

In the United States the pointed lightning rod conductor often incorrectly referred to as the lightning attractor was invented by Benjamin Franklin as part of his groundbreaking explorations of electricity Franklin thought that with an iron rod sharpened to a point at the end

The electrical fire would I think be drawn out of a cloud silently before it could come near enough to strike 

Franklin speculated about lightning rods for several years before his reported kite experiment This experiment in fact took place because he was tired of waiting for Christ Church in Philadelphia to be completed so he could place a lightning rod on top of it There was some resistance from churches who felt that it was defying divine will to install these rods Franklin countered that there is no religious objection to roofs on buildings to resist precipitation so lightning which he proved to be simply a giant electrical spark should be no different As an act of philanthropy Franklin decided against patenting the invention

In the 19th century the lightning rod became a symbol of American ingenuity and a decorative motif Lightning rods were often embellished with ornamental glass balls The ornamental appeal of these glass balls has also been incorporated into weather vanes 

Balls of solid glass occasionally were used in a method thought to prevent lightning strikes to ships It is worth noting here not because it worked which it did not but because it reveals a lot about pre scientific thought Glass objects do not conduct electricity well They are seldom struck by lightning Therefore goes the theory there must be something about glass that repels lightning Hence the best method for preventing a lightning strike to a wooden ship was to bury a small solid glass ball in the tip of the highest mast The random behavior of lightning ensured that the method gained a good bit of credence even after the development of the marine lightning rod soon after Franklins initial work

The Arrival of the Castaeda Family began in 1929 as a salute to the settlers in the east of the country

Blacks Day originally commemorated the day in which the African slaves had a free day after the 1607 slave rebellion in the Colombian town of Remedios It is said that when news reached Popayan the African population there went to the streets and danced and blackened all the white walls of that city with coal In Pasto the celebration has probably taken place since 1857 when white people began to paint their faces black

Whites Day began in 1912 as a new way to celebrate the Epiphany The people began to paint their faces white with cosmetics and powder In 1926 the Great Parade began full of colorful and giant floats and people began playing with streamers and confetti

 Carnival Remate happens by celebrating Cuys day when locals and tourists delight in the typical dish of the region

Today the carnival is very important for tourism People use costumes and masks and still play with black cosmetics and white powder

Charles Edouard Jeanneret Gris known by the popular name of Le Corbusier was an architect and writer born in Switzerland In the 1930s he became a French citizen He is famous for his theories about modernism in architecture His plans included the improvement of housing for people in large cities This was because many people lived in poverty at that time Many of his designs have been built across the world

He also liked to paint and was skilled at designing furniture

Le Corbusier grew up in La Chaux de Fonds a small town in the north of Switzerland In 1907 aged 19 he moved to the French city of Paris He travelled across Europe and learned a lot of new ideas He learned to speak German and worked with famous architects such as Peter Behrens

During World War I Le Corbusier went back to Switzerland and became a teacher Soon he opened his own architectural business with his cousin and they worked together until 1940 It was in 1918 that he met a painter Amde Ozenfant who would become a great friend They combined their ideas to create a new type of art called Purism

After the war Le Corbusier concentrated on his art until 1922 After this he began designing apartments that could be stacked on top of each other to house people and meet their needs This type of low density housing was to deal with the problem of over crowding in Paris He said this transformation was needed or a revolution could occur from the unhappy lower classes He created a design for an ideal city that was never built It was a plan developed around a lot of skycrapers He presented this plan to the French government who refused it This did raise their awareness of overcrowding in the city though

Le Corbusier began to dislike capitalism and said that peoples house size should depend on the size of their family and not by how rich they were

Le Corbusier was not active in politics from 1942 Instead he built units smaller housing blocks around France This is illustrated in the design below

The name Le Corbusier is French It is a different version of his grandmothers surname Lecorbsier The name translates in to English as the crow like one He chose this name in 1920

Anna Karenina also Anglicised as Anna Karenin is a novel by the Russian writer Leo Tolstoy

Tolstoy considered this book his first true novel 

Anna Arkadyevna Karenina is romantic and has a very strong character For example she likes to write childrens books and admires art She is described as being very beautiful and there is a lot of energy in her She loves her son very very much and this is one of the biggest reasons why she is afraid of running away with Vronsky Although she does not love her husband Karenin she feels sorry and guilty However she says that I hate him for his virtues She is emotionally honest and really does not like to pretend She thinks that Karenin loves to pretend and this is one of the greatest reasons why she does not like him She thinks that love is more important than anything even duty

Count Alexei Kirillovich Vronsky is a handsome rich passionate soldier He is romantic and charming but he too is just a man Anna is disappointed after she runs away with him and commits adultery because he is not perfect His head begins to become bald he loses at horse games and he does not care about Kittys feelings Tolstoy does not often write about his thoughts and feelings as he does about the other characters

Other big buys by Prada in the 1990s were Helmut Lang and Jil Sander However by 2006 Prada had sold both Jil Sander was sold to Change Capital Partners which is run by Luc Vandevelde Helmut Lang is now owned by Japanese fashion company Link Theory

In May 2007 Prada and mobile phone maker LG Electronics worked together to make the LG Prada phone The phones were sold for 800 each

Buildings

Prada has paid for several famous architects the most famous are Rem Koolhaas and Herzog de Meuron to make their shops around the world

In 2005 near the West Texas towns Valentine and Marfa two Scandinavian artists Emily Milne and Zoe Brown opened Prada Marfa a sculpture of a Prada mini boutique The sculpture is on US Highway 90 and is a long way from any other buildings Prada helped pay for the building which is 15 by 25 foot The building does not actually sell clothes but there are clothes in the window as this is just for art

Prada has 9 small shops and 2 big stores in the USA

A cross section is what one gets if one cuts an object into slices

In geometry the correct definition of cross section is the broken wikt linkintersectionintersection of a body in 2 dimensional space with a line or of a body in 3 dimensional space with a plane 

A cross section or section is also an orthographic projection of a 3 dimensional object from the position of a plane through the object A floor plan is a section viewed from the top 

In a simple understanding space is something that we all know and that is measured in the three dimensions length width and height

In physics a definition of space is difficult because it cannot be explained by something else because there is nothing more fundamental known at present Therefore the only definition that one uses is done by measurement 

The standard space interval called a standard meter or simply meter is defined as the distance traveled by light in a vacuum during a time interval of exactly 1299792458 of a second 

Before Einsteins work on relativistic physics time and space were viewed as independent dimensions Einsteins discoveries have shown that due to relativity of motion space and time can be mathematically combined into space time

Quintus Horatius Flaccus known to English speakers as Horace was a famous poet in the Roman Empire

Horace was born in the small Italian town of Venosa His father used to be a slave but was known as a freedman because his master had freed him They moved to Rome a short time later Horaces father had a job taking items from the seller to the buyer He received money from these sales His father became more wealthy and was able to send Horace to the best schools in Rome He was also able to send him to Athens to study the Greek language and philosophy Horaces native language was Latin Horace was incredibly proud of his father and said he felt no shame in being the son of a freedman

In his early adult life Julius Caesar the Roman dictator was killed War was declared against the people who killed him Horace joined the army When the war was over Horace returned to Italy to find that other people were living in his apartment His father was also gone Horace became very poor Eventually he found a job in the treasury This involved sorting the countrys money

His friends Lucius Varius Rufus and Virgil who were also writers introduced him to Maecenas Maecenas was a close friend of Augustus the emperor of Rome Horace lived in Tivoli an area of Rome When he died he gave the land he owned to Augustus to increase the land the state owned Today other writers visit the land to remember him

Horace wrote many famous quotes in his poems These lines are still spoken today by speakers of every language in the original Latin

Some of Horaces poems are difficult to translate because of their syntax grammar and structure which is sometimes very different to modern languages

Horace is viewed by many people including experts to be one of the best Latin poets

In mathematics and abstract algebra group theory studies a type of algebraic structure called a group Group theory is often used in mathematics as a starting point for the study of many algebraic structures and of addition and multiplication of numbers Because group theory is also useful for studying symmetry in nature and abstract systems it has many applications in physics and chemistry

A group is a set G whose members are called elements The elements can be numbers of some kind or other abstract objects The elements can even be material objects There is also a binary operation which combines any two elements of G and results in another element of G This new element may be different from either of the original two but it does not have to be It only has to be an element of G To be a group the following four conditions must be true of G and the operation defined over G

An important fact about groups is that when two elements are combined using the operation the order of the elements matters Switching the order of two combined elements typically gives a different result This means that a b b a does not hold If the order does not matter and the previous equation does hold the group is called an abelian group

One example of a group is the set of integers with the addition operator This group is called G Each required condition is true of G so G is a group

New user UserIamandrewrice is currently a banned user on EN Looking at the admin noticeboard discussion I think this ban should be extended over here

The default policy for this is that we choose which bans to enforce from other wikis unless its a formal ban from Jimbo Wales I think this should be one to enforce over here This involved creating sockpuppets and using meatpuppets and showing off to admins that he was evading their blocks etc etc This was only a short time ago so I think its a bit early to ignore it My other concern is that the other people involved are gonna be over here before long as well

I am usually in favour of second chances for banned users on EN but in this case I think we should ban over here too Archer7  talk 1825 1 January 2008

If you are saying you are going against what both I AND Jeff say even though he is a notable wikipedian then simply by drawing a link between us the only reason you could want to be opposed to both of us would be a homophobic one However EconomicsGuy a user from wikipedia also gave me persmission to edit here I do not want to cause trouble here and my friends dont know about my account this time so they wont bother trying to hack onto this or impersonate me so basically the same things wont happen again All I want is to be part of the community and work towards a common goal  building an encyclopedia not argue about whose fault it was that I got banned last time we are living in the present not the past i am not doing anything wrong if I do do anything wrong then deal with it as you will then but there is currently nothing suggesting that I am a problem here Ben 2030 1 January 2008

TO ALL ADMINS This is to notify all admins that Ben evaded his block by editing several talk pages including mine Barliners and his own through a total of 4 different IP addresses 

After having each one blocked consecutively he finally stopped But we must take into consideration that evading a block with no less than 4 different IP addresses is a serious affair Here is a list of the IP addresses he used

Hi all I blocked IuseRosary due to some confusion I was experiencing due to heavy traffic on my talk page He has been unblocked but through IamAR says he cannot edit still because of the autoblock Anyone have any idea what the trouble could be Tygrrr 1846 8 January 2008

He keeps posting the same message on mine and IuseRosarys talk page He has posted it 3 times on mine and twice on IuseRosarys The comment is completely irrelevant as in it you will see that he asks something about sarcasm and whit which have no benefit to the encyclopedia I have informed IuseRosary of what was going on on his talk page through email and he requested that I delete it Can you please help to stop Gwib harrassing us Thank you everyone im trying to deal with this in the most appropriate way ive never dealt with someone quite like this IamARe 1902 8 January 2008

He has now also protected my talk page to stop me removing his persistent messaging Im not sure whats got into him but I am not in a position to do anything about this and in his current state of mind he will probably try and block me soon probably just for posting this something is really up with him and i dont know what to do Can my talk page be unprotected everyone too please IamARe 1905 8 January 2008

OK razorflame I will wait it out and see what you can conclude I would like to point out that Gwibs angry outbirsts appeared to start when I removed Gwibs mention in my wikifriends on my userpage Perhaps this is the reason for Gwibs temper and if it is I sincerely appologize for the tantrum it may have caused Gwib to have However my reason for removing him was in fact to do with his religious interrogations of IuseRosary which I found unprofessional and un administor like So thank you everyone I will check up on this some time later or tomorrow IamAre 1957 8 January 2008

They bothered to do it an EN Wiki they bothered to create over 50 accounts to vandalize and pose as sockpuppets of you IuseRosary also found out about this site and if you and him plan on editing during school time whilst surrounded by classmates I dont think that our splendid isolation would survive much longer  Gwib  1759 11 January 2008

This restriction is in hope that he will stop his excessive disruption I have said that if he breaks this restriction that it will result in a one week block If anyone sees a violation please issue the block If problems continue despite the restrictions I think it will be time for a ban Tygrrr 1923 11 January 2008

Assuming good faith is all well and good but when two users are seemingly using their talk pages as a social network and have almost identical signatures and then go out of their way to insult admins by constantly referring to them as hesheit then surely enough is enough I ask you to consider how much of your time has been spent trying to deal with these two users Despite his claims of superior intelligence the user quickly reverts to after being given a very easy piece of advice to comprehend claiming he doesnt understand it

A game seems to be being played and while I have the utmost of respect for the admins and other users who are going out of their way to help iamandrewrice  and while his terrible behaviour at EN Wiki arguably has nothing to do with here  there has to come a time when enough is enough Users on EN tried to help or at least thought they were trying to help before eventually realising they were being gamed Fortunately there were enough people over there to sort the situation out whereas here the lesser number of users means there is more potential for disruption

So Id just like to urge you all to be very cautious because the longer the minor niggles and gaming og the system goes on the more annoyed you will be when you eventually decide to act upon it MindTheGap 1455 12 January 2008

She married her first cousin Humbert on April 21 1868 On November 11 1869 Margherita gave birth to Victor Emmanuel Prince of Naples

On January 9 1878 Humbert succeeded as the new King of Italy She became his Queen consort and remained by his side for the rest of his reign Humbert was assassinated by anarchist Gaetano Bresci on July 29 1900

In music consonance and dissonance are words which are used to describe certain musical intervals or chords The adjectives are consonant and dissonant 

A consonant interval or chord is one which sounds stable and pleasant It could for example be the end of a piece of music For example C and E sound well together or the chord C E and G

A dissonant interval or chord is one which sounds unstable It may even sound harsh by itself The notes seem to clash It cannot be the end of the piece of music It sounds as if it wants to move on to a consonant interval The notes C and Fsharp together make a dissonant interval The chord C  Dsharp  Fsharp is a dissonant interval it is full of tension and it sounds as if it wants to resolve onto C  E  G

Scientifically a consonant interval is one in which the two notes vibrate at frequencies which have a simple mathematical relationship eg in two notes which are an octave apart the higher note vibrates exactly twice as fast If they are a fifth apart the top note vibrates 1 12 times as fast as the lower note The more complicated mathematically the interval the more dissonant it will sound

A better translation of the phrase would probably be pluck the day

The Middle Kingdom is the period in the history of ancient Egypt stretching from the establishment of the Eleventh Dynasty to the end of the Fourteenth Dynasty roughly between 2030 BC and 1640 BC

The period had two phases the 11th Dynasty which ruled from Thebes and the 12th and the following dynasties which were centred around el Lisht These two dynasties were originally considered to be the full extent of this unified kingdom but historians now consider the 13th Dynasty to at least partially belong to the Middle Kingdom

Thebes was a city in Ancient Egypt about 800 km south of the Mediterranean on the east bank of the river Nile It was the capital of Waset the fourth Upper Egyptian nome 

The Politics of Germany is based on a federal parliamentary democratic republic

The Federal Chancellor is the head of government and of the majority group in the legislature which is called the Bundestag

Executive power is exercised by the government

The power to make federal law is given to the government and the two parts of parliament the Bundestag and Bundesrat

From 1949 to 1990 the main political parties were the Social Democratic Party of Germany and the Christian Democratic Union with its sister party the Christian Social Union of Bavaria

After the reunification of Germany the Green Party and Alliance 90 became more important and was in government between 1999 and 2005

Other important political parties after reunification have been the PDS which was based on East Germanys Socialist Unity Party of Germany It joined with The Left Party of western Germany In 2007 Die Linke and WASG joined together under the leadership of Oskar Lafontaine

The political system is set out in the 1949 constitution the Grundgesetz which stayed in effect after 1990s German reunification

The constitution puts freedom and human rights first It also splits powers both between the federal and state levels and between the legislative executive and judicial branches The 1949 Grundgesetz was written to correct the problems with the Weimar Republics constitution The Weimar Republic collapsed in 1933 and was replaced by the dictatorship of the Third Reich

The courts of Germany are independent of the government and the lawmakers Senior judges are appointed by the Bundestag for a fixed term

The Bundeskanzler heads the Bundesregierung and thus the executive branch of the federal government He or she is chosen by and must report to the Bundestag Germanys parliament Germany like the United Kingdom can thus be said to have a parliamentary system

The Chancellor cannot be removed from office during a 4 year term unless the Bundestag has agreed on a successor This Constructive Vote of No Confidence is stop what happened in the Weimar Republic There the government did not have a lot of support in the parliament The small parties often joined together to vote against the government but could never stay together and choose a new government

Except in the periods 1969 72 and 1976 82 when the social democratic party of Chancellor Brandt and Schmidt came in second in the elections the Chancellor has always been the candidate of the largest party Usually the largest party is helped by one or smaller more parties to get a majority in the parliament Between 1969 72 and 1976 82 the smaller parties decided not to help the largest party but the second biggest party instead

The Chancellor appoints a Vice Chancellor who is a member of his cabinet usually the Foreign Minister When there is a coalition government the Vice Chancellor usually belongs to the smaller party of the coalition

The Chancellor is responsible for policy guidelines This means he or she sets the broad ideas of what the government will do To help carry out these ideas the Chancellor can change the make up of the federal ministries whenever they want For example in the middle of January 2001 the Federal Ministry of Agriculture was renamed to Ministry of Consumer Protection Food and Agriculture This was to help fight the Mad Cow Disease BSE problem At the same time some of the jobs of the Ministry of Justice the Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of Health were moved to the new Ministry of Consumer Protection

Reporting to the cabinet is the Civil service of Germany

The duties of the Bundesprsident are mostly representative and ceremonial The power of the executive is exercised by the Chancellor

The President is elected every 5 years on May 23 by the Federal Assembly The Bundesversammlung only meets to elect the President Its members are the entire Bundestag and an equal number of state delegates selected especially for this purpose in proportion to election results for the state parliaments In May 2004 Horst Khler of the CDU was elected The reason that the President is not directly elected by the people is to stop him from claiming to be more powerful than the government and the constitution which happened in the Weimar Republic

1 Although Mr Khler has been a member of the CDU the German Basic Law requests in Article 55 that the Federal President does not hold another office practice a profession or hold a membership of any corporation Accordingly every Federal President has let his party membership rest dormant and does not belong to a political party during his term of office

Germany has a bicameral legislature that means that the parliament has two houses The Bundestag has at least 598 members elected for a four year term Half of the members are elected in single seat constituencies according to first past the post The other 299 members are chosen from statewide party lists

The total percentage of constituency members and regional list members a party has should equal the percentage of votes that a party gets This is called proportional representation

Because Voters vote once for a constituency representative and a second time for a party Germany is said to have mixed member proportional representation

Sometimes a party already has more constituency seats in a land than it should have to keep the percentage of votes and seats equal The party does not lose seats Instead it gets no land seats This means that the Bundestag sometimes has more than 598 members In the current parliament there are 16 overhang seats giving a total of 614

A party must get 5 of the national vote or win at least three constituency seats to be represented in the Bundestag This rule often called the five percent hurdle was made to stop lots of small parties being in the Bundestag Small parties were blamed for the problems of the Weimar Republics Reichstag

The first Bundestag elections were held in the Federal Republic of Germany on August 14 1949 Following reunification elections for the first all German Bundestag were held on December 2 1990 The last election was held on September 18 2005 the 16th Bundestag met on October 18 2005

The Bundesrat is the representation of the state governments at the federal level The Bundesrat has 69 members who are delegates of the 16 Bundeslnder Usually the 16 Ministers President are members but they do not have to be The Lnder each have from three to six votes in the Bundesrat depending on population Bundesrat members must vote as their state government tell them

The legislature has powers of exclusive jurisdiction and concurrent jurisdiction with the Lnder What laws and what type of laws are set out in the Basic Law

The Bundestag does most law making

The Bundesrat must concur to laws about money shared by the federal and state governments and those making more work for the states Often this means that the Bundesrat often needs to agree to a law because federal laws are often carried out by state or local agencies

Since the political make up of the Bundesrat is often different from that of the Bundestag the Bundesrat is often the place for opposition parties to put their point of view rather than for the states to look after their interests as the constitution intended

To limit members of the Bundestag and the Bundesrat form a Vermittlungsauschuss which is a joint committee to try to reach agreement when the two chambers can not agree on a certain piece of legislation

More info 16th German federal election 2005 The Federal Council is composed by representatives of the State governments

Germany has had a court system that was free of government control for longer than it has had democracy

This means that the courts have traditionally been strong and almost all state actions are subject to judicial review

There is the ordinary courts system that handles civil and criminal cases

This has four levels

There is also a system of specialist courts that deall with certain areas of the law These generally have a state court and state appeals court before coming to the federal supreme court for that area of law The other federal supreme courts are

Unlike the United States all courts are state courts except for the top level supreme courts

Germany also has another supreme court the Bundesverfassungsgericht Federal Constitutional Court The Grundgesetz says that every person may complain to the Federal Constitutional Court when his or her constitutional rights especially the human rights have been violated by the government or one of its agencies and after he or she has gone through the ordinary court system

The Bundesverfassungsgericht hears complaints about laws passed by the legislative branch court decisions or acts of the administration

Usually only a small percentage of these constitutional complaints called are successful Evenso the Court is often angers both the government and the law makers The judges even say that they do not care about the reactions of the government the Bundestag or public opinion or about the cost of one of the courts decisions All that matters is the constitution

The Bundesverfassungsgericht is very high popular with ordinary people because it protects them from government wrong doing

Only the Constitutional Court can handle some types of cases including arguments between government bodies about their constitutional powers

Only the Constitutional Court has the power to ban political parties for being unconstitutional However so far the Constitutional court has only used this power twice outlawing the KPD and the SRP because both parties ideas went against the constitution

Music notation or musical notation is a way of writing down music so that anyone can play it Many systems have been used in the past to write music Today most musicians in the Western world write musical notes on a stave five parallel lines with four spaces in between them However there are many others some of which are in use today in different cultures

Writing music down makes it possible for a composer who makes up a piece of music to let other people know how he wants his music to sound That music can then be played or sung by anybody who can read music If music is not written down then people can only learn other peoples music by listening to it and trying to copy it This is how folk music was traditionally learned

The earliest kind of musical notation was written on tablets using a way of writing called cuneiform Music from Nippur from about 2000 BC has been found which seems to give an approximate idea of how the music should be played A tablet from 1250 BC has musical notation which shows the names of the strings of a lyre They are the earliest records we have of written music

Musical notation from Ancient Greece showed the notes in more detail than the earlier cuneiform It shows the pitch and how long it lasts It sometimes give an idea of the harmony It was used from at least the 6th century BC until about the 4th century AD

When music started to be written down in Europe it was music for the Roman Catholic church The monks who wrote it down used a system of dots and strokes called neumes They gave an idea of how high or low the notes were but did not show the length of the notes They may have been used by people who knew the music already and just needed a reminder of when to go up and down

People gradually realized that it was necessary to find a system which showed the exact pitch of the note The first stave was just one single horizontal line Gradually this increased to four lines Guido dArezzo an Italian Benedictine monk who lived in the 11th century developed this system which soon led to the way of writing music that we know By the 16th century everybody was using the 5 line stave A system of bars was used everywhere by the end of the 17th century At first the bar lines where there to show which notes should be played or sung together Gradually the system we know today was developed in which each bar lasted the same length of time and has a particular number of beats for each bar By the end of the 17th century this was used by most musicians in European classical music

Today we use a five line staff The pitch is shown by where the note is put on the stave There may also be sharps or flats in front of some of the notes The music is read from left to right

A staff of written music usually has a clef in front This shows exactly which notes are to be played Notes which are very high or low can be put on extra lines called ledger lines above or below the stave

After the clef there is usually a key signature which shows the key of the piece it shows which sharps or flats are to be used regularly

After the key signature is the time signature Bars divide the piece into regular groupings of beats and the time signatures show these groupings

Above the music there is usually a word or words to show the tempo At various places in the music there will be dynamic marks to show how loud or soft to play

For vocal music words are written underneath the notes

When music is played by a large group of instruments such as an orchestra the music is written in a score This shows the music played by all the instruments so there are many staves written underneath one another The conductor will need to have a score but the players will play from a part which has just the notes that they play All the parts needed for a piece of music is called a set of parts 

Instruments such as guitars often play from a chord chart or just the names of the chords written underneath the music or under the words of a song

A system called tonic sol fa was used by amateur musicians a century ago This showed the names of the notes of a scale

Lute music in the Renaissance and Baroque periods used to be written in a system called tabulature Some 20th century composers have also used tabulature

Some modern composers such as John Cage have written music by making drawings called graphic notation

Music can also be written in Braille for blind musicians

Today computers are often used for making music This has led to other forms of music notation which are used in different systems of software The MIDI file format stores information about the pitch duration speed volume etc of notes and can be used to control a MIDI instrument

There are other systems in use today for some non Western music

Musicology means the study of music by a scholar A scholar is an academic person often a professor or lecturer at a university Someone who studies musicology is a Musicologist

Musicologists study all kinds of music They study the history of music and learn about all the composers and how they developed their ideas and learned from one another They can do this by studying music scores or by looking for historical documents which tell us about musicians from the past Musicologists may also study the philosophy of music 

They write articles in musical journals or books on music This can help us to know and understand more about the music we play or listen to

Nyingma is the name of one of the four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism The Nyingma school is made up of several different lines that start with Padmasambhava the legendary founder of Tibetan Buddhism The word Nyingma means ancient Nyingma followers see themselves as holding the oldest teachings of Vajrayana Some of these teachings can be found in the local Bn religion of Tibet

Notable modern Nyingma teachers include Kyabje Dudjom Rinpoche Sogyal Rinpoche Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche Khenpo Choga Rinpoche filmmaker Khyentse Norbu and Penor Rinpoche

Thelema is the English spelling of the Greek noun will from the verb to will wish purpose Early Christian writings use the word to refer to the will of God the human will and even the will of Gods opponent the Devil

Thelema is also a way of life first written about by Franois Rabelais in his famous books of fiction Gargantua and Pantagruel The core of this way of life was summed up in the phrase Do what thou wilt This idea was later put into practice in the mid 18th century by Sir Francis Dashwood at Medmenham 

This Thelemic Law of Rabelais was revived by Aleister Crowley in 1904 when Crowley wrote The Book of the Law This book contains both the word Thelema in Greek as well as the phrase Do what thou wilt From this Crowley took Thelema as the name of his own religion Thus Shri Gurudev Mahendranath wrote that Rabelais Dashwood and Crowley must share the honor of perpetuating Thelema

The core of Thelemic thought is Do what thou wilt However people understand and apply this in different ways For example some people accept Crowley as a prophet Other people regard Crowleys system to be only one form of Thelema Crowley himself shared this view

Many followers of Thelema are learn and use other systems of spiritual thought blending them according to their own will with Thelema Most borrow freely from other traditions For example Nu and Had are thought to be the same as or similar to the Tao and Teh of Taoism Shakti and Shiva of the Hindu Tantras Shunyata and Bodhicitta of Buddhism Ain Soph and Kether in the Qabalah Like Crowley other followers of Thelema make free use of the methods and practices of other traditions including alchemy astrology qabalah tantra tarot and yoga according to their own wills

Some groups say that they are true to Crowleys system Some groups build upon his teachings expanding upon and extending them For example the Fraternitas Saturni founded in 1928 in Germany accepts the Law of Thelema but extends it with the phrase Mitleidlose Liebe The Thelema Society also located in Germany accepts Liber Legis and much of Crowleys work on magick while also including the ideas of other thinkers such as Friedrich Nietzsche Charles S Peirce Martin Heidegger and Niklas Luhmann In America the writings of Maggie Ingalls have started a movement called Maat Magick along with a group called the Horus Maat Lodge founded in 1979 This movement combines elements of Thelema with Nemas system based on the Egyptian goddess Maat She wrote her own holy book titled Liber Pennae Praenumbra The HML aims to combine the current Aeon of Horus with the future Aeon of Maat in which mankind will achieve balance

Most of Thelemic writing was written by Aleister Crowley He wrote many books Many of them were on the subject of Thelema During his time there were a few other people who wrote on the subject including Charles Stansfeld Jones and JFC Fuller Since his death in 1947 only a few new writers have written on the subject such as

Thelema has been attracting more attention in recent years from scholars of religion especially those interested in new religious movements contemporary Gnosticisms and Hermeticisms References at the end of this article supply a few such sources Perhaps the most unusual attempt was made by bishop Federico Tolli in his German book Thelema Im Spannungsfeld zwischen Christentum Logentradition und New Aeon For Tolli Thelema is to be regarded as the dialectical consequence of Christianity Christianity for Tolli exists as a community in Christ whereas Tolli sees Thelema as a necessarily individualistic response to the world 

Taken from a 1938 theological dictionary the concept of salvation history has a great effect on Tollis thought and it is in this context that he discusses Crowleyan Thelema Tolli regards Crowleys Heilsgeschichte as one in which the whole Universe is to combine Love in the form of combinatory attraction is a universal principle therefore akin to the concept of Natural religion The main difference is that in Christianity salvation of the entire Universe cannot be made by solipsistic man The bishop sees Crowley as a failed however talented artist or Mystagogie but not as a Satanist The merit and contribution of bishop Tolli to Thelemic studies lies in the fact that it was he who first expresses that the genuine meaning and idea of Thelema does not necessarily contradict the teachings of Jesus as Crowley himself affirmsCitation neededdateJanuary 2011
