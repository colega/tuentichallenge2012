A laptop is a computer which is easy to carry around Its user can fold the laptop up and be able to take it with himher The laptop was created mainly for this particular reason In order to develop a laptop a computer technology was taken and then scaled to smaller size

The first laptop was invented in 1969 by Bill Moggridge The British developed his portable computer for GRiD Systems Corporation GRiD made the product with a fold down display that covered the keyboard GRiD started manufacturing in 1979 with commercial distribution occurring in 1981

GRiDs computer was five times lighter than any other computer used at that time NASA used the laptop when it performed its shuttle program back in the 1980s GRiD held patents for the Clamshell design which represents our modern laptop design GRiD was acquired in 1988 by Tandy Corporation who after acquisition monetized the Clamshell Patent by aggressively pursuing all computer manufacturers who were selling clamshell design laptops GRiD also had patents for handheld and handwriting computers which Tandy holds to this day

Historians however consider that the first portable was created in 1981 and its name was Osborne 1 Its inventor was Adam Osborne who was also a former book publisher He was the founder of Osborne Computer His portable computer weighed 24 pounds 

The company spent 1795 US dollars on creating the computer which had a five inch screen and a special place for a modem and two devices for using a floppy disk There were also several programs designed for the computer and a battery pack for providing energy The computer however was not successful 

The same year saw the birth of another computer called Epson HX 20 It was a portable computer with a liquid crystal display monitor The computer also included a built in printer The whole device was battery powered 

One year later in 1982 two computer designers from Microsoft Kazuhiko Nishi and Bill Gates started their discussion concerning a new portable computer The main thing about the computer was a new LCD technology The prototype of the new laptop was presented to Radio Shack 

The latter agreed to start the production of the computer A year later the company launched its TRS 80 Model 100 which was a computer that looked pretty much like the laptops we know today

In 1986 the company created its improved version called TRS Model 200 The following two years saw the appearance of a laptop PC from Compaq Computers and the first notebook style laptop from NEC called NEC UltraLite

The year 1989 was quite successful for laptop producers First there was Apple Computer that developed its first portable computer called Macintosh Portable the evolution of which turned it into PowerBook Then the company named Zenith Data Systems introduced its Zenith MinisPort a portable computer weighing 6 pounds Finally there was Compaq Computer that designed its first laptop PC called Compaq LTE

The development of laptops continued with various upgrades and additional functions added Laptops have a lot of advantages like 

At the same time portable computers have several negative points like

A notebook is a collection of sheets of paper bound as a book or leaflet It can be used to make notes and to draw things Some notebooks also have a printed calendar

Inuyasha is a manga made by Rumiko Takahashi that has also been made an anime series 

This is a story started by a girl shooting a boy who has dog ears and white hair She shouts Inuyasha to him while she shoots and dies afterwards nobody knows why Her little sister Kaede runs to her side calling Sister Kikyo but its too late Shes already dead Before Kikyo dies though she asks Kaede to burn her together with a purple jewel  the Shikon no Tama 

But Kikyos not dead yet because of her reincarnation meaning Kikyo became alive again to another person who is a girl called Kagome She soon appears after Kikyo burns in the future world and her granpa shows a fake shikon no tama which Kagome does not believe in She never believed in those things until her 15th birthday arrived She lands into a well in her house where she goes back to the past finding Inuyasha on a tree stuck on there for 50 years by Kikyos arrow 

She meets Kaede an older one because 50 years passed in this world after what happened to Kikyo Kaede finds out that Kagome is the reincarnation of her own sister and helps her keep the real shikon no tama that Kagome suddenly found in her body Kagome gets the arrow out of Inuyasha when a centipede yokaidemon attacked her to get the jewel When Inuyasha does kill it he tries to kill Kagome too to revenge on Kikyo but Kagome can now control him with Kaedes magic by saying sit just like a dog And Inuyasha is a dog yokai After that Kagome shatters the jewel by mistake and has to try to find them all before evil creatures do This is the beginning of their adventure and they also have to find one of the evil who is Naraku Many other characters come to help Kagome and Inuyasha like Sango Miroku Kirara and Shippo this in the anime finished at 167 episodes but many people expect it to continue inuyasha is like a basic fairy tale

The Shikon no Tama is the fictional magic jewel in the anime and manga series InuYasha It is called the Jewel of Four Souls because it has four souls of 4 different names Aramitama Nigimitama Kushimitama and Sakimitama The souls can make a person very powerful

When Midoriko was about to die fighting a demon she joined her 4 soul inside her heart with the soul of the demon to make it good and pure By doing that she killed herself and the demon This created the Shikon jewel Inside it Midoriko and the demon souls still fought each other This battle is depends to the person who has the jewel The jewel can become pure or impure Many creatures want the jewel because it can make them powerful like Midoriko They can do anything they want with it If someone wants to become a full demon then they will become that just like Naraku wants to 

After many fights of different demons and humans Shako Sangos grandpa found the jewel from a demon called Mistress Centipede The jewel was impure because it had been with the evil Mistress Centipede He took the jewel to Kikyo Only the goodness of Kikyos priestess power could purify it and make it good But when Kikyo is burnt because she dies by Naraku wanting the jewel and killing her and she wants the jewel to burn and destroy along with her Kagome Kikyos reincarnation gets the jewel even so and when Mistress Centipedes bones inside the well become alive with the jewels power when Kagome comes near she is dragged into the well and the past where everything happened Kagome shatters the jewel by accident when she shoots a crow which swallowed it and has to find all the pieces before evil creatures do with Inuyasha 

Some people tried to make shikon no tama themselves so that they can have its power without trying to find all the pieces Izumo a half demon who turns to a demon at night but a human at day is a clever philosopher who likes nature and the world He is the one who knows how to make a shikon no tama and a frog demon with some other demons grab him so that they can start making a fake shikon no tama Izumo agrees and makes many copies of shikon no tamas which only has small power He said to the frog demon that to make the copies like the real one they had to collect the souls of people with Aramitama Nigimitama Kushimitama and Sakimitama When Inuyasha and his friends come to save Izumo who plans to get them because of his friends having the souls that he needed to make a real shikon no tama 

Inuyasha Kagome Miroku Sango Shippo and Sesshomaru finally finish off Naraku and the shikon jewel disappears Miroku and Sango have three kids together Kagome is thrown back into her own time for three years and comes back to the feudal era after she finishes off high school Kikyo was killed by Naraku Inuyasha and Kagome are married after being reunited after the three year separation and Sesshomaru leaves Rin at Kaedes villages so that she can be used to being surrounded by humans and once a while Sesshomaru visits Rin and gives her presents

Several liberal parties have existed in Germany since the 19th century The FDP was founded in West Germany in September of 1945 in the state of Hamburg It became member of the state parliament of Hamburg in its first election Similar liberal parties were founded in other German states most of them successful in getting mandates In 1947 on March 17th the Demokratische Partei Deutschlands was founded as a whole Germany liberal party by Theodor Heuss and Wilhelm Klz but it broke down after a short while On December 11th in 1948 the FDP was founded as a liberal party for West Germany Chief of the party was Theodor Heuss The next important man was Thomas Dehler

In its first years the main part of the party followed a national liberal way Liberal in the economical field but very conserative in most other fields But in every state it had its own way

The FDP was the smaller partner of the CDU under Konrad Adenauer It was member of the West German government from 1949 to 1966

In 1969 the FDP returned to government But now the FDP was partner of the Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands under Willy Brandt later Helmut Schmidt The party changed its values Left liberal positions were the leading ideas of the FDP at that time and included ideas like civil rights and giving everyone the chance for a good education

It changed again in 1982 when the government crashed on Schmidt and elected Helmut Kohl of the CDU as the new chancellor It became more and more a single issue party with its only interest in a low tax tarif  especally for high incomes It fought for study fees now and against social security It secretary general said one day We are the party of the best incomes

In 1998 it lost its power and became part of the opposition In some state parliaments the FDP is still in power as junior partner of the CDU

The partys unofficial motto is So viel Staat wie ntig so wenig Staat wie mglich meaning as much state as necessary as little state as possible

Alliance 90The Greens is a political party in Germany It was formed in 1992 by the Western German party Die Grnen and the Eastern German Bndnis 90 Its main interests are ecology civil rights equality between men and women and the chances of immigrants in the German society Their motto is now for tomorrow

In the 1970s there were a lot of protests against nuclear power in Germany The protesters had no support in the political parties in Germany So they got the idea to found their own party

In the election to the European Parliament of 1979 their party the Sonstige Politische Vereinigung Die Grnen got 32 They tried again and this time it was accepted and was founded in Karlsruhe on January 13th 1980

Since their aims were for civil rights and ecology a lot of former Anti Vietnam War protesters joined the party The Greens were pacifists and strictly against nuclear weapons They wanted to reach a de militarized Europe

First chiefs of the party were Herbert Gruhl and Petra Kelly After a short while some right winged people left the party so they became a left winged party

In the old GDR a Green party was founded in 1989 and joined to the Western Greens in 1990 In 1993 the Bndnis 90  a civil rights movement from the former GDR  and Die Grnen joined them

In 1998 they joined the federal government under Gerhard Schrder together with the Social democrats

The Green lost a lot of their values in that time They voted for joining the Kosovo War and to attack Serbia in 1999 and lost their social issues In 2005 they lost their power in the federal government Currently they are in opposition in the federal and all state parliaments

The Greens are interested in ecology so one of their main issues is saving the earth  especially the climate  without using nuclear power

The second main issue of the Greens is gender mainstraming

The third issue are the integration and the chances of immigrants in Germany

In the foreign policy the Green changed their position in their first period in federal government Before that time they wanted German soldiers only to allow peace keeping missions of the United Nations many Greens wanted a de militarized Germany After their legislative period  with main influence of foreign secretary Fischer  they accepted to join international military missions eg in Afganisthan But their main issue is to avoid conflicts by development policy and international cooperation Main issues of foreign policy are international envoirementional and climate saving projects like the Kyoto protocoll the development of the European Union and a reform of the international law like the installing of the International Crime Court in The Hague

They are left winged liberals

The Christian Social Union of Bavaria or Christlich Soziale Union is a conservative political party in the German state of Bavaria In the federal parliament of Germany the CSU and the CDU which the main center right political party of Germany always join together

Its chief is Horst Lorenz Seehofer

In 1945 two local CSU groups were founded One in Wrzburg and the other in Munich

In January 1946 the CSU was founded for the whole of Bavaria

All state elections of Bavaria were won by the CSU Sometimes the CSU had to make some coalitions with the Bayernpartei the FDP or the SPD

In the federal government the CSU always joins with the CDU

The CSU is more conservative than the CDU

One very famous leader of the CSU was Franz Josef Strau Sometimes he was well known for the good that he did Other times because of scandals

The CSU is a very conservative party according to the people of Bavaria who mainly live in the countryside and smaller towns and villages

Traditionally it tried to make a compromise between conservative tradition and social welfare

Currently it leans to more free market beliefs instead of social care

The Christian Democratic Union of Germany or Christlich Demokratische Union Deutschlands is one of the two main right of centre political parties in Germany It describes itself as a Christian democratic liberal and conservative party of the centre

In November 2005 the Federal leader of the CDU Dr Angela Merkel became the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany

Income is the money that someone gets for business activities 

For individuals income usually means their wages or salary before any tax and other deductions has been made by their employer

For business there is a difference between the USA where it most often means the amount of money that a company earns after paying for all its costs and the world outside the US where the term is usually profit or earnings

The Theory of Computation is a branch of Mathematics Generally it is seen as belonging to Computer science The field of study of this subject is to see if a certain problem can be solved by a computer If this is the case then the question is to know if it can be solved in an efficient way 

There are two major branches in it The first is computability theory It looks to see if a certain problem can be solved by a computer Since this is a theoretical field of study no real computers are used They are replaced by a system called the Turing machine

Once it is known if such a solution exists computer scientists want to know if it can be found and perhaps how it can be improved This field of study is covered by the complexity theory That theory has developed concepts to compare different methods of solving a problem to one another Such methods are usually called algorithms This is similar to comparing cooking recipes and seeing which of two recipes is easier to do

A link also called a Gunters link is a unit of length in the imperial and US systems Links were commonly used in measuring land in the English speaking world before the 20th century but are now rarely used Link is usually abbreviated as l li or lnk

In mathematics an algebraic structure is a set with one two or more binary operations on it 

The basic algebraic structures with one binary operation are the following

The basic algebraic structures with two binary operations are the following

Examples are

A rod a perchrefArea or a pole is a unit of length in the imperial and US systems

In medival times English ploughmen used a wooden stick with a pointed tip to spur or guide their oxen The rod was the length of this stick In 1607 Edmund Gunter standardised this length

The rod is still in use as a unit of measure in certain specialised fields In recreational canoeing overland paths where canoes must be carried are measured in rods This is probably because the length of a typical canoe is about one rod In the United Kingdom some gardens are measured in rods

In the episode of The Simpsons entitled A Star is Burns Grampa Simpson said My car gets forty rods to the hogshead and thats the way I likes it Thats about 12 litres per metre 12 feet per imperial gallon or 10 feet per US gallon

A chain is a unit of length People usually used it for measuring land There are a number of different chains from 50 to 100 feet long

When people talk about the chain as a unit they normally mean the unit of the imperial or US system This is equal to 66 feet or 201168 metres This is also called a Gunters chain surveyors chain or land chain

In the past people used to use wire chains for measuring land These chains had 100 links The links were made of thick wire with a loop at each end The links were connected to each other by three rings There were brass handles at each end People folded the chain up link by link and carried it in their hand The name chain comes from these devices

The chain was also called an acres breadth This is because an acre was defined as the area of a rectangle one chain wide and one furlong long

The unit was once important in everyday life in United Kingdom and its colonies and in the United States People used it when they made maps and planned out cities and towns

Farmers in the United States and Canada still use measuring wheels frac10 of a chain around the outside 

It is also the length of the pitch between the wickets in cricket

Americans sometimes used a longer chain of 100 feet This is called the engineers chain or Ramsdens chain

Texans use another chain for measuring Spanish land grants This chain is called the Hispanic chain or vara chain It is based on the vara A vara is the equivalent of one yard in the old Spanish and Portuguese system of measurement 

Since in Texas one Mexican foot is defined as frac2527 English feet

A furlong is a measure of distance in imperial and US systems It is equal to 660 feet or 201168 metres There are eight furlongs in a mile

The English first used the furlong in the 9th century or before The name furlong comes from the Old English words furh and lang Originally it was the length of the furrow in one acre of a ploughed field 

An acre is an area that is one furlong long and one chain wide For this reason the furlong was once also called an acres length Around the year 1300 England standardised the furlong as 40 rods or 660 feet

Distances for thoroughbred horse races in the United Kingdom Ireland the United States and Canada are still given in miles and furlongs It is also used in the rail industry in the UK Otherwise the unit is not used much

Stefan Zweig was an Austrian writer He volunteered to be a soldier in the First World War and got the post as a military commentator This made him an enemy of war The Nazis gained power in Germany in 1933 and their influence could be felt in Austria as well 1934 Stefan Zweig emigrated first to London then to South America That way he lost much of his audience He committed suicide in 1942 He did this through an overdose of sleeping pills

He has written many books and poems One of his best known works is called Schachnovelle The Royal Game in English In it he describes a Chess player that is forced to play against himself He explores the theme of madness This book inspired the movie Geris Game made by Pixar in 1997

The Leeward Islands are part of the Society Islands in French Polynesia 

Complexity theory is a type of Computer science It looks at how hard a problem is to do for a computer and how good particular solutions to that problem are Different algorithms that solve a problem may be better or worse in multiple ways An algorithm may be faster than some other algorithm but it may need more resources like memory 

Part of complexity theory is understanding how algorithms perform in their worst case scenario An algorithms worst case scenario is a problem that will take a long time or lots of resources to solve If people know how good an algorithm is in its worst case they can guarantee that the algorithm will be at least that good in every case People are also interested in how a certain algorithm does on average many algorithms are very inefficient in their worst case but are okay on most cases Knowing how good an algorithm is on average lets people know what to generally expect when using that algorithm

In mathematics a binary operation often denoted on a set is a way of combining a pair of elements in that set that results in another element of the set For example if we take a pair of natural numbers and let the operation be addition then their sum is also a natural number and is the result of applying this particular binary operation Another example of an operation on the natural numbers is multiplication For instance take the natural numbers 2 and 3 When multiplied together they give 6 another natural number

Others The sum between matrices The composition of functions The union and the intersection of sets are also two different binary operations on the set of all sets or on subsets in a power set

Kubuntu is a version of the free Linux distribution Ubuntu It uses the desktop environment KDE instead of GNOME Most of the software used in Kubuntu is part of the KDE project but all other software used in Ubuntu can also be used Because the only difference of Kubuntu and Ubuntu is the default software you can turn an Ubuntu system into a Kubuntu system or a Kubuntu system into an Ubuntu system only by installing some software

Some examples of changes in software

Xubuntu is a free Linux distribution based on Ubuntu It uses the Xfce desktop environment

Edubuntu is the version of Linux distribution Ubuntu It is used for education It uses GNOME and is designed for use in classrooms

Edubuntu has been created in collaboration with teachers and technologists in multiple nations Edubuntu is built on top of the Ubuntu base and incorporates education specific applications designed for the 6 18 years age group

Included with Edubuntu is the Linux Terminal Server Project a large number of educational applications including GCompris KDE Edutainment Suite The first Edubuntu release coincided with the release of Ubuntu 510 which was called Breezy Badger on 2005 Edubuntu CDs can be ordered for free through the official website service

The principal design goals of Edubuntu are easier configuration users and processes together with ways for working together in classrooms Equally important is the gathering together of the best available free software and digital materials for education

Dissociative Identity Disorder is a medical diagnosis of a mental condition

Zucchini are a type of vegetable Usually they are served cooked They can also be used as an ingredient in a sweet bread

They may look similar to cucumbers

A civil servant or public servant is an employee who works in the civilian career public sector for a government department or agency Many consider the study of civil service to be a part of the field of public administration 

Workers in non departmental public bodies may also be called civil servants in context with statistics All people that may be called civil servants together form a nations Civil Service or Public Service

An employee is a term for workers and managers working for a company organisation or community These people are the staff of the organization Generally speaking any person hired by an employer to do a particular job is an employee 

In most modern economies the word employee means a person who works for a corporation The relationship between employer and employee is different from that between the firm and a customer or client 

An employee usually gets the job after having an interview

An employer is a person or institution that hires employees or workers Employers offer wages or a salary to the workers in exchange for the workers work or labor 

One speaks of wages if the employee is paid by the hour and of salary if he is paid a set rate per pay period Wages are paid for all hours worked including overtime but a salary is typically not paid more for more hours worked than the minimum

Employers include everything from individuals hiring a babysitter to governments and businesses which may hire many thousands of employees In most western societies governments are the largest single employers but most of the work force is employed in small and medium businesses in the private sector

The public sector is the part of economic and administrative life that deals with the delivery of goods and services by and for the government whether national regional or localmunicipal 

Examples of public sector activity range from delivering social welfare administering urban planning and organising national defences

The word administration means giving service or to give a definition it can be understood as the process of organizing people and resources so to direct activities toward common goals

Administration is both an art and a science and can be seen as a craft as administrators are judged ultimately by their performance

In Kingdom Hearts II the player controls a 15 year old boy named Sora Sora goes through different worlds fighting different enemies like Heartless and Nobodies Occasionally there will be enemies you have to defeat that are based on the world you are in such as the cursed pirates in Pirates of the Caribbean

The player starts the game controlling Roxas a 15 year old boy living in a town called Twilight Town He is on summer vacation with his three best friends Hayner Pence and Olette As a week goes by strange things begin to happen A man named Axel a member of Organization XIII who was in Chain of Memories shows up and is surprised and upset that Roxas does not remember him They fight and Roxas discovers that he can use a Keyblade Roxas also meets Namin and a man named DiZ who was in Rikus side of Chain of Memories Namin tells Roxas she has been changing his memories so he can become whole again Axel tells Roxas they used to be friends and that he must either take Roxas back to the Organization or destroy him They battle and Axel disappears Roxas then finds Sora and disappears himself

After Roxas disappears Sora wakes up and becomes the new player character Donald and Goofy also wake up and the three of them continue their mission to find Riku As they search for him they meet the rest of the members of Organization XIII and learn that they are beings called Nobodies When a Heartless steals someones heart that person also becomes a Heartless but if their heart is strong their body becomes a Nobody Nobodies have no emotions but want to have hearts again Xemnas the leader of Organization XIII is trying to summon Kingdom Hearts which he claims will enable the Nobodies to get their hearts back To summon Kingdom Hearts Heartless must be killed with a Keyblade which will release the hearts they hold and let them return to Kingdom Hearts This is the reason the Organization wanted Sora to join them

It is later revealed that Roxas is Soras Nobody and was a member of Organization XIII Roxas was created when Sora briefly lost his heart in Kingdom Hearts Namin is then revealed to be Kairis Nobody who was created when Kairi lost her heart at the beginning of Kingdom Hearts Xemnas is the Nobody of a man called Xehanort who no longer exists Ansem the main enemy from the first game was Xehanorts Heartless

Near the end of the game Sora Kairi and Riku reunite and destroy Xemnas With all members of Organization XIII destroyed and the worlds apparently safe Sora Riku and Kairi go home to Destiny Islands

Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix is a reissue of the game that was released only in Japan on March 29 2007 It has more content than Kingdom Hearts II including new areas new battles and a new secret ending It is also for the PlayStation 2

Mithril is a fictional metal from J R R Tolkiens Middle earth universe 

Mithril is the strongest metal known in Middle earth It looks similar to silver It does not weigh much and it is easy to make into things Mithril is very rare and precious It was only found in Khazad dm where it was mined by the Dwarves and in Nmenor

The most well known object made of mithril is probably the mail shirt of Bilbo and Frodo Baggins

Shaw and Crompton is a town in the North West of England It is to the north east of Manchester Shaw and Crompton was part of Lancashire until the 1970s but is now part of Greater Manchester Shaw and Crompton is near to Oldham

Shaw and Crompton grew during the Industrial Revolution because of its large cotton factories which sent fabric across the world

Greater Manchester is a county in the North West of England It was created in 1974 Its cities are Manchester and Salford and its large towns are Oldham Bury Rochdale Ashton Under Lyne Stockport Wigan and Bolton It also has smaller towns and villages for example Shaw and Crompton

A league is an old unit of length It was first an ancient Celtic unit It was the distance a person could walk in about one hour The Romans adopted the league and it became a common unit of measurement throughout western Europe and Latin America

In English speaking countries the league was usually three statute miles on land or three nautical miles at sea However in writing the word league often means the Spanish Portuguese or French league

The league was used by Ancient Rome which defined it as being frac112 Roman miles The origin is the leuga gallica the league of Gaul The ancient league was short but the unit grew longer over time

In Argentina a league is a distance of 5 km

In Brazil the league was 6 km but it is not used anymore

The French league had different values at different times 10 000 12 000 13 200 and 14 400 French feet about 325 km to about 468 km It was used for a while together with the metric system but it is not used now The nautical league was three nautical miles

In the Mexican countryside the league is still commonly used in the original sense of the distance a person can walk in an hour So a league along a good road on level ground is longer than a league on a difficult path over rough ground

The gill is a unit for measuring volume It is equal to a quarter of a pint People do not use it much now

A quart is a unit of measurement for volume It is a quarter of a gallon or two pints Because the imperial system and the American system use different gallons their quarts are different too

In the American system there are two different quarts There is a wet quart and a dry quart There is only one imperial quart One US dry quart is a little smaller than one imperial quart Six US wet pints are about five imperial pints

The amp is defined using two parallel wires placed one metre apart in a vacuum The wires are very long and very thin One amp is defined as the current producing an attractive force of 2107 newtons per metre of length between these wires

A corporation is a union of natural persons that has its own legal status that is independent from the persons involved It is a creature of statute ie it is like a person created by law Because it is recognized by governments as such it must file tax returns and pay taxes and conform to state and federal law This separation of persons and corporation gives it special powers Its status and capacity is determined by the law of the place of incorporation

Investors and entrepreneurs often form joint stock companies to make a business easier Therefore the term corporation often means such business corporations Corporations may also be formed for local government policial religious and charitable purposes or government programs

In common speech the word corporation refers usually to limited responsibility corporation That is a business firm where each of the partners invest a sum of money in as the capital of the corporation They receive shares as recognition of the sum they have invested If the company goes bankrupt the business partners are responsible of only the name value of their shares not their whole own personal property of the companys debts

In jurisprudence a natural person is a real human being in contrast to an artificial person meaning an organization that the law treats for some purposes as if it were a person distinct from its members or owner

For example the right to vote is given to natural persons only That is the case for most of the human rights Therefore obviously a corporation cannot hold public office but it can file a lawsuit

Although science fiction has long fantasized about the possibility of sentient robots living among humans no court has yet dealt with the question of whether such a being would be considered a natural person

Jurisprudence is the theory and philosophy of law Scholars of jurisprudence or legal philosophers hope to obtain a deeper understanding of the nature of law of legal reasoning legal systems and of legal institutions As jurisprudence has developed there are three main aspects with which scholarly writing engages

Modern jurisprudence and philosophy of law is dominated today primarily by Western academics The ideas of the Western legal tradition have become so pervasive throughout the world that it is tempting to see them as universal Historically however many philosophers from other traditions have discussed the same questions from Islamic scholars to the ancient Greeks

Orascom is an Egyptian company that offers mobile telephone services in many countries It operates these companies

A legal entity is a legal construct through which the law allows a group of natural persons to act as if they were a single person for certain purposes The most common purposes are lawsuits property ownership and contracts 

A legal entity is not always something else than the natural persons of which it is composed as one can see with a company or corporation 

Some examples of legal entities include

There are limitations to the legal recognition of artificial persons Legal entities cannot marry they cannot vote or hold public office and in most jurisdictions there are certain positions which they cannot occupy The extent to which a legal entity can commit a crime varies from country to country Certain countries prohibit a legal entity from holding human rights other countries permit artificial persons to enjoy certain protections from the state that are traditionally described as human rights

examples of legal entities are  sole traders partnerships  trusts  private and public company

Ownership means total possession or control of property which may be an object landreal estate intellectual property or some other kind of property

Ownership is needed for the development of the capitalist socio economic system The concept of ownership has existed for thousands of years and in all cultures

Possession means to have some sort of control over something else 

Generally to possess something a person must have an intention to possess it A person may be in possession of some property Like ownership the possession of things is commonly regulated by states under property law

When English explorer Captain James Cook claimed the country of Australia as a British country he took possession of the land The spot where he made his claim on 22 August 1770 a small island in the Torres Strait is now called Possession Island

An officer of arms is someone who is chosen by a sovereign or state to do some important jobs relating to

In Scotland the officers of arms maintain the old job of a herald  passing on royal messages Three days after parliament is dissolved in London the royal proclamation is read out at the Mercat Cross in Edinburgh They wait three days because this is how long it used to take to get from London to Edinburgh by horse

Personal property means property that consists of object that can be moved from one place to another 

In the common law systems personal property may also be called chattels There it is distinguished from real property or real estate 

In the civil law systems personal property is often called movable property or movables  any property that can be moved from one location to another This term is in distinction with immovable property or immovables such as land and buildings

The common law is a kind of legal system Under the common law the law is not just made by legislation Instead it is also made by courts Common law courts use the precedent of earlier courts to help them make decisions

The common law is used in the United Kingdom and most countries that used to be colonies of the British Empire including the United States Many other countries use a system called civil law where people say that legislation is the only kind of law In common law countries courts usually have more power than in civil law countries

Common law started in England when courts decided to use tradition custom and precedent to help them make decisions A precedent is something that another court has done in the past By looking at decisions by earlier court a common law court tries to make decisions that will not surprise people and that fit in with the rest of the law

In common law countries when people like lawyers and judges want to know what the law is they also look at what courts have written When a court decides a case it makes a decision and then usually delivers a judgment or a an opinion about what the law is A judgment or courts opinion explains how the court reached its decision and it is a guide for later courts that need to decide similar cases The case sets a precedent The judgments of higher courts will commonly tell lower courts how they must decide a case on the same or very similar facts  if so the precedent is said to be binding Even if the facts are different the reasoning in the case may still be considered by the court as persuasive

Even though courts follow precedent legislation is still important in common law countries In fact it is usually more powerful than precedent For example if legislation and precedent say different or opposite things a court will usually have to follow the legislation

In common law countries many important areas of law are mostly made by precedent For example in England and Wales and in most states of the United States the law of contracts and torts is mostly made by precedent

In a common law country sometimes the words common law are used to mean the law that the courts have made For example a lawyer or judge might say that a case can be decided using only common law This means that no legislation helps decide the case

The words common law also sometimes mean the system of law that existed in England in the 1700s and 1800s At that time England had two different court systems One was called equity and one was called common law Law was mostly for ordering people to pay money and equity was mostly for other kinds of cases Today in most places there are not two separate systems and courts sometimes say that they work with both common law and equity

Non statutory law bases on the sources of law other than statutory law Its authority rests not on legislation passed by Parliament andor Administration and eventually codified but rather tradition custom and precedent But like the case of the wiring regulations that are non statutory you can still be prosecuted if they are not abided by

Statutory law is written law set down by a legislature or other governing authority such as the executive branch of government in response to a need to clarify the functioning of government improve civil order answer a public need to codify existing law or for an individual or company to obtain special treatment 

The term codified law is sometimes used as a synonym for statutory law in general In some US states the entire body of statutory law is referred to as a code such as the Ohio Revised Code At the federal and state level in the United States portions of the statutory law are also referred to as code such as the US Bankruptcy Code

An oral law are rules of human behavior in use in a given culture religion or other groupe which is transmitted by oral tradition and respected or a single rule that is orally transmitted

Many cultures do have an oral law while most legal systems of today have a formal written organisation

An oral tradition or oral culture is a way of transmitting history literature or law from one generation to the next in a civilization without a writing system by telling stories and talking An example that combined aspects of oral literature and oral history before being written down is the Homeric poetry of the Iliad and the Odyssey

The Royal Canadian Air Cadets is a program for Canadian youth It is supported by sponsors in the community and Canadas Canadian Forces funded by the Department of National Defence There are about 450 Air Cadet squadrons in every province and territory in Canada The two other cadet programs for youth in Canada are the Royal Canadian Sea Cadets and the Royal Canadian Army Cadets People between the ages of 12 and 18 can join this program for free and they are led by the officers of the Canadian Forces Cadet Instructor Cadre

The aim of the Air Cadets is to develop in youth the attributes of good citizenship and leadership promote physical fitness and to stimulate the interest of youth in the sea land and air activities of the Canadian Forces The Motto of the Air Cadets is To Learn To Serve To Advance

The rank system in Air Cadets is founded in that ranking system used by the former Royal Canadian Air Force with some modifications Royal Canadian Air Cadets are not part of the Canadian Forces and do not have to join the Canadian forces

1 Air Cadet When people first join Air Cadets they get the rank of an Air Cadet 

2 Leading Air Cadet After someone joins and often takes part in the Air Cadet training for five months they hold the rank of a leading Air Cadet 

3 Corporal A corporal is a non commissioned officer To become a corporal an air cadet has to be a Leading Air Cadet first and finish Level 1 of Air Cadets successfully

4 Flight Corporal A new rank recently introduced in Sept 2007 as the first earned position of the chain of command It is required that you have received the rank of corporal and successfully completed level 2

5 Sergeant To become a sergeant an Air Cadet to be a flight corporal for at least 6 months and successfully finish Level 2 training in air cadets It is better is they also complete a Familiarization Summer Course but a cadet does not have to take this course to become a Sergeant

6 Flight Sergeant To become a Flight Sergeant an Air Cadet must be a sergeant for six months and successfully complete the level three training They do not have to take and complete a Introductory Speciality Summer Course but it is not mandatory

7 Warrant Officer Second Class

8 Warrant Officer First Class

In law a precedent or authority is a legal case that established a principle or rule that a court may need to adopt when deciding subsequent cases with similar issues or facts 

The term may also refer to the collective body of case law that a court should consider when interpreting the law When a precedent establishes an important legal principle or represents new or changed law on a particular issue that precedent is often known as a landmark decision

Precedent is very important in a fair legal system because it can allow the law to be enforced equally to all cases For example if a person crashes a car because they are drunk the resulting court case will set a precedent for all similar cases If a later case has a different result the precedent may be changed If we did not have this system then it is likely that the law would not be fairly enforced

A legal case is a dispute between two parties that is resolved by a court or other legal process A legal case may be either civil or criminal

Nasal hair are small hair like cells in the nose Most of them can be found near the nostrils The purpose of these hairs is to act as a filter keeping dust and dirt out of the nasal passages They also draw liquid mucus up from the epithelium by capillary action In that way they help to maintain humidity in the air passages and stop them from drying out The hairs trap moisture as air is breathed out The evaporation of trapped moisture on the hairs increases the humidity of air as it is breathed in Note that nasal hair is different from the cilia found in the nose which are part of the olfactory system

Some cultures consider nose hair coming out from the nostrils to be ugly The increased growth of nasal cilia with age is often a source of anxiety and embarrassment A number of devices have been sold to trim the nose hair including small rotary clippers and attachments for electric shavers However given the role of nasal cilia many doctors recommend trimming them lightly if at all There is evidence that the movement in the ciliar slows down with age This may be the reason that old people have more respiratory infections

Before the Willis Tower was completed the tallest building in the world was the World Trade Center In 1996 the Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia became the worlds tallest buildings The Willis Tower is still the tallest building in the world from ground to pinnacle because it has two television antennas on top of it From the ground to the top of the taller antenna is 527 m

Beetles the order Coleoptera are the largest group of insects There are 350000 different species of beetles which have been named thats about 40 of all known insects There are an estimated 800000 to a million living species Beetles live almost everywhere though not in the ocean or in places that are very cold such as Antarctica

Beetles went through a massive adaptive radiation early in their evolutionary history The evolution of flowering plants helped drive the diversification of beetles Four of the six biggest families of beetles are mainly angiosperm feeders 

People sometimes call some beetles by other names Fireflies are actually beetles so are ladybirds or ladybugs which biologists call lady beetles

In common with other insects there are three main parts to a beetles body the head the thorax and the abdomen On the head beetles have antennae eyes and a mouth The legs and wings of the beetle are attached to the thorax The abdomen of a beetle does not usually have special parts on the outside but it has the beetles intestines inside Like other insects beetles have no internal bones but instead have a hard exoskeleton on the outside of the body The exoskeleton is made of hard plates of chitin

Beetles differ from other flying insects because their front wings have evolved into hard covers or elytra The back wings are used for flying They are thin and are kept under the elytra when at rest Beetles lift their leytra out of the way in order to fly A few species of true bugs have a similar arrangement

Not all beetles can fly Some beetles do not have back wings and some beetles cannot lift their front wings out of the way Only a few beetles have no wings at all and can never fly Some beetles with no wings look like larvae and are called larviform

The legs of beetles help them to walk run swim and dig All beetles have six legs Each leg is made out of several parts The parts on the end of each leg are called tarsi The last tarsus of each beetle foot has one or two claws on the end of it Most beetles use their legs to walk or run Some beetle legs are flat and have long hairs on them These kinds of legs are found on water beetles Beetles that often dig in soil have flat legs with spines or horns at the edges Flat legs with horns are called fossorial legs A few beetles have large hind legs similar to those of grasshoppers which help the beetle to jump Flea beetles are an example of jumping beetle

Beetles have compound eyes which means the two big shiny eyes on the head are actually made out of many smaller parts Sometimes the two eyes are each divided in half so that it looks like there are four eyes One beetle family the whirligig beetles has divided eyes so that when they are swimming they can see on top of the water and inside the water at the same time A few beetles have extra simple eyes called ocelli The ocelli are on the top of the beetles head

Because beetles have no nose they use their antennae to smell things Beetles also use their antennae to feel things around them Some beetles use their antennae to fight other beetles or even to fight larger animals that want to eat them Beetle antennae do not all look the same Some antennae are long and thin while others are short and wide Thin antennae are called filiform antennae and antennae that are wide on the end are called clavate antennae

The mouth of a beetle is very different from the mouth of a person Most beetles have two hard mandibles at the front of their mouth which are a bit like teeth Mandibles help the beetle eat by crushing and cutting food In some beetles the mandibles look like big pincers Beetles also have four fingers around their mouth that push food into the mouth of the beetle These fingers are called palpi

Beetles do not breathe instead they have holes called spiracles in the sides of their bodies which lead to trachea which act like lungs Beetles do not have blood but they have something like blood called haemolymph It is a green colour Thats because their haemoglobin molecule has a copper atom at its centre wheras ours has an iron atom there

Beetles start out as eggs that a female beetle lays Some beetles can lay thousands of eggs during their lives A larva comes out when an egg hatches Most beetle larvae do not look like adult beetles A beetle larva eats and grows larger until it changes and becomes a pupa When the pupa opens an adult beetle sometimes called an imago comes out This way of growing up is called complete metamorphosis

Beetles eat the most when they are larvae Some beetle larvae eat the outside of plants some eat inside plants Some beetle larvae are predators which means they hunt for other insects to eat Other beetle larvae eat dead things such as dead plants and dead animals

Not all beetle larvae look the same Some beetle larvae are flat and move very fast To describe these larvae scientists use the descriptive word campodeiform Some beetle larvae look similar to hard worms with tiny legs These have an elateriform shape Click beetle larvae have a special name wireworms Other beetle larvae are short and very thick and are called grubs In a few beetles the larvae change their shape after some time Blister beetle larvae start out moving fast such as campodeiform larvae but end up slow and thick

Beetles eat many different things including living plants rotting plants animals that may be dead or alive and animal feces Some beetles can eat both plants and animals while others you eat just one type of food Beetles that can only eat one kind of thing are said to be host specific Many leaf beetles and longhorn beetles are host specific

Beetles are tough animals for their size They are mechanically tough and have a variety of strategies to avoid being attacked by predators or parasitoids These include camouflage mimicry toxicity and active defense

Some beetles live in places that are hard for predators to find Some beetles such as longhorn beetles live in tunnels inside tree branches Only special predators that are small enough to use the long horned beetle tunnels can eat the longhorn beetles

Other beetles do not live in special places but they have colours or shapes that make them hard to find When beetles have colours so that predators cannot see them this is called camouflage Some leaf beetles are green so that they can not be seen when they are on green leaves Some beetles have very complex colours so that they look like bird faeces

Sometimes beetles use colour to warn predators Some beetles have black and yellow stripes so that they look similar to bees and wasps Some beetles even behave similar to bees to confuse predators 

Beetles have a wide range of chemical defences mostly got from plants their larvae eat These chemicals make them taste bad when predators eat them Blister beetles are so poisonous that if a horse eats only a few of them the horse may die Bombardier beetles squirt hot poisonous liquid at attackers Lady beetles put out a cyanide compound when molested Lady beetles also have colours that warn predators that they taste bad Insects which taste foul use warning colours which birds learn about and avoid Also other species which are tasty copy those warning colours This is called mimicry and is quite common in insects

Very large beetles sometimes fight predators Beetles that fight will often use their mandibles as teeth to bite their predators

Beetles have sexual reproduction which means males and females mate in order to make offspring

Before reproduction male beetles sometimes fight to claim a female This especially happens with stag beetles males will fight using their long mandibles

Some beetles give special care to their eggs or larvae Some scarab beetles called dung beetles roll balls of dung and put them in a hole in the ground The female lays her eggs in the dung When the eggs hatch the larvae will eat the dung that their mother supplied for them

Different kinds of beetles can be divided into groups called families There are many beetle families The biggest families are listed here

Some beetles cause trouble for farmers and people in forests because they eat crops or trees These beetles are called pests One beetle that hurts crops is the Colorado beetle another is the Maize weevil One that destroys trees is the Emerald ash borer

Other beetles help people lady beetles eat insects that hurt crops and trees

People who study beetles are called coleopterists

John IX was Pope from 898 to 900 He was a Benedictine monk He was made Pope because of the support of Emperor Lambert of Spoleto Lambert was of the Formosian party Pope Sergius III who had been elected by the Anti Formosians was chased from office with arms John IX died unexpectedly in the year 900 which again led to feuds between different groups

Joseph Arthur Comte de Gobineau was a French aristocrat He was well educated and wrote many things He became famous for developing the racialist theory of the Aryan Master race in his book An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races 

A staff is the name given to the five horizontal lines on which we can write music  Musical notes can be placed either on a line or in a space There are four inside spaces as well as the two outer spaces at the top or bottom The higher the pitch of the note the higher it will be on the staff  Taking the white notes of a keyboard each note is placed higher on the stave A clef is needed to show which notes they are There are different clefs to suit high medium or low instruments

This musical example shows the opening of Symphony no 5 by Beethoven The first three notes are on the second line They are Gs because there is a treble clef at the beginning of the staff The fourth note is a little lower on the bottom line the E line The next note is between the other two in pitch After the three Fs comes a D in the outside bottom space

Sometimes composers have used staves with fewer or more than 5 lines but the five line staff started to become the usual one in Western music in the 13th century

When notes are a little too high or low to put on the stave extension lines are used These are called leger lines 

If two or more staves are being played at the same time the staves are joined on the left by a bracket which is called a brace Piano music for example is written on two staves one for the right hand and one for the left

Instruments that only play a rhythm do not need a stave The notes can be written just on one line The beats are crosses

In an orchestral or vocal score the staves that are bracketed together are called a system If the whole orchestra are playing there will only be room for one system on each page but in places where only a few instruments are playing there may be two or three systems on a page to save space and unnecessary turning

The Colorado potato beetle Leptinotarsa decemlineata is a beetle It is sometimes just called the Colorado beetle It is one of the worst potato pests in the world 

The beetle is notable for its ability to resist pesticides Over the last 50 years it has become resistant to 52 chemical compounds used in insecticides including cyanide However not every population is resistant to every chemical

The Colorado beetle first lived in the southwest United States and northern Mexico Now it lives in most of North America and also in Europe and Asia

The Colorado potato beetle now eats cultivated potato plants Both larvae and adults eat the leaves and strip the plant down to a skeleton They may also attack tomato and eggplants There can be so many Colorado potato beetles in potato farms that they destroy the potatoes

Because the beetle rapidly evolves resistance to chemicals the best defence may be biological control A ground beetle Lebia grandis is a predator of the eggs and larvae and its larvae are parasitoids of the Colorado beetles pupae 

Beauveria bassiana is a pathogenic fungus that infects many insects including the Colorado beetle It is probably the most widely used natural enemy of the Colorado beetle There are commercial formulations that can be applied using a pesticide sprayer 

The Colorado potato beetle did not always eat potato plants This is because potatoes came from South America not near the beetles original range Before people brought potatoes to North America the Colorado beetle ate a plant called buffalo bur

The Harvestmen are eight legged arachnids Although they belong to the class of arachnids harvestmen are not spiders They belong to the order Opiliones or Phalangids 

More than 6400 species of harvestmen have been discovered although the real number of extant species may exceed 10000 Well preserved fossils have been found in the 400 million year old Rhynie cherts of Scotland The samples found look surprisingly modern Apparently the basic structure of the harvestmen has not changed much since then 

In some places harvestmen are known by the name daddy longlegs but this name is also used for two other unrelated arthropods the crane fly and the cellar spider

Many species are omnivores they eat anything they can find Most of the time this is small insects and some plants and fungi Some are scavengers 

Harvestmen are not dangerous to humans None of the described species has poison glands They are not true spiders even though they look like spiders in many ways For example harvestmen have no venom or silk glands spiders have these

These arachnids have exceptionally long walking legs compared to body size although there are also short legged species In harvestmen the two main body sections are broadly joined so that they appear to be one oval structure they also have no venom or silk glands unlike true spiders In more advanced species the first five abdominal segments are often fused into a dorsal shield called the scutum which is normally fused with the carapace In some species this shield is only present in males The second pair of legs is longer than the others and works as antennae This can be hard to see in short legged species

The feeding apparatus differs from other arachnids chunks of food can be taken in rather than liqids Most species have a single pair of eyes in the middle of their heads oriented sideways However there are some eyeless species

Daddy Longlegs could mean

The Shikon no Tama is the fictional magic jewel in the anime and manga series InuYasha It is called the Jewel of Four Souls because it has four souls of 4 different names Aramitama Nigimitama Kushimitama and Sakimitama The souls can make a person very powerful

When Midoriko was about to die fighting a demon she joined her 4 soul inside her heart with the soul of the demon to make it good and pure By doing that she killed herself and the demon This created the Shikon jewel Inside it Midoriko and the demon souls still fought each other This battle is depends to the person who has the jewel The jewel can become pure or impure Many creatures want the jewel because it can make them powerful like Midoriko They can do anything they want with it If someone wants to become a full demon then they will become that just like Naraku wants to 

After many fights of different demons and humans Shako Sangos grandpa found the jewel from a demon called Mistress Centipede The jewel was impure because it had been with the evil Mistress Centipede He took the jewel to Kikyo Only the goodness of Kikyos priestesss power could purify it and make it good But when Kikyo is burnt because she dies by Naraku wanting the jewel and killing her and she wants the jewel to burn and destroy along with her Kagome Kikyos reincarnation gets the jewel even so and when Mistress Centipedes bones inside the well become alive with the jewels power when Kagome comes near she is dragged into the well and the past where everything happened Kagome shatters the jewel by accident when she shoots a crow which swallowed it and has to find all the pieces before evil creatures do with Inuyasha 

Some people tried to make shikon no tama themselves so that they can have its power without trying to find all the pieces Izumo a half demon who turns to a demon at night but a human at day is a clever alchemist who likes nature and the world He is the one who knows how to make a shikon no tama and a frog demon with some other demons grab him so that they can start making a fake shikon no tama Izumo agrees and makes many copies of shikon no tamas which only has small power He said to the frog demon that to make the copies like the real one they had to collect the souls of people with Aramitama Nigimitama Kushimitama and Sakimitama When Inuyasha and his friends come to save Izumo who plans to get them because of his friends having the souls that he needed to make a real shikon no tama 

Inuyasha had the soul of Aramitama Shippo with Nigimitama Miroku with Kushimitama and Sango with Sakimitama Kagome tries to save her friends who are inside the frog eggs made by the frog demon and in the end he is killed together with Izumo in his half demon form Kagome was sad because she felt for Izumo but they carried on their adventure anyway 

The Daddy Long Legs Spider is a spider of the family Pholcidae Its legs are about 5 or 6 times the length of its body It is often confused with the daddy long legs a member of the Opiliones which are not true spiders P phalangioides has the habit of shaking the web violently when disturbed This is probably to blur the vision of a predator Because it is often found on the ceilings of rooms caves or cellars it is also called cellar spider They can easily catch and eat hairy house spiders mosquitoes and other insects When food is scarce they will prey on their own kind Because they originally came from the tropics these spiders do not seem to be aware of seasonal changes and breed at any time of the year 

The female holds 20 to 30 eggs in her jaws Spiderlings are transparent with short legs and change their skin about 5 or 6 times as they grow

Females have a body length of about 9mm males are slightly smaller

Crossopriza lyoni and Physocyclus globosis are spiders with a very similar appearance

Crane flies are a type of fly in the family Tipulidae They are insects Crane flies look like big mosquitoes Unlike mosquitoes crane flies do not bite people or animals

There are about 4000 different kinds or species of crane flies This means that the Tipulidae are the largest group of flies Most crane fly species were found by Charles P Alexander 

People in different places call crane flies different names Most of these names are only used by people in small areas Some of the other names for crane flies are mosquito hawks mosquito eaters gallinippers and jimmy spinners In the United Kingdom they are most commonly referred to as Daddy Long Legs but in the United States the name Daddy Long Legs is given to arachnids that look like thin spiders and that scientists call Opiliones 

Adult crane flies are long and thin They have very long legs and a long thin abdomen It is very easy to accidentally break off their delicate legs when catching crane flies This may help them to escape from birds who try to eat them Females have larger abdomens in comparison to the males The female abdomen also ends in a pointed ovipositor that looks a bit like a stinger Crane flies cannot sting

The wings are often held out from the body when the crane fly is not moving When the wings are held out the large halteres can be seen behind the wings Unlike mosquitoes crane flies can not fly well They will sometimes wobble when flying 

Crane flies that live in temperate places such as Tipula species may grow as big as 60 mm in size Tropical crane flies may grow to more than 100 mm The Giant Crane Fly that lives in the western United States can reach 38 mm There are also small crane flies called bobbing gnats These are the size of mosquitoes but you can tell they are not mosquitoes by the V shaped suture on the middle part of their body the thorax Crane flies also do not have ocelli which are extra tiny eyes on the top of their heads

Larvae of crane flies are divided into segments They have a distinct head capsule on the front The segments on the rear portion of the larva often have long fleshy projections Scientists have never seen the larvae from most crane fly species less than 2 of the larvae are known

Even though crane flies look like mosquitoes they do not bite humans They also do not eat mosquitoes Adult crane flies eat nectar or they do not eat at all most adult crane flies only mate and then die once they become adults

Crane fly larvae are called leatherjackets or leatherjacket slugs because of the way they move and eat roots and other vegetation Leatherjackets can sometimes cause damage to plants Because of this people sometimes think crane flies are a pest of lawn grass in some areas Some leatherjackets are aquatic which means they live in water

Many birds eat crane flies

1 Oosterbroek Pjotr Tipulidae 

Neville became a successful manager in a manufacturing company In 1911 when he was 42 the people of Birmingham elected him to be part of the city council On the council he had the job of planning improving the city the same kind of work his father had done He planned new houses for poor people In 1915 he became Lord Mayor of Birmingham also as his father had done In this job he did work to improve the city including starting the Birmingham Symphony Orchestra

In 1916 the prime minister Lloyd George asked Chamberlain to manage the department in control of conscription making civilians become soldiers in times of war Chamberlain and Lloyd George often argued and soon they did not like each other Chamberlain left the job the next year Instead he entered the 1918 general election and became the Conservative Member of Parliament for Ladywood in Birmingham

In 1923 the prime minister Andrew Bonar Law made Chamberlain the health minister In this job Chamberlain did more work to help poor people For example he made a law that connected rent prices to how good the building was Chamberlain was then Chancellor of the Exchequer in charge of the economy for a short time After the 1924 general election he became health minister again where he stayed until the Conservatives lost the 1929 general election Between 1924 and 1929 Chamberlain helped to make many new laws to help poor people including a pensions system that helped to make Britains welfare state after the Second World War

In 1929 the Conservatives lost the general election and Ramsay MacDonald became the new Labour prime minister At this time the Conservative party was trying to put tariffs on imports to make trade in the British Empire stronger Other people including Lord Beaverbrook a businessman who owned a lot of newspapers disagreed saying that trade should be free Lord Beaverbrook started a new party to fight the Conservatives Chamberlain fought Beaverbrooks part in an election and won This made him very popular in the Conservative party

An economic crisis in 1931 led to another general election After the election Chamberlain became Chancellor of the Exchequer In this position he worked to cancel debts from the war In 1932 he was able to start a tariff system His father Joseph Chamberlain had spent a long time working for a stronger British Empire when he was foreign secretary He also worked hard for a tariff system before he died because he believed it would make the Empire economically independent Neville was pleased to make his fathers wishes come true

By 1934 Chamberlain felt that the economy had recovered However at this time many important people including Chamberlains half brother Austen and Winston Churchill were warning that Nazi Germany was broken wikt linkrearmrearming These men said that Britain must rearm too In July 1934 the government told parliament that it had a plan to make the Royal Air Force much stronger 

However not everybody was happy to see an arms race The First World War was still in peoples memories and there was a pacifist feeling in the country Chamberlain advised the prime minister Stanley Baldwin to talk about rearmament in the 1935 general election Baldwin was worried people would not vote for them if they talked about making the military stronger so he talked about housing and unemployment instead

Chamberlain worked hard with a slow economy The government bought factories that were not being used and spent money making them new again This idea helped when the war began because Britain had the most modern equipment When he announced his budget in 1935 the Labour party said he wanted war Other people still said he was not doing enough to build the military In 1936 the government announced plans to build the Royal Navy

Stanley Baldwin retired in 1937 and Chamberlain became the new prime minister on the 28th May Chamberlain is mostly remembered for being the prime minister as Europe moved into the Second World War but as prime minister he also made some important changes in Britain He made laws that made working conditions better He limited working hours for women and children He introduced paid holiday for a large part of the population He laws to try to make the population healthier by exercising and medical inspection Many other changes were planned but the start of the war stopped these changes from happening

In the 1930s the Irish Taoiseach was amon de Valera de Valera worked to make a new constitution for Ireland He wanted to make Ireland independent from Britain Ireland had its own government but Britain still controlled Northern Ireland and had naval ports in Ireland de Valera wanted this control to stop Chamberlain wanted Ireland to support Britain if there was a war because he knew that without Irish help defending the Atlantic Ocean would be difficult Chamberlain and his Secretary of State Malcolm MacDonald made an agreement to give the treaty ports back to Ireland but hoped that British warships might use them in the war

Many Conservatives including Winston Churchill disagreed strongly with this plan This agreement together with a plan to limit the number of Jewish people moving into Palestine made Chamberlain unpopular with many people

Although many people warned about the threat of Nazi Germany Chamberlain only chose ministers that agreed with him and wanted to avoid war Chamberlain together with many people of the same age were very worried about war They believed that people like Adolf Hitler were in power because their people felt that their situation was unfair German people felt that the Treaty of Versailles was unfair When Nazi Germany broken wikt linkinvadeinvaded Austria and the Sudetenland Chamberlain tried to keep peace 

In September 1938 he flew to Munich to speak with Hitler Together with the French prime minister douard Daladier and the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini he made an agreement with Hitler Hitler was allowed to control the Sudetenland but had to agree not to use his military to solve future disputes When Chamberlain returned home many people said he had done a wonderful job Chamberlain was very pleased and said that the agreement meant peace for our time

In March of 1939 the German military moved in to control the rest of Czechoslovakia This was against the Munich agreement Chamberlain realised that his attempts to control Hitler had failed He started to get Britain ready for war using the new factories that had been built Many new weapons were built including the Supermarine Spitfire and radar When the Germans invaded Poland on 1st September 1939 the British and the French talked together and decided to declare war on Germany Chamberlain spoke on the radio and told the British people that war had begun

Chamberlain made a new government and included Winston Churchill After the Germans invaded Norway in April 1940 the British sent a naval force to fight them The plan was not a success however and parliament no longer supported Chamberlain on 10 May 1940 Chamberlain resigned Churchill became the prime minister but Chamberlain stayed in the government Later in May Germany offered conditions for peace Most of the government including Chamberlain wanted to agree with Germany and stop fighting Churchill did not want to agree with Germany He spoke with Chamberlain and soon Chamberlain began to agree with Churchill The result was that Britain stayed in the war

In the summer of 1940 Chamberlain became sick In July he had an operation on his stomach to treat cancer He tried to return to work but became too weak and had to retire He died on 9 November 1940 of bowel cancer He was 71 years old Winston Churchill spoke to parliament to tell them about Chamberlains death He praised Chamberlain as a good honest man

People disagree about the history of Chamberlain Some people think that his actions were wrong because he did not stop Hitler Other people say that he gave Britain and France more time to get ready for war 

commonsATTAC The Association pour la Taxation des Transactions pour lAide aux Citoyens is an organization that promotes a tax on foreign exchange transactions the so called Tobin tax 

At first Attac demanded only the introduction of the so called Tobin tax on currency speculation Now it fights for many issues related to globalisation Therefore it reports about the decisions of the World Trade Organisation the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and the International Monetary Fund ATTAC attends the meetings of the G8 with the goal of influencing policymakers decisions

Though ATTAC criticises the neoliberal ideology dominating economic globalisation it is not anti globalisation It supports globalisation policies that they characterise as sustainable and socially just One of ATTACs slogans is The World is not for sale denouncing the merchandisation of society

A threat is a declaration of intention to inflict punishment or harm on another It will often be conditional upon a particular course of action on the part of the recipient

The threat can have a form of an explicit or implicit message 

It can also be any source of probable impending danger or a warning of an impending danger

Fireflies are a family of beetles called the Lampyridae These beetles are special in that most of them have bioluminescence the ability to produce light They are sometimes called lightning bugs or forest stars There are about 2000 different species most of which are nocturnal

Adults use flashes of light to attract mates Also firefly larvae flash their lights to warn predators that they are not a tasty meal Many predators do not like the taste of firefly larvae

A firefly is an insect so it has an exoskeleton and three body parts Their exoskeleton gives protection The body parts are the head thorax and abdomen The head has small eyes and long antennae

On a fireflys thorax there are six jointed legs At the end of their legs fireflies have claws 

A firefly can be brown or black with yellow and red marks

All fireflies glow as larvae Bioluminescence serves a different function in lampyrid larvae than it does in adults It appears to be a warning signal to predators since many firefly larvae contain chemicals that are distasteful or toxic

Light in adult beetles was originally thought to used for similar warning purposes but its main purpose is now thought to be mate selection Fireflies are a classic example of an organism that uses bioluminescence for sexual selection They have evolved a variety of ways to communicate with mates in courtships steady glows flashing and the use of chemical signals unrelated to photic systems

Fireflies live in tropical climates in the United States Latin America Caribbean Island and South East Asia They also live east of Rocky Mountains Fireflies like to live in damp areas and dry areas Examples of damp areas are rain forests streams marshes ponds and leaf piles Examples of dry areas are backyards and meadows 

Most species live in marshes or near water because there their larvae have more than enough food

Phengodidae is a family of glow worm beetles Their larvae are also glow worms

The family occurs only in the New World and has about 30 genera Both the females and larvae are bioluminescent they have organs that can produce light This family is different from the fireflies

The larvae and the females are predators They feed on millipedes and other animals they find in the soil and litter Males are winged They are attracted to lights at night They are probably short lived and do not feed at all In some species adult males can also produce light Females have organs that produce a green or yellow light on their trunks Some of them also have such an organ in front which can produce a red light

Arachnocampa is a family of flies They are also called Fungus gnats They occur in Australia and New Zealand Their larvae are glowworms

They were called Bolitphila until 1924 Then people found out that their larvae use silk threads to catch prey Their current name means spider grub

Debate or debating is a formal method of argument 

It is a larger form of argument than logical argument because in a debate the debaters try to influence the feelings of the hearers in order to persuade them on a topic Disputes and conflicts may be settled by debate

Informal debates like discussion are very common but the quality of a debate improves with knowledge and skill of its participants as debaters 

Deliberative bodies such as parliaments legislative assemblies and meetings of all sorts have debates The winner of a debate may be decided by the audiences vote by judges or by both 

Formal debates between candidates for a elected office are quite common in places where leaders of countries are chosen by the people The most well known of these debates are between candidates for the President and Vice President of the United States and leaders debates between leaders of parties in Parliament in countries like Great Britain and Canada

Ando was born to Taiwanese parents in Kagi Taiwan and grew up an orphan in Tainan City In 1948 Momofuku Ando founded what was to become Nissin in Ikeda Osaka Japan It was a small family run company at first

On August 25 1958 at the age of 48 and after months of trial and error experimentation Ando announced that he had finally perfected his flash frying method and therefore invented the instant noodle Called Chikin Ramen after the original flavour it was originally considered a luxury food item as it cost around six times that of traditional non instant udon and soba noodles Ando began sales of the Cup noodles on September 18 1971 As prices dropped ramen soon became a booming business An estimated 70 billion servings were sold in 2004

In 1964 looking for a way to promote the instant noodle industry Ando founded the Instant Food Industry Association which set guidelines for fair competition and product quality introducing several industry standards such as the inclusion of production dates on packaging The Momofuku Ando Instant Ramen Museum is named after Ando

Ando was also the chairman of the International Ramen Manufacturers Association He died on January 5 2007 of heart failure in Osaka Prefecture at the age of 96

A demon or daemon is a bad or powerful being in many world religions The word is also used for a type of computer program that does useful things in the background of a computer but this use is not related to the religious meaning 

A demon is usually thought to be a supernatural creature that is a bad spirit Demons are often described as being called by someone and then working in a bad way To demonize means to make someone appear evil 

In a few writings there are also good demons for example in stories by James Clerk Maxwell Hesiod and Shakespeare In Indo European mythology and traditions of Iranian Avestan and Vedic the idea of demons was there for many years Ancient Egyptians thought of demons as monsters that ate souls of people when they went to the afterlife In ancient Greek mythology there are also daemons but they were thought to be invisible protectors that they believed protect them In the book Northern Lights by Philip Pullman a daemon is said to be a creature that everyone has as part of the body So if it is far away from someone that person would feel hurt

In the Greek New Testament and Hebrew Old Testament demons are said to be bad In Hebrew demons are called seirim In other Hebrew writings they do not come from heaven but came from another world and made much troubles They gave diseases too And they have a prince who is not God but a demon

In Hinduism demons are called asuras Patala is thought to be an underground place below the Earth where humans live Asura means supernatural beings that were good or bad People who do evil and horrible things in their lives by reincarnation will turn into evil ghost spirits called Vetalas Pishachas Bhtas

In Islam Djinns are creatures that cannot be seen by people most of the time made of fire with special powers to help and harm people but in Islam djinns must serve and obey God

Monotheistic religions usually teach that demons are rebels and under Gods authority at all times The English poet John Milton describes Satan as rebelling against God but losing and being allowed to survive only by Gods grace In some polytheistic religions demons are equal to gods In Hinduism the demon goddess Kali represents destruction and thus from a human standpoint is bad

The grimoire called Ars Goetia writes about 72 demons that a king has called and put in a bronze container sealed by magical symbols The demons had to do whatever the king said This book is all about spirits and demons good and evil that were called by magic The word demon has different meanings all over the world but often there is the idea that they are spirits that lived in a place or went with a person 

Christians believe that demons were bad angels that went to bad ways instead of good ways Angels were like humans God asked them if they wanted to stay with him or to go away from himFactdateMarch 2009 Those angels who became demons because they wanted to go away fought against God who won the battle with MichaelFactdateMarch 2009 God sent the bad demons into a prison called Hell and they could not see God now for the punishment Those demons are called the fallen angels 

Some say that the demons go back to heaven after asking forgiveness of their bad doingsFactdateMarch 2009 But others say they stay in that prison forever The demons go into the prison also because of marrying a human woman when they are not supposed to The fictional Inuyasha has some demons marrying a human as well

In InuYasha a fictional manga yokais cannot die easily but humans do and yokais get old more slowly than humans They are also creatures that have supernatural powers and most of them are evil A half demon is a child made by human and a demon married together  so its half demon and half human

A daemon is a type of program found in computers running operating systems based on Unix like Linux BSD and Mac OS X It usually starts when the computer starts and does useful things Some daemons start other programs after waiting until a certain time of day or wait for you to ask for a file from another computer The term is a reference to Maxwells Demon not religion

The Central Bank bombing was one of the deadliest terrorist attacks of the civil war in Sri Lanka between the government and the Tamil militant LTTE group

The attack happened on January 31 1996 in Colombo the capital city of Sri Lanka A truck with about 440 pounds of high explosives crashed through the main gate of the Central Bank a seaside building which managed most of the financial business of the country As gunmen and security guards were shooting the suicide bomber in the truck detonated the massive bomb which badly damaged the bank and damaged eight other buildings nearby

The explosion killed 90 people and injured 1400 others Most of these were ordinary citizens or civilians working in the small shops set up near the bank This bombing was followed by one in July on a train that killed more than 70

Until 2006 the Central Bank bombing was the deadliest LTTE terrorist bombing 

A ledger line is a short line used to write notes which would otherwise be too high or too low for the staff A short line is drawn parallel to the lines on the staff and the note head is placed on that line or in the space below or above it

Notes more than two or three leger lines below the treble clef stave or two or three leger lines above the bass clef stage are rarely used It is usually easier to change the clef

Notes more than four or five leger lines above the treble clef stave or below the bass clef stage also become hard to read These very high or very low notes are easier to read if an 8va sign followed by little dots is placed above or below the notes This means they are to be played an octave higher than written

The piccolo always sounds an octave higher than the music written and the double bass always sounds an octave lower than written Some wind instruments also transpose up or down an octave to make it easier to read eg the bass clarinet sounds a ninth lower than the music which is written in the treble clef

A clef is a sign at the beginning of a staff of music which makes it possible for the player to work out what the notes are The word clef is a French word meaning key The original Latin word is clavis It is the key to understanding which notes should be played 

The staff consists of five lines across the page The notes are placed on these lines and in these spaces The staff is only large enough to cover one and a half octaves of music Therefore different clefs are used for high music and for low music

The treble clef is drawn by starting with a circle in the middle then going up round and straight down with a hook at the end The second line of the staff goes through the middle of the treble clefs circle A note on this line is a G This is why the treble clef is called a G clef The treble clef is used for high notes The notes higher than Middle C can be written in the treble clef In piano music the right hand is usually written in the treble clef Music for instruments such as the violin flute oboe recorder trumpet and high singing voice are always written in the treble clef

The alto clef is an example of a C clef The middle of a C clef points to Middle C In the alto clef Middle C is on the third line of the staff  Viola music is written in this clef which is why it is also called the viola clef Alto trombone players also need to be able to read the alto clef

The tenor clef is another C clef Middle C is on the fourth line up Tenor trombone players need to be able to read the tenor clef Cellists Double bass players and bassoonists also need to read tenor clef when their music goes high

The bass clef is normally used for the left hand in piano music Low instruments like the cello double bass and bassoon mostly read from the bass clef It is an F clef because the two dots are on either side of the fourth line up which is an F below Middle C

The choice of clef used depends on the music The music for a pianists left hand may be written in the bass clef and the right hand notes may be in the treble clef

In choral music the sopranos and altos sing from the treble clef the tenors usually sing from the treble clef but sounding an octave lower than written and the basses sing from the bass clef for low bass intoments

A Tobin tax is a tax on all trade of currency across borders 

The first idea that it could be useful came from the economist James Tobin The tax is meant to put a penalty on short term speculation in currencies The proposed tax rate would be low between 01 to 025 

On August 15 1971 Richard Nixon told that it would no longer be possible to change the US dollar to gold so ended the Bretton Woods system Tobin suggested a new system for international currency stability and proposed that such a system include a charge on foreign exchange transactions Professor Tobin later received a Nobel Prize in Economics in 1981

The idea was nearly forgotten for more than 20 years In 1997 Ignacio Ramonet editor of Le Monde Diplomatique started the debate around the Tobin tax again with an editorial titled Disarming the markets Ramonet proposed to create an association for the introduction of this tax which was named ATTAC The tax has then become an issue of the antiglobalization movement and a matter of discussion not only behind academic institutions but even in the streets and in parliaments around the world such as the UK and France 

Since one country acting alone would find it very difficult to introduce this tax many argue it would be best done by an international institution It has been proposed that having the United Nations manage a Tobin tax would solve this problem and would give the UN a large source of funding independent from donations by participating states However there have been initiatives of national dimension about the tax

The Tobin tax idea was the subject of much discussion in Europe in the summer of 2001 On June 15 2004 the Commission of Finance and Budget in the Belgian Federal Parliament approved a bill implementing the Spahn tax According to the legislation Belgium will introduce the Tobin tax once all countries of the eurozone introduce a similar law

A penalty is most often a punishment and may also mean

In logic the truth value of a logical statement says how much it is true Usually the truth value can only be true or false For example The car is red is true when the car is red and false when it is not

In multi valued logics the truth value can be other values as well For example one could use a value between 0 and 1 to say how much it is true Zero would mean that it is completely false and one would mean that is completely true When the car is orange the truth value could be 05 because the statement is half true and half false

Theobroma is a genus There are about 20 species in it They are small trees native to the forests of Central and South America The name translates to food of the gods

Their family is given as Sterculiaceae or sometimes as Malvaceae

Some of these trees have edible seeds Best known are perhaps the Cacao tree the source of cocoa and chocolate Other well known trees are Cupuau and Mocambo 

Theobroma species are used as food plants by the larvae of some moths of the genus Endoclita including E chalybeatus E damor E hosei and E sericeus The larva of another moth Hypercompe muzina feeds exclusively on Theobroma cacao

Cupuau also spelled Cupuassu and Copoasu is a tropical rainforest tree related to Cacao Common throughout the Amazon basin it is widely cultivated in the north of Brazil The largest production occurs in Par followed by Amazonas Rondnia and Acre

Cupuau trees usually are between 5 and 15 meters tall Some trees can reach 20 meters They have brown bark Their leaves are 2535 cm long and 610 cm across These leaves have 9 or 10 pairs of veins As they mature their leaves change colour from pink tinted to green Eventually they begin bearing fruit Cupuau fruits are broken wikt linkoblongoblong brown and fuzzy 20 cm long 12 kg in weight and covered with a thick hard exocarp

Linear search or sequential search is an algorithm to find an item in a list Its a search algorithm

Start out with a list L which may have the item in question

In the programming language Java linear search looks like this This method has two parameters an array of integers and the item we are looking for It says the location in the array if it finds the item If it does not find it it says 1

Ros wine is a kind of wine It is made from red grapes by letting the juice have only very short skin contact All colour and tannins come from the skin of the grape

In programming languages an array is a way of storing several items These items must have the same type because an array can not store different kinds of items Every item in an array has a number so the programmer can get the item by using that number This number is called the index In some programming languages the first item has index 0 the second item has index 1 and so on But in some languages the first item has index 1

When the programmer creates an array heshe must give the size of the array This is the number of items that can be stored in the array If the programmer wants to store more items then heshe must create a new array This is because the size of an array can not be changed

In the programming language C arrays can be created like this

This creates an array of integers and it can store 5 integers The programmer can now store integers in the array by doing

The programmer can use a value in the array like this

In the programming language Java arrays can be created like this

This creates an array of integers and it can store 5 integers The programmer can now store integers in the array by doing

In music a Tierce de Picardie is a major chord at the end of a piece of music in a minor key

In the 16th and 17th centuries this was a very common way to end a piece in a minor key There is a scientific explanation for this Music in the minor sounds melancholy or disturbed in comparison to the major because the third note of the scale is flattened In the harmonic series this minor third is the 17th harmonic which sounds dissonant against the fundamental This means that ending in the major gives a sense of relief after the tension of the minor In a piece in A minor for example where the third note of the scale is C natural in a Tierce de Picardie the final chord will include a C sharp changing the chord from A minor to A major

Beethovens Fifth Symphony is in C minor but the last movement is in the major This is not a Tierce de Picardie in this case as the term applies only when just the last chord alters The term was introduced in 1767 by Rousseau in his Dictionnaire de musique Tierce means third but no one knows why he called it Picardie

Bach used it fairly often in his music The first movement of the Concerto for Two Violins and Orchestra is a good example In his Fantasia and Fugue in G minor BWV542 the fugue ends with a Tierce de Picardie and in some editions the Fantasie as well It is possible that Bach would have finished the Fantasie with a major chord only if he was playing it on its own but we cannot be sure of this Another famous piece that ends in a Tierce de Picardie is Greensleeves

The Boston Tea Party was a violent protest by American colonists against King George IIIs rule in America It happened on December 16 1773

The British government had been putting taxes on almost everything that Americans wanted to buy including tea The Americans had no one to speak for them in the British government They were mad that they were being taxed by the government but had no part in how the government was run They did not think it was right to pay taxes when they did not have a representative in the government Also merchants selling their goods would lose their profit because of the taxes The Americans began purchasing smuggled goods which were much cheaper

To show how angry they were a group of people named the Sons of Liberty dressed up as Native Americans and went onto ships in the Boston harbor They took boxes of tea and dumped them into the water This made the British government angry The British government made even harder laws for the people of the Massachusetts colony One of these laws was The Intolerable Acts which said that Boston harbor was closed until the colonists paid back all the tea they lost The Boston Tea Party was one of the main things that started the American Revolutionary War

A cookie is a sweet dessert made from flour Cookies are made in an oven They are also called biscuits in many English speaking countries except for the United States and Canada

Most cookies are flat and round like a disc Cookies often have flavors added to them like spices chocolate butter peanut butter nuts or dried fruits Most cookies are very sweet Today many people think of cookies with warmth and love Cookies may be used like chocolate and candy as an reward when children do good deeds

Even though it is close to cakes and other sweetened breads cookies usually do not use water for cohesion Water in cakes makes the base as thin as possible which allows the bubbles to form better Cookies do not have bubbles so they do not need this In cookies some form of oil or fat is used for cohesion Oils like butter egg yolks vegetable oils or lard are much more viscous than water and evaporate freely at a much higher temperature than water So a cake made with butter or eggs instead of water is more dense when cooked

Hard wafers have been made for as long as baking existed They were very popular because they last a long time and are not fragile but they were normally not sweet enough to be called cookies today

Cookies were made at first in 7th century AD Persia just after the use of sugar became common there They spread to Europe through the Muslim conquest of Spain By the 14th century they were common in all parts of Europe and could be found anywhere from royal cuisine to street vendors

People started to travel around the world at that time and cookies made a good travel snack a sweeter version of the travel cakes used throughout history One of the most popular early cookies which traveled very well and became known on every continent was the jumble a hard cookie made mostly from nuts sweetener and water

The Etruscan civilization was a culture in ancient Italy The Romans named them Etrusci or Tusci The Ancient Greeks named them Tyrrhenoi or Tyrrsenoi The Etruscans named themselves Rasenna

The Etruscan Civilization is very old It began in pre history When it was very powerful it was in three confederacies These three confederacies were Etruria Latinum and the Po Valley and Campania The Etruscans ruled Rome until 396BC

The Etruscan language is related to the Tyrrhenian language family and is not related to other languages Some Etruscan letters were used by the Romans in the Latin alphabet which English uses When the Romans conquered the Etruscans they wrote everything in Latin So now we do not know much about the language Some Romans wrote about the Etruscans and their language but it is now lost

The Etruscans mined metals like copper and iron They became rich and powerful and travelled around the Mediterranean Sea The Etruscan Civilisation began to lose power in the 5th century BC The Romans began conquering parts of Etruscan land By the beginning of the 1st century BC the Etruscans were entirely defeated

The Sea of Japan or East sea is a sea in the western Pacific Ocean It is between Korea to the west Russia to the north and Japan to the east and south Different countries have different names for the body of water North Korea calls it East Korea Sea

International Hydrographic Organization decided to call this sea area Sea of Japan in 1929

Since 1992 South Korea demands the world to use the names East Sea or Sea of Korea instead of Sea of Japan South Korea argues that this sea area has been called East Sea since early times It is also a Korean belief that the name East Sea was eliminated from the maps of the world in the early 20th century while South Korea was under the rule of Japan

On the contrary Japan says that the name Sea of Japan has been used more widely than East Sea in Europe and America since before the 18th century Japan also points out that if there was no Japan there would be no sea Especially the name Sea of Japan is also strongly spread by the extreme nationalists politicions of right wing parties such as Jimin party or Minshu party

Nowdays many maps and documents include both the name Sea of Japan and East Sea often with East Sea listed in parentheses or otherwise marked as a secondary name

Natural environment means all living and non living things that are naturally on Earth 

In a narrow sense it is an environment that is not influenced by human The environment that is influenced by humans can be called the built environment or cultural landscape

For some there is a difficulty with the term natural environment in that nearly all environments have been directly or indirectly influenced by humans at some point in time In order to address this concern some level of human influence is thus allowable without the status of any particular landscape ceasing to be natural Many natural environments are the product of the interaction between nature and humans For this reason the term ecosystem has been used to describe an environment that contains nature and includes people It follows then that environmental problems are human or social problems Some also consider it dangerously misleading to regard environment as separate from people

The roots of Natural Environment can be simply defined Natural can be described as something that occurs naturally or of its own accord on Earth Environment can be described as the surroundings of an object

Natural capital is a metaphor for the mineral plant and animal formations of the Earths biosphere when viewed as a means of production of oxygen water filter erosion preventer or provider of other ecosystem services 

In a traditional economic analysis of the factors of production natural capital would usually be understood as land and therefore something else than capital in its original sense 

At the beginning of reflection about economics land was seen as something natural but capital as man made goods only 

But the benefits which humans have from nature are many 17 of them were closely looked at by Robert Costanza These benefits are in some ways similar to those that owners of capital have as their capital produces more goods eg a factory which produces automobiles just as an apple tree produces apples

This is an approach to ecosystem valuation an alternative to the traditional view of all non human life as passive natural resources But human knowledge and understanding of the natural environment is never complete and therefore we cannot yet know what natural capital means exactly

Marie SkodowskaCurie was a physicist and chemist She was from Poland but lived in France She was an expert in the field of radioactivity She was also the first woman to win a Nobel Prize She was the first woman professor at the University of Paris as well as the first person to win two Nobel Prizes She received their Nobel Prize in physics for her research on spontaneous radiation which was discovered by Henri Becquerel

She was born with the name Maria Skodowska in Warsaw Poland She lived there until she was 24 At the age of twelve her mother died and two years earlier her sister Zofia died In 1891 she followed her older sister Bronisawa to study in Paris In Paris she got higher degrees She also did her important scientific work She founded the Curie Institutes in Paris and Warsaw Her husband Pierre Curie daughter Irne Joliot Curie and son in law Frdric Joliot Curie also won Nobel Prizes

Curie did many great things She created a theory of radioactivity found different ways for separating radioactive isotopes and discovered two new elements radium and polonium It was also under her own direction that the worlds first studies were used into the treatment of cancers These treatments used the radioactive isotopes 

While being a French citizen she never lost her Polish identity She named the first new chemical element that she discovered polonium This was named after her home country Poland In 1932 she founded a radium institute in her home town Warsaw It was run by her sister Bronisawa

A flyover is a trick that people do with planes or helicopters The Blue Angels are a special group of pilots that do a lot of flyovers at sporting events Doing a flyover usually flying over the people who are watching Sometimes the planes fly very low to make the stunt more exciting

In the military a flyover is when fighter jets fly over the enemy They do this to try to scare the people they are fighting against

The Blue Angels are a group of special pilots who work for the US Navy They fly FA 18 fighter jet airplanes that are painted to look different from regular Navy planes They are very famous Almost every American has heard of them The pilots of the Blue Angels are very good at what they do They are able to fly very close to each other and do very difficult tricks They are most famous for the flyovers they do at many American sporting events

A stuntman is a man or a woman who performs dangerous acts usually within the television or movie production industry In this line of work the stuntman is paid to do those actions that are deemed too dangerous for the regular actor to perform these include jumping from a height falling down being in a car crash or pretending to fight with weapons such as swords or knives These stunts are usually presented as a small feature within a larger production

Action movies war movies martial arts movies and crime television shows use many stuntmen to do the dangerous actions depicted in the movies or shows Jackie Chan and the Blue Angels are examples of stuntmen who perform this kind of work

There are however other stuntmen that present dangerous stunts to a live audience as entertainment in their own right rather than as part of a larger story Sometimes these are as standalone effects and sometimes as a feature within a larger stunt show Escape artists sword swallowers and other circus and sideshow acts are an example of this

These types of stuntmen can be found scattered throughout history with one of the most famous from the last Century being escape artist Harry Houdini

Modern examples of these types of stuntmen include escape artist and stuntman Roslyn Walker and sideshow veteran Kondini both from the UK

Stunt work is dangerous regardless of whether you work in film television or within a live stunt show Stuntmen are often hurt during the stunts they perform and in some cases stuntmen have even been killed

Stunt work is not steady work Stuntmen who work in film are only employed on a film by film basis sometimes they are needed for a number of months if they are lucky to double for the lead actor but could quite easily only be needed for a single stunt that is filmed over the space of a day or two

Within the live stunt industry work is very seasonal A stuntman can be working long hours during the summer months often seven days a week but not at all during the winter period

Stuntmen who perform for film and television often benefit from having a large safety crew present which is in stark contrast to those who perform within live shows who often work alone and are responsible for all aspects of the stunt they perform 

Stuntmen also have to travel to many different regions or countries to get work For people who like to travel this may be an advantage However it can also make it hard to see friends and relatives if you are away from home a lot

To become a stuntman some people go to a stuntman school There are stuntman schools in California and Florida where professional stuntmen teach people how to do stunts Most people do not go to school to become stuntmen though People learn the skills from other more experienced stuntmen 

When a stuntman first begins working as a stuntman they do not make much money Once a stuntman has experience they can ask for more money In many countries stuntmen have to join a union to work on film or television show productions and pay dues to the union There are more men working as stuntmen than women 

Usually a stuntman within film and television does not work as a stuntman after they become 40 years old However those who work live stunt shows continue to do so until very late in life Kondini continues to work as a sword swallower and escape artist despite being in his 70s Some experienced stuntmen become stunt coordinators or consultants who plan and devise the stunts performed in TV shows and films

Another job for men or women in the television or movie production industry where people replace the actors is the job of body double When a film has a scene with a love scene or a nudity scene that the actor does not want to do the movie or television director may hire a man or a woman to be a body double The man or woman pretends to be the actor for a short period so that the love scene or nudity scene can be filmed

Means of production also called means of labour are the materials tools and other instruments used by workers to make products This includes machines tools materials plant and equipment land raw materials money power generation and so on anything necessary for labor to produce

Ecosystem services are processes by which the natural environment produces resources useful to people as to economic services They include

To look at the way in which ecosystems provide goods is popular now at Stanford University The concept of ecosystem services is similar to that of natural capital

The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment released in 2005 showed that 60 of ecosystem services are used in a way that destroys them

The Year 2000 problem was a problem that happened because of the way in which some early computer programs were made They were made to handle only years containing 2 digits and people started fearing that date related processing would happen incorrectly for dates and times after December 31 1999 It caused a big concern that very important industries and government functions would stop working at exactly midnight January 1 2000 and on other critical dates which were called event horizons More people were panicked by press coverage and other media speculation as well as corporate and government reports Companies and organisations around the world had to check and upgrade their computer systems The preparation for Y2K thus had a significant effect on the computer industry No significant computer failures occurred when the year changed to 2000 Debate continues on whether the absence of computer failures was the result of the preparation undertaken or whether the problem had been overstated

Biodiversity or biological diversity is the variation of different life forms within a given ecosystem or for the entire Earth Biodiversity is often a measure of the health of biological systems to indicate if there could be a danger that species get extinct Variation helps species live in a population therefore creating Biodiversity

Egalitarianism is the belief that groups are or should be equal to one another The word is named for the French word gal meaning equal or level

There are many possible kinds of egalitarianism For example legal egalitarianism is the belief that groups of people should be equal in law even if they are of different race or religion Gender egalitarianism is the idea that men and women are equally important although they are different

This word may be used when talking about philosophy in many slightly different ways We can best understand the different kinds of egalitarianism by asking Who is equal to whom and How are they equal

Polycarbonate is transparent thermoplastic This material is tough and stable It can resist a high temperature of 280F and a low temperature of 40 F It is stain resistant and non toxic Polycarbonate weighs six times less than glass 

Industries use polycarbonate for making different products from bulletproof windows to CDs and DVDs The main advantages of polycarbonate are high strength and light weight

Industries use clear polycarbonate to make eyeglasses This is because it has a very good transparency and durability Lenses made from clear polycarbonate can be thinner than lenses made from ordinary glass

Companies that create electronic equipment use polycarbonate to create the cover of cell phones laptops and other products Although polycarbonate is not toxic it needs toxic chemicals during its production phase

A natural disaster is the consequence of the combination of a natural hazard and human activities

Only if humans are there where the hazard happens and if they have no sufficient emergency management there will be human losses Therefore one can say disasters occur when hazards meet vulnerability A natural hazard will therefore have no natural disaster as a result in areas without vulnerability that means if for example a strong earthquake is in uninhabited areas

International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement is established to do help at emergency including natural disaster by Geneva Conventions and Article 11 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities also difines such help by international law both humanitarian and human rights

A landslide includes a wide range of ground movement such as rock falls deep failure of slopes and shallow debris flows 

The biggest reason for a landslide is always that there is a slope and material goes down the slope because of gravity 

But other things also contribute to landslides 

An underlying reason is the nature of the material For example a thixotropic material such as mud or sand and water can change from a gel to a sol by adding water or pressure or shaking It goes from being stable one minute to fluid the next minute The greatest disasters like lahars or mudslides happen suddenly It is possible for much of a volcano to just slide down suddenly as with Toba Krakatoa and Mount St Helens

Waste heat is the by product heat of machines and technical processes for which no useful application is found 

A fraction of input energy is always converted to heat by friction between machine parts and other processes such as liquid friction 

Mechanical drives can be designed to run smoothly with little loss of energy to heat Machines for conversion of energy contained in fuels to mechanical work or electric energy produce large amounts of waste heat 

This waste heat can be re used if a cogeneration system is used It is hard to use waste heat because it is difficult to transport the heat to another place and it is difficult to store the heat for use at another time

Kingda Ka is a steel roller coaster at Six Flags Great Adventure in Jackson New Jersey USA It is the tallest and was the fastest roller coaster until Formula Rossa and 1 of 2 strata coasters It goes up convert456ft and can go convert128mph It first opened on May 21 2005 To get up 456 feet the train is launched by a machine to 128 miles per hour in 3 seconds The train goes up the tower and back down At the bottom the train goes over a hill while it is slowing down Soon it is going slow enough to be able to arrive safely back where it started The ride lasts 59 seconds

In the past it has been struck by lightning and shut down for almost a whole year Also the launch cable snapped and they shut down for a while Something happened to the braking fins so they shut down the ride It also can get shut down by weather The train is made so that if it rolls back it gets placed back for launch This happens when the hydraulic launch system does not get enough power to get over the hill or the brakes on the top off the hill stop you too much In Top Thrill Dragster it once got stuck at the top 

Kingda Ka is named for a 500 pound mythical tiger A tiger in the safari was named after the roller coaster It is surrounded by bamboo to make it look more real It also plays music

Vulnerability means the extent to which changes can hurt or harm a person or a system

In context with natural hazardss and natural disasters vulnerability is a concept that looks at the relationship that people have with their environment and at social aspects

So it links environment to social forces and institutions and the cultural values that sustain and contest them The concept of vulnerability expresses the multidimensionality of disasters by focusing attention on the totality of relationships in a given social situation which constitute a condition that in combination with environmental forces produces a disaster

Complex definition Vulnerability is the susceptibility to physical or emotional injury or attack It also means to have ones guard down open to censure or criticism assailable Vulnerability refers to a persons state of being liable to succumb as to persuasion or temptation

Harm is physical or psychological or emotional damage or injury to a person animal or other entity

It is generally believed that humans in addition to other sentient animal species possess an aversion to causing harm to others

Many religions consider any harm to another person as a sin 

A liquid crystal display is a special thin flat panel with a number of pixels in front of a light source Each pixel is filled with liquid crystals that are capable of showing many colors or one color only The technology they use is called electro optical modulation Liquid crystal displays are often abbreviated LCDs Liquid crystal displays are often used in battery powered devices because they use very little electricity 

Each pixel of a LCD is typically made of a layer of molecules which are aligned between two transparent electrodes There are also two polarizing filters one on each side These two filters are perpendicular to one another This means that without the liquid crystals between them they would block all light from passing through the light passing through the first filter is polarized in such a way that the second filter blocks it

The surface of the electrodes that are in contact with the liquid crystal materials are treated so that they align the liquid crystal molecules in a particular direction This treatment typically consists of a thin polymer layer that is unidirectionally rubbed using for example a cloth The direction of the liquid crystal alignment is then defined by the direction of rubbing Electrodes are made of a transparent conductor called Indium Tin Oxide 

Before applying an electric field the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules is determined by the alignment at the surfaces In a twisted nematic device the surface alignment directions at the two electrodes are perpendicular to each other The molecules therefore arrange themselves in a helical structure or twist This reduces the rotation of the polarization of the incident light and the device appears grey If the applied voltage is large enough the liquid crystal molecules in the center of the layer are almost completely untwisted and the polarization of the incident light is not rotated as it passes through the liquid crystal layer This light will then be mainly polarized perpendicular to the second filter and thus be blocked and the pixel will appear black By controlling the voltage applied across the liquid crystal layer in each pixel light can be allowed to pass through in varying amounts this will yield different levels of gray

The optical effect of a twisted nematic device in the voltage on state is far less dependent on variations in the device thickness than that in the voltage off state Because of this these devices are usually operated between crossed polarizers such that they appear bright with no voltage These devices can also be operated between parallel polarizers in which case the bright and dark states are reversed The voltage off dark state in this configuration appears blotchy however because of small variations of thickness across the device

Both the liquid crystal material and the alignment layer material contain ionic compounds If an electric field of one particular polarity is applied for a long period of time this ionic material is attracted to the surfaces and degrades the device performance This is avoided either by applying an alternating current or by reversing the polarity of the electric field as the device is addressed

When a large number of pixels are needed in a display it is not technically possible to drive each directly since then each pixel would require independent electrodes Instead the display is multiplexed In a multiplexed display electrodes on one side of the display are grouped and wired together and each group gets its own voltage source On the other side the electrodes are also grouped with each group getting a voltage sink The groups are designed so each pixel has a unique unshared combination of source and sink The electronics or the software driving the electronics then turns on sinks in sequence and drives sources for the pixels of each sink

The researches on liquid crystals began at the end of the 19th century but the first publication on this topic was made in 1904 by Otto Lehman and after this first publication there followed a series of other related articles which described the same topic

LCD displays use two pieces of glass which contain a solution of liquid crystals between them When an electric current passes through the solution the crystals align in such a way that light cannot come through them

LCD displays have matrixes which build up a colored picture There are two types of matrixes active and passive The simpler passive matrix types can be found in electronic wrist watches and pocket calculators Active matrix devices are more complex and use thin film transistors TFT images are as sharp as the images from the older CRT displays On the other hand they are more expensive but are extensively used in producing LCD computer monitors and TV panels 

Main features of an LCD monitor are

Additional types are Reflective often referred to as day light viewable can be viewed in direct sunlight

Body language means the way humans show their feelings with their bodies This is in place of or in addition to using sounds or verbal language It is a kind of nonverbal communication

Body language is something that one has to Learn some people find it easier than others Its something that people with certain Disorders have trouble with but nearly everyone uses it in their life

Some examples of body language include

Plagiarism is copying another persons ideas words or writing and pretending that they are ones own work It can involve violating copyright laws College students who are caught plagiarizing can be kicked out of school and writers who plagiarize will often be taken less seriously

When writing papers many students practice plagiarism without knowing it by using other peoples ideas without citing them Reading another article or book and taking an idea from it and putting it into ones own words is not plagiarism if the writer of the paper says where they got the idea

A riksha or rickshaw is a kind of vehicle that has two wheels They are usually pulled by a human but there are types that have been changed to be pulled by a bicycle or have their own motor 

Saturation or saturated generally means thoroughly full while unsaturated means less than full These terms may be related to

Water content means the amount of water a porous medium contains

This term is used in hydrogeology soil science and soil mechanics In saturated groundwater aquifers all available pore spaces are filled with water Above a capillary fringe pore spaces have air in them too When the porous medium in question is soil water content is synonymous with soil moisture

Soil moisture is the amount of water present in the soil 

Gaps between soil particles are called pore spaces or voids These voids contain various amounts of either water or air Soil moisture content can be expressed in different basis

The amount of void space within a soil depends on the distribution of particle sizes and is quantified by soil porosity

Soil moisture is more generally considered within the context of hydrology where it represents the immediate store of infiltrating rainfall before it either evapotranspires or contributes to groundwater recharge

Black metal is a extreme style of Heavy metal that started in the early 1980s Lyrics are often against religions such as Christianity Various black metal bands have relations to satanism in their lyrics and even in outlook Lyrics may also have subjects such as Paganism The majority of black metal vocalists are male although there are a few notable exceptions for example Cadaveria Astarte and Lucifugum

Black metal is often divided into two waves The first wave began in the early 1980s by bands such as Venom Bathory Hellhammer Celtic Frost and Mercyful Fate Venoms first albums Welcome to Hell and Black Metal are usually said to be the first black metal records Second wave is the most popular wave of black metal and it started in the early 1990s It started from Norway and includes bands such as Darkthrone Enslaved Burzum Satyricon Mayhem Gorgoroth Immortal and Emperor

Black metal is also very controversial especially in Norway During the early 1990s certain black metal musicians burned old churches in Norway One of the people who was found guilty for burning churches Varg Vikernes was also found guilty for murdering ystein Aarseth a fellow black metal musician

National Socialist black metal is a title used to refer to black metal acts with an emphasis on Nazi beliefs in their music For example Absurd and Nokturnal Mortum are National Socialist black metal bands

Harthacanute was King of Denmark from 1035 to 1042 and England from 1040 to 1042 He was the only son of Canute the Great and Emma of Normandy

He followed his father as King of Denmark in 1035 becoming Canute III Fighting with Magnus I of Norway stopped him from sailing to England to take up his throne His older illegitimate half brother Harold Harefoot became regent of England

Harold took the English crown for himself in 1037 After Harthacanute had settled the situation in Scandinavia he prepared an invasion of England to take over his kingdom Harold died and Harthacanute was able to take back his throne peacefully

Harthacanute was a broken wikt linkharshharsh and unpopular ruler to pay for his ships he greatly increased the rate of taxation In 1041 the people of Worcester killed two of Harthacanutes men who had been collecting the tax Harthacanute burned the city The story of Lady Godiva riding naked through the streets of Coventry to persuade the local earl to lower taxes may come from the reign of Harthacanute The Anglo Saxon Chronicle says of him He never accomplished anything kingly for as long as he ruled 

In 1041 Harthacanute asked his half brother Edward the Confessor back from exile in Normandy to become a member of his household and probably made Edward his heir Harthacanute was unmarried and had no children On 8 June 1042 he died at Lambeth he died as he stood at his drink and he suddenly fell to the earth He was buried at Winchester Cathedral Hampshire Edward became the new king

Upon Canutes death Harolds younger half brother Harthacanute the son of Canute and his queen Emma of Normandy was legitimate heir to the thrones of both the Danes and the English but was unable to travel to his coronation because his Danish kingdom was under threat of invasion by King Magnus I of Norway and King Anund Jacob of Sweden Therefore he was installed temporarily as regent though Godwin the Earl of Wessex and the Queen were against it

Harold died at Oxford on March 17 1040 just as Harthacanute was preparing an invasion force of Danes and was buried at the abbey of Westminster

The English Interregnum was the period of parliamentary and military rule in the land occupied by modern day England and Wales after the English Civil War It began with the execution of Charles I in 1649 and ended when Charles II became king after Oliver Cromwell died in 1660

This era in English history can be divided into four periods

Oliver Cromwell was a Puritan and during the Interregnum he imposed a very strict form of Christianity upon the country Although a main cause of the English Civil War was oppression under Charles I England during the Interregnum became oppressive in its own fashion Cromwell granted religious freedom otherwise previously unknown in England but other forms of expression were suddenly limited Cromwell also made certain that his own personal vision of Christianity was enforced upon the masses Many of Cromwells actions were called harsh unwise and tyrannical by some commentators 

His son and successor Richard Cromwell gave up his position as Lord Protector with little hesitation resigning or abdicating after a demand by the Rump Parliament This was the beginning of a short period of restoration of the Commonwealth of England

An interregnum is a period between monarchs between popes of the Roman Catholic Church emperors of Holy Roman Empire Polish kings or between consuls of the Roman Republic It can also refer any gap in the continuity of a government organization or social order

In some monarchies such as the United Kingdom an interregnum is usually avoided due to a rule described as the king is dead long live the King ie the heir to the throne becomes a new monarch immediately on his predecessors death or abdication This famous phrase signifies the continuity of sovereignty This is not so in other monarchies where the new monarchs reign begins only with coronation or some other formal or traditional event 

An interregnum occurs also upon the death of the Roman Catholic Pope though this is generally known as a sede vacante The interregnum ends immediately upon election of the new Pope by the College of Cardinals 

Oliver Cromwell was an English military and political leader best known for making England a republic and leading the Commonwealth of England  

Cromwells actions during his career seem confusing to us today He supported Parliament against the King yet he ordered his soldiers to break up parliament Under his rule the Protectorate said that peoples religious beliefs should be respected but people who went against what most people believed were sometimes tortured and imprisoned

Cromwell was the first ruler of England to be a Puritan

Cromwell started off as an ordinary man from Huntingdon He became an MP and a Puritan and supported Parliament in its quarrel with the King When war broke out the Kings army was stronger and better prepared than the army of Parliament Cromwell saw this and he decided to train men to fight better Soon the New Model Army he had trained began to win battles As a result Parliament won the war By the end of the war Cromwell was very powerful

After the execution of the King a republic was declared known as the Commonwealth of England A Council of State was appointed to manage affairs which included Cromwell among its members His real power base was in the army

A new constitution known as the Instrument of Government made Cromwell Lord Protector for life He had the power to call and dissolve parliaments 

In 1657 Cromwell was offered the crown by Parliament Cromwell reflected for six weeks over the offer Then he rejected it and was ceremonially re installed as Lord Protector at Westminster Hall

Cromwell is thought to have suffered from malaria He died at Whitehall on 3 September 1658 the anniversary of his great victories at Dunbar and Worcester

He was succeeded as Lord Protector by his son Richard Although Richard was not entirely without ability he had no power base in either Parliament or the Army and was forced to resign in the spring of 1659 bringing the Protectorate to an end A year later Parliament restored Charles II as king 

When the Royalists returned to power Cromwells corpse was dug up hung in chains and beheaded

Restoration may refer to

The English Restoration or simply Restoration was an episode in the history of England beginning in 1660 when the English monarchy Scottish monarchy and Irish monarchy was restored under King Charles II after the English Civil War The term Restoration means both the actual event which put a monarch back in power and the period immediately after Charles II came to power

The Commonwealth of England was the republican government which ruled first England and then Ireland and Scotland from 1649 to 1660 After the execution of Charles I on January 30 1649 the Commonwealth was declared by the Rump Parliament on May 19 1649 The government during 1653 to 1659 is properly called The Protectorate and took the form of direct personal rule by Oliver Cromwell and after his death his son Richard as Lord Protector The term Commonwealth is however loosely used to describe the system of government during the whole of 1649 to 1660 the years of the English Interregnum

 Declaration can mean

A declaration of independence is a proclamation of the independence of an aspiring state or states Such states are usually formed from part or all of the territory of another nation or failed nation or are breakaway territories from within the parent state

Declarations of independence are typically made without the consent of the parent state and hence are sometimes called unilateral declarations of independence particularly by those who question the validity of the declarations

Presbyterianism is a kind of Protestant Christianity It was started off in Scotland by John Knox Today there are Presbyterian churches across the world

Presbyterians believe that the Bible is the most important thing in their church and that no one can change the meaning of it They believe that God has control over everything and that only followers of Jesus Christ may get into heaven

Presbyterian churches may be led by men called Ministers Rectors or Elders Some Presbyterian churches have women as elders

A declaration of war is a formal declaration issued by a national government indicating that a state of war exists between that nation and one or more others

Declarations of war have been acceptable means and diplomatic measures since the Renaissance when the first formal declarations of war were issued 

In an effort to force nations to resolve issues without warfare the United Nations Charter attempted to commit member nations to using warfare only under limited circumstances especially for defensive purposes only

In science a nymph is the young of some kinds of insects

Insects grow in two ways In one of these ways called incomplete metamorphosis an insect egg hatches and a small insect called a nymph comes out The nymph usually looks just like the adult insect but is much smaller Nymphs do not become pupae before becoming adults

Some insects have nymphs that are aquatic which means they live in water These nymphs look very different from the adults Dragonflies have nymphs that live in water such as in lakes and rivers Nymphs that live in water are sometimes called naiads

The other way insects grow is by complete metamorphosis This way has no nymphs

Some insects that are nymphs when they are young are grasshoppers cockroaches true bugs and dragonflies

In mythology spirits of nature are called nymphs Water spirits are called naiads in mythology

In British history the Protectorate was the period 165359 during which the Commonwealth of England Scotland and Ireland was governed by a Lord Protector

Before the Protectorate England had been ruled directly by Parliament since it had declared England to be a Commonwealth in 1649 The Rump Parliament had been sent away in April 1653 by soldiers led by Oliver Cromwell Although the replacement the Barebones Parliament was nominated by Cromwell and the leaders of the army it was just as difficult to control

The post of Lord Protector was created by a constitution passed in December 1653 Cromwell got this position for life Although the constitution divided power between the Lord Protector the Council of State and Parliament in practice there was again the strong executive power that had been absent since the end of the monarchy Cromwellian government has been called one of the first experiments in military dictatorship 

During the Protectorate there was Puritan legislation Religious toleration was extended to Jews and most Protestants but not to Anglicans or Roman Catholics 

After Cromwells death in September 1658 the new Lord Protector Richard Cromwell was unable to control the army and resigned in May 1659 After a chaotic interregnum the monarchy was restored in May 1660 through the initiative of General George Monck

Vibrator could mean several different types of devices

Vibrator could also mean

The Rump Parliament was the name given to Parliament until 1660 of the English Parliament that followed the Long Parliament after Prides Purge of December 6 1648 had removed those Members of Parliament that were against the plan to try King Charles I for high treason

A vibrator is a device that is made to vibrate against the body thereby stimulating the nerves and giving a pleasurable and possibly erotic feeling

The electrically powered vibrator was invented in the 1880s by doctors who were treating women for hysteria for centuries by performing what today would be considered masturbation At the time however not only did doctors regard the vulvular stimulation required as having nothing to do with sex they reportedly found that it took a lot of time to do and it was hard work The vibrator did it more quickly and easily and because of this it was very popular with doctors Home versions soon started being made and they were also popular with adverts in places like Needlecraft Womans Home Companion Modern Priscilla and the Sears Roebuck catalog These disappeared in the 1920s apparently because their appearance in pornography made it no longer tenable for polite society to avoid the sexual connotations of the devices

In their more common guise as body massagers millions of vibrators have been sold to both men and women Some of the people that buy vibrators only use them to relieve them of muscular tension or aches and pains However many people who purchase vibrators marketed as body massagers and presumably most people who purchase vibrators marketed as adult toys use them to get sexual pleasure most often in masturbation a form of autoeroticism Vibrators often allow people to achieve orgasm faster and easier and are often said to provide stronger orgasms than those produced by hand stimulation alone They are often recommended by sex therapists for women who have difficulty reaching orgasm by other means Couples also use them sometimes as an enhancement to the pleasure of one or both partners 

Harpers magazine notes a Durex survey that says 46 of women have vibrators near 2006 This may have been market research relating to their vibrating condom base product

The sale of vibrators and similar novelty items is forbidden in several states in the southern United States In the state of Texas the sale of devices for sexual stimulation such as vibrators and dildos is technically illegal but many stores will sell such items provided that the customer sign a statement that the device will be used only for educational purposes The states of Georgia Alabama Mississippi Indiana Virginia Louisiana and Massachusetts also have laws that prohibit vibrators

An enormous range of vibrators exist falling into several broad categories

Most vibrators use internal batteries but some of them have a power cord and must be plugged into a power socket to work

 

England is the largest of the countries that today make up the United Kingdom The name England comes from the Anglo Saxons who arrived in the 5th century The territory of England has been united as one country since the 10th century This article is about the history of that territory until 1707 when Britain was joined with Scotland to make Great Britain 

Archaeology shows that people came to southern England long before the rest of the British Isles probably because of the friendly climate between and during the ice ages of long ago 

Julius Caesar invaded what is now England in 55 and 54 BC and wrote in De Bello Gallico that there were many tribes there who were very similar to other Celtic tribes in Europe Coins and later Roman historians have given us the names of some of the rulers of the tribes and what they did 

For hundreds of years what is now England was a Roman province Britannia The Romans later gave up on the province and left the Celtic people on their own as the Roman Empire began to fall apart The influence of the Romans meant that the territory of England had already experienced unity before the Anglo Saxons arrived

After the Romans left around 410 England was settled by waves of Germanic peoples

Jutes together with large numbers of Frisians Saxons from northern Germany and Angles from southern Denmark  often called Anglo Saxons began to invade Britain in the mid 5th century They were tribes led by royal chiefs and they settled on the eastern and southern shores

Analysis of human bodies found at an ancient cemetery near Abingdon England shows that Saxon immigrants and native Britons lived side by side The Romano British population was assimilated The settlement of England is called the Saxon Conquest or the Anglo Saxon or English Conquest

From the 4th century AD many Britons left across the English Channel from Wales Cornwall and southern Britain and started to settle the western part of Gaul where they started a new nation Brittany The Britons gave their new country its name and the Breton language Brezhoneg a sister language to Welsh and Cornish The name Brittany arose at this time to tell the new Britain apart from Great Britain Brezhoneg is still spoken in Brittany today

Beginning with the raid in 793 on the monastery at Lindisfarne Vikings made many raids on England

After a time of raids the Vikings also began to settle in England and to trade eventually controlling an area called the Danelaw from the late 9th century One Viking settlement was at York called Jorvik by the Vikings Viking rule left traces in the English language because Old English was already related to Old Norse many Norse words began to be used in English at this time

The defeat of King Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings in 1066 against Duke William II of Normandy later called William I of England and the following Norman conquest of England caused important changes in the history of Britain William ordered the Domesday Book to be written This was a survey of the entire population and their lands and property to help in collecting taxes

William also ruled Normandy then a powerful duchy in France William and his nobles spoke and held court in Anglo Norman in Normandy as well as in England The use of the Anglo Norman language by the aristocracy was kept up for centuries and had a great influence on the development of English

In England the Middle Ages was a time of war civil war rebellions from time to time and many plots among the nobles and royalty England had more than enough cereals dairy products beef and mutton The nations international economy was based on the wool trade where wool from northern England was sold to the textile merchants of Flanders to make into cloth Medieval foreign policy was also shaped by relations with the Flemish cloth business An English cloth business was developed in the fifteenth century allowing the English also to become wealthier 

In the reign of Henry II the king got some power back from the barony and the Church Henrys successor Richard I the Lion Heart took part in the Third Crusade and defended his French territories against Philip II of France His younger brother John who followed him as king was not so lucky he lost Normandy and many other French territories In 1215 the barons led an armed rebellion and forced him to sign the Magna Carta which put legal limits on the Kings personal powers

The reign of Edward I was rather successful Edward strengthened the powers of his Government and called the first English Parliament He conquered Wales His son Edward II lost the Battle of Bannockburn against Scotland

The Black Death an epidemic that spread over all of Europe and parts of Asia arrived in England in 1349 and killed perhaps up to a third of the population 

Edward III gave land to powerful noble families including many people with royal blood Because land was like power in these days some powerful men could now try to claim the Crown

The Wars of the Roses ended with the victory of Henry Tudor who became king Henry VII of England at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485 where the Yorkist king Richard III was killed 

His son Henry VIII split with the Roman Catholic Church over a question of his divorce from Catherine of Aragon Though his religious position was not entirely Protestant this led to the Church of England breaking from the Roman Catholic Church There followed a time of great religious and political troubles and the English Reformation

Henry VIII had three children all of whom would wear the Crown The first to reign was Edward VI of England Although he was intelligent he was only a boy of ten when he took the throne in 1547 

When Edward VI died of tuberculosis in 1553 Mary I took the throne when crowds cheered for her in London which people at the time said was the largest show of affection for a Tudor monarch Mary a loyal Catholic who had been influenced greatly by the Catholic King of Spain and Holy Roman Emperor Charles V tried to get the country back to Catholicism This led to 274 burnings of Protestants which are recorded in John Foxes Book of Martyrs She was highly unpopular among her people then Mary lost Calais the last English possession on the Continent and became even more unpopular at the end of her reign 

The reign of Elizabeth returned a sort of order to England in 1558 The religious question that had divided the country since Henry VIII was put to rest by the Elizabethan Religious Settlement which set up the Church of England in much the same form it has today 

The slave trade that made Britain a major economic power began with Elizabeth who gave John Hawkins permission to start trading in 1562 

The government of Elizabeth was more peaceful apart from the revolt of the northern earls in 1569 and she was able to lessen the power of the old nobility and expand the power of her government One of the most famous events in English military history was in 1588 when the Spanish Armada lost against the English navy commanded by Sir Francis Drake Elizabeths government did much to make her government stronger and to make common law and administration more effective throughout England

In all the Tudor period is seen as an important one leading to many questions that would have to be answered in the next century during the English Civil War These were questions of how much power the monarch and Parliament should have and how much one should control the other

Elizabeth died without children who could take the throne after her Her closest male Protestant relative was the king of Scotland James VI of the house of Stuart so he became James I of England the first king of the entire island of Great Britain although he ruled England and Scotland as separate countries

The English Civil War began in 1642 mainly because of conflicts between James son Charles I and Parliament The defeat of the Royalist army by the New Model Army of Parliament at the Battle of Naseby in June 1645 destroyed most of the Kings forces The capture and trial of Charles led to his beheading in January 1649 at Whitehall Gate in London A republic was declared and Oliver Cromwell became the Lord Protector in 1653 After he died his son Richard Cromwell followed him in the office but soon quit The monarchy was returned in 1660 after England had a time of anarchy with King Charles II again in London

In 1665 London was hit with the plague and then in 1666 the capital was burned for 5 days by the Great Fire destroying around 15000 buildings

In 1689 the Dutch Protestant William of Orange replaced the Catholic King James II in what is called the Glorious Revolution However in Scotland and Ireland Catholics loyal to James II were not so happy and a series of bloody revolts followed These Jacobite rebellions continued until the mid 18th century when Charles Edward Stuart was defeated at the Battle of Culloden in 1746

The First Act of Union made Scotland England and Wales into one county The history of England after this 1707 Act is a part of Great Britains history

The Anglo Saxons were people living in England from the mid 5th century AD to the Norman conquest of 1066

They spoke Germanic languages and are identified by Bede as the descendants of three powerful tribes the Angles Saxons and Jutes 

Their language Anglo Saxon or Old English came from West Germanic dialects and transformed into Middle English from the 11th century Old English was divided into four main dialects West Saxon Mercian Northumbrian and Kentish

The Anglo Saxons displaced the Celtic tribes which had lived all over the British Isles However they never got to Wales Scotland or Ireland so their original tribes were more or less undisturbed

There is a debate as to the how much Anglo Saxon migration there was from the 4th century to the 6th century

The first theories said large numbers of Anglo Saxon settlers arrived basically killing or moving the British people living in south and east of Britain Such an idea is supported by the language related and place name evidence In terms of language Old English became the language of the English kingdoms but a few Celtic words became part of the language 

More recently the focus has shifted towards continuity trying to place Britain in the context of European Late Antiquity Some of this argument is based on scale The population of Britain in 400 is unknowable but is carefully guessed based on land usage to have been around 2 million people It is thought to be unlikely that such a large population was all together killed or displaced between the 5th century and sixth century Much of the argument for continuity is based on archaeological evidence

The indigenous British people who wrote in both Latin and Welsh referred to these invaders as Saxones or Saeson the latter is still used today in the Welsh word for English people In the Scottish Gaelic the word for English people saesonach and in Irish the word for English people Sasanach

Anglo Saxon art before roughly the time of Alfred is a fusion of Anglo Saxon and Celtic techniques and motifs The Sutton Hoo treasure is an exceptional survival of very early Anglo Saxon metalwork and jewellery from a royal grave of the early 7th century

The period between Alfred and the Norman Conquest with the revival of the English economy and culture after the end of the Viking raids saw a distinct Anglo Saxon style in art though one in touch with trends on the Continent

Anglo Saxon art is mainly known today through illuminated manuscripts Manuscripts were far from the only Anglo Saxon art form but they have survived in much greater numbers than other types of object Contemporaries in Europe regarded Anglo Saxon goldsmithing and embroidery as especially fine Perhaps the best known piece of Anglo Saxon art is the Bayeux Tapestry which was commissioned by a Norman patron from English artists working in the traditional Anglo Saxon style The most common example of Anglo Saxon art is their coins Anglo Saxon artists also worked in fresco ivory stone carving metalwork and enamel but few of these pieces have survived

Old English literary works include genres such as epic poetry biography sermons Bible translations legal works chronicles riddles and others In all there are about 400 surviving manuscripts from the period

The most famous works from this period include the poem Beowulf which has achieved national epic status in Britain The Anglo Saxon Chronicle is a collection of important early English history Cdmons Hymn from the 7th century is the earliest attested literary text in English

The Norman conquest of England was a military invasion of England by William the Conqueror in 1066

William was a Duke who ruled Normandy now a region in France He invaded England after the death of King Edward the Confessor because he believed he had the most right to be King of England But King Harold II had himself crowned king instead King Harold with his Saxon army and Duke William fought at the Battle of Hastings on October 14 1066 King Harold was killed in the battle and his army left On December 25 1066 William was crowned the new King of England

The Norman conquest brought an important change in English history for a number of reasons The conquest linked England more closely with Continental Europe and made Scandinavian influence less important It created one of the most powerful monarchies in Europe The conquest changed the English language and culture and set the stage for rivalry with France which would continue until the 19th century England has never been successfully invaded since the Norman invasion nearly 1000 years ago

A raid is an attack into enemy territory with no intent to gain or hold terrain

The attacking people return to friendly territory immediately after the attack Generally a raid is brief and performed by a small number of people

The English Reformation was part of a process and movement of thought referred to as the Protestant Reformation which led to the breaking away of a number of Christian churches in Europe from communion with Rome

After that they started writing music together Two of their songs were played on the local radio station and the listeners wanted them to do a concert They later appeared live and became a popular act in their area

The Parliament of England was the legislature of the Kingdom of England Its roots go back to the early medieval period It took over more and more from the power of the monarch and after the Act of Union 1707 became the main part of the Parliament of Great Britain and later the Parliament of the United Kingdom

The origin of Parliament can be found in the times of the Anglo Saxons Anglo Saxon kings were advised by a council known as the Witenagemot to which belonged the Kings sons and brothers 

The Ealdormen or executive heads of the shire and the senior clergymen of the state had seats as well The King still had the highest authority but laws were made only after seeking the advice of the Witenagemot

The royal council slowly grew into a Parliament The first time the word Parliament can be found in official documents was during Henry IIIs reign It was still mostly informal and not an official body The right to vote in Parliamentary elections for county constituencies was the same everywhere in the country giving a vote to everyone who owned the freehold of land to a rent of 40 shillings a year 

The rise of Parliaments power was slowed down by civil war between Stephen and Empress Matilda By the end of the Wars of the Roses the king had the strongest authority again The Crown was at the height of its power during the reign of Henry VIII 

The great struggle between the Crown and Parliament happened under James Is successor Charles I The House of Commons sent Charles the Petition of Right demanding to have their rights again in 1628 Though he accepted the petition he later closed Parliament and ruled without them for eleven years It was only after he had money problems as a result of war that he was forced to call Parliament so they could authorise new taxes The new Parliament was quite rebellious so the king shut them down after only three weeks this was called the Short Parliament But this did not help the king with his money problem so he realized that he would need to call another Parliament Their struggle for power with the king led to the English Civil War Those supporting the Parliament were called Parliamentarians or Roundheads In 1649 Charles was put to death by the Rump Parliament and replaced by the military dictator Oliver Cromwell After Cromwells death however the monarchy was restored in 1660 

Following the Restoration monarchs agreed to regularly call Parliament But there was no clear guarantee of Parliamentary liberties until James II an unpopular Catholic ruler was forced to flee the country in 1688 Parliament decided that he had given up his crown and offered it to his Protestant daughter Mary instead of his Catholic son Mary II ruled together with her husband William III

Following the Treaty of Union in 1707 twin Acts of Parliament passed in respectively the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland created a new Kingdom of Great Britain and dissolved both parliaments replacing them with a new Parliament of Great Britain based in the former home of the English parliament

The Bill of Rights is the name for the first ten amendments to the United States Constitution which limit the power of the federal government and guarantee citizens of the United States certain rights The amendments were written in 1789 by James Madison and were based on important ideas about personal rights The Bill of Rights went into effect in 1791 when 34 of the states agreed that they were fair Originally the Bill of Rights had 12 different amendments but the first two were not passed by enough states The second amendment that was not passed was eventually added to the Constitution in 1992 It is now the 27th Amendment to the Constitution and deals with pay changes for the government

Human migration means any movement by humans from one locality to another often over long distances or in large groups Humans are known to have migrated extensively throughout history and prehistory 

International migration is the movement of people between countries Some leave their home countries voluntarily and some are forced to leave They hope to find a job better climates access to hospitals schools and entertainment Some want to be with friends and relatives but others are forced to leave the country because of religious and political persecution wars racial discrimination famine or natural disasters These people are refugees they move to other countries hoping to find help and asylum Most refugees are illegal immigrants and more than half are children and women They live in extreme poverty lacking food shelter clothing education and medical care

Rural urban migration is the movement from country areas to towns and cities There are many reasons why people leave the countryside In some areas there is overpopulation resulting from high birth rates and starvation Mechanization has caused a reduction in jobs available in the countryside Farming is hard work with long hours and little pay In developing countries a lack of money means a lack of machinery Natural disasters such as droughts hurricanes floods and volcanic eruptions destroy villages and crops There is a lack of services like schools and hospitals in the countryside

People move to the city because they are looking for better paid jobs and expect to be housed more comfortably and to have a higher quality of life They have a better chance of services such as schools medical treatment and entertainment People are often also attracted by the advantages of a cosmopolitan lifestyle such as shops restaurants theatres and nightlife

Reality is very different Though as many new arrivals to the city are unlikely to have much money they will be unable to buy or rent a house even if one was available They will probably have to make a temporary shelter using cheap or wasted materials A lot of migrant workers children are also struggling to get a decent education

In the new country they often are not integrated and are treated like an underclass But they are needed in the cities even if the local population doesnt like immigrants because they compete for the same jobs More people means more traffic and more crime But in fact they help to build up cities provide cheap labour invest money buy products and services pay tax and help companies compete The government should support immigrants because they are very important for the economy of a country

See Proto Indo Europeans

The movement of populations in modern times has continued under the form of both voluntary migration within ones region country or beyond and involuntary migration The people who migrate are called migrants or more specifically emigrants immigrants or settlers depending on historical setting circumstance and perspective

The European Parliament is the parliament of the European Union EU citizens elect its members once every five years Together with the Council of Ministers it is the law making branch of the institutions of the Union It meets in two locations Strasbourg and Brussels

The Parliament is made up of its 785 members called MEPs Each member speaks for an area of Europe for example London Denmark or Scotland Anyone can be elected they are elected by all the EU citizens the people who are citizens of a country in the EU People have been elected to Parliament since 1979 before that they came from the Parliaments of each country Because MEPs come from lots of countries they all speak different languages This means that the Parliament has to have lots of interpreters

Unlike other international groups of politicians MEPs do not sit in groups of countries but they sit next to people who they share ideas with The two largest groups are the European Peoples Party European Democrats and the Party of European Socialists But these groups work together to agree so they do not fight and try to make a law if the other does not like it

The European Parliaments power depends on which area of the EU it is working in The EU has three areas the Community its representation to other countries and things to do with police and courts In the last two areas it can not do much as the Council takes care of those issues but in the Community it can change or stop any law But the Council also has to agree and sometimes they disagree and cannot make a law

While Parliament can change a law it cannot start a new one it has to ask the European Commission to do that The European Commission works on everyday work and the Parliament has to make sure it does its job properly if it does not Parliament can make them all leave their jobs or not allow them to spend the EU budget

When the Parliament wants to make something a law they all vote at the same time But before then they make lots of small changes while talking about with people who know lots about what it will change They do this in small meetings known as Committees which have between 28 to 86 MEPs in it

The Parliament has a President The President is elected by the MEPs two times every two and a half years to organise the meetings and speak for the Parliament when meeting other leaders The president right now is a German called Hans Gert Pttering the first one was a French woman called Simone Veil

The Parliament was made in 1952 and was then called the Common Assembly At this time it did not have any power it was only asked to comment on laws made by the European Coal and Steel Community In 1957 it was renamed the European Parliamentary Assembly and got to comment on the laws of the European Economic Community and the European Atomic Energy Community Over the following years it was given a few powers over laws and money and it called itself the European Parliament in the 1960s It wanted to be elected so it could do more as if people voted for the people in Parliament the Council and Commission would have to pay more attention to it

In 1979 it held its first election and it gained more powers and also members because more countries joined the Communities and they elected people as well In 1993 it was given even more and power over the Commission when the European Union took the place of the Communities It is now known as one of the most powerful Parliaments in the world

The Council of the European Union is one of the three organisations that manage the European Union Along with the European Parliament it is responsible for law making for the European Union

An ice age is a period when for a long time the temperature of Earths climate is very low This leads to an expansion of the continental ice sheets polar ice sheets and mountain glaciers 

Ice age is a phrase coined for the period of extensive ice sheets in the recent Pleistocene period We now know that ice ages have happened a number of times in the past the greatest and longest of which took place in the Proterozoic era before multi cellular eukaryotes evolved 

Within an ice age there are stages The longer cold stages are called glacials or glacial periods The shorter warm periods are called interglacials

We are still in a sense in an ice age because the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets still exist When speaking of the last two million years the Pleistocene ice age in the glacials there were extensive ice sheets over the North American and Eurasian continents The last glacial ended about 11000 years ago when the present interglacial started

Many glacial periods have occurred during the last few million years initially at 40000 year frequency but more recently at 100000 year frequencies These are the best studied There have been four major ice ages in the further past

Guayana Esequiba is the name that Venezuela calls a region that it claims in the west of Guyana Its area is 159500 square kilometers Guyana calls this area the six administrative regions of Barima Waini Cuyuni Mazaruni Pomeroon Supenaam Potaro Siparuni Upper Takutu Upper Essequibo and Essequibo Islands West Demerara 

Spain made its first claim on this area in a report dated 10 July 1788

It has been stated that the south coast of the Orinoco from the point of Barima 20 leagues more or less inland up to the creek of Curucima is low lying and swampy land and so reckoning all this tract as useless very few patches of fertile land being found therein and hardly any savannahs and pastures it is disregarded so taking as chief base the said creek of Curucima or the point of the chain and ridge in the great arm of the Imataka an imaginary line will be drawn running to the south south east following the slopes of the ridge of the same name which is crossed by the Rivers Aguire Arature and Amacuro and others in the distance of 20 leagues direct to the Cuyuni from there it will run on to the Masaruni and Essequibo parallel to the sources of the Berbis and Surinama this is the directing line of the course which the new Settlements and foundations proposed must follow

In 1840 Venezuela claimed all of Guyana west of the Essequibo River 62 of what was then British Guiana Britain and Venezuela argued over the boundary between British Guiana and Venezuela for much of the 19th century On 21 February 1881 in a note to Lord Grenville Minister of Foreign Affairs of Great Britain at that time Venezuela suggested a border line starting from a point one mile to the north of the Moruka River drawn from there westward to the 60th meridian and running south along that meridian This would have given the Barima District to Venezuela The Government of Venezuela in the case it made to the Arbitration Tribunal changed its claim on the district just west of the Essequibo and claimed that the boundary should run from the mouth of the Moruka River southwards to the Cuyuni River near where it meets the Mazaruni River and then along the east bank of the Essequibo to the Brazilian border Britain and Venezuela accepted the decision of the Tribunal in 1899

Venezuela raised the issue again in 1962 four years before Guyana won independence from Britain At a meeting in Geneva in 1966 the two countries agreed to hear ideas from a representative of the UN Secretary General on ways to settle the dispute peacefully There are still diplomatic contacts between the two countries and the Secretary Generals representative

On recognizing the independence of Guyana on 26 May 1966 Venezuela said

Venezuela recognises as territory of the new State the one which is located on the east of the right bank of the Essequibo River and reiterates before the new State and before the international community that it expressly reserves its rights of territorial sovereignty over all the zone located on the west bank of the above mentioned river Therefore the Guyana Essequibo territory over which Venezuela expressly reserves its sovereign rights limits on the east by the new State of Guyana through the middle line of the Essequibo River beginning from its source and on to its mouth in the Atlantic Ocean

Venezuelan maps drawn since 1970 show all the area from the eastern bank of the Essequibo including the islands in the river as Venezuelan territory On some maps the western Essequibo region is called the Zone of Reclamation

The Germanic peoples are a linguistic and ethnic branch of Indo European peoples They came from Northern Europe and are identified by their use of the Germanic languages Migrating Germanic peoples spread throughout Europe mixing with existing local populations forming the future basis of many nations that are connected by similar languages and common history and culture

Latin Germani is first used by Julius Caesar

But the Germanic tribes did not have a self name that included all Germanic speaking people In English German is first attested in 1520 replacing earlier use of Almain or Dutch Dutch is now used in the English language to refer to the language and the inhabitants of the Netherlands

By the 1st century AD the writings of Caesar Tacitus and other Roman era writers indicate a division of Germanic speaking peoples into tribal groupings centred on

The Sons of Mannus Istvaeones Irminones and Ingvaeones are collectively called West Germanic tribes In addition those Germanic people who remained in Scandinavia are referred to as North Germanic These groups all developed separate dialects the basis for the differences among Germanic languages down to the present day

The division of peoples into West Germanic East Germanic and North Germanic is a modern linguistic classification

The Germanic tribes were each politically independent under a hereditary king The kings appear to have claimed descendancy from mythical founders of the tribes the name of some of which is preserved

The early Germanic tribes spoke mutually intelligible dialects and shared a common culture and mythology as is indicated by Beowulf and the Volsunga saga

In the absence of large scale political unification such as that imposed forcibly by the Romans upon the peoples of Italy the various tribes remained free led by their own hereditary or chosen leaders

Lennon and Ono decided to reconcile early in 1975 and became the parents of Sean Lennon Even though Pang had been involved with the marketing of several of Lennons records and also records by Harry Nilsson and Ringo Starr she had a hard time finding a new job She later found out the reason was because many companies were afraid Lennon would not want to do business with them if he knew she worked there

An omelette or omelet is a type of food that is mainly eggs with various fillings In the United States omelets are usually eaten at breakfast However omelettes can be eaten as a light lunch or late evening meal

An omelette is prepared from beaten eggs cooked with butter or oil in a frying pan A thin flat heavy omelette is usually folded around a filling such as cheese vegetables meat or some combination of these ingredients In some traditions omelettes are fried to cook the bottom and then flipped over or in half for final stage of cooking However in other traditions omelettes is baked to cook it evenly or the top is cooked under a broiler When making an omelette it is best to use several eggs Put a little water in with the eggs when you mix them up because the water helps the eggs to produce steam as they cook The steam makes them lighter and fluffier Using oil in the bottom of a nonstick omelette pan helps prevent the omelette from sticking Follow these tips add your favourite filling and you will make a tasty omelette quickly and easily

For a full light and fluffy omolette separate the egg whites and whisk to stiff peaks then fold in the yolks Cook by frying in a knob of butter on a medium heat until centre starts to dry then fold in half and cook until its hot in the middle

There are many different types of omelette often with different names depending on what is used as a filling

Arnold Bennett was a British writer Often after having been to the theatre in London he visited the Savoy Hotels Grillroom The chef added haddock cream and Parmesan cheese to the basic omelette and called the new dish Omelette Arnold Bennett in his customers honour

When Napoleon Bonaparte and his army were marching through southern France they stopped for the night near the town of Bessieres A local innkeeper made Napoleon an omelette Napoleon was so impressed by the cooking he ordered the townspeople to collect all the eggs in the village and to prepare a huge omelette for his army the next day

A visa is a permit given by a country that allows someone to go to that country A visa is a document that is stamped on a persons passport by an embassy It names the kind of visit and says how long the person can stay Sometimes people need to go through an interview held at the embassy before they get a visa

Many countries require foreign visitors to have a valid passport and a visa before they can enter the country but there are exceptions

Visas are associated with the request for permission to enter a country and are thus for some countries not the same as actual formal permission for an alien to enter and remain in the country

Some countries such as some states of the former Soviet Union require that their citizens and sometimes foreign travelers obtain an exit visa in order to be allowed to leave the country Until 2004 foreign students in Russia were issued only an entry visa on being accepted to University there and had to obtain an exit visa to return home This policy has since been changed and foreign students are now issued multiple entry visas

Some visas can be granted on arrival or by prior application at the countrys embassy or consulate or sometimes through a specialized travel agency with permission from the issuing country in the country of departure If there is no embassy or consulate in ones home country then one would have to travel to a third country and try to get a visa issued there The need or absence of need of a visa generally depends on the citizenship of the applicant the intended duration of the stay and the activities that the applicant may wish to undertake in the country he visits these may delineate different formal categories of visas with different issue conditions

Some but not all countries have reciprocal visa regimes if Country A requires citizens of Country B to have a visa to travel there then Country B may apply reciprocity and require a visa from citizens of Country A Likewise if A allows Bs citizens to enter without a visa B may allow As citizens to enter without a visa

Examples of such reciprocal visa regimes are between

A fee may be charged for issuing a visa these are typically also reciprocal so if country A charges country Bs citizens 50 USD for a visa country B will often also charge the same amount for country As visitors The fee charged may also be at the discretion of each embassy A similar reciprocity often applies to the duration of the visa and the amount of entries one can attempt with the visa Expedited processing of the visa application for some countries will generally incur additional charges

This reciprocal fee has become more common in recent years with the decision of the United States to charge nationals of various countries a 100 visa processing fee A number of countries including Brazil Chile and Turkey have reciprocated Brazil requires an advance visa before entry into the country and that a US citizen be fingerprinted and photographed on arrivalmatching US requirements for Brazilians and other foreigners

The issuing authority usually a branch of the countrys foreign ministry or department and typically consular affairs officers may request appropriate documentation from the applicant This may include proof that the applicant is able to support himself in the host country proof that the person hosting the applicant in his or her home really exists and has sufficient room for hosting the applicant proof that the applicant has obtained health and evacuation insurance etc Some countries ask for proof of health status especially for long term visas some countries deny such visas to persons with certain illnesses such as AIDS The exact conditions depend on the country and category of visa Notable examples of countries requiring HIV tests of long term residents are Russia and Uzbekistan  However in Uzbekistan the HIV test requirement is sometimes not strictly enforced 

Developed countries frequently demand strong evidence of intent to return to the home country if the visa is for a temporary stay and especially if the applicant is from a developing country due to immigration concerns

The issuing authority may also require applicants to attest that they have had no criminal convictions or that they do not partake in certain activities Some countries will deny visas if the travellers passports show evidence of citizenship or travel to a country which is not recognized by that country For example Saudi Arabia will not issue visas to nationals of Israel or those with evidence of visiting Israel

Types of visa 

Common types of visas are

Less common visas include

Visas can also be single entry which means the visa is cancelled as soon as the holder leaves the country double entry or multiple entry permitting multiple entries into the country with the same visa Countries may also issue re entry permits that allow temporarily leaving the country without invalidating the visa Even a business visa will normally not allow the holder to work in the host country without an additional work permit

Once issued a visa will usually have to be used within a certain period of time

The validity of a visa is not the same as the authorized period of stay in the issuing country The visa validity usually indicates when the alien can apply for entry to the country For example if a visa has been issued January 1st and expires March 30th and the typical authorized period of stay in a country is 90 days then the 90 day authorized stay starts on the day the passenger reaches the country which has to be between January 1st and March 30th The traveller could therefore stay in the issuing country until July 1st  

Once in the country the validity period of a visa or authorized stay can often be extended for a fee if the immigration authorities choose to do so Staying longer than the period of authorized stay given by the immigration officers is considered illegal immigration even if the visa validity period is not over and a form of being out of status and the offender may be fined prosecuted deported or even blacklisted from entering the country again 

Entering a country without a valid visa or visa exemption may result in being arrested and removed from the country Doing things that are not authorized by the status of entry can result in the individual being deemed removable in common speech an illegal alien Such violation is not a violation of a visa despite the common misuse of the phrase but a violation of status hence the term out of status

Even having a visa does not guarantee that somebody can enter ah ost country The border crossing authorities make the final determination to allow entry and may even cancel a visa at the border if the alien cannot demonstrate to their satisfaction that they will abide by the status their visa grants them

Visa and immigration laws may be very different among countries As such aliens are advised to check with immigration lawyers for visa and immigration laws governing the countries they wish to enter and eligibility to receive visas or other immigration benefits

Many countries have a mechanism to allow the holder of a visa to apply to stay longer in that country For example in Denmark a visa holder can apply to the Danish Immigration Service for a Residence Permit after they have arrived in the Country In the United Kingdom applications can be made to the Border and Immigration Agency In certain circumstances it is not possible for the holder of the visa to do this either because the country does not have a mechanism to prolong visas or most likely because the holder of the visa is using a short stay visa to live in a country In such cases the holder often engages in what is known as a visa run leaving the country for a short period in order to apply for a new visa prior to their return or so that they can be given a fresh permission to stay when they re enter

A visa may be denied for a number of reasons including if the applicant

Possession of a valid visa is a condition for entry into many countries however various exemption schemes do exist In some cases visa free entry may be granted to holders of diplomatic passports even as visas are required by normal passport holders

Some countries have reciprocal agreements such that a visa is not needed under certain conditions eg when the visit is for tourism and for a relatively short period One example of this is the Visa Waiver Program of the United States Such reciprocal agreements may stem from common membership in international organizations or a shared heritage

Other countries may unilaterally grant visa free entry to nationals of certain countries in order to facilitate tourism

Visa free travel between countries also occurs in all cases where passports are not needed for such travel

Normally visas are valid for entry only into the country which issued the visa Countries that are members of regional organizations or party to regional agreements may however issue visas valid for entry into some or all of the member states of the organization or agreement

The Angles were a Germanic people of unknown origin Their name seems to be connected with Angeln a modern district located in Schleswig Holstein Germany 

The Angles together with the Jutes Saxons and Frisians were mentioned amongst the Germanic tribes who sailed across the North Sea to raid and eventually invade Great Britain

Modern Angeln is a peninsula in Schleswig Holstein Germany Ancient Angeln may have been somewhat larger than the Angeln of today but following the ancient sources it included the territory of modern Angeln

Angeln has an importance far beyond its small area as it seems to have been the original home of the Angles who invaded the southern part of Great Britain which was named after them England And so the name of the major world language English seems to have taken its name from this little region

Following the departure of the Angles from Anglia about 350 the region was occupied by Danish settlers not later than the 8th century

A commonwealth is a group of people or of groups with a common aim to improve themselves help each other and share knowledge and resources

The word can refer to several organisations

It is also part of the official name of some countries

or part of the official name of some US states and territories

In history the Commonwealth of England was the name of England between 1649 and 1660 when England had no king

The Frisians are a group of people of northwestern Europe living in an area known as Frisia They are mainly in the Dutch provinces of Friesland and Groningen and in Germany East Frisia and North Frisia They said to be a tall big boned and light haired people and they have a rich history and folklore

The Frisians were able to make a treaty with the Romans at the River Rhine in AD 28 Sixteen years late they defeated the Romans under Tiberius at the Battle of Baduhennawood The Frisii were known and respected by the Romans and written about by several writers Tacitus wrote about the Germanic peoples in 69 describing the habits of the Germanic people as well as listing numerous tribes by name Of the many tribes he listed the Frisians are the only ones that have kept their ancient name

They were probably a people of seafarers The North Sea from Britain to Eastern Denmark was called Mare Frisia at that time Small groups of Frisians settled the surrounding lands and their settlements have been found in England Scotland Denmark Germany Belgium France and obviously The Netherlands

Their territory followed the coast of the North Sea from the mouth of the Rhine river up to that of the Ems their eastern border according to Ptolemys Geographica 

In the 5th century many of them joined the migration of the Anglo Saxons who went through Frisian territory to invade Great Britain while those who stayed in Europe moved into the newly emptied lands previously lived in by the Anglo Saxons

Vampire bats is a subfamily of bats Unlike other bats vampire bats feed on blood Currently there are three species of bats known to do this All of them live in the Americas in Mexico Brazil Chile and Argentina Of the three known species one feeds on the blood of mammals the other two on the blood of birds

The common vampire bat lives in large groups of up to 100 animals They have developed complex social behaviour 

Vampire bats commonly spread diseases most notably rabies The saliva of the vampire bats contain chemicals that prevent the clotting of the blood of the victim this has been used to develop drugs to help the patients of strokes and heart attacks

The False Vampire Bats are not vampire bats they do not feed on blood some eat fruits others devour small animals

Vampires may be modeled on the bats

Prehistoric Britain was a period in the human occupation of Great Britain that ended with the Roman invasion of Britain in AD 43

Britain has been inhabited for hundreds of thousands of years None of the pre Roman inhabitants of Britain had any written language so their history culture and way of life are known only through archaeological finds 

The first written record of Britain and its inhabitants was by the Greek navigator Pytheas who explored the coastal region of Britain around 325 BC Ancient Britons were however involved in extensive trade and cultural links with the rest of Europe from the Neolithic onwards especially in exporting tin

Palaeolithic Britain is the period from almost 750000 years ago until around 10000 years ago This huge length of time saw many changes in the environment several glacial and interglacial periods which greatly affected human settlement in the region 

There is evidence from bones and flint tools found in coastal deposits near Happisburgh in Norfolk and Pakefield in Suffolk that Homo erectus was present in what is now Britain around 700000 years ago At this time southern and eastern Britain was linked to continental Europe by a wide land bridge allowing humans to move freely The current position of the English Channel was a large river flowing westwards and fed by tributaries that would later become the Thames and Seine 

The extreme cold of the following Anglian glaciation is likely to have driven humans out of Britain altogether A warmer time period lasted from around 300000 until 200000 years ago The more advanced flint technology permitted more efficient hunting 

There is little evidence of human occupation during the subsequent Ipswichian interglacial between around 130000 and 110000 years ago 

Neanderthal occupation of Britain was limited and by 30000 BC the first signs of modern human activity The most famous example from this period is the burial of the Red Lady of Paviland in modern day Wales A final ice age covered Britain between around 70000 and 10000 years ago with an extreme cold snap between 22000 and 13000 years ago which may have driven humans south out of Britain altogether The environment during this ice age period would have been a largely treeless tundra eventually replaced by a warmer climate perhaps reaching 17 degrees Celsius in summer which encouraged the expansion of birch trees as well as shrub and grasses

The dominant food species were the Wild Horse and Red Deer although other mammals ranging from hares to mammoth were also hunted By 10500 years ago the climate was becoming cooler and dryer Food animal populations seem to have declined although woodland coverage expanded Tool manufacture in the Final Upper Palaeolithic revolved around smaller flints and bone and antler work became less common However the number of known sites is much larger and more widely spread Many more open air sites are known such as that at Hengistbury Head

Around 10000 years ago the ice age finally ended Temperatures rose probably to levels similar to those today and forests expanded farther By 8500 years ago the rising sea levels caused by the melting glaciers cut Britain off from continental Europe for the last time The warmer climate changed the Arctic environment to one of pine birch and alder forest

Farming of both crops and domestic animals was adopted in Britain around 4500 BC at least partly because of the need for reliable food sources

Traditionally the arrival of the Neolithic in Britain has been seen as a wave of immigration from the continent Modern archaeology now considers that farming along with pottery and settled living was in fact adopted by the native population who were related to the similarly newly farming Neolithic people across the water Links with continental Europe are demonstrated by finds of axes made from exotic stone such as jadeite 

Analysis of the mitochondrial DNA of modern European populations shows that over 80 are descended in the female line from European hunter gatherers Less than 20 are descended in the female line from Neolithic farmers from the Middle East In 1997 DNA analysis was undertaken on a tooth from a Mesolithic man whose remains were found in Goughs Cave at Cheddar Gorge His mitochondrial DNA was of a type found in 11 of modern European populations 

Such findings have cast doubt on the traditional view of successive waves of mass immigration annihilating earlier peoples In any case the Neolithic Revolution as it is called introduced a more settled way of life and ultimately led to societies becoming divided into differing groups of farmers artisans and leaders 

The construction of the earliest earthwork sites in Britain began during the early Neolithic in the form of long barrows used for communal burial 

The Middle Neolithic saw the development of cursus monuments close to earlier barrows The earliest stone circles and individual burials also appear

New enclosures called henges were built along with stone rows and the famous sites of Stonehenge and Silbury Hill reached their peak Industrial flint mining such as that at Cissbury and Grimes Graves began

In around 2700 BC a new culture arrived in Britain often referred to as the Beaker culture Beaker pottery appears in the Mount Pleasant Phase along with flat axes and burial practices of inhumation The megalithic phases of Stonehenge date to this period

Britain had large reserves of tin in the areas of Cornwall and Devon in what is now southwest England and thus tin mining began By around 1600 BC the southwest of Britain had a trade boom as British tin was exported across Europe

The Beaker people were also skilled at making ornaments from gold and examples of these have been found in graves of the wealthy Wessex culture of southern Britain

In around 750 BC iron working techniques reached Britain from southern Europe Iron was stronger and more plentiful than bronze and its introduction marks the beginning of the Iron Age Iron working revolutionised many aspects of life most importantly agriculture Iron tipped ploughs could churn up land far more quickly and deeply than older wooden or bronze ones and iron axes could clear forest land far more efficiently for agriculture

About 900 BC British society changed again The Celtic culture had by 500 BC covered most of the British Isles The Celts were highly skilled craftsmen and produced nicely patterned gold jewellery and weapons in bronze and iron

Iron Age Britons lived in organised tribal groups ruled by a chieftain 

As people became more numerous fights broke out between opposing tribes This led to the building of hill forts The first had been built about 1500 BC Britain exported hunting dogs animal skins and slaves

The last centuries before the Roman invasion saw refugees from Gaul known as the Belgae who were displaced as the Roman Empire expanded

From around 175 BC they settled in the areas of Kent Hertfordshire and Essex and brought with them pottery making skills far more advanced than anything produced previously The Belgae were partially Romanised and were responsible for creating the first settlements large enough to be called towns

About 100 BC iron bars began to be used as currency coinage was developed based on continental types

As the Roman Empire expanded northwards Rome began to take interest in Britain See Roman Britain for the history of this period

The Domesday Book is the record of the great survey of much of England and parts of Wales completed in 1086 done for William I of England or William the Conqueror 

The Domesday Book was a record of all taxable land in England together with such information as would indicate its worth 

As the scribes went round England they were protected by Williams armed men Each group was led by a Royal Commissioner who took a list of standard questions A jury of local nobility and citizens answered the questions All answers were written down in Latin

Information was collected from the start of 1086 and working up into the complete volume started later that year William died in 1087 before the writing up work was completed

William the Conqueror wished to know the details of the land he had conquered England He let his knights and barons have big areas of land and wanted rent money from them The Domesday Book was a record of every farm village and house so that he knew how much rent he should get Only some small villages in the country side are not in the book Major cities like London and Winchester are also not in the Domesday Book perhaps because of their size or because the people could not be taxed 

The Domesday book gave the names of King Williams friends and even listed the number of pigs on a piece of land But it was not like a modern census It did not give the names of all the people It listed the heads of each household but left out Londoners monks nuns and anyone living in castles In effect it listed only people he could get rent from and who might supply men to fight in his army

The Domesday Book is two volumes One of the books was called Great Domesday and the other was called Little Domesday The draft of the second volume Little Domesday was never worked up but no doubt was used for tax collection just the same

The Domesday book got its name because its lists were so complete that it reminded people of the Last Judgment in Christianity when lists of what people have done go before God for people to be judged

The name LD50 is an abbreviation for Lethal Dose 50 or median lethal dose It is the amount of the substance required to kill 50 of the test population 

The test was created by JW Trevan in 1927 but has now been phased out The US Food and Drug Administration has begun to approve non animal alternatives to LD50 in response to research cruelty concerns and the lack of validitysensitivity of animal tests as they relate to humans  

The Dahlerau train disaster was a railway disaster that happened on 27 May 1971 It happened in Dahlerau which is a part of Radevormwald in Germany

A passenger train carrying pupils was travelling on the railway line from Wuppertal to Radevormwald on the evening of 27 May 1971 The pupils belonged to the final year of a school in Radevormwald and were returning from a trip to Bremen Around 2100 the train had just left the railway station in Wuppertal Beyenburg and was a few minutes away from the railway station in Dahlerau Farther south a freight train was traveling from Radevormwald to Wuppertal and had just arrived outside the Dahlerau station The freight train would have to wait in the station to allow the passenger train to pass This was necessary because the passenger train was 30 minutes late and there was only one track on the railway line outside the station

The dispatcher in the station would have to go outside and show a red lantern to the freight train because there were no signals in the station Nobody knows for sure what happened but the freight train went right through the station and onto the track where the passenger train was running The driver of the freight train later told that the dispatcher in the station had shown him a green light This was the signal not to stop

The dispatcher had seen what happened and tried to hold the train back with emergency signals but he failed and the train disappeared behind a curve He went into his office to call the station in Wuppertal Beyenburg but the passenger train had already left Beyenburg The dispatcher knew what would happen and called the police Meanwhile about 800 metres north of the station the two trains crashed The passenger train was crushed to 13 of its length because it consisted of light railbuses and the freight train locomotive was five times as heavy Police firefighters and ambulances arrived quickly but had problems rescuing people This was because the crash happened on a hillside The parents of the pupils had also heard of the accident and had come to search for their children In all 25 people were injured many of them badly 46 people died in the accident Of these 46 41 were pupils two teachers one was a mother who travelled with the children and two were working for the railway Only one person walked away from the accident without injuries So many people had died that they had to be put in a gymnasium

The dispatcher died a few weeks after the crash He had a car accident but police said it was not suicide Because the dispatcher could not be asked investigating the crash was difficult and took about a year In the end it was decided that human error was the cause for the accident Nobody could find out the exact happenings on that evening and so the case never went before a court The passenger train was badly damaged and had to be destroyed The locomotive of the freight train was repaired and stayed in service until 2001

The victims were buried on 2 June 1971 More than 10000 people attended the funeral and all shops in Radevormwald were closed on that day Many important people went to the funeral like Chancellor Willy Brandt and the Minister of Transport The victims were buried together in a large grave on the Radevormwald cemetery Later a memorial was built near the graves as well

The Deutsche Bundesbahn the company who ran the trains changed the lanterns used by the dispatchers They would not show a red light any more so that red and green could not be confused any more They also built the successors of the type of railbus that crashed sturdier because some people said they had been built too light

The line from Wuppertal to Radevormwald was closed in 1976

The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake also called the Sumatra Andaman earthquake was a great underwater earthquake It happened at 005853 UTC December 26 2004 The epicenter of the earthquake was off the west coast of Sumatra Indonesia At first the earthquake was measured as a 90 on the Richter scale Later scientists said it was as high as a 93 Only the Great Chilean Earthquake has been more powerful The earthquake also was the longest ever recorded It lasted between 500 and 600 seconds It was so powerful that it caused the entire Earth to vibrate It started other earthquakes as far away as Alaska

The large movement of earth under the water caused a very large and powerful tsunami The tsunami was called the Asian Tsunami or the Boxing Day Tsunami in Australia Canada England and South Africa because it happened on the holiday of Boxing Day The tsunami caused a lot of damage to countries such as Philippines Thailand Indonesia and Sri Lanka It also devasted the eastern coast of Indiasuch as the states of Tamil NaduOrissa and Andhra Pradesh

Waves as high as 30m killed many people and damaged or destroyed a lot of buildings and other property Over 225000 people died or were not found after the Tsunami The wave itself was 3 times the size of Moscow Russia The wave traveled as far away as South Africa where as many as 8 people died because of high water caused by the wave Because of how much damage was caused and the number of people the earthquake affected over 7 billion was donated to help the survivors and rebuild the areas damaged

Taiwan is an island of eastern Asia Its first people were related to Oceanic people with small numbers of Chinese After the arrival of the Dutch in the 1600s many Chinese moved to Taiwan to work Few European people moved to Taiwan and the native people married with Chinese or moved away from the west side of the island When the Qing dynasty began in China a supporter of the old Ming dynasty hid in Taiwan Eventually the Qing came to Taiwan defeated him and added Taiwan to China Taiwan remained Chinese territory through most of the Qing dynasty until it was taken by Japan in 1895 Taiwan became a colony of Japan for fifty years until the end of World War Two For a brief time it was under the control of China through the Guomindang government but that government lost a civil war and moved to Taiwan The rule of the Guomindang is considered controversial in the modern day Some criticize its treatment of the people of Taiwan but others focus on positive political and economic change that it made In the 1980s the government Taiwan has became more democratic This has also become controversial because it has allowed different political parties to compete The Democratic Progressive Party gained influence in the government During this time Taiwan has officially been called the Republic of China but has acted independently of China The Peoples Republic of China demands that Taiwan must become a part of China while most Taiwanese debate the appropriate political status for today These perspectives create a complicated situation in the politics of Taiwan

The original people to move to Taiwan can be called the Aboriginal people They have many similarities with others societies called Austronesian Chinese historians have mentioned Taiwan several times since its Three Kingdoms period although it was considered a land of barbarians

About 50000 years ago was called the Old Stone Age in Taiwan At that time people hit rocks against each other to make tools The most famous culture of Taiwanese old stone age is Changping Culture The Changping cultures monument is the Eight Gods Hole Monument in Taitung Conty

About 5000 years ago was the New Stone Age People in New Stone Age sharpened stones to make tools We can take New Stone Age into three parts The most famous cultures are the Tapenken culture the Beinan culture and the Yuanshan culture The Tapenken culture monument is the Tapenken Monument in Taipei the Beinan cultures monument is the Puyuma Relics in Taitung Conty and the Yuanshan cultures monument is the Yuanshan Monument in Taipei City

About 2000 years ago was the Metal Age In the Metal Age people used metal to make tools and started trading The most famous culture in Metal Age is the Thirteen Hangs Cultures Its monument is the Thirteen Hangs Monument in Taipei County

In the 17th century the Dutch took control of Taiwan During this time it was a Dutch colony and it encouraged Chinese people to move there Few Chinese had lived on Taiwan until this time As more Chinese moved to Taiwan there was conflict with the Aboriginal people The Aboriginal people either married with Chinese or moved away from the west of Taiwan During the time of Dutch control Spain also briefly held northern Taiwan but the Dutch removed them in 1642 

In 1644 the Qing Dynasty began ruling China and Ming Dynastys courtier Koxinga landed Taiwan removed the Dutch and ruled Taiwan He turned it into a place to resist the Qing Dynasty This period is called the period of Ming Zheng or the Kingdom of Tungning the Kingdom of Yanping One year later the Qing Dynasty ended the Kindom of Tungning The Qing Dynasty ruled Taiwan for 212 years until 1895 

Japan first showed interest in Taiwan in the 1870s It tested the strength of the Qing Dynastys control in 1871 Some ship wrecked Okinawan fishermen were killed by Aboriginal people in southern Taiwan and Japan demanded compensation Okinawa had secretly paid tribute to both China and Japan In this situation Japan claimed Okinawa was part of Japan and it must protect its own people There was no war but China stated it could not control barbarian people Japan used this excuse to demand Taiwan after it defeated China in the First Sino Japanese War Taiwanese people rebelled without the support of China and created the Republic of Formosa that lasted for about one year Japan crushed Taiwanese resistance but it was the beginning of Taiwanese nationalism

In 1945 the Republic of China won the Second Sino Japanese War The Allied Powers agreed to divide the territory of the Japanese Empire and Taiwan would be returned to Chinese control The Chinese civil war occurred at this time and in 1949 the Guomindang lost and escaped to Taiwan Taiwan was ruled by this one party until democratic reforms began in the 1980s

Katana is a Japanese long sword used mainly by samurai warriors It is the most important sword of the three swords worn by samurai katana wakizashi and tanto The katana was popular from 1400 AD until 1876 when the samurai disappeared as a social class 

In Japanese katana means a long sword and it represents a blade which is a little curved with a single edge and a very sharp point 

There are several types of katanas

Today katanas are mainly made of stainless steel of different quality But there are some swords made of zinc and aluminum alloys which are able to resist some external forces and are only used for decoration To determine the quality of a katana it is enough to check its resistance elasticity and endurance of the blade after striking

Generally katana is designed for cutting but it was widely used for stabbing too This depended mainly on the length of the hilt The katana could be easily used for cutting if it was made for using with both hands It was used for stabbing when the katana was made for using with one hand As a rule katana was worn by the belt with its blade up

Katana was very important in Japanese society This sword was thought to be the soul of its master Only a samurai was allowed to have a katana A simple man with a katana sword could be killed at once 

There was a tradition of wearing taking care and taking the katana out of its scabbard A samurai had to pay attention to the way he wore the katana when entering someones house A certain position in which a samurai has taken his sword out of the cover could be understood as aggression 

It was also important the way a samurai keeps his katana on a special stand for swords called katana kake This stand was used for both katana and wakizashi The blade had to have its point up just as when wearing the sword the handle had to be turned to the left This made katana available for handling any time it was needed 

The art of handling a katana was developed in martial arts like kenjutsu and iaijutsu Today this art is practiced in iaido and kendo martial arts The last one is the art of dueling with bamboo or wooden sword Old schools of handling katana swords still exist The most famous are Kashima Shin ryu Kashima Shinto ryu Tenshin Shoden Katori Shinto ryu 

The most appreciated technique of handling a katana is a school called Nitto Ryu This school taught how to use both a katana and a wakizashi during a fight The most famous samurai who improved this art was Miyamoto Musashi

Lindisfarne is a tidal island off the north east coast of England It is connected to the mainland of Northumberland by a causeway and is cut off twice a day by tides something well described by Sir Walter Scott

According to the 2001 census it had a usual population of 162

Large parts of the island and all of the adjacent inter tidal area are protected as Lindisfarne National Nature Reserve to help safeguard the internationally important wintering bird populations Grey seals are frequent visitors to the rocky bays at high tide

The monastery of Lindisfarne was founded by Irish born Saint Aidan He had been sent from Iona off the west coast of Scotland to Northumbria around AD 635 It became the base for Christian evangelising in the North of England and also sent a successful mission to Mercia Monks from the community of Iona settled on the island 

Northumberlands patron saint Saint Cuthbert was a monk and later Abbot of the monastery and his miracles and life are recorded by the Venerable Bede Cuthbert later became Bishop of Lindisfarne 

In the early 700s the famous illuminated manuscript known as the Lindisfarne Gospels was made probably at Lindisfarne 

Later a monk named Aldred added an Anglo Saxon translation to the Latin text This made the earliest surviving Old English copies of the Gospels 

In 793 a Viking raid on Lindisfarne scared many people throughout the Christian West The year 793 is often called as the beginning of the age of Viking raids A very famous passage in the Anglo Saxon Chronicle reads

In this year fierce foreboding omens came over the land of Northumbria There were excessive whirlwinds lightning storms and fiery dragons were seen flying in the sky These signs were followed by great famine and on January 8th of the same year the ravaging of heathen men destroyed Gods church at Lindesfarne

Eventually the monks fled the island taking with them the body of St Cuthbert which is now buried at Durham Cathedral The priory was re established in Norman times as a Benedictine house and continued until its dissolution in 1536 under Henry VIII It is now a ruin in the care of English Heritage who also run a museumvisitor centre nearby The neighbouring parish church is still in use

Lindisfarne also has the small castle based on a Tudor fort and open to visitors

The history of Tamil Nadu goes back to the early stone age The region of Tamil Nadu has been under continuous human habitation since prehistoric times

The civilisation of the Tamil people is among the oldest in the world and has been influenced by influenced and coexisted with many external cultures 

The three Tamil dynasties of Chera Chola and Pandya were all of ancient origins Together they ruled over Tamil Nadu with a unique culture and language contributing to the growth of Sangam Literature some of the oldest literature in the world 

They had extensive oversee trade contacts with the Roman and Greek empires later on These three dynasties were in constant struggle with each other as they wanted hegemony over the land 

Invasion by the Kalabhras during the third century disturbed the tradition and order of the land by displacing the three traditional ruling dynasties These occupiers were overthrown by the Pandyas and the Pallavas who restored the kingdoms The Cholas who came back from obscurity in the ninth century by defeating the Pallavas and the Pandyas rose to become a great power and extended their empire over the entire southern peninsula At its height the Chola empire had spread from Bengal in the northeast to Sri Lanka in the south The Chola navy held sway over the Sri Vijaya kingdom in Southeast Asia 

Rapid changes in the political situation of the rest of India occurred due to the incursions of Muslim armies from the northwest marked a turning point in the history of Tamil Nadu With the decline of the three ancient dynasties during the fourteenth century the Tamil country became part of the Vijayanagara Empire Under this empire the Telugu speaking Nayak governors ruled the Tamil land The brief appearance of the Marathas gave way to the European trading companies who began to appear during the seventeenth century and eventually assumed greater sway over the indigenous rulers of the land The Madras Presidency comprising of most of southern India including what is now Tamil Nadu was created in the eighteenth century and was ruled directly by the British East India Company After the independence of India by Mohandas Gandhi the Tamil Nadu state was created based on linguistic boundaries due to a Telugu man who wished the Telugu speaking land bordering Tamil Nadu to become its own state which it did Andra Pradesh was born This caused a chain reaction because the other languages also wanted their own states This led to state boundries because of linguistic reasons and gave birth to many other linguisticly devised states including Tamil Nadu 

Although there is very little concrete historical evidence that has been found so far for the period prior to 600 CE the history of the Tamil people probably predates this period Various legends became prevalent after the tenth century CE regarding the antiquity of the Tamil people According to Iraiyanar Agapporul a tentheleventh century annotation on the Sangam literature the Tamil country extended southwards beyond the natural boundaries of the Indian peninsula comprising of 49 ancient nadus The land was supposed to have been destroyed by a deluge The Sangam legends also added to the antiquity of the Tamil people by claiming tens of thousands of years of continuous literary activity during three Sangams However there have been no direct archaeological finds supporting these legends

The prehistoric period during which the Palaeolithic civilisations existed in the Tamil Nadu region has been estimated to span the period from about 50000 BCE until around 3000 BCE For most part of the lower Palaeolithic stage humans lived close to river valleys with sparse forest cover or in grassland environments The population density was very low and so far only two localities of this lower Palaeolithic culture have been found in south India One of these is in Attirampakkam valley in the northwest of Chennai in Tamil Nadu Archaeological research has uncovered evidence of fossil remains of animals and primitive stone implements around the northern Tamil Nadu that could be dated to belong to around 300000 BCE Humans in South India belonging to the species of Homo erectus lived in this primitive old stone age for quite a long time using only crude implements such as hand axes and choppers and subsisting on food he hunted and gathered instead of actively growing it according to his needs  

The ancestor of modern humans who appeared around 50000 years ago was more developed and could fabricate thinner flake tools and blade like tools using a variety of stones From about 10000 years ago humans made still smaller tools called Microlithic tools The material used by the early humans to make these tools were jasper agate flint quartz etc In 1949 researchers found such microliths in Tirunelveli district In Tamil Nadu the Neolithic period had its advent around 2500 BCE Humans of the Neolithic period made their stone tools in finer shapes by grinding and polishing The Neolithic humans lived mostly on small flat hills or on the foothills in small more or less permanent settlements but for periodical migration for grazing purposes They gave the dead proper burials within urns or pits They were also starting to use copper for making certain tools or weapons

Humans started using iron for making tools and weapons The Iron Age culture in peninsular India is marked by Megalithic burial sites which are found in several hundreds of places

Ancient Tamil Nadu contained three monarchical states headed by kings called Ventar and several tribal chieftaincies headed by the chiefs called by the general denomination Vel or Velir During the third century BCE the Deccan was part of the Mauryan kingdom and from the middle of the first century BCE to second century CE the same area was ruled by the Satavahana dynasty The Tamil area had an independent existence outside the control of these northern empires 

The names of the three dynasties Cholas Pandyas and Keralaputras or Cheras are mentioned in the Pillars of Ashoka inscriptions where they are mentioned among the kingdoms which though not subject to Ashoka were on friendly terms with him

Karikala Chola was the most famous early Chola He is mentioned in a number of poems in the Sangam poetry

Pandyas ruled initially from Korkai a sea port on the southernmost tip of the Indian peninsula and in later times moved to Madurai Pandyas are also mentioned in Sangam Literature as well as by Greek and Roman sources during this period The early Pandyas went into obscurity at the end of the third century CE during the incursion of the Kalabhras

The kingdom of the Cheras comprised of the modern state of Kerala along the western or Malabar Coast of southern India Their proximity to the sea favoured trade with Africa Internal and external trade was well organised and active 

After the close of the Sangam era from about 300 to about 600 CE there is an almost total lack of information regarding occurrences in the Tamil land Some time about 300 CE the whole region was upset by the appearance of the Kalabhras These people are described in later literature as evil rulers who overthrew the established Tamil kings and got a strangle hold of the country They did not leave many artefacts or monuments The only source of information on them is the scattered mentions in Buddhist and Jain literature

Jainism and Buddhism took deep roots in the society giving birth to a large body of ethical poetry

Writing became very widespread and vatteluttu evolved from the Tamil Brahmi became a mature script for writing Tamil

The medieval period of the history of the Tamil country saw the rise and fall of many kingdoms some of whom went on to the extent of empires exerting influences both in India and overseas The Hindu sects Saivism and Vaishnavism became more dominant with temples being built and Dravidian architecture being supported by empires replacing the significance of Nastik Jainism and Buddhism of the previous era Some of the output of villages throughout the kingdom was given to temples that reinvested some of the wealth accumulated as loans to the settlements 

Tamil script replaced the vatteluttu script throughout Tamil Nadu for writing Tamil Both secular and religious literature flourished during the period 

The seventh century Tamil Nadu saw the rise of the Pallavas under Mahendravarman I and his son Mamalla Narasimhavarman I The Pallavas were not a recognised political power before the second century After the fall of the Satavahanas they began to get control over parts of Andhra and the Tamil country The Pallavas were at their finest during the reigns of Narasimhavarman I and Pallavamalla Nandivarman II

During the sixth and the seventh centuries the western Deccan saw the rise of the Chalukyas based in Vatapi The Pallavas had the more difficult existence of the two as they had to fight on two fronts  against the Pandyas as wells as the Chalukyas

Pandya Kadungon is credited with the overthrow of the Kalabhras in the south Pandya Cendan extended their rule to the Chera country His son Arikesari Parantaka Maravarman had a long and prosperous rule He fought many battles and extended the Pandya power 

After some decades of expansion the Pandya kingdom was large enough to pose a serious threat to the Pallava power 

The Pandya power continued to grow under Srimara and encroached further into the Pallava territories 

Around 850 rose Vijayalaya made use of an opportunity arising out of a conflict between Pandyas and Pallavas captured Thanjavur and eventually established the imperial line of the medieval Cholas Vijayalaya revived the Chola dynasty and his son Aditya I helped establish their independence He invaded Pallava kingdom in 903 and killed the Pallava king Aparajita in battle ending the Pallava reign The Chola kingdom under Parantaka I expanded to cover the entire Pandya country However towards the end of his reign he suffered several reverses by the Rashtrakutas who had extended their territories well into the Chola kingdom 

The Cholas went into a temporary decline during the next few years due to weak kings palace intrigues and succession disputes

European settlements began to appear in the Tamil country during the Vijayanagara Empire In 1605 the Dutch established trading posts in the Coromandel Coast near Gingee and in Pulicat The British East India Company built a factory at Armagaon a village around 35 miles North of Pulicat as the site in 1626 

The conflict between the British and the French had as result in 1765 the Emperor of Delhi issued a firman recognizing the British possessions in southern India

Although the Company was becoming increasingly bold and ambitious in putting down resisting states it was getting clearer day by day that the Company was incapable of governing the vast expanse of the captured territories In 1784 Pitts India Act made the Company subordinate to the British Government 

The next few decades were of rapid growth and expansion in the territories controlled by the English The Anglo Mysore Wars of 1766 to 1799 the Anglo Maratha Wars of 1772 andPolygar Wars of 1800 1805 Dheeran chinnamalaithe Tamil king won three polygar wars against Britishers and at last he was hanged along with his two brothersThen Britishers took entire control of tamilnadu by settling east india company after the death of chinnamalai the brave Tamil king

The discontent in the various districts of the company territories exploded in 1857 into the Sepoy war Although the rebellion had a huge impact on the state of the colonial power in India Tamil Nadu was mostly unaffected by it 

In 1858 the British Crown assumed direct rule in India 

Failure of the summer monsoons and administrative shortcomings of the Ryotwari system resulted in a severe famine in the Madras Presidency during 1876  1877The government instituted a famine insurance grant setting aside 15 million Rupees Other civic works such as canal building and improvements in roads and railway were also undertaken to minimise effects of any future famines

The growing desire for independence began to gradually gather pace in the country and its influence in Tamil Nadu generated a number of volunteers to the fight against the British colonial power in the struggle for Independence Notable amongst these are Tiruppur Kumaran who was born in 1904 in a small village near Erode Kumaran lost his life during a protest march against the British 

In 1916 Dr TM Nair and Rao Bahadur Thygaraya Chetty released the Non Brahmin Manifesto sowing the seeds for the Dravidian movements

The trauma of the partition did not impact Tamil Nadu when India was granted Independence in 1947 There was no sectarian violence against various religions There had always been an atmosphere of mutual respect and peaceful coexistence between all religions in Tamil Nadu Congress formed the first ministry in the Madras Presidency C Rajagopalachari was the first Chief Minister Madras Presidency was eventually reconstituted as Madras State 

The Madras state was named Tamil Nadu in 1968 

Ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka during the 1970s and the 80s saw large numbers of Sri Lankan Tamils fleeing to Tamil Nadu 

The politics of Tamil Nadu have gone through three distinct phases since independence The domination of the Congress Party after 1947 gave way to the Dravidian populist mobilisation in the 1960s This phase lasted until towards the end of the 1990s The most recent phase saw the fragmentation of the Dravidian political parties and led to the advent of political alliances and coalition governments

Clarence Leonidas Fender also known as Leo Fender was an American instrument maker

He founded a company called Fender Electric Instrument Manufacturing Company which makes electric guitars electric bass guitars and electric guitar amplifiers Leo Fender designed electric guitars which he called the Telecaster and the Stratocaster Fender also designed the first bass guitar which he called the Precision Bass In the 1960s Fender designed another bass guitar which he called the Jazz Bass 

All of these instruments became popular Fender Electric Instrument Manufacturing Company sold thousands and thousands of these instruments Many rock and pop music bands from the 1960s to the 2000s use these electric guitars and electric bass guitars

Frets are thin metal strips which are used on several stringed musical instruments such as the guitar the electric guitar the bass guitar the mandolin and the banjo

These thin metal strips are mounted on the long necks of these stringed instruments The frets help the musician playing the instrument to know where to place their fingers on the instrument

The word amplifier usually refers to an electronic amplifier Electronic amplifiers make a signal from a radio or electric musical instrument louder and stronger Amplifiers are also hidden in any electronic thing that makes sound with loudspeakers This includes televisions radios computers and mp3 players to name a few

Devices similar to the electronic amplifier are made in mechanical engineering The power assisted steering and braking on a motor car utilise mechanical amplifiers to multiply the amount of force applied by the driver 

Electronic amplifiers make a signal from the radio or electric instrument louder and stronger by using transistors or vacuum tubes Electronic amplifiers have to be connected to electrical current or a battery to work Once the signal from the radio or electric instrument has been made louder and stronger the signal needs to be connected to a loudspeaker so that people can hear it

When an amplifier tries to make the sound louder than it can it adds distortion to the sound Some amplifiers are made to add controlled distortion Distortion from transistors sounds different than distortion from tubes Distortion from tubes is more musical Because of all this amplifiers usually add controlled distortion with tubes That is not to say that those amplifiers do not also use transistors That is to say that the part that gets more electricity than it can use without distortion is a vacuum tube

From the 1920s until the 1950s electronic amplifiers used vacuum tubes However electronic amplifiers with vacuum tubes were heavy and they produced a lot of heat They also broke down a lot 

Since the 1960s most electronic amplifiers have been built with transistors Transistors are lighter less expensive and more reliable

A loudspeaker which is also called a speaker is a device that is used to create the sound in radios television sets and electric musical instrument amplifier systems 

Loudspeakers use both electric and mechanical principles to convert an electrical signal from a radio television set or electric musical instrument into sound For a loudspeaker to produce sound the signal from the radio television set or electric musical instrument needs to be connected to an electronic amplifier 

Loudspeakers are usually built by using stiff paper cone a coil of thin copper wire and a circular magnet The cone copper wire and magnet are usually mounted in a rectangle shaped wood cabinet The coil of copper wire moves back and forth when an electrical signal is passed through it The coil of copper wire and the magnet cause the rigid paper cone to vibrate and reproduce sounds

Some loudspeakers are designed for lower pitched sounds such as woofer loudspeakers or subwoofer loudspeakers Other loudspeakers which are called tweeters are designed to reproduce high pitched sounds

Loudspeakers for electric musical instruments are usually much stronger and heavier than loudspeakers for radios or television setsLoud speakers main function is to convert electrical signals given to it into sound signals

Alexander Graham Bell invented the first loudspeaker in 1876 Bell invented the loudspeaker because he needed a device that would amplify sound for the telephone In 1878 Ernst Siemens from Germany invented an improved type of loudspeaker

Chorzw is a city in Poland in Silesia voivodship It has about 115000 inhabitants and an area of 33 km

Wabrzych is a town in southwestern Poland situated in the Lower Silesian Voivodeship It has about 126 000 inhabitants and 84 km The city belonged to Germany until 1945 The original German population being expelled after WW II

An organ trio is a type of jazz band with three musicians Usually a jazz organ trio consists of a Hammond organ player a drummer and either a jazz guitarist or a saxophone player 

Organ trios popular in the United States in the 1950s and 1960s Organ trios usually performed jazz music that had influences from blues music Organ trios are usually led by the organ player who is called the leader of the trio

Important organ trio leaders from the 1950s were organists such as Jimmy McGriff Jimmy Smith and Jack McDuff In the late 1960s organist Larry Young had a jazz fusion style organ trio In the 1970s Tony Williams had a jazz fusion band called Lifetime which was an organ trio In the 1990s and 2000s organist Joey DeFrancesco is an organ trio leader 

The word organ trio is also used to refer to the type of music played by organ trios from the 1950s and 1960s For example a person might say I want to listen to some organ trio music This would usually mean that they want to listen to music by Jimmy McGriff Jimmy Smith Jack McDuff or other well known organ trio leaders

Hegemony is the dominance of one group over other groups Hegemony is mostly used to refer to relationships between different nations This might be direct dominance such as through military might but is more commonly indirect dominance such as when a nation can dictate the terms of trade to its advantage 

This word is most often used when talking about international relations Many recent authors use hegemony to describe Americas relationship to the rest of the world 

A hegemonic relationship is usually described as less than an empire but more than a regional power This means a hegemon often does not actually take over other nations the way the British Empire did in the past On the other hand a global hegemon is more powerful than say Iran is in the Middle East

A hegemon is one who has a hegemony

Smoke is a cloud of very small solid particles that is made when something is burned with a flame such as wood or paper 

Smoke can be bad because if it goes into the lungs of a person it can hurt their lungs or even kill them Most people think that they are always able to see smoke but people cannot see some types of smoke they are invisible

When people smoke tobacco in cigars or cigarettes they are burning the tobacco and inhaling the smoke Tobacco smoke can hurt the mouth throat and lungs It can cause mouth throat or lung cancer It can also cause emphysema and bronchitis

Factories and power plants produce large amounts of smoke into the atmosphere which pollutes the air Eventually the toxic chemicals in smoke fall to the ground and then they pollute the soil and the water When the air soil and water are polluted with toxic chemicals the chemicals also get absorbed by plants and animals

When Dry ice is put into water it creates smoke also Dry ice is used for theatrical needs and for places that need illumination

While he was in Russia Litvinenko tried to publish a book in which he said President Vladimir Putin rose to power with help of the FSB He said the FSB tried to cover this up by frightening Russians by bombing apartment buildings in Moscow He said the FSB then pinned the blame on terrorists operating from Chechnya 

On 1 November 2006 Litvinenko suddenly became sick and was hospitalized He died three weeks later as a result of poisoining by polonium 210 The news of his death spread around the world and many felt the poisoning was done by the Russian government Vladimir Putin and Kremlin spokesmen have repeatedly denied this and many new leads have been taken upon during the case Although there are some suspects and theories in the murder no official arrest has been made yet

Apple Corps Ltd is a broken wikt linkmultimediamultimedia company started by The Beatles It grew out of their earlier company Beatles Ltd and included NEMS Enterprises the company started by Beatles manager Brian Epstein

The Beatles started Apple in 1967 because they wanted to help other musicians writers artists and other creative people to succeed They knew many talents were not discovered because the business side of their fields were controlled by large corporations Many corporations cared more about making money than developing new ideas The Beatles hoped to find and develop the best new talents Brian Epstein helped to work out the plans for Apple but died before the company was founded Epsteins family sold NEMS Enterprises to the Beatles because they did not wish to keep the company without him

Apples first business venture was a retail store called the Apple Boutique It was located on Baker Street in London England The outside of the building was painted with a strange broken wikt linkmuralmural and inside clothes and other items were for sale The mural and clothes were designed by an artistic trio called The Fool More things were stolen than sold in the boutique and it was not profitable Other local businesses did not like the mural outside and got the city to order it removed The Beatles decided to close the store and gave away everything that had been for sale

After Brian Epstein died the Beatles had not sought a new manager They believed they could handle their own affairs working together with just their helpers and their normal business contacts Over time this proved to be a bad idea Small disagreements between the band members turned into major problems at Apple and agreements could not always be worked out Many of the people hired to work for Apple caused more problems than they solved or cost the company money Magic Alex dreamed and talked big but could not deliver on the promises he made Even his recording studio at Apple had to be completely rebuilt because he had not planned it well or asked for outside help

The problems between the Beatles led to their breaking up early in 1970 Apple had been part of those problems and each Beatle lost interest as he saw his hopes for Apple would not work out Without their input Apple soon wilted Its divisions closed one by one Apple Recordss artists went to other labels or retired from recording Paul McCartney sued to dissolve the Beatless business interests The lawsuit went on for years The rebuilt Apple Studio was well liked and a good place to work on recordings but closed its doors by 1975 Apples townhouse headquarters was sold

Hashish is a sticky thick dark colored resin which is made from the flower of the female cannabis plant Cannabis sativa The cannabis plants leaves and flowers contain a chemical or drug known as THC which gives a person who smokes or eats parts of the cannabis plant a feeling of euphoria The name hashish comes from an Arabic word meaning herb 

The two main drugs made from the cannabis plant are marijuana and hashish Hashish has much more of the chemical THC than marijuana Hashish is an illegal drug in the United States Canada and many other countries It is controversial since some people think it should be legal some think it should be legal only for medical purposes and some think it should not be legal at all

To make hashish workers rub cannabis blossoms with their hands to get the resin to stick to their hands and then the resin is collected Another way to make hashish is to sift the ground up dried leaves through a screen and compress the powder resin to make a brick

A more modern method of producing hashish is through alcohol extraction In this method cannabis plants are ground up and covered in isopropyl alcohol or butane and left to sit The resulting mixture is then evaporated off the alcohol leaving the active terpenoid and terpene compounds which can be used immediately or cooked into bricks 

When a person wants to use hashish they usually smoke it by putting a small piece of hashish in a joint with tobacco or marijuana Then the person lights the paper roll with a flame and inhales the smoke that comes out

Another way that people use hashish is by putting a small piece of hashish in a pipe or bong then lighting it with a flame inhaling the smoke Some people also eat hashish usually by mixing it into food or baked goods

The legality of hashish use varies by country In the USA there are conflicting state and federal laws concerning the use of the drug Some states allow medicinal use but these state laws are superseded US federal law which prohibits all use of hash and marijuana 

Hashish is not legal in the Netherlands but there are no criminal laws against having a small amount of cannabis This is because the Netherlands has decided that having cannabis should not be a crime Some other countries are starting to decriminalize marijuana as well

In some countries such as Canada and America sick people with serious diseases can legally use marijuana if they have a prescription from a medical doctor When people with serious diseases such as AIDS or Multiple Sclerosis smoke marijuana it helps to improve their mood and increase their appetite

Hashish has much more of the chemical THC than marijuana THC is the chemical which causes people who take hashish or marijuana to feel euphoria Hashish is a much stronger drug than marijuana 

When people smoke hashish or eat hashish certain sensations come about One can start feeling any of the following depending on the strain or origin happy relaxed feeling silly cloudy which can be descriptive of the type of high experienced The term of getting high could mean that the effects are a more mental stimulation while other types that are for getting stoned tend to render the user in a relaxed and observational state The two types of this High are called 1 a heady high or 2 couchlock A heady high does exactly what it sounds like by creating mental stimulation that sometimes leads to exaggerated imagination and potential over analysis on simple subjects When one over does it the stimulation can lead to various degrees of dizziness euphoria and a sensation of feeling uncoordinated In a couchlock state one becomes extremely focused on a singular action or topic sometimes leading to an unproductive state The latter is achieved depending on the strain of marijuana or hashish and also depends on the amount of the drug taken

Since hashish is much stronger than marijuana people who take a very large amount of hashish may also see imaginary colors or patterns or see strange visions or thoughts which are not actually there Some people who take a large amount of hashish may start feeling scared strange or paranoid

In the 19th century hashish was used as a source of inspiration by Charles Baudelaires Club des Hachichins This was a group of French writers

Hashish is less dangerous than many other illegal drugs that are commonly used Unlike other drugs like cigarettes and alcohol it is impossible for a person to die from an overdose of hashish But a person who had a very large amount of hashish could start feeling sick or feeling strange

One of the dangers of using hashish is that a person is often less capable than when sober This increases the risk of normal accidents slightly but more importantly it changes the way you receive and process an emergency situation which could be dangerous in activities like driving a car or motorcyclefact

Smoking any drugs such as marijuana hashish or tobacco is bad for the lungs Smoke hurts the lungs and the throat because the smoke has tar in it and contains chemicals that can cause cancer in the lungs or mouth if the person smokes over a long time period A person who only eats hashish will not hurt their lungs or throat but may take too much without noticing in time to avoid side effects A relatively newer process of inhalation which is much safer than smoking is vaporizing the Hashish This method is based on increasing the temperature of the Hashish to about 190 195 degrees Celsius which is about the temperature THC vaporizes at but is far below the point when carbons begin being burned The end result is the THC compound being breathed in combined with air rather than the THC compound being breathed in with smoke

Addiction is not based on a substance but a persons ability to become addicted to a feelingFeeling like you cannot stop taking hashish Most other illegal drugs such as heroin crack and cocaine are very addictive This means that if a person starts taking heroin meth or cocaine the person will want to keep taking more of the drug even if it is making them sick Legal drugs such as tobacco and alcohol are also found to be addictive Tobacco has additives that make it more harmful than cannabis and hash

Hashish and marijuana are not addictive like heroin cocaine and cigarettes Most people are able to use hashish as a recreational drug and stop taking it when they want to However some people who use hashish over several months or several years do get a type of addiction called a psychological addiction This means that the person is addicted to the high

Hashish is often just called hash Slang terms vary from one country to country A pipe used for smoking hashish is often called a bowl A water pipe for smoking hashish is called a bong There are also many slang terms for hashish smoking such as getting faded blown or blazing Many slang terms for cannabis intoxication such as getting high getting stoned getting ripped toking bowls and spliffing are shared for hashish as the effects of cannabis marijuana and hashish are the same

A Ninja is a kind of spy or assassin who lived in Japan beginning in the 14th century 

Ninja were a mystery in Japanese history The correct Japanese word for these warriors was shinobi no mono Ninja is easier to say this is why it is more widely used Ninja warriors created secret associations and participated in many political killings Their mystery comes from the two ideas 1 they always participated in secret spy operations and political killings 2 ninja were hired by heads of army as paid warriors The art of fighting which was used by ninja was called ninjitsu which was a combination of shinobi no jitsu and shinobi jitsu

A ninja was always considered a superman who was able to fly and who possessed extra natural skills Ninja existed during the entire history of Japan but ninja only became specially trained people at the beginning of 15th century They mainly trained in the region of Iga and Koga 

Ninja were involved in samurai wars and were hired by samurai for different missions But at the same time samurai did not accepted them as noble warriors because most of the ninja came from lower social levels They were dangerous and could not be controlled Their methods of fighting did not fit the samurai code The samurai code is a code of honor For example the samurai warrior would show his rank and would only fight a samurai of equal or higher rank Japanese land lords widely used the services of the Iga and Koga ninja in the period of 1485 1581 But in 1581 one of the three daimyo who united Japan Oda Nobunaga attacked ninja from Iga province The ninja remained alive and ran to the provinces Kii and Mikawa where Tokugawa Ieyasu protected them Later Oda Nobunaga was killed by a samurai named Akechi Mitsuhide who later became an enemy to Tokugawa Ieyasu

The art of ninja fighting was transmitted from father to son or from master to best students But in the middle of 17th century Nakagawa Sosuntzin created a ninja school in the Mutsu Province It was called Nakagawa ryu and taught ninjitsu method of fighting Nakagawa Sosuntzin himself trained a group of 10 men which he called Hayamiti no mono Ninja were taught many more things than a samurai He had to be skilled at handling swords spears bows and many more but also he had to know about explosive and poisonous substances to be a good path finder and to survive in different situations Usually they were trained from young age and should have maintained their physical shape A ninja who could read and write was very appreciated 

A ninja usually wore black clothes which helped him to hide in the dark If they had to fight on the battlefield they put on a light armor which protected him but also permitted to move easily On the feet they worn Japanese socks which separated the big toe  

The diversity of ninja weapons and attributes is much wider than that of the samurai The main weapon of ninja was the sword Ninja sword was usually shorter than samurai katana and had a straight blade When they climbed the sword was put on the left shoulder thus the handle of the sword was close to the left ear Ninja also used different types of throwing knives and a weapon for fist called tagaki They used metallic claws on their feet which served them for climbing and for feet hits

They are also very close to the other form of Japanese killer a samurai

Sergei Sergeyevich Prokofiev was a Russian composer and pianist who came from Ukraine During his lifetime Ukraine was part of Russia Together with Dmitri Shostakovich he is one of the greatest Russian composers of the 20th century Children all over the world love to listen to his musical story Peter and the Wolf and the music for Lieutenant Kije but he wrote many other great works including symphonies concertos piano sonatas ballets and operas

Prokofiev was born into an educated family whose mother recognized very early her sons musical gifts His father was a college educated agronomist who managed the farm site of his employer in the Ukrainian steppe His mother played the piano reasonably well in her sons opinion The young Sergei started composing at a very early age By the time he was eleven he had written two operas and a series of small piano pieces he would later call little puppies Soon he was writing music with unusual time signatures and in unusual changes of key

Prokofievs formal musical education began when as a young boy he started taking lessons from Reinhold Glire In 1904 he went to study at the Conservatory in St Petersburg He was a brilliant student but he often disagreed with the way the professors were teaching He was bored with the lessons in orchestration from Rimsky Korsakov and the counterpoint lessons from Liadov although he could have learned more from these great men His main friends were the composers Nikolai Myaskovsky and Boris Asafiev He often showed them his latest piano compositions which sounded very modern Many of St Petersburgs newspaper critics did not like his music while others felt he showed great promise and was sure to be a futurist

Prokofiev spent the summer of 1909 back at home in the small Russian farming village of Sontsovka in what is now Ukraine where his father was an estate manager He worked in a way that was to be typical of him all his life he carefully kept a diary until the middle 1930s was an excellent chess player and writer kept making changes to a number of his earlier works He often borrowed music from one composition and put it in another or used unfinished works in new compositions

When he returned to St Petersburg he took piano lessons from a teacher at the St Petersburg Conservatory called Anna Esipova She worked hard to discipline him in his playing although he did not appreciate her efforts He also took conducting lessons from Nikolai Tcherepnin who taught him to like late Romantic composers such as Scriabin and Debussy He wrote some music himself in this style but most of the music he wrote at this time sounded very harsh and dissonant and although he was becoming quite famous many people hated it When he finished his studies at the Conservatoire he won its top prize with his First Piano Concerto although the examiners had found it hard to agree and Rimsky Korsakov said that Prokofiev was gifted but immature

Prokofiev travelled to London where he met many famous people including Diaghilev who had a very skilled ballet group called Ballets Russes The composer Igor Stravinsky had been writing ballet music for Diaghilevs dancers Prokofiev particularly loved Stravinskys Rite of Spring and it influenced his music He wrote an opera The Gambler based on the novel by Brusilov but the singers and the orchestra did not understand his music and refused to perform it One of the first works of Prokofiev to become known all over the world was his First Symphony known as the Classical Symphony He made the music sound like that of composers from the Classical period such as Haydn This symphony is still very popular today

In 1917 the Russian Revolution took place The country was in a chaotic state so Prokofiev went to the United States After a journey which took four months via the Transsiberian railway Tokyo and San Francisco he arrived in New York His first real success came from his connections with Cyrus McCormik in Chicago His first major commission was the opera The Love for Three Oranges for the Chicago Lyric Opera It was popular in Chicago but not in New York City where he really wanted to make his reputation He soon traveled to Paris to see Diagalev again whom he had met earlier in London His first ballet for him was Ala and Lolly which Diagalev did not like and would not perform This ballet later became Prokofievs Scythian Suite His next ballet was more successful The Tale of the Buffoon He also wrote his Third Piano Concerto which is his most popular concerto for piano Prokofiev lived off and on in Paris for fourteen years but he often went on tour performing his works on the piano In 1928 his Third Symphony was first performed much of which was based on music from his opera The Fiery Angel which was never performed completely in his lifetime In the late 1920s he was invited back to Russia Although many Soviet people tried to persuade him to stay there he decided to remain in the West where he was starting to have a very successful career  It was not until 1936 that he finally decided to move back to Russia Life was not easy in the Soviet Union for all types of creative people such as musicians poets writers and film makers  Composers were expected to write music which would make ordinary people happy and make them feel proud of their country and of the communist revolution Any music that did not do this was called decadent or formalist Many artists where punished for creating works that did not do what the socialist politicians expected of them Prokofiev had never been interested in politics and he thought the politicians would leave him in peace so that he could write the kind of music he liked

Back in Russia Prokofiev settled in Moscow He wrote several childrens pieces including Peter and the Wolf He was asked to write music for two important jubilees the 20th anniversary of the Revolution and the centenary of Pushkins death He took great care over this music Much of what he wrote was to be directed by Meyerhold but Meyerhold was arrested later tortured and murdered so the whole project never happened Some of the music written for the Pushkin centenary was later used in his opera War and Peace the Stone Flower ballet and Symphonic Waltzes He also wrote a very large piece called Cantata for the Twentieth Anniversary of the October Revolution using words by Marx Lenin and Stalin for a total of 500 performers The music included realistic effects such as gun shots machine gun fire and sirens However many critics said that the music was vulgar and it was not performed until 1966 long after Prokofievs death He tried to make the soviet authorities pleased by writing a safe opera called I am the Son of the Working People but the politicians stopped it during its early auditions The opera was going to be produced by Meyerhold but again it never happened because Meyerhold was arrested and executed

The World War II was a time of change for Prokofiev for several reasons In 1941 his marriage to Lina Llubera came to an end and his new companion Mira Mendelsohn and later wife saw him through his last years Lina was a foreigner and marriage to foreigners was made illegal at that time In 1948 she was arrested charged with being a spy and sent to a labour camp On the other hand Mira had lived her entire life within the Soviet system and was much more aware of how to survive in the politacally charged times In 1945 shortly after the premier of his Fifth Symphony he had a stroke which was the beginning of a period of bad health He spent a lot of time away from Moscow where it was unsafe The first signs that his health was to be poor occurred in Alma Ata in 1943 when he had a fainting spell He was an workaholic and this plus the pressures placed upon him by the Soviet system forced him to withdraw from an active social life in Moscow   Prokofiev lived with Mira for the rest of his life Lina was freed from the labour camp after Stalins death Later she left the Soviet Union and she died in London in 1989

During the war Prokofiev composed a lot of his best music He wrote his last piano sonatas as well as working on his operas Betrothal in a Monestary after Sherican and War and Peace and writing his film music for both Eisensteins Alexander Nevsky and Ivan the Terrible and composing his Fifth Symphony The first performance of this symphony given on 13 January 1945 was the last time he conducted in public He spent the rest of his life in a house in the country to the west of Moscow although during his last winters he lived in Moscow close to his doctors Even in these last years he was not to find peace Stalins rule of terror had serious effects on all Soviet artists In 1948 a committee of the Communist Party spoke out against several Soviet composers including Prokofiev They said that his music was formalist and alien to the Soviet people His opera War and Peace was not allowed to be performed because it was neither lyrical nor patriotic enough The works he wrote in his last years were mostly ones which the politicians officially approved His last great work of this period is the Symphony Concerto for cello and orchestra which used a lot of music from the unsuccessful Cello Sonata and greatly revised with the help of the cellist Mstislav Rostropovich

Prokofiev died of a brain haemorrhage on 5 March 1953 His death was hardly mentioned in the newspapers because the dictator Stalin died on the same day

Most do not see themselves as Arabs

Arab Christians are people who speak Arabic and have the religion of Christianity

Most Christian Arabs live in the Middle East where Islam is the biggest religion The largest number of Arab Christians are in Egypt In Arab populations of these places a big number of these Arabs are Christians In Brazil there are more than 12 million Arabs and most of these people are Christian

For hundreds of years Arab Christians have lived peacefully with Muslims and Jews Even after the spreading of Islam from the 7th century AD onwards many Christians chose not to change their religion to Islam Instead they kept Christianity as their belief As Muslims call them the People of the Book Christians in the area are to obey Islamic laws This is called the Shariah law

Arab Christians have been around before Arab Muslims This is because there were many Arab tribes that became Christians since the first century They were the Nabateans and the Ghassanids They protected the south eastern parts of the Byzantine Empire in north Arabia 

Arab Christians made important contributions to the Arab world and they still do Some of the best poem writers at certain times were Arab Christians and many Arab Christians were doctors writers government staffs and people who knew a lot about literature

A musical synthesizer is an instrument that uses electricity to make musical sounds Very often synthesizers have a keyboard like that of a piano When playing a piano keyboard sounds are made by hitting soft hammers against strings pulled very tight When playing a synthesizer keyboard sounds are made by turning electrical oscillators on and off Since synthesizer is such a big word the word is usually shortened to synth

An oscillator is something that vibrates or repeats the same pattern The pendulum of a clock for example is a very slow oscillator A piano string oscillates when struck by a hammer

Electric oscillators might be made using transistors They turn electricity into electrical patterns or signals that repeat over and over When different keys are pressed different notes are heard This is done by making the signal from the oscillator repeat at different rates 

The signal can be boosted in strength and sent straight to a loudspeaker But the sound of a simple signal can be boring after a while Sounds can be made more interesting in many ways

By combining many of these methods synths can now sound very much like older instruments For one example special synths called drum synths are used just to make the sounds a drummer might make Synths can also make many new sounds never heard before

In the early 2000s computers got fast enough so software synths could be made These are computer programs designed to look and work like a synth They tend to be less expensive so more can be used Most of these programs can be downloaded for free however this may be illegal which means that the police officers may arrest the player and send that person to jail

There are special tools available to play synths For example a thing called a wind controller lets players of wind instruments use their special skills But there is still a need for more ways to control synths to make them more expressive

 The word evangelicalism mostly means religious practices and traditions which are found in conservative Protestant Christianity 

Evangelicalism is typified by an emphasis on evangelism a personal experience of conversion biblically oriented faith and a belief in the importance of Christian faith to cultural issues In the late 20th century and early 21st century Protestant people churches and social movements have often been called evangelical in contrast to Protestant liberalism

Instead of arranging a coronation for the new king Duke Richard decided to take the throne for himself and became King Richard III He sent Prince Edward to live in the Tower of London and wait for his coronation He also got Edwards younger brother Prince Richard Duke of York to come and live at the Tower Earl Rivers was executed by Richard Gloucester was able to convince people that the two young princes were not the legal heirs to the throne On 25 June 1483 the Parliament said that Richard Duke of Gloucester was the legal king 

After a few months the two boys disappeared and what happened to them is still a mystery today Most people think that the two boys were murdered They became known as the Princes in the Tower It is most likely they were killed by their uncle Richard III It is also possible that they were killed by Henry VII who became king two years later

In 1674 during building work at the Tower a wooden chest was found under a staircase in the White Tower It contained the bones of two young boys It has never been proved that these are the missing princes but King Charles II had the bones buried in Westminster Abbey In 1933 the bones were looked at again by scientists who believed that they were the two princes

Lincolnshire is a county in the east of England It borders Norfolk Cambridgeshire Rutland Leicestershire Nottinghamshire South Yorkshire the East Riding of Yorkshire and Northamptonshire Its county town is the ancient city of Lincoln

Norfolk is a low lying county in East Anglia in the east of southern England It has borders with Lincolnshire to the west Cambridgeshire to the west and southwest and with Suffolk to the south Its northern and eastern boundaries are the North Sea coast including The Wash The county town is Norwich Norfolk is home to the Norfolk Broads a famous tourist and wildlife spot 

ISO 3166 2 is a standard It was made by the International Organisation for Standardisation It extends ISO 3166 to a national level ISO 3166 is about abbreviating geographical names like countries to two or three letter codes or numbers ISO3166 2 does the same with provinces on a per country level

Leicestershire is a county in central England It takes its name from the heavily populated City of Leicester its traditional administrative centre although the City of Leicester is today administered separately from the rest of Leicestershire The county borders onto Lincolnshire Rutland Northamptonshire Warwickshire Staffordshire Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire

Leicestershire was recorded in the Domesday Book

Northamptonshire is a county in central England with a population of 629676 It has borders with Warwickshire Leicestershire Rutland Cambridgeshire Peterborough Bedfordshire Buckinghamshire Oxfordshire and Lincolnshire The county town is Northampton

Northamptonshire has often been called the county of squires and spires due to its wide variety of historic buildings and country houses

Northampton is by far the largest town in the county with a population of 194122 This is followed by Corby Wellingborough Kettering Rushden and Daventry Most of the countys population is concentrated in a central north south

Cherwell Edge in Northamptonshire is near the River Cherwell north west of Banbury England The once heavily wooded hill and valley was mostly cleared many years ago The area now also covers the near by Cherwell Edge Golf Club that was recently built by it too The golf club is used by various local residents

Fractal Geometry is the study of sets called fractals When drawn a fractal is very rough looking Also it can be cut into parts which look quite like a smaller version of the set that was started with Another thing that fractals have is a dimension which is not what people would expect  often it is not a whole number Fractals have very simple descriptions Last of all even in very small parts of the set the set will still look very rough

The Koch Curve is a simple example of a fractal First start with part of a straight line  called a straight line segment Cut the line into 3 same sized pieces Get rid of the middle of those pieces and put in the top part of a triangle with sides which are the same length as the bit to cut out We now have 4 line segments which are touching at the ends We can now do what we just did to the first segment to each of the 4 bits We can now do the same thing again and again to all the bits we end up with We now do this forever and look at what we end up with

The Koch Curve is one of the simplest fractal shapes and so its dimension is easy to work out Its similarity dimension and Hausdorff dimension are both the same This is not true for more complex fractals

The Koch snowflake is the same as the Koch curve except it starts with an equilateral triangle instead of a line segment

Fractals have many applications eg in biology in earthquakes in finance where it is related to the so called heavy tail distributions and in physics This indicates that fractals should be studied to understand why fractals are so frequent in nature

An Earl or Jarl was an Anglo Saxon and Scandinavian title meaning chieftain and it referred especially to chieftains set to rule a territory in a kings stead In Scandinavia it got out of use in the Middle Ages whereas in Britain it became synonymous with the continental count

Today an earl is a member of the British peerage and ranks below a Marquess and above a Viscount A British Earl is equivalent to a continental Count Since there is no feminine form of Earl the wife of an Earl bears the rank of Countess

Lobsters are large crustaceans that live in the sea They form the family of Nephorpidae which is sometimes also called Homaridae Lobsters are an economically important type of seafood

Several different groups of crustaceans are known as lobsters When people talk about lobsters they mean clawed lobsters most of the time such as the genus Homarus Clawed lobsters are not closely related to spiny lobsters or slipper lobsters which have no claws or squat lobsters The closest relatives of clawed lobsters are the reef lobster Enoplometopus and the three groups of freshwater crayfish

Smaller kinds are sometimes called lobsterettes Lobsters are invertebrates and have a hard exoskeleton which protects them Like most arthropods lobsters must shed it in order to grow This is called moulting It makes them weak and easy to attack during this time When they are moulting some species colors might change

Lobsters live on rocky sandy or muddy bottoms from the shore to beyond the edge of the continental shelf They usually live alone in cracks or in broken wikt linkburrowburrows under rocks

Lobsters usually eat live food consisting of fish mollusks other crustaceans worms and some plant life Sometimes they will scavenge if necessary and may eat each other when they are in broken wikt linkcaptivitycaptivity however this has not been observed in the wild Lobster skin in the stomachs of lobsters has been found before although this is because lobsters will eat their shed skin after molting  Lobsters grow throughout their lives and it is not unusual for a lobster to live for more than 100 years They can thus reach impressive sizes According to the Guinness World Records the largest lobster was caught in Nova Scotia Canada and weighed 2014 kg

Being arthropods lobsters are largely bilaterally symmetrical Clawed lobsters often have unequal specialized claws like the king crab A freshly caught lobster will have a claw that is full and fleshy not small Lobsters have the cephalothorax which is the head connected to the thorax both of which are covered by the carapace of chitinous composition and the abdomen The lobsters head has two pairs of antennae three pairs of jaws Because a lobster lives in a murky environment at the bottom of the ocean its eyesight is poor and it mostly uses its antennae to feel around Studies have shown that the lobster eye is formed with a reflective structure at the top a rounded retina In contrast most complex eyes use lenses that change the direction of rays and a inward curving retina The abdomen of the lobster includes swimming legs and a tail fan

In general lobsters move slowly by walking on the bottom of the sea floor However when they are in danger and need to escape they swim backwards quickly by curling and uncurling their abdomen A speed of 5 metres per second has been recorded

Linuparus

Palinurus

Spiny lobsters also known as rock lobsters are a family of about 45 species of  crustaceans in the Decapoda Reptantia Spiny lobsters are also called crayfish sea crayfish or crawfish

Although they superficially resemble true lobsters in terms of overall shape and that they also have a hard carapace and exoskeleton the two groups are not closely related Spiny lobsters can be easily distinguished from true lobsters by their very long thick spiny antennae and by their complete lack of claws true lobsters have much smaller antennae and claws on the first three pairs of legs with the first being particularly enlarged Like true lobsters however spiny lobsters are edible and are an economically significant food source they are the biggest food export of the Bahamas 

Spiny lobsters are found in almost all warm seas including the Caribbean and the Mediterranean Sea but are particularly common in Australasia where they are referred to commonly as crayfish or sea crayfish and South Africa A new species Palinurus barbarae was described in 2006

The largest spiny lobster on record was over 1 m long and weighed over 118 kg

Spiny lobsters tend to live in crevices of rocks and coral reefs only occasionally venturing out at night to seek snails clams crabs sea urchins or carrion to eat Sometimes they migrate en masse in long files of lobsters across the sea floor Potential predators may be deterred from eating spiny lobsters by a loud screech made by the antennae of the spiny lobsters rubbing against a smooth part of the exoskeleton Spiny lobsters usually exhibit social habit by being together However recent studies indicate that healthy lobsters move away from infected ones and leaving the diseased lobsters to fend for itself 

The furry lobsters are sometimes separated into a family of their own the Synaxidae but are usually considered members of the Palinuridae The slipper lobsters are their next closest relatives and these two or three families make up the Achelata Genera of spiny lobsters include Palinurus and a number of anagrams thereof Panulirus Linuparus etc

Air plants are very curious because they do not need any roots to stay alive Instead they soak up moisture from the air around them through tiny silvery scales on their leaves They have so many of these scales that the whole plant can look grey In the wild they grow on tree banches in rainy and misty areas In the Caribbean there is a kind that grows on telephone wires

Urn plants are easy to keep They grow to about 60 cm across but because the stiff green and grey leaves have spiny edges they need to be out of the way Urn plants got their name because they have a hole in the middle made by the ring shaped arrangement of their leaves This central urn fills up with rainwater in the wild and is often home to insects and frogs Its flowers are held high on a single stem and protected by a globe of small pink leaves which lasts for several months

Vriesias are like urn plants but they have no spines and their leaves are softer They are often sold in flower shops and are very easy to look after Their flowers grow on a single stem protected by flattened colourful leaves It is better not to fill the central space with water as these soft leaved plants might rot instead their soil should be watered

Spanish moss is a grey plant found hanging from trees in the swamps of the southern United States especially in Louisiana but as far east as coastal Virginia To the south it spreads as far as Chile and Argentina It gained its current name from Spanish and French colonisers in the Gulf of Mexico The French called it Barbe Espagnole to insult their rivals and the Spanish in turn called it Cabello francs Today Spanish moss survives as a mild version of the French taunt although some call the plant Graybeard 

Bromelia the plant which gives its name to the family is the only other bromeliad with edible fruit Its berries taste a bit like pineapple but are less tasty and there are not very many on each plant

Fascicularia is the only bromeliad that can be grown in frosty areas It is not killed by frost if it is kept dry in the winter

Pitcairnia is the only wild bromeliad outside the Americas One species Pitcairnia feliciana was discoved living in West Africa It is probably descended from seeds carried by migrating birds

Puya is the largest bromeliad It can grow up to nine metres tall It lives in the Andes mountains and is sometimes eaten by bears for its nectar In Chile the young leaves of some puyas are eaten in salads

An oscillator is something that vibrates or repeats the same pattern Many things in nature move back and forth or up and down when pushed or struck In time natural oscillators slow down and stop because of friction

Eucalyptus is a name for a kind of tree Nearly all of them are from Australia Eucalyptus can be found in almost every part of the Australia 

There are more than 700 species of eucalypts They have many local names like gum trees mallee box ironbark stringybark and ash

Eucalypts have special flowers and fruits that no other trees have When it flowers a bud cap made of petals grows around the flower until it is ready to open Then the bud cap falls off to reveal a flower with no petals 

The woody fruits are called gumnuts They are roughly cone shaped and open at one end to release the seeds

Nearly all eucalypts are evergreen but some tropical species lose their leaves at the end of the dry season The leaves are covered with oil glands These oils are often used to treat coughs and colds

Many Eucalypts also change the shape of their leaves as they get older Young eucalypts have round leaves When one to a few years old the leaves of most kinds become longer and spearhead or sickle shaped A few kinds keep the round leaf shape all their lives Most species do not flower until the adult leaves starts to appear

The bark dies every year In smooth barked trees most of the bark falls off the tree leaving a smooth surface that is often colourfully marked With rough barked trees the dead bark stays on the tree and dries out Many kinds of eucalyptus trees have smooth bark at the top but rough bark lower down These different kinds of bark are used to arrange the eucalypts into groups  this is useful because there are hundreds of kinds of eucalypts and breaking down the group in this way makes the group easier to understand

The different groups are

Today specimens of the Australian Mountain Ash are among the tallest trees in the world at up to 92 metres in height and the tallest of all flowering plants taller trees such as the Coast Redwood are all conifers There is evidence that at the time of European settlement of Australia some Mountain Ash were indeed the tallest plants in the world

Most eucalypts cannot survive frost or can only stand light frosts down to 3 C to 5 C The hardiest eucalypts are the so called Snow Gums such as Eucalyptus pauciflora which is capable of withstanding cold and frost down to about 20 C Two sub species of this tree can survive even colder winters

Several other kinds especially from the high plateau and mountains of central Tasmania have produced extreme cold hardy forms It is seed from these hardy strains that are planted for ornamental trees in colder parts of the world

An oil found in eucalyptus leaves is a strong natural disinfectant which is used in some medicines but can be poisonous if too much is taken Several marsupials such as koalas and some possums are partly resistant to it These animals can tell which plants are safe to eat by their smell 

Eucalypts make a lot of nectar providing food for many insects

Eucalypts have a habit of dropping entire branches off as they grow Eucalyptus forests are littered with dead branches The Australian Ghost Gum Eucalyptus papuana is sometimes called the widow maker due to the high number of tree felling workers who were killed by falling branches Many deaths were actually caused by simply camping under them as the trees shed whole and very large branches to save water during droughts For this reason you should never camp under large eucalyptus branches

On warm days eucalyptus oil vapour rises above the bush to create the well known distant blue haze of the Australian landscape Eucalyptus oil catches fire very easily and bush fires can travel quickly through the oil rich air of the tree crowns The dead bark and fallen branches are also flammable Eucalypts are well adapted for periodic fires  in fact most species are dependent on them for spread and regeneration They do this in several ways by sprouting from underground tubers hidden buds under their bark and from seeds sprouting in the ashes after the fire has opened them

Eucalypts began between 35 and 50 million years ago not long after Australia and New Guinea separated from Gondwana Their coming coincides with an increase in fossil charcoal deposits but they remained a minor component of the rainforest until about 20 million years ago when the gradual drying of the continent and lessening of soil richness led to the growth of a more open forest type with mainly Casuarina and Acacia trees With the arrival of the first humans about 50 thousand years ago fires became much more frequent and the fire loving eucalypts soon came to account for roughly 70 of Australian forest

Eucalypts grow back quickly after fire The two valuable timber trees Alpine Ash and Mountain Ash are killed by fire and only grow back from seeds The same fire which had little impact on forests around Canberra has resulted in thousands of hectares of dead forests

Eucalypts have many uses which have made them important Because of their fast growth the main benefit of these trees is the wood They provide many uses such as planting in parks and gardens timber firewood and pulpwood Fast growth also makes eucalypts suitable as windbreaks

Eucalypts draw a very large amount of water from the soil They have been planted in some places to lower the water table and reduce the amount of salt in the soil Eucalypts have also been used as a way of reducing malaria by draining the soil in such places as Algeria Sicily mainland Europe and California Drainage removes swamps which provide a habitat for mosquito larvae but such drainage can also destroy harmless habitats by accident

Eucalyptus oil is refined from the leaves by steaming It can be used for cleaning deodorising and in very small amounts in food supplements especially sweets cough drops and decongestants Eucalyptus oil is an insect repellent

The nectar of some eucalyptus produces high quality honey In the western United States the flowering is in late January before the flowering of other nut and fruit trees this means that its nectar can be easily made into its own kind of honey which is said to have a buttery taste

The ghost gums leaves were used by Aborigines to catch fish Soaking the leaves in water releases a mild tranquiliser which stuns fish making them easy to catch

Eucalyptus is also used to make the digeridoo a musical wind instrument made popular by the Aborigines

Eucalypts were first introduced to the rest of the world by Sir Joseph Banks botanist on the Cook expedition in 1770 They have since been introduced to many parts of the world Several species have become invasive and are causing major problems for local wildlife 

In Spain they have been planted in pulpwood plantations replacing native oak woodland As in other such areas while the original woodland supports kinds of native animal life the eucalypt groves cannot support the local wildlife leading to silent forests and the decline of wildlife populations On the other hand eucalyptus helps several industries such as sawmilling pulp and charcoal making 

In the 1850s many Australians traveled to California to take part in the California Gold Rush Much of California has similar climate to parts of Australia and some people had the idea of introducing eucalyptus By the early 1900s thousands of hectares of eucalyptus were planted with the encouragement of the state government It was hoped that they would provide a renewable source of timber for construction and furniture making However this did not happen partly because the trees were cut when they were too young and partly because the Americans did not know how to process the cut trees to prevent the wood from twisting and splitting

One way in which the eucalyptus mainly the blue gum proved valuable in California was in providing windbreaks for highways orange groves and other farms in the mostly treeless central part of the state They are also admired as shade and ornamental trees in many cities and gardens

Eucalyptus forests in California have been criticized because they drive out the native plants and do not support native animals Fire is also a problem The 1991 Oakland Hills firestorm which destroyed almost 3000 homes and killed 25 people was partly fueled by large numbers of eucalyptus in the area close to the houses

In some parts of California eucalyptus forests are being removed and native trees and plants restored Some people have also illegally destroyed some trees and are suspected of bringing in insect pests from Australia which attack the trees

In 1910 the eucalyptus were introduced on Brazil for timber substitution and the charcoal industry Regrettably the long term effects were not studied and in the present the eucalyptus is causing problems because of its high consumption of water This causes the soil to dry out killing many local plants which the local animals need to survive

Cell theory is a way to describe the biology of living things Cell theory says that the cell is the basic unit of life Cells by themselves are alive but they can also be part of a larger living thing The smallest living organisms and the biggest ones are all made of cells Very small organisms like bacteria and amoebas are only made of one cell each so they are called unicellular organisms Larger organisms are made of many cells and they are called multicellular organisms

Cell theory has 3 basic points 

Cells are born from older cells in a process called cell division Cells contain information that is passed from the parent cell to the daughter cells so that the daughter cells can do what they need to do This information is carried on molecules called DNA

Because cells are alive they must be able to eat and do other things to stay alive All cells have chemical ways of consuming food These are part of its metabolism

Even though there are many kinds of cells they have some similarities too Many of the chemicals inside of them are the same

Robert Hooke discovered cells in 1663 He used a microscope to look at a piece of cork cambium What he saw through the microscope reminded him of the small rooms that monks lived in These rooms were called cellula in Latin so Hooke called his discovery cells Hooke did not know that he was looking at dead cell walls and not living cellsFactdateMarch 2007 These cell walls did not have the nucleus and other organelles found in most living cells

The first man to look at a live cell under a microscope was Anton van Leeuwenhoek In 1674 he described the algae SpirogyraFactdateMarch 2007 He also described bacteria which he called animaculesFactdateMarch 2007

Oxfordshire is a county in the South East of England bordering on Northamptonshire Buckinghamshire Berkshire Wiltshire Gloucestershire and Warwickshire

It is divided into five local government districts Oxford Cherwell Vale of the White Horse West Oxfordshire and South Oxfordshire

The county has a major tourism industry The area is known for the concentration of motorsport companies and facilities Oxford University Press has headed a concentration of print and publishing firms the university is also linked to the concentration of local biotechnology companies

The main centre of population is the city of Oxford Other significant settlements are Bicester Banbury and Chipping Norton to the north of Oxford Witney to the west Thame and Chinnor to the east and Abingdon Wantage Didcot and Henley on Thames to the south Future population growth in the county is hoped to be concentrated around Banbury Bicester Didcot and Witney near the South Midlands growth area

The highest point of the county is Whitehorse Hill in the Vale of White Horse reaching 856 feet

The county of Oxfordshire was formed in the early years of the 10th century

Historically the area has always had some importance it has been good agricultural land resting between the main southern cities and Oxford The area was part of the Cotswolds wool trade from the 13th century The Great Western Railway reached Didcot in 1839 Morris Motors was founded in Oxford in 1912 and MG in Abingdon in 1929 The importance of agriculture as an employer has gone down in the 20th century today less than one percent of the countys population are involved

The Vale of the White Horse and parts of South Oxfordshire south of the River Thames were historically part of Berkshire but were added to the administrative county in 1974 

Minnie Mouse is a cartoon character She is Mickey Mouses girlfriend They were both created by Walt Disney Her birthday is on 18th November 1928 But she only first appeared in 1928 in Plane Crazy She is also known as Princess Minnie and Maestro Minnie Minnies favourite foods are cheese chocolate and cake She loves listening to Jazz Music 

Minnie Mouses parents are both farmers Marcus Mouse is her fathers name His name was first used in the comic strip story Mr Slicker and the Egg Robbers But Minnies mothers name is Margie Mouse Minnie Mouse also has a sister called Mandie Mouse Minnie Mouse has twin nieces Millie and Melody Mandies daughters they are rarely seen now and when they are seen they are on their own without the other twin Marshal Mouse Marcus Mouses father and Minnie Mouses grandfather was also a farmer He is also seen in Mr Slicker and the Egg Robbers

Minnie Mouse has two pets a dog and a cat The dog is called Fifi Fifi has 5 puppies with Mickeys dog Pluto Pluto was Mickeys first dog he was called Rover at that time She also has a cat called Figaro this is the same cat which appears in the Disney movie Pinocchio

Walt Disney said in a interview in 1933 that in private Mickey and Minnie are married He also said that many people asked him about this Depending on the movie Minnie and Mickey are married or sometimes not married but always married and not married

From 19th January 1942 to 2nd May 1942 there was a comic magazine called The Gleam In this magazine once it said that Minnies real name was Minerva Mouse But the Walt Disney head office said that there is no register about her real name as Minerva There is not much information about Minerva but she is similar to Minnies character Therefore many people miss understood that Minerva was Minnies real name Formally Minnies name is only registered as Minnie Mouse However some sources say that Minerva is Minnies real name and that Minnies full name is Minerva Minnie Mouse More likely is that Minnies original name was the GermanDutch Wilhelmina which is about the only name for which Minnie is the official abbreviation Possibly this fact was suppressed during the 1930s as Germany became more unpopular due to its political and racial leanings

It seems that Minnies closest friends are Daisy Duck Donald Ducks girlfriend and also sometimes Clarabelle Cow She often goes shopping with Daisy and she spends a lot of time with her Her friendship with Daisy is more of a product of recent cartoons as they never interacted with each other during the Classic shorts Minnie also has another friend called Honor the Hippo and they keep their secrets in bits of moss on the pavement Minnies other friend Carly the Cat has a middle parting in her long hair

The order Notostraca has just two living genera in it Triops and Lepidura The two genera are considered living fossils as they have not changed in outward form since the Triassic

Notostracans or tadpole shrimps are omnivores living on the bottom of temporary pools and shallow lakes They live in pools of water on every continent except Antarctica They grow very quickly and can reach adulthood in a week Triops only live for a short time a record breaking female only lived to be 100 days When their pools dry upadult tadpole shrimp die Their eggs however stop developing for a time When they are in water again they come to life and new Triops are hatched This is because of a state known as diapause where eggs can lie dormant for up to twenty years before hatching again

The fossil record of Notostraca is extensive They occur in a wide range of geological deposits reaching back to the Carboniferous The lack of major morphological change since 250 million years ago has led to Notostraca being described as living fossils

The Notostraca abandonned filter feeding in open water and took up a benthic lifestyle in muddy waters taking up food from particles of sediment and preying on small animals

Notostracans keep the ancient condition of having two separate compound eyes These touch but do not become united as does happens in other groups of Branchiopods

Porphyria is the name for certain medical conditions or diseases Those who suffer from the disease can not make certain substances in the blood The condition may be because of a genetic deficiency or because it was acquired in some way This will manifest in either skin problems or some diseases of the nervous system or both Drugs are available that can at least treat the symptoms This disease is most common in European countries and often affects the skin When someone is affected by Porphyria they will start to lose their hair about two weeks after having an attack There is no cure for the hair loss however there is medication available to help prevent attacks

Diatoms are a big group of eukaryotic algae They are one of the most common types of phytoplankton Most diatoms are unicellular although some form chains or simple colonies Diatom cells are encased within a unique cell wall made of silica These walls called frustules take many forms some quite beautiful and ornate They usually consist of two asymmetrical sides with a split between them which gives the group its name

Diatom chloroplasts were probably derived from those of red algae The fossil record of diatoms starts in strata of the Lower Jurassic 185 million years ago Molecular clock evidence suggests an earlier date for their origin The entire genomes of two species of diatom have been analysed The analysis reveals that hundreds of genes in both species came from bacteria

Diatoms have some practical uses Diatom communities are a popular tool for monitoring environmental conditions past and present They are commonly used in studies of water quality They are also of interest to nanotechnology

Decapitation or beheading is the act of cutting off the head from the rest of the body of a living thing Beheading usually means that the removal of the head is intentional It is generally done during a murder or execution with an axe sword or guillotine If the removal of the head is an accident or unintentional it is called decapitation It can happen because of an auto accident explosion factory accident a mistake during a hanging or some other violent accident

Decapitation is always fatal that is the result is always death

Decapitation can also describe the removal of a head from a body that is already dead In these situations the head is usually a trophy or a public display of warning

Beheading was the usual means of death penalty in Scandinavian countries in the past Noblemen were behaded with a sword commoners with an axe The last execution by beheading in Finland occurred in 1822 when a farmhand Tahvo Putkonen was beheaded for murder The last beheading in Sweden occurred in 1910 when Johan Andersson Ander was guillotined for murder Also Germany France and Belgium favoured beheading in the past In those countries was carried out by guillotine

Last beheading in Europe occurred 1977 when a Tunisian murderer Hamida Djandoubi was guillotined in France 

Some countries especially Arab countries or former French colonies still use beheading as the means of execution In Saudi Arabia the convicts are beheaded with a sword

The executioner who performs beheadings is called a headsman

Dimitri Mendeleev was a Russian chemist He is said to be the main creator of the first version of the periodic table of elements Many of the predictions made in his periodic table were later proved correct by experiments

Mendeleev was born in Verhnie Aremzyani village near Tobolsk to Ivan Pavlovich Mendeleev and Maria Dmitrievna Mendeleeva His grandfather was Pavel Maximovich Sokolov a priest of Russian Orthodox Church from the Tver region Ivan along with his brothers and sisters obtained new family names while attending theological seminaryLater in life he invented the periodic table of elements

Mendeleev is thought to be the youngest of 14 siblings but the exact number differs among sources At the age of 13 after the death of his father and the destruction of his mothers factory by fire Mendeleev attended the Gymnasium in Tobolsk

In 1849 the now poor Mendeleev family relocated to Saint Petersburg where he entered the Main Pedagogical Institute in 1850 After graduation tuberculosis caused him to move to the Crimean Peninsula on the northern coast of the Black Sea in 1855 While there he became a science master of the Simferopol gymnasium 1 He returned with fully restored health to Saint Petersburg in 1857

Work was made by others in the 1860s to suggest that the elements display periodicity John Newlands who published his Law of Octaves in 1865 The lack of spaces for undiscovered elements and the placing of two elements in one box were criticized and his ideas were not accepted Another was Lothar Meyer who published a work in 1864 describing 28 elements Neither attempted to predict new elements In 1863 there were 56 known elements with a new element being discovered at a rate of approximately one per year

Mendeleev made other important contributions to chemistry The Russian chemist and science historian LA Tchugayev has characterized him as a chemist of genius first class physicist a fruitful researcher in the fields of hydrodynamics meteorology geology certain branches of chemical technology and other disciplines adjacent to chemistry and physics a thorough expert of chemical industry and industry in general and an original thinker in the field of economy Mendeleev was one of the founders in 1869 of the Russian Chemical Society He worked on the theory and practice of protectionist trade and on agriculture

The wakizashi is a traditional Japanese sword It is shorter than the katana which was well known in the beginning of the 17th century as a kodachi sword The two swords were always carried together the wakizashi finished off the work of the katana sword Such a sword could be from 30cm to 60cm long A small version was called a ko wakizashi a longer one was called an o wakizashi 

A wakizashi had a slightly curved blade with a square shaped hilt The hilt and the scabbard of a wakizashi was richly decorated with traditional motifs A wakizashi was more decorated than a katana because it was not used as much as a katana but still carried everywhere Another distinctive feature is the scabbard The sayas were made to be like the katana but they could have extra pockets for smaller knives a hair arranger etc 

The katana and the wakizashi together are called a daish which is translated as large and small The first part of the word means big and stands for the katana sword the second stands for wakizashi Wakizashi was more decorated than a katana and it was thinner this is why it was designed to cut through softer targets So it was a sword to make dangerous cuts in weak points of the human body The use of a daish on the battlefield gave its user a big advantage With the two swords the samurai could keep the enemies within a radius of action ranging from 2 to 7 feet Miyamoto Musashi a famous Japanese samurai was especially skilful at using the daish

A wakizashi sword was an irreplaceable weapon for a samurai The tradition says that when entering a house or any other building the samurai has to leave his katana with a servant but the wakizashi could be worn at all times and places This is why the wakizashi is often called the samurais side arm The wakizashi followed his master even when he went to sleep because it was always near the bed 

The wakizashi was carried along the thigh and was usually used with one hand the other hand was used for the katana The wakizashi proved to be very effective when the katanas length and weight made it hard to use The wakizashi needs less force to use and it is more maneuverable 

The wakizashi was also the sword used by merchants and artisans who were forbidden from wearing a katana This fact explains a greater number wakizashi swords were found than katanas There are even more wakizashi swords than katana swords although the katana swords had greater meaning for Japanese society 

The wakizashi sword was much used in the ritual of seppuku In this ritual it was used along with the shortest Japanese sword  Tanto The wakizashi was thrust into the torso cutting open vertically This kind of death was considered honorable for a samurai When a female samurai committed seppuku she would only cut her own throat

The Sea of Galilee is Israels largest freshwater lake about 53 kilometers around about 21 km long and 13 km wide it has a total area of 166 km and a depth of about 43 meters At 209 meters below sea level it is the lowest freshwater lake on Earth and the second lowest lake in the world after the Dead Sea a saltwater lake It is not a real sea  it is called a sea because of tradition 

The lake is also known on modern maps as Lake Galilee or Lake Tiberias in the region of Galilee In modern Hebrew it is known as Yam Kinneret Sea of Kinnereth It has also been called the Lake of Gennesaret or the Sea of Gennesaret after the name of a small fruitful plain on its western side The Arabic name for the lake is Buhairet Tabariyya meaning Lake Tiberias Other names are Ginnosar Lake of Gennesar Sea of Chinneroth Sea of Tiberias and Waters of Gennesareth

Its main source is the Jordan River which flows through it from north to south The lake is deep in the Jordan Great Rift Valley the valley caused by the separation of the African and Arabian Plates Because of this the area has earthquakes and in the past volcanic activity 

Due to its low lying position in the rift valley surrounded by hills the sea can get sudden violent storms as in the New Testament story about Jesus calming the storm A main feature of the lake seems to be that it is always changing It is still famous just as in New Testament times for having plenty of fish and in todays restaurants St Peters Fish is very popular

History and scripture The Sea of Galilee is on the ancient Via Maris road which linked Egypt with the northern empires The Greeks Hasmoneans and Romans started towns and settlements here Gadara Hippos Tiberias and others The 1st century historian Flavius Josephus wrote of a large fishing industry at this time with 230 boats regularly working in the lake

Much of the ministry of Jesus was on the shores of Lake Galilee In those days there were many settlements and villages all around the lake and plenty of trade and ferrying by boat The gospels of Mark Matthew and Luke tell how Jesus got four of his apostles from the shores of Lake Galilee the fishermen Simon and his brother Andrew and the brothers John and James One of Jesus famous teachings the Sermon on the Mount was given on a hill overlooking the lake Many of his miracles were also recorded to have been here his walking on water calming a storm feeding five thousand people and many others

In 135 the second Jewish revolt against the Romans called Bar Kokhbas revolt was put down The Romans responded by sending all Jews away from Jerusalem and not letting them come back The center of Jewish culture and learning thus moved to the region of the Kinneret particularly to the city of Tiberias 

In the time of the Byzantine Empire the lakes importance in Jesus life made it a major destination for Christian pilgrims This led to the growth of a tourist industry with package tours and plenty of comfortable inns

The lake lost importance when the Byzantines lost control of it The area came under the control of the Umayyad Caliphate and later Islamic empires Except for Tiberias little by little the major towns and cities began to be left empty In 1187 Saladin defeated the armies of the Crusades at the Battle of Hattin mainly because he cut the Crusaders off from the valuable fresh water of the Sea of Galilee

In 1909 Jewish pioneers built their first cooperative farming village Kvutzat Kinneret which trained Jewish immigrants in farming and agriculture Kinneret was the center of the Kibbutz culture of early Zionism

In 1923 an agreement between the United Kingdom and France set the border between the British Mandate of Palestine and the French Mandate of Syria The British gave the southern Golan Heights to the French in return for the northern Jordan Valley The border was drawn again so that both sides of the Jordan river and the whole of the Sea of Galilee including a 10 meter wide strip along the northeastern shore were made a part of Palestine The 1947 UN Partition Plan put this area inside the Jewish state

During the 1948 Arab Israeli War Syria occupied the lakes northeastern shore In 1967 the State of Israel took control of the entire Sea of Galilee as well as the Golan during the Six Day War Syria still claims the northeastern shore of the sea arguing it is a part of the Golan Heights 

Israels National Water Carrier built in 1964 takes water from the lake to the population centers of Israel and is the source of most of the countrys drinking water Israel also supplies water from the lake to the West Bank and to Jordan More demand for water and some dry winters have resulted in a lower water level that is sometimes dangerous

Today tourism is again very important in the area The entire Sea of Galilee is a popular holiday resort area The many historical and spiritual sites around the lake especially its main town Tiberias are visited by millions of local and foreign tourists every year Other economic activities include fishing in the lake and agriculture particularly bananas in the fertile belt of land surrounding it

A key attraction is the site where the Kinnerets water flows into the Jordan River Thousands of pilgrims from all over the world come to bebaptized there every year

Seppuku is a Japanese ritual when a Samurai cuts his belly It was considered that seppuku was an honorable way to die Seppuku is also referred to as hara kiri which is translated from Japanese as belly cutting The Japanese considered though that this name was offensive for such an honorable cause

Seppuku was a key part of bushido the code of the samurai warriors it was used by warriors so that they would not fall into enemy hands and be ashamed It was possible also that a samurai received an order from his master to commit seppuku Since seppuku was an honorable act a warrior was allowed in some cases to commit it rather than to be executed so that he could protect his honor It was not expected that warriors who were not considered samurai to commit seppuku Samurai women had to ask for permission to commit seppuku This act could be performed either with a ritual or quietly on the battlefield while other warriors fight the enemy The main weapon used to commit seppuku was the samurais knife called tant or the short sword called wakizashi A samurai who wants to commit seppuku would take the weapon he chose he would open his kimono stab the blade into his belly and then he would make a deep cut from left to right An assistant of the warrior committing seppuku would finally decapitate the warrior

A sow bug or woodlouse is a small land arthropod They are often confused with centipedes millipedes or insects but are actually crustaceans They have fourteen legs and breathe through gills Because of the gills woodlice need water in the air around them They mostly eat dead plants and are considered helpful because they act as garbage collectors Some species can roll up into a ball when in danger In such position their hard shell faces out protecting the softer parts of the body

Sow bugs do not look like shrimps or crabs although they are closely related

Lady beetles are the Coccinellidae a family of beetles All species are protected by noxious fluids based on cyanide and most have warning colouration such as red with black spots

They are often called lady bugs or ladybirds but biologists prefer the term lady beetle

Coccinellids are found worldwide with over 5000 species Most species are carnivorous feeding mainly on the true bugs the Hemiptera Their favourite food is pests such as aphids or scale insects Their larvae are also voracious eaters of greenfly

Harmonia axyridis was introduced into North America from Asia in 1988 to control aphids but is now the most common species as it is out competing many of the native species It has since spread to much of western Europe reaching the UK in 2004

Coccinellids are often brightly coloured to warn potential predators This phenomenon is called aposematism and works because predators learn by experience to associate certain prey phenotypes with a bad taste

Mechanical stimulation causes reflex bleeding in both larval and adult ladybird beetles in which a toxin is put through the joints of the exoskeleton deterring feeding This method works well birds and cats seldom try twice

Most people know lady beetles as small round red beetles with black spots on their backs 

Not all lady beetles are red and not all red lady beetles have spots Some lady beetles are very little and are black and hairy Lady beetles vary in color as red orange or yellow with black spots They can also be black with red spots Some are missing spots altogether There are even a few kinds of ladybeetles with metallic blue iridescence and some have checkerboard markings or stripes

Most of the black part of the ladybeetle is the thorax also called the pronotum It sometimes has spots on it and sometimes it is all black

Most coccinellids overwinter as adults In Harmonia axyridis eggs hatch in 34 days from clutches numbering from a few to several dozen Depending on resource availability the larvae pass through four instars over 1014 days after which pupation occurs After several days the adults become reproductively active and are able to reproduce again though not late in the season Total life span is 12 years on average

It only takes about four weeks for the ladybeetle to transform from a tiny egg to an adult Some females can lay up to 1000 eggs in one summer The ladybeetle may lay her eggs near an aphid colony or on plants where the larvae will have a ready supply of food when they hatch

Almost all lady beetles are insectivores which means they eat other insects Many of these insects have soft bodies such as aphids Even baby lady beetles eat other insects Aphids are a huge problem for farmers and gardeners and therefore a ladybug is a very good help to the farmers Some species of ants herd aphids like sheep and will attack a ladybeetle that tries to eat one of their aphids

The causes of many stillbirths are unknown even when autopsies are done on the baby Some possible causes include

The number of stillbirths in the United States is about 1 in 115 births which is about 26000 a year or one every 20 minutes In developing countries where medical care is not as advanced or good the number of stillbirths is higher 

In Australia England Wales and Northern Ireland the rate is about 1 in 200 babies

In Australia any stillborn fetus that weighs more than 400 grams and lived in the mother for more than 20 weeks must be registered

The United States does not have a formal definition of stillborn babies All pregnancies are legally called either live birth fetal death or induced termination of pregnancy The law does not have a difference between a stillbirth and a miscarriage However it is recommended to register infants who weighed over 350 grams or who lived over 19 weeks inside the mother before dying

Art films are a type of movie that is very different from the popular Hollywood blockbuster movies Art films have many other names Some people call them art movies independent films indie films arthouse films auteur films or experimental films 

Art films are usually made by smaller movie companies These companies do not have much money compared to the large movie studios for example Paramount Pictures or Walt Disney Pictures Art films usually have different plots than blockbuster movies They usually tell more creative or unusual stories than blockbuster movies 

Art films often show controversial or sad stories These types of movies may have sad endings They are sometimes hard to understand because the movie may be about peoples feelings thoughts or dreams 

For these reasons art films are not shown in many cinemas or theaters This means that art films do not have large audiences and do not make a lot of money They are generally promoted by people who see the movie and then tell their friends to go see it

The opposite of an art film is a popular blockbuster movie Blockbuster movies have famous actors and large budgets They are made so that millions of people will pay money to see the movie 

To understand why movie directors make art movies one has to know about blockbuster movies Blockbuster movies are part of the reason why people make art films Movie directors making art films try to make them very different from blockbuster movies The movie is a more personal statement by the director Blockbusters are made for commercial reasons and art films are made for personal reasons

Blockbuster movies often have very large budgets This money is used to pay large salaries for the actors It pays for special effects and for advertisements Art movies have small budgets They usually have unknown or little known actors Some even use amateur actors Some art films will even use regular people with no experience as actors to work as the actors It is not uncommon for Art film directors to use friends and family members as actors 

Blockbusters often use simple stories and characters that have been used before in other movies Art movies usually use strange or unusual stories and characters that the audience may not have seen before

In blockbuster movies there is usually a happy ending All of the problems in the story are figured out or fixed by the end of the movie In art movies there is often a sad ending They can also have endings which are either hard to understand or could mean many different things These endings are used so that the audience will have to think about what might have happened in the story 

Blockbuster movies have a large amount of television advertising billboards and internet sites Art films often have little or no advertising

Blockbuster movies are very popular This causes more movies to be made using the same story and characters For example the James Bond movies all tell stories about the British spy named James Bond The Star Wars science fiction movies all tell stories about spaceships and outer space wars Art films are very rarely made into franchises with sequels This is because directors of art films are often trying to create a new movie with new ideas for each movie they make Some art films do have sequels This will most often happen when the movie was very well liked and the director wanted to tell more stories using some of the same characters 

Rarely an art film can be so well liked that a franchise is created because of it The View Askew universe is an example of this Kevin Smith wrote and directed the movie Clerks He produced the movie himself with a friend Scott Mosier They named their production company View Askew Productions This movie was an art film It had a small budget dealt with personal issues and its actors were mainly Smiths friends and family Smith even played one of the characters himself The movie was very popular and sold well when it was released on DVD Universal Pictures a large Hollywood studio asked him to make a movie for them He used two of his characters from Clerks Jay and Silent Bob as part of the new movie He later used Jay played by Jason Mewes and Silent Bob is three other movies he wrote Dogma Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back and Clerks 2 a sequel to Clerks 

David Bordwell is a professor from the United States He studies movies at a university He thought of a way of explaining what an art film is in 1979 He wrote that art films are different from regular Hollywood movies Regular Hollywood movies have a clear story and plot Art film often have much stranger stories In an art film the stories may be hard to understand As well in an art film the audience may have a hard time understanding what is going on Art movies are often about peoples feelings and thoughts Art movies are often about big questions that a person has to answer about who they are or what they should do in a situation

In Switzerland

In the US

Champagne is a sparkling wine that is named after the Champagne region a region in France with many vineyards that grow grapes and make wine Many people call all sparkling wines champagne but according to trade laws only sparkling wine from the Champagne region can be called champagne

Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin was a Russian poet novelist dramatist and writer of short stories People think he was the greatest Russian poet He started the great tradition of Russian literature Pushkin wrote in a way that no other Russian had done he used the Russian language in the way it was spoken instead of writing in a style based on old church books His influence on other Russian writers was enormous and many Russian composers set his stories and poems to music Fewer people outside Russia read Pushkins poems This is because his poetry is very hard to translate well into other languages because the words are full of special meanings in Russian culture Pushkin was killed in a duel in 1837 at the age of 37 

Pushkins father came from an old aristocratic family On his mothers side Pushkin had African ancestors His great grandfather Abram Gannibal was an Abyssinian who was living in a palace of the Turkish sultan in Istanbul The Russian ambassador bought him as a present for Peter the Great the tsar of Russia Gannibal became a favourite of Peter the Great and he was sent to Paris to study He became very rich Pushkin was proud of his great grandfather and wrote about him in a novel called The Negro of Peter the Great

In 19th century Russia all aristocratic families learned to speak French so Pushkin and his brother and sister spoke and wrote in French more than in Russian The children were cared for by a nurse Arina Rodionovna Yakovleva It was the nurse who taught them to love the Russian language She told the children Russian folktales Pushkin also spoke Russian to the peasants and he read many books in his fathers library

When he was 12 he went to a new school called the Imperial Lyceum at Tsarskoye Selo Years later this school was renamed Pushkin after their famous pupil He soon started writing romantic poems in Russian using Russian tales of heroes and adventures Ruslan and Ludmila was a poem that was later to be made into an opera by Mikhael Glinka

In 1817 Pushkin got a job in the foreign office at St Petersburg He soon became interested in politics and supported the Decembrist revolt of 1825 when a group of noblemen and army officers tried to put another tsar in power and make him less powerful Pushkin wrote some political poems The result was that he was told he had to leave St Petersburg He had to spend six years in exile in the south of the country in the Caucasus and the Crimea He wrote about his experiences in the south in several romantic narrative poems He started work on a novel in verse called Yevgeny Onegin He did not finish it until 1833 This was to be his most famous work It was used by many musicians including Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky who made it into an opera The poem shows typical Russian people in the society of his day 

Pushkin was angry that he was still in exile and he wrote many letters to his friends Many of these letters were later published He spent a lot of time drinking gaming and fighting with swords He fell in love with the daughter of a Count for whom he was working The Count managed to get Pushkin exiled to his mothers estate near Pskov at the other end of Russia Pushkin spent two years here He was lonely but he studied Russian history and talked to the peasants The poems he wrote were full of ideas from Russian culture He wrote one of his major works Boris Godunov a drama about a story from Russian history The composer Modest Mussorgsky later made an opera from it Boris Godunov was a cruel tsar in the 17th century Pushkins play shows that the ordinary people had a lot of power This made it difficult for Pushkin to get it published

After the revolt in 1825 the new tsar Nicholas I realized that Pushkin was by now very famous He also realized that he had not taken part in the revolt so he allowed him to return The tsar said that he himself would censor Pushkins works before they were allowed to be published He said that he was going to be a good tsar and help the poor people to become free Pushkin was in a difficult position because he could not write anything that the tsar would not like

He had to be very careful not to say bad things about the rulers of the country The police watched him very carefully Yet at this time Pushkin wrote a large number of great works almost each one of them being the first of their kind in Russian literature One example is the short story The Queen of Spades which Tchaikovsky made into an opera and which was to be a great influence on the novels of Fyodor Dostoevsky

In his last years Pushkin was again in government service in St Petersburg He married in 1831 and had to spend a lot of time in society at court He wrote more and more prose He wrote a history of Peter the Great and a historical novel The Captains Daughter He kept asking the tsar to let him resign from his job and go to the country to spend his time writing The tsar would not allow that In 1837 Pushkin was killed in a duel He had been forced to fight the duel in order to defend his wifes honour

The Russian language today would be very different if it had not been for Pushkin Using the language as it was spoken by the people he made it into a language which was simple but which could also express deep feelings His works were a great influence on later writers like Ivan Turgenev Ivan Goncharov and Leo Tolstoy Yevgeny Onegin was the first Russian novel which told a story about the society of the time His works have been translated into all the major languages

Exile means being sent away from the country or area where you live People are usually exiled for political reasons or sometimes because they have committed a crime They may have said bad things about the rulers in that country or tried to get into power themselves People are not exiled in democratic countries but many famous people in history have been sent into exile

Exile may mean that someone is sent out of the country but sometimes they are sent to another part of the country Sometimes people have made their own decision to leave their country as a protest against the way it was being ruled This is called self imposed exile

In the Old Testament the Jews were exiled to Babylon In Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome people were often sent into exile For several centuries Russia sent many people into exile often to labour camps in Siberia Thousands of people from Europe including many famous people went to the United States when the Nazis came to power in Germany in the 1930s

One famous person who was sent into exile was Napolon Bonaparte who was exiled from France first to Elba and then to St Helena

The cellist Pablo Casals went into self imposed exile as a protest against the government of Spain He said he would not come back until Spain was a democracy

A flagellum is a long whip like projection of a cell composed of microtubules They help propel cells and organisms in a whip like motion The flagellum of eukaryotes usually moves with an S motion and is surrounded by cell membrane

Flagella are structurally almost identical with the much smaller Cilia So much so that it has been proposed protists bearing either should be unified in the Phylum Undulipodia Previously Margulis had proposed that the Ciliates alone should be placed in a Phylum Ciliophora Admittedly the Protista is a collection of disparate single celled forms but while a more sophisticated taxonomy is in flux Protista is still a useful term

Cilia and flagella are cell organelles specialised units which carry out well defined functions like mitochondria and plastids It is fairly clear now that all or most of these organelles have their origin in once independent prokaryotes and that the eukaryote cell is a community of micro organisms working together in a marriage of convenience

Three types of flagella have so far been distinguished bacterial archaeal and eukaryotic The main differences among these three types are summarized below

Movies that use MPEG 4 standard have high quality and have take up less computer room Older standards were MPEG 1 and MPEG 2 In comparison with these older versions MPEG 4 has additional features like having a way to fix problems lots of quality and size choices good picture and many more

MPEG 4 takes into consideration special needs from computer television areas and telecommunication It is able to be besides rectangular pieces of computer information individual objects in a certain area An example could be a car driving in front of a background The background does not change Since MPEG 4 can be many rectangular images the car can be treated as another thing not being a fixed background

LSD is the shorter name for a drug called Lysergic acid diethylamide LSD is often called by the slang name acid LSD is a psychedelic drug which causes people who take it to witness illusions It also alters their thought processes

LSD is sometimes used for certain therapies Most often it is not taken as a medicine Instead it is used as an illegal drug

LSD is made in a laboratory by chemists It was invented in 1938 by a Swiss chemist named Dr Albert Hofmann at the Sandoz Laboratories in Switzerland Dr Hofmann was trying to find new drugs including one against the common cold

One day in 1943 Hofmann accidentally broken wikt linkingestingested a small amount of LSD and noticed strange light patterns in the sky as he went home He believed that what he had experienced were the effects of the drug He tried a larger amount next He ended up with a much stronger reaction to the drug than he expected Hofmann lay on a couch afraid he had made himself insane for life When a neighbor came found him in trouble and stayed to look after Hofmann he was able to calm down and even said he began to enjoy the plays of colorful shapes and patterns that occurred behind his closed eyes The next day Hofmann reported to have waken up refreshed and clear headed though somewhat physically tired He also noted that his breakfast tasted unusually delicious that morning

Sandoz began to offer LSD to doctors and broken wikt linktherapisttherapists Sandoz saw it as a help to doctors and therapists so they could get a chance to gain insight into how someone who was mentally ill might see the world It is known today that the effects of LSD are very different from those of delusional mental illnesses such as schizophrenia For their patients it was a chance to uncover hidden feelings and thoughts which could be dealt with in therapy LSD showed promise in the treatment of problems like alcoholism Some alcoholics who tried the drug found their need to drink alcohol lessened or went away They understood better why they had abused alcohol Unlike other drugs the broken wikt linkcravingcraving for alcohol was not replaced by a craving for LSD The study showed a 50 success rate compared to 10 for cold turkey methods

In the United States the Central Intelligence Agency tested the drug on subjects for different reasons The name for one of these test projects was MK ULTRA Subjects did not know they were given the drug It was used in broken wikt linkinterrogationinterrogations to see if it would make people tell the truth or remember things they had forgotten It was also used to convince people they were becoming insane or that things had happened which really had not such as an invasion from outer space or a Communist takeover of the country or that their bodies were broken wikt linktransformtransformed in some way The CIA supposedly felt it was important to learn how ordinary citizens might react to such things if they happened The drug sometimes made the scenarios more believable The effects of these experiments were often harmful to the subjects even years later because of the intense anxiety or fear caused when someone unknowingly takes a drug like LSD

LSD first became popular in the 1960s A Harvard psychology professor called Dr Timothy Leary began to encourage people to try the drug then College students willingly took part in LSD experiments These experiments were made by psychologists and other professionals Leary and two of the people he worked with Richard Alpert and Ralph Metzner thought the transforming effects of the drug could be a kind of broken wikt linkrebirthrebirth of users in the same way as many religions offered them They wrote a book The Psychedelic Experience which was based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead Leary eventually became well known in the 1960s hippie movement for his broken wikt linksloganslogan about LSD Turn on tune in drop out The Hippies were a countercultural movement A number of famous rock bands including the Beatles and the Grateful Dead became known for their use of LSD and even a new type of rock music called acid rock was born from the fad

LSD quickly became a popular drug outside of the medical profession Many people began using or giving LSD out casually Acid parties and acid tests became a social broken wikt linkfadfad The drug would sometimes be slipped to persons unknowingly often through spiked punch or drinks Some problems developed as some casual users began to experience broken wikt linkside effectside effects such as flashbacks and psychotic symptoms though both of these are rare Sometimes signs of depression and broken wikt linkinstabilityinstability were seen Due to the spread of LSD use outside of the medical community the United States government banned LSD in 1967 Other countries soon followed

The most common danger of taking LSD is having a bad experience which is called a bad trip During a bad trip people may feel very scared and worried and they may have very sad thoughts A bad trip can lead to lasting bad memories and even mental harm Users who get out of control or who try to harm themselves should be taken for medical help

Many illegal drugs such as heroin and cocaine are very addictive This means that people who start taking the drug will want to keep taking it even if it is damaging their physical and mental health LSD is not addictive to the body or to the mind

Another danger from using LSD is that it makes a person impaired When people are impaired they may have accidents or do things that they would not normally do In some rare cases people taking LSD develop a psychosis

Frequent or regular use of LSD can result in broken wikt linkflashbackflashbacks In a flashback the person feels the drug beginning to affect him or her again even though he or she has not taken a dose that day This can be brought on by stress Note that over 75 of LSD users claimed never to have flashed back

It has been said that some people who use LSD can end up with damage to their chromosomes but this is a myth based on one wrong report that was disproved soon after it was published

LSD is illegal in the United States Australia the United Kingdom and most of Europe Some countries enforce the laws against LSD very harshly Other countries do not enforce the law very much LSD has been manufactured illegally since the 1960s

Fritjof Capra is an Austrian born American physicist

Born in Vienna Austria Capra earned a PhD in theoretical physics from the University of Vienna in 1966 He has done research on particle physics and systems theory and has written popular books on the implications of science with ethycs metaphysics and society In particular in The Tao of Physics he makes the assertion that physics and metaphysics are both inexorably leading to the same knowledge His works all share a similar subtext that there are hidden connections between everything Capra is both a Buddhist and a Catholic Christian 

After touring Germany in the early 1980s Capra co wrote a book on Green Politics with ecofeminist author Charlene Spretnak called Green Politics in 1984

Capra pushes for western society to abandon conventional linear thought and the mechanistic views of Descartes Critiquing Descartes reductionistic view that everything can be studied in parts to understand the whole he allows his readers to take an objective and fresh mind encouraging them to see the world through complexity theory

Capra is purportedly setting the grounds for change in many new theories one of which is the theory of living systems a theoretical framework for ecology This theory is only now fully emerging but it has its roots in several scientific fields that were developed during the first half of the twentieth century organismic biology gestalt psychology ecology general systems theory and cybernetics

Ethelred II was also known as Ethelred the Unready He was King of England twice The first time was from 978 to 1013 and the second time was 1014 to 1016 He was the son of Edgar and Aelfthryth For most of his reign he had to fight off Viking invaders 

The word unready in his name means badly advised When he asked for ideas about how to do things he was told the wrong thing Because he was only ten he did not know what was the best way of doing things

The Elizabethan Religious Settlement was Elizabeth Is answer to the religious quarrels that developed during the reigns of Henry VIII Edward VI and Mary I 

This answer was given in two Acts of the Parliament of England The Act of Supremacy of 1559 confirmed the English churchs independence from Rome The Act of Uniformity 1559 decided about the form of the English church

Often it was seen as the end of the English Reformation and the foundation of Anglicanism But some historians think that England did not become a Protestant nation on a popular level for a long time since then There seem to have been great divisions in the population and among the clergy for a long time afterwards 

Geckos are small to middle size lizards Lizards are reptiles There are 1196 different kinds of geckos They live in many warm countries Some kinds of geckos to go into peoples houses People are often happy to have them because geckos eat many insects

Unlike most lizards geckos have voices A gecko sounds a little like a bird or a frog In some languages these lizards have names that sound like their calls for example both English and Indonesian call one kind gecko and tokay Another kind of gecko with a different sound is called chicak

Geckos have no eyelids Instead they have a clear membrane over their eyes They lick the membrane clean with their tongues Like most lizards they can regenerate their tail if they need to

Many kinds of geckos can walk on walls windows and ceilings They can do this because they have special toe pads A microscope can show that each toe pad is made of thousands of hair like structures Each of these structures branches into many smaller ends

Rutherfordium is a chemical element It has also been named eka hafnium and unnilquadium It has the symbol Rf It has the atomic number 104 It is a very radioactive element that does not exist in nature It has to be made Rutherfordium is the first transactinide element The isotope that has the longest half life is 265Rf Rutherfordium 265 only has a half life of about 13 hours

The amount of rutherfordium that has been made is not enough to give much information about it The element has no present uses It is thought that the chemistry of rutherfordium will be like the chemistry of hafnium

Rutherfordium was named after Ernest Rutherford It was reported that it was first made in 1964 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research at Dubna Russia The scientists reported that they bombarded a different chemical element 242Pu with the element 22Ne The neon 22 particles were accelerated to an energy of 113 to 115 MeV They claim they detected nuclear fission tracks in a special type of glass with a microscope showing that a new element was there

In 1969 scientists at the University of California Berkeley made rutherfordium by banging together 249Cf and 12C at very high energies These scientists said that when they tried to make rutherfordium in the same way as the scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research none of the element was produced

The scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research claimed that it was first detected in Dubna They thought it should be named dubnium or kurchatovium for Igor Vasilevich Kurchatov

The scientists at the University of California Berkeley thought it should be named rutherfordium

The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry decide the name of elements that should be used by everyone They used unnilquadium as a temporary name Unnilquadium is the systematic element name In 1997 they resolved the dispute and used the current name of rutherfordium The chemical element with atomic number 105 was named dubnium

A lizard is a kind of reptile They are the Suborder Lacertilia also called Sauria Alternatively they and the snakes are the Order Squamata 

There are about 3800 species which live all over the world except in cold climates One type the marine iguana lives in the sea Size varies greatly ranging from 5 inches to the Komodo dragons 9 feet and 150 pounds 

Some kinds of lizard are

Suborder Lacertilia 

In the traditional taxonomy the Order Squamata is divided as follows

A modern view is that the snakes and lizards are all infraorders of the Squamata p238

There are other versions and the taxonomy will probably not settle until more molecular evidence is collected

The skull structure of both snakes and lizards is distinctive They can move their upper jaw relative to the braincase They bear horny scales and many use venom for attack and deefence

The Squamates are definitely a monophyletic group they are a sister group to the Tuatara Judged by their fossil record the Squamates were present in the Mesozoic but occupied a minor place in the land ecology Three of the six lines are recorded first in the Upper Jurassic the others in the Cretaceous Probably all arose earlier in the Jurassic The Mosasaurs of the Upper Cretaceous were by far the most successful of all the lizards becoming the top predator in their ecosystem

Sight is very important for most lizards both for locating prey and for communication Many lizards have highly acute color vision Most lizards rely heavily on body language using specific postures gestures and movements to define territory resolve disputes and entice mates Some species of lizard also utilize bright colors such as the iridescent patches on the belly of Sceloporus These colors would be highly visible to predators so are often hidden on the underside or between scales and only revealed when necessary

The dewlap is a brightly colored patch of skin on the throat usually hidden between scales When a display is needed the lizards erect the hyoid bone of their throat resulting in a large vertical flap of brightly colored skin beneath the head which can be then used for communication

Learning music by ear is learning to play a piece of music by listening to other people playing it and then trying to play it oneself In some musical traditions there is no written music and everybody plays by ear all the time Folk music is traditionally learned by listening to other musicians and copying them This is how music is passed from one generation to another

Most people in the Western musical tradition learn pieces and songs by reading music but it is good to try to play music by ear sometimes It can be a very useful skill

The Suzuki method of learning instruments started in Japan but is now used in many countries It teaches young children to play an instrument by ear

There are several different levels of ability in the Minor Leagues these levels are 

Once a player has shown he is good enough to play in one level of the minor leagues he is usually moved up to a higher more difficult level until he is finally able to play in the Major Leagues This way players are able to get better at baseball before having to play against tougher opponents Almost all players in the Major Leagues had to play in the minor leagues first in order to become good enough to play in the Major Leagues

Sometimes Major League players who are have been hurt will play a few games in the minor leagues before playing in the Major Leagues again in order to see if they feel good enough to start playing again

Statistical surveys are collections of information about items in a population 

Surveys can be grouped into numerical and categorical types A numerical survey is to get numbers as replies For example How many minutes on average do you spend eating breakfast

 What is your favorite color 

The categories for this would be yellow green purple etc which are not numbers

Surveys of human populations and institutions are common in political polling and government health social science and marketing research A survey may concentrate on opinions or factual information depending on its purpose

The social sciences are a group of academic disciplines that study human aspects of the world Social Sciences includes anthropology archaeology economics geography political science psychology and sociology They are different from the arts and humanities as for them scientific method is important Most of the social sciences require doing a lot of research such as making surveys Such research is called social research Some subjects such as history are sometimes social sciences and sometimes humanties 

The term social sciences has been used for over 200 years and mostly originates from a thinker named Auguste Comte Many of the fields of social science have come about since then In America much of the thought and practice of social science came from the University of Chicago and other universities

The arts are a large part of culture and the word means much more than art  

The arts means visual arts and performing arts 

Sometimes in universities it is shorthand for a wider group of subjects which are properly called the humanities These include philosophy theology literature languages and history as well 

The arts are usually contrasted with The sciences 

ImageNuclear weapon programs worldwide 2pngthumb300pxWorld map with nuclear weapons development status represented by color

Nuclear proliferation is when a country starts making nuclear objects On the right is a map showing who has nuclear reactors and weapons and who could have them When a country starts making nuclear weapons they become a nuclear power

Dual use technology means to the possibility of military use of civilian nuclear technology for generating electricity Many technologies and materials associated with the creation of a nuclear electricity program have a dual use capability These items can be used to make nuclear weapons if a country chooses to do so When this happens a nuclear electricity program can lead to making atomic bombs The crisis over Irans nuclear activities is an example

A Chief Executive Officer or Chief Executive is the highest ranking corporate officer administrator corporate administrator executive or executive officer in charge of total management of a corporation company organization or agency 

In closely held corporations it is general business culture that the office of Chief Executive Officer CEO is also the chairman of the board Specifically one person often shares the chairman and CEO titles while another person takes the presidency or may become chief operating officer However the term president is from the US and in the UK COO is favored Underneath that comes the Executive Vice President or Executive Director In publicly held corporations the CEO and chairman positions can be separated but there are implications in corporate governance by doing so

In some European Union countries there are two separate boards one executive board for the day to day business and one supervisory board for control purposes In these countries the chief executive officer presides over the executive board and the chairman presides over the supervisory board and these two roles will always be held by different people This ensures a distinction between management by the executive board and governance by the supervisory board This allows for clear lines of authority The aim is to prevent a conflict of interest and too much power being concentrated in the hands of one person There is a strong parallel here with the structure of governments which tend to separate the political cabinet from the management civil service

In rare circumstances an Executive Chairperson can be appointed but this is either illegal in many jurisdictions or frowned upon by Regulators

In the United Kingdom many Charities and Government Agencies are headed by a Chief Executive who is answerable to a Board of Trustees or Board of Directors In the UK the Chairman in public companies is more senior than the Chief Executive Most public companies now split the role of Chairman and Chief Executive

Typically a CEO has a cadre of subordinate executives each of which has specific functional responsibilities These direct reporting relationships most often include Chief Financial Officer Chief Operating Officer Chief Marketing Officer and Chief Information Officer Although not an Executive the Director of Human Resources plays a vital role within any corporation

However depending on the industry in which the company operates andor the organizational structure the company has employed various other functional areas may be highlighted through the CEOs direct span of control Some of these less common monikers include Chief Development Officer Chief Knowledge OfficerChief Learning Officer Chief Strategy Officer Chief Risk Officer and Chief Credit Officer

According to Don Schmincke to be a strong executive one cannot act in business differently from how he acts in family life or society Meaning being a successful executive requires a mans conduct to be correct in all points his actions must follow his words at all times

Amateur radio is a hobby for people who like to talk using radio transmitters Many people enjoy using amateur radio to talk to other amateur radio hobbyists in other countries Amateur radio hobbyists also use their radio transmitters to get help in emergencies Amateur radio is often called Ham Radio Many people use their amateur radios for fun People who use Amateur radio are often called amateur radio operators hams or amateurs

During a disaster or emergency Amateur radio can be used to get help When telephones do not work it may be the only way to communicate with people Amateur radio hobbyists also use their radio transmitters to get help in emergencies Some amateur radio hobbyists volunteer to listen to the emergency band frequencies in case there are distress calls If the volunteers hear a distress call they notify the appropriate authorities

People must have a license to use Amateur radio In most countries users must pass a test to get a license In some countries there is more than one license grade In some countries people can use Amateur radio if they have a license from their home country

There are many clubs for Amateur radio in many countries These clubs do many things as a group and help people get their Amateur radio license

Amateur radio operators talk to each other in many ways Some people talk with their voice others use computers television or Morse code They use many ways to get their signals to others They can bounce their signals off the sky the moon or a satellite Amateur radio operators have many ways to talk using the radio Amateur radio satellites are called OSCARs  Orbital Satellites Carrying Amateur Radio Hams can also talk to astronauts and cosmonauts aboard the International Space Station

There are many ways to have fun with amateur radio There are many games and contests Amateur radio operators try to talk with as many others as possible They then mail each other postcards called QSL cards to confirm the contact Contesters may try to see how far they can talk or to how many different people they can talk

Some hide a transmitter which sends out a signal and others try to find it using receivers This is called Radio direction finding fox hunting or Radio sport Sometimes the event is done with cars or as a foot race

Amateur radio is practised by over 15000 licensed users in India The first amateur radio operator was licensed in 1921 By the mid 1930s there were around 20 amateur radio operators in India Amateur radio operators have played an important part in the Indian independence movement with the setting up of pro independence radio stations in the 1940s

The humanities include languages literature music philosophy history media the classics religion and the visual and performing arts Additional subjects sometimes included in the humanities are anthropology area studies communications and cultural studies although these are often regarded as social sciences It was popular in the Renaissance ages

The arts are usually considered as part of the humanities These include visual arts such as painting and sculpture as well as performing arts such as theatre and dance and literature Other humanities such as language are sometimes considered to be part of the arts for example as the language arts

The humanities study the human condition and mostly use methods that are analytic critical or speculative and not as empirical as natural and social sciences

The Coconut palm is a type of palm tree It is a part of the Family Arecaceae It is a large palm growing to 30 m tall It has leaves that are 46 m long The term coconut refers to the fruit of the coconut palm

A coconut is a large nut Coconuts grow in tropical countries The flesh of a coconut is white and can be eaten raw or used in cooking It is used in many of the foods we eat for flavour and are native in tropical areas Especially in India 

There are many coconut palms in the coastal belt of India and Bangladesh People of this area use coconut milk in cooking Women use coconut oil as hair oil for hair The Coconuts shell is relatively hard but can be broken Because its shell is hard it can be used as an ingredient to make craftworks 

Shawarma is a meat sandwich eaten by people in the Middle East It is served in round Arabic bread with meat and vegetables with some spice or sauce of choice in it Normally the meat can either be lamb beef turkey or chicken Shawarma can also be spelled chawarma shwarma shawerma or shoarmais

It was first introduced by people from Turkey They call it evirme which means turning because the meat can be turned around in the oven

Merchants deal with trade That means they deal goods that they do not produce themselves in order to get profit

Merchants can be into two types

In the US merchant is any person while engaged in a business or profession or a seller who deals regularly in the type of goods sold Under the common law in the United States merchants are held to a higher standard in the selling of products than those who are not engaged in the sale of goods as a profession For example when a merchant sells something he or she is expected to give a warranty guaranteeing that the product is fit to be sold even if there is nothing in writing to this effect 

In commercial and consumer transactions a warranty is an obligation that an article or service that is sold has the quality the buyer can reasonably expect from the seller

That often means that there must be a remedy That means repair or replacement if the article or service is not as good as the warranty says It is a breach of the warranty when the promise is broken ie a product is defective or not as good as should be expected by a reasonable buyer

In business and legal transactions a warranty is an assurance by one party to the other party that certain facts or conditions are true or will happen The other party is allowed to rely on that assurance and seek some type of remedy if it is not true or followed

A warranty may be express or implied

An express warranty is typically a guarantee from the seller of a product that specifies the extent to which the quality or performance of the product is assured and states the conditions under which the product can be returned replaced or repaired 

An implied warranty is one that arises from the nature of the transaction and the understanding by the buyer To be merchantable the goods must reasonably conform to an ordinary buyers expectations ie they are what they say they are For example a fruit that looks and smells good but has hidden defects would violate the implied warranty of merchantability if its quality does not meet the standards for such fruit as passes ordinarily in the trade 

A warranty is violated when the promise is broken when goods are not as should be expected at the time the sale occurs whether or not the defect is apparent Most warranties exclude parts that normally wear out and supplies that must be periodically replaced as they are normally used up 

Many people do not realize that extended warranties are not always provided through the manufacturer but in some circumstances it may work to the consumers benefit For instance when an auto warranty is provided through a dealership from the manufacturer repairs on the vehicle are reimbursed at a lower negotiated rate

In the United States the rights and remedies of buyers and sellers of goods are governed by the Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code as it has been adopted with variations from state to state 

A car warranty is at least one year Three years is more common Five years is an extended warranty

A home warranty protects against the high costs of home and appliance repair by offering insurance coverage for appliances and equipment in the house

Giuseppe Verdi was an Italian composer of operas Verdi and Richard Wagner were the greatest composers of opera in the 19th century although they were completely different from one another When Verdi was a young man the most famous opera composers in Italy were Gaetano Donizetti and Vincenzo Bellini who wrote in the bel canto tradition This meant that their operas had beautiful tunes which were written for singers to show off their voices even if what they sang did not suit the story During his long life Verdi changed opera so that it did not have to obey old fashioned rules He made the drama the most important thing and the music is there to help the drama

The small village where Verdi was born lies in the valley of the river Po in the north of Italy It was a poor district His father was an innkeeper who had a small farm The young boy must have been very talented He was given a spinet which he kept all his life At the age of 9 he often played the organ for church services in the village when the organist was away

A few years later he composed music for the amateur orchestra in Busseto A man called Antonio Barezzi knew many important people and he helped Verdi a lot Later Verdi married his daughter Barezzi sent him to Milan so that he could study but Verdi had not been taught the piano properly and he did not get a place in the music conservatory He had some private lessons and learned a lot about opera as well as about literature and politics In 1839 he composed an opera Oberto conte di San Bonifacio which was performed in La Scala the world famous opera house in Milan It is not one of his greatest operas but it helped him to become well known and he was asked to write three more operas for La Scala When his next opera was produced it was not a success the audience did not like it and they hissed and booed There was also tragedy in his personal life at this time his two children and his wife all died

Verdi managed to overcome his unhappiness in 1842 when he produced his opera Nabucco This was a great success and made him world famous He started to work very hard composing two operas a year He not only had to write the music but organize all the people to perform it It was a huge workload His opera Ernani was one of the best from this period In 1847 he had another big success with Macbeth This opera based on Shakespeares famous play is still one of the best loved of all operas He was becoming more amazing

For centuries Italy had been a collection of several countries each with their own ruler In the 1850s there was a lot of political unrest in the country Verdi often wrote music for large choruses in his operas The words of these choruses were often about fighting for freedom and it was often thought that the songs were encouraging people to revolt The song Va pensiero from his opera Nabucco was about the Hebrew slaves who were captive in Babylon People chanted it in the streets with the words suitably changed Verdi became a great national hero Italy eventually became one country in 1861

Giuseppina Strepponi was the soprano who sang the part of Abigaille in Nabucco Verdi fell in love with her She had lived with another man and had three children so she felt that she was not good enough for Verdi They eventually married in 1859 She was a great support to him until her death in 1897 although Verdi was not an easy husband to live with He moved back to Busseto with her He continued to travel a lot but did not let his wife come with him leaving her behind in Busseto where she was not happy because many people there did not like her

Three more famous operas were written at this time Rigoletto in 1851 and Il trovatore and La traviata both in 1853 These operas have many tunes which became famous They are full of exciting drama in which the characters are very skilfully described by the music The music is not divided so clearly into recitative and aria like it had been for two centuries Instead the music is developing all the time the arias run straight into the following music He had a brilliant sense of drama but he often had to fight hard to stop producers making changes to what he had written

Verdi often had trouble with the censors His opera Rigoletto was based on a story called Le roi samuse by Victor Hugo The attempted murder of a king was not thought to be a suitable subject Verdi had to change the king into a duke in his story and make some other changes before the opera could be performed The story of his opera Traviata based on a novel by Alexandre Dumas fils was also thought to be immoral At the first performance the audience laughed because the heroine who is supposed to be dying of consumption was very fat However the opera soon became enormously popular

Verdi had become very famous by now and was asked to compose for the Opra in Paris He had to write operas in the French style operas with five acts and a ballet based on a serious story None of the operas he wrote at this time for Paris belong to his best works He was more inspired when writing for the Italian theatres Simon Boccanegra has a very complicated plot but the characters are described beautifully by the music Un ballo in maschera was about the murder of King Gustav III of Sweden Again the censors did not like it and he had to change the story to a setting in Boston which rather spoiled the story In the 1860s his best works were La Forza del Destino written for St Petersburg Don Carlos written for the Paris Opra and Aida for the new opera house in Cairo in Egypt Aida is considered one of his most perfect works The first performance was not without difficulties Verdi was having a long argument with the conductor Mariani who refused to go to Cairo to conduct it The argument was made worse by the newspapers who accused Verdi of taking Marianis girlfriend This caused a great scandal

Verdi retired in the 1870s He was a rich man who owned a lot of land He gave a lot of money to charities particularly to one charity for elderly musicians Even in retirement he was persuaded by his publishers to write two more operas He became fascinated by Shakespeare and he wrote Otello to a libretto by Arrigo Boito This was a brilliant libretto and it helped him to write a great masterpiece in which every little detail of the story is beautifully described by the music His very last opera Falstaff is based on Shakespeares Merry Wives of Windsor Verdi continued to write a few religious pieces in his old age He died in 1901

A blue box is a device that someone could use to make free telephone calls It worked by playing back the same sounds that the telephone company employees used to program their equipment

The most famous person to use a blue box was John Draper who went by the name Captain Crunch Draper taught Steve Wozniak how to build them Wozniak and Steve Jobs sold blue boxes to fellow students at the University of California Berkeley One time Wozniak used a blue box to call the Pope

A red box is a device that people can use illegally to make free telephone calls at a pay telephone It works by playing back the same sounds that the payphone sends to the phone company when coins are put into it

Silicon Graphics Inc is a company that makes high end computers The company was founded by Jim Clark and Abbey Silverstone in 1982 to make graphics display terminals SGI was famous for making very good computers for 3D animation working on video and pictures They invented many things that other companies still use today

Constituent may mean

A constituency is any cohesive corporate unit or body bound by shared structures goals or loyalty

In the United Kingdom a parliamentary constituency is sometimes called a Parliamentary seat or a Division Constituencies for local government elections are called either Wards or electoral divisions

As of 2005 there are 646 House of Commons constituencies in the UK

Northern Ireland has 18 constituencies each of which elect six MLAs to the Northern Ireland Assembly under the Single Transferable Vote system

The Scottish Parliament has 73 single member constituencies elected on a first past the post basis with the remaining 56 seats in the parliament being selected by the Additional Member System Since the passage of the Scottish Parliament Act 2004 the constituencies of the Scottish Parliament are no longer identical to those of the House of Commons

The National Assembly for Wales has 40 constituencies elected by first past the post which are identical to the Welsh constituencies of the House of Commons Its remaining 20 seats are selected by AMS

The London Assembly has 14 constituencies elected by first past the post described in the article on London Assembly constituencies Its remaining 11 seats are also selected by AMS

Cohesion may mean

Local governments are administrative offices that are smaller than a state or province The term is used to contrast with offices at nation state level which are referred to as the central government national government or federal government

What a local government does changes depending on what country it is in and even when they are similar what it is called often varies Common names for local governments include state province region department county prefecture district city township town borough parish municipality shire and village However all these names are often used informally in countries where they do not describe a legal local government

This is a list of the 646 constituencies currently represented in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom Parliament as at the United Kingdom 2005 general election Each constituency is represented by a single Member of Parliament

A stain is a spot that has another color than the material on which it is found It can be occur without intention in the case of domestic stains on fabric cloth or other material or it can be intentional Stains are used intentionally in a variety of fields including research technology and art

Different types of material can be stained by different substances and stain resistance is an important characteristic in modern textile engineering Various laundry techniques exist to attempt to remove or minimize existing stains and stain removers are an important type of chemical in laundry detergents Some stand alone stain removers also exist

Stainless steel also known as inox steel is a steel alloy with a minimum of 105 or 11 chromium content by mass 

Stainless steel does not stain corrode or rust as easily as ordinary steel but it is not stain proof

The term corrosion resistant steel is used when the alloy has less than the 12 minimum of chromium for example in the aviation industry There are different grades and surface finishes of stainless steel depending on where it will used Stainless steels have a higher resistance to oxidation and corrosion in many natural and man made environments however it is important to select the correct type of stainless steel for the use There are over 150 grades of stainless steel of which fifteen are the most used 

The idea behind stainless steel was discovered in the first part of the 19th century but it took about 80 years to develop a reliable industrial method French British and American inventors worked on this until a genuine stainless steel was produced A common use of stainless steel is cutlery Stainless steel cutlery from Sheffield Yorkshire was a big industry in the mid 20th century

Ferrous is an adjective coming from the Latin ferrum One uses this word to indicate the presence of iron mostly in metallurgy or related industries There are also non ferrous metals which are metals that have no iron in them at all

Ferrous can also refer to iron in its 2 oxidation state

Ferrous is also the name of a song by Peter Gabriel

Carbon steel also called plain carbon steel is a metal alloy a combination of two elements iron and carbon where other elements are present in quantities too small to affect the properties The only other alloying elements allowed in plain carbon steel are manganese silicon and copper Steel with a low carbon content has the same properties as iron soft but easily formed As carbon content rises the metal becomes harder and stronger but less ductile and more difficult to weld Higher carbon content lowers steels melting point and its temperature resistance in general 

Typical compositions of carbon are

Steel can be heat treated which allows parts to be fabricated in an easily formable soft state If enough carbon is present the alloy can be hardened to increase strength wear and impact resistance Steels are often wrought by cold working methods which is the shaping of metal through deformation at a low equilibrium or metastable temperature

Mild steel is the most common form of steel as its price is relatively low while it provides material properties that are acceptable for many applications Mild steel has a low carbon content and is therefore neither extremely brittle nor ductile It becomes malleable when heated and so can be forged It is also often used where large amounts of steel need to be formed for example as structural steel Density of this metal is 7861093 kgm and the tensile strength is a maximum of 500 MPa

Carbon steels which can successfully undergo heat treatment have a carbon content in the range of 030 to 170 by weight Trace impurities of various other elements can have a significant effect on the quality of the resulting steel Trace amounts of sulfur in particular make the steel red short Low alloy carbon steel such as A36 grade contains about 005 sulfur and melts around 14261538 C Manganese is often added to improve the hardenability of low carbon steels These additions turn the material into a low alloy steel by some definitions but AISIs definition of carbon steel allows up to 165 manganese by weight

Hardened steel usually refers to quenched or quenched and tempered steel Silver Steel or high carbon bright steel gets its name from its appearance due to the high carbon content It is a very high carbon steel or can be thought of as some of the best high carbon steel It is defined under the steel specification standards BS 1407 It is a 1 carbon tool steel which can be ground to close tolerances Usually the range of carbon is minimum 110 but as high as 120 It also contains trace elements of 035 Mn 040 Cr 030 Si and also sometimes sulfur and phosphorus Silver steel is sometimes used for making straight razors due to its ability to produce and hold a micro fine edge

The purpose of heat treating plain carbon steel is to change the mechanical properties of steel usually ductility hardness yield strength and impact resistance

Yellowcake is a type of uranium powder Yellowcake is made from rocks and minerals with uranium inside like uraninite after they are changed in a factory Yellowcake can be made into fuel for nuclear reactors or it can be used in making atomic bombs

Ductility is the physical property of a material where it is capable of sustaining large permanent changes in shape without breaking An example is when a piece of metal is drawn into a wire It is characterized by the internal structure of the material flowing under shear stress

Ductility is the amount that any material yields under shear stress Gold copper aluminium and steel have high ductility

MI could mean

Defibrillation is the act of defibrillating the heart to try treat ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia Defibrillation works by delivering a controlled electric current to the heart which depolarises a critical mass of the heart muscle which stops the arrhythmia and allows a coordinated heart rhythm to return Defibrillation may be administered outside the body with the use of an external defibrillator or an automated external defibrillator or inside the body with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator

The first use of the technique on a human was in 1947 by Claude Beck a professor of surgery at Case Western Reserve University The patient was a 14 year old boy named Mickey

A defibrillator is a machine that can help when ventricular fibrillation happens in the heart of a human 

Fibrillation happens when many different cells in the heart begin to act as pacemaker cells This means that many thousands of cells tell the heart to beat all at different times and with no rhythm This confusion causes the heart to become unable to move blood around the body This causes death 

A defibrillator sends an high energy pulse from the top right of the heart to the bottom middle of the heart This causes the whole heart to stop all activity The hearts normal pacemaker then can try and restart normal beating Defibrillation does not always work

Implantable cardioverter defibrillators are defibrillators that are designed to help patients from inside their body They are put inside people that are at high risk of going into cardiac arrest and monitor a persons heart rate rhythm and waveform By comparing the activity in the different chambers of the heart an icd can detect cardiac arrhythmias and treat them quickly

External defibrillators are often used in hospitals and ambulances They are now also being used outside of medical environments more as automated external defibrillators become safer and cheaper There are many different types of external defibrillators and progress in cardiac research has led to big improvements in the underlying technology

Until recently external defibrillators relied on monophasic shock waves Electrical pulses are quickly sent from one electrode to the other in one direction 

Biphasic defibrillation however changes the direction of the pulses It completes one cycle in approximately 10 milliseconds It significantly lowered the energy level necessary for successful defibrillation This in turn has decreased the risk of burns and other damage However there is not much evidence to suggest that biphasic defibrillation is better than monophasic defibrillators The small capacitor size required for the defibrillator can result in large cost and size savings 

An automated external defibrillator is a self contained defibrillator device designed to be movable and easy and simple to use They are often shaped like briefcases so that they can be carried by a handle An AED contains a battery a control computer and electrodes When the electrodes are stuck onto the patient the control computer will assess the patient checking the rhythm of their heart It will then charge itself to an appropriate power level and tell users that the person needs to be shocked If the patient does not need to be defibrillated the automated external defibrillator will not allow a shock to be administered A button must still be pushed manually to trigger the shock as the operator beforehand must be certain that nobody is touching the patient Often automated external defibrillators will have speakers which give instructions when they are opened 

Current automated external defibrillator devices are designed for emergency medical technicians home users police and security officers and other people with minimal medical knowledge These devices are commonly found in large gathering places such as airports casinos sports stadiums and college campuses

The electrode is the part of the defibrillator that gives off the shock 

The most well known type of electrode is the traditional metal paddle with an insulated handle This type must be held in place on the patients skin while shocks are delivered Before the paddles are used gel must be applied to the patients skin so that there is a good connection and to minimise electrical resistance 

Another type of resuscitation electrode is designed as an adhesive pad which can be stuck onto the skin of a patient These electrodes are left connected to a defibrillator If defibrillation is required the machine is charged and the shock is delivered without any need to apply any gel or to retrieve and place any paddles 

Both solid and wet gel adhesive electrodes are available Solid gel electrodes are more convenient because there is no need to clean the patients skin after removing the electrodes However the use of solid gel electrodes presents a higher risk of burns during defibrillation since wet gel electrodes more evenly conduct electricity into the body

Defibrillators are often depicted in movies television video games and other fictional media This is because it can quickly produce dramatic improvements in patient health Their function however is often exaggerated 

Medical providers are often shown defibrillating patients with a flat line ECG rhythm this is not done in real life as the heart is not restarted by the defibrillator itself 

A curse is a word which threatens the other person to have bad luck Nobody knows if it really works or become true Some people believe in them even so that they become true by magic For example for fairy tales the princes are cursed to become a beast or a frog by witches because of their bad behaviours But in the end a princess saves them 

Theres also something called a curse tablet which most Romans used to curse people they did not like They would often let them drift to the river so that the curse will be carried to where that person who has the curse But many curses are made when people are jealous and they want that person who has the curse to not do well 

The opposite of a curse is a blessing

Ventricular fibrillation is a cardiac arrhythmia in which there is an uncoordinated contraction of the cardiac muscle of the ventricles in the heart The heart is unable to pump blood around the body properly and ventricular fibrillation can cause tachycardia and hypoxia Ventricular fibrillation is a medical emergency If it is allowed to continue for more than a few seconds the blood will stop circulating which is what causes the loss of a pulse and respiration and the person will die

Ventricular fibrillation is a cause of cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death The ventricular muscle twitches randomly when it should contract in unison and the ventricles cannot pump blood into the arteries and into the systemic circulation

Ventricular fibrillation can often be reversed by the electric discharge of direct current from a defibrillator If no defibrillator is available a precordial thump can be delivered at the onset of VF to regain cardiac function but they are not always effective Antiarrhythmic agents such as amiodarone or lidocaine can help but unlike atrial fibrillation ventricular fibrillation rarely reverses spontaneously in large adult mammals Although a defibrillator is designed to correct the problem it is not always successful

In patients at high risk of ventricular fibrillation the use of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator has been shown to help

Seal or SEAL may refer to articles connected to a variety of meanings

Some of these names referred originally to the marine mammal

Tachycardia is the fast beating of the heart In adults it refers to heart rates higher than 100 beats per minute Tachhycardia may be a normal physiological response to stress but depending on the cause and how healthy the patient is tachycardia could be harmful and need medical treatment In some cases tachycardia can cause death

Tachycardia can be harmful in two ways First when the heart beats too rapidly it may perform inefficiently Second the faster the heart beats the more oxygen and nutrients the heart requires This can be especially problematic for patients suffering from ischaemic heart disease

A fracture is the separation of a body into more than one piece under the action of stress

The word fracture is often applied to bones of living creatures or to crystals or crystalline materials such as gemstones or metal Sometimes fractures can happen without the object actually separating into two or more pieces 

Stress in material science means that material is influenced in a way that may cause it to break or change its form

Stress is the way in which the force per unit area is spread out in a cross section of an item that balances and reacts to external loads applied to a body It is a second order tensor with nine dimensions but can be fully described with six dimensions due to symmetry in the absence of body moments Stress is often broken down into its shear and normal components as these have unique physical significance It often results from built up pressure due to the lack of an outlet 

Stress can be applied to solids liquids and gases Static fluids support normal stress but will flow under shear stress Moving viscous fluids can support shear stress Solids can support both shear and normal stress with ductile materials failing under shear and brittle materials failing under normal stress All materials have temperature dependent variations in stress related properties

All real objects occupy three dimensional space However if two dimensions are very large or very small compared to the others the object may be modelled as one dimensional This simplifies the mathematical modelling of the object One dimensional objects include a piece of wire loaded at the ends and viewed from the side and a metal sheet loaded on the face and viewed up close and through the cross section

Shear stress is a stress state where the stress is parallel to the surface of the material as opposed to normal stress when the stress is vertical to the surface 

Shear stress is relevant to the motion of fluids upon surfaces which result in the generation of shear stress Also constructions in soil can fail due to shear eg the weight of an earth filled dam may cause the subsoil to collapse like a small landslide

Tensile stress is the stress state leading to expansion that is the length of a material tends to increase in the tensile direction The volume of the material stays constant When equal and opposite forces are applied on a body then the stress due to this force is called tensile stress

Therefore in a uniaxial material the length increases in the tensile stress direction and the other two directions will decrease in size In the uniaxial manner of tension tensile stress is induced by pulling forces Tensile stress is the opposite of compressive stress

Structural members in direct tension are ropes soil anchors and nails bolts etc Beams subjected to bending moments may include tensile stress as well as compressive stress andor shear stress

Tensile stress may be increased until the reach of tensile strength namely the limit state of stress

Tension may mean

Tension is a reaction force applied by a stretched string on the objects which stretch it The direction of the force of tension is parallel to the string towards the string

Tension exists also inside the string itself if the string is made up of two parts tension is the force which the two parts of the string apply on each other The amount of tension in the string determines whether it will break as well as its vibrational properties which are used in musical instruments

Shear as a noun could mean

Shear as a verb or shearing could mean

Flow may mean

IOU means I Owe You or I Owe Unto It is a note between two people that is used to say that one person owes something to the other It is usually used for money IOUs are most often only used between people that know each other very well for example friends

In engineering mechanics deformation is a change in shape that is result of a force that influences the object 

It can be a result of tensile forces compressive forces shear bending or torsion

Depending on the type of material size and shape of the object and the forces used various types of deformation may result

This type of deformation is reversible Once the forces are no longer applied the object returns to its original shape As the name implies elastic has a rather large elastic deformation range Soft thermoplastics and metals have moderate elastic deformation ranges while ceramics crystals and hard thermosetting plastics undergo almost no elastic deformation

A phenomenon only discovered in modern times is metal fatigue which occurs primarily in ductile metals It was originally thought that a material deformed only within the elastic range returned completely to its original state once the forces were removed However faults are introduced at the molecular level with each deformation After many deformations cracks will begin to appear followed soon after by a fracture with no apparent plastic deformation in between Depending on the material shape and how close to the elastic limit it is deformed failure may require thousands millions billions or trillions of deformations 

Metal fatigue has been a major cause of aircraft failure especially before the process was well understood 

This type of deformation is not reversible But an object in the plastic deformation range will first have undergone elastic deformation which is reversible so the object will return part way to its original shape Soft thermoplastics have a rather large plastic deformation range as do ductile metals such as copper silver and gold Steel does too but not iron Hard thermosetting plastics rubber crystals and ceramics have minimal plastic deformation ranges Perhaps the material with the largest plastic deformation range is wet chewing gum which can be stretched dozens of times its original length

This type of deformation is also not reversible A break occurs after the material has reached the end of the elastic and then plastic deformation ranges At this point forces accumulate until they are sufficient to cause a fracture All materials will eventually fracture if sufficient forces are applied

A popular misconception is that all materials that bend are weak and all those which do not are strong In reality many materials which undergo large elastic and plastic deformations such as steel are able to absorb stresses which would cause brittle materials such as glass with minimal elastic and plastic deformation ranges to break There is even a story to describe this observation

The word ceramic is derived from the Greek word The term covers inorganic non metallic materials which are formed by the action of heat Up until the 1950s or so the most important of these were the traditional clays made into pottery bricks tiles and the like along with cements and glass Clay based ceramics are described in the article on pottery A composite material of ceramic and metal is known as cermet The word ceramic can be an adjective and can also be used as a noun to refer to a ceramic material or a product of ceramic manufacture Ceramics may also be used as a singular noun referring to the art of making things out of ceramic materials The technology of manufacturing and usage of ceramic materials is part of the field of ceramic engineering

Many ceramic materials are hard porous and brittle The study and development of ceramics includes methods to mitigate problems associated with these characteristics and to accentuate the strengths of the materials as well as to investigate novel applications

The American Society for Testing and Materials defines a ceramic article as an article having a glazed or unglazed body of crystalline or partly crystalline structure or of glass which body is produced from essentially inorganic non metallic substances and either is formed from a molten mass which solidifies on cooling or is formed and simultaneously or subsequently matured by the action of the heat

For convenience ceramic products are usually divided into four sectors and these are shown below with some examples

Technical ceramics can also be classified into three distinct material categories 

Each one of these classes can develop unique material properties

Ceramic materials are usually ionic or covalent bonded materials and can be crystalline or amorphous A material held together by either type of bond will tend to fracture before any plastic deformation takes place which results in poor toughness in these materials Additionally because these materials tend to be porous the pores and other microscopic imperfections act as stress concentrators decreasing the toughness further and reducing the tensile strength These combine to give catastrophic failures as opposed to the normally much more gentle failure modes of metals         

These materials do show plastic deformation However due to the rigid structure of the crystalline materials there are very few available slip systems for dislocations to move and so they deform very slowly With the non crystalline materials viscous flow is the dominant source of plastic deformation and is also very slow It is therefore neglected in many applications of ceramic materials

There are a number of ceramics that are semiconductors Most of these are transition metal oxides that are II VI semiconductors such as zinc oxide

While there is talk of making blue LEDs from zinc oxide ceramicists are most interested in the electrical properties that show grain boundary effects

One of the most widely used of these is the varistor These are devices that exhibit the property that resistance drops sharply at a certain threshold voltage Once the voltage across the device reaches the threshold there is a breakdown of the electrical structure in the vicinity of the grain boundaries which results in its electrical resistance dropping from several megohms down to a few hundred ohms The major advantage of these is that they can dissipate a lot of energy and they self resetafter the voltage across the device drops below the threshold its resistance returns to being high 

This makes them ideal for surge protection applications As there is control over the threshold voltage and energy tolerance they find use in all sorts of applications The best demonstration of their ability can be found in electrical substations where they are employed to protect the infrastructure from lightning strikes They have rapid response are low maintenance and do not appreciably degrade from use making them virtually ideal devices for this application

Semiconducting ceramics are also employed as gas sensors When various gases are passed over a polycrystalline ceramic its electrical resistance changes With tuning to the possible gas mixtures very inexpensive devices can be produced

Under some conditions such as extremely low temperature some ceramics exhibit high temperature superconductivity The exact reason for this is not known but there are two major families of superconducting ceramics 

Piezoelectricity a link between electrical and mechanical response is exhibited by a large number of ceramic materials including the quartz used to measure time in watches and other electronics Such devices use both properties of piezoelectrics using electricity to produce a mechanical motion and then using this mechanical motion to produce electricity The unit of time measured is the natural interval required for electricity to be converted into mechanical energy and back again

The piezoelectric effect is generally stronger in materials that also exhibit pyroelectricity and all pyroelectric materials are also piezoelectric These materials can be used to inter convert between thermal mechanical andor electrical energy for instance after synthesis in a furnace a pyroelectric crystal allowed to cool under no applied stress generally builds up a static charge of thousands of volts Such materials are used in motion sensors where the tiny rise in temperature from a warm body entering the room is enough to produce a measurable voltage in the crystal

In turn pyroelectricity is seen most strongly in materials which also display the ferroelectric effect in which a stable electric dipole can be oriented or reversed by applying an electrostatic field  Pyroelectricity is also a necessary consequence of ferroelectricity This can be used to store information in ferroelectric capacitors elements of ferroelectric RAM

The most common such materials are lead zirconate titanate and barium titanate Aside from the uses mentioned above their strong piezoelectric response is exploited in the design of high frequency loudspeakers transducers for sonar and actuators for atomic force and scanning tunneling microscopes

Increases in temperature can cause grain boundaries to suddenly become insulating in some semiconducting ceramic materials mostly mixtures of heavy metal titanates The critical transition temperature can be adjusted over a wide range by variations in chemistry In such materials current will pass through the material until joule heating brings it to the transition temperature at which point the circuit will be broken and current flow will cease Such ceramics are used as self controlled heating elements in for example the rear window defrost circuits of automobiles

At the transition temperature the materials dielectric response becomes theoretically infinite While a lack of temperature control would rule out any practical use of the material near its critical temperature the dielectric effect remains exceptionally strong even at much higher temperatures Titanates with critical temperatures far below room temperature have become synonymous with ceramic in the context of ceramic capacitors for just this reason

Non crystalline ceramics Non crystalline ceramics being glasses tend to be formed from melts The glass is shaped when either fully molten by casting or when in a state of toffee like viscosity by methods such as blowing to a mold If later heat treatments cause this class to become partly crystalline the resulting material is known as a glass ceramic

Crystalline ceramics Crystalline ceramic materials are not amenable to a great range of processing Methods for dealing with them tend to fall into one of two categories either make the ceramic in the desired shape by reaction in situ or by forming powders into the desired shape and then sintering to form a solid body Ceramic forming techniques include shaping by hand slip casting tape casting injection molding dry pressing and other variations A few methods use a hybrid between the two approaches

The most common use of this method is in the production of cement and concrete Here the dehydrated powders are mixed with water This starts hydration reactions which result in long interlocking crystals forming around the aggregates Over time these result in a solid ceramic

The biggest problem with this method is that most reactions are so fast that good mixing is not possible which tends to prevent large scale construction However small scale systems can be made by deposition techniques where the various materials are introduced above a substrate and react and form the ceramic on the substrate This borrows techniques from the semiconductor industry such as chemical vapour deposition and is very useful for coatings

These tend to produce very dense ceramics but do so slowly

The principles of sintering based methods is simple Once a roughly held together object is made it is baked in a kiln where diffusion processes cause the green body to shrink The pores in the object close up resulting in a denser stronger product The firing is done at a temperature below the melting point of the ceramic There is virtually always some porosity left but the real advantage of this method is that the green body can be produced in any way imaginable and still be sintered This makes it a very versatile route 

There are thousands of possible refinements of this process Some of the most common involve pressing the green body to give the densification a head start and reduce the sintering time needed Sometimes organic binders such as polyvinyl alcohol are added to hold the green body together these burn out during the firing Sometimes organic lubricants are added during pressing to increase densification It is not uncommon to combine these and add binders and lubricants to a powder then press A comprehensive book on the subject for mechanical as well as electronics applications is Organic Additives and Ceramic Processing by D J Shanefield Kluwer Publishers Boston 1996

A slurry can be used in place of a powder and then cast into a desired shape dried and then sintered Indeed traditional pottery is done with this type of method using a plastic mixture worked with the hands

If a mixture of different materials is used together in a ceramic the sintering temperature is sometimes above the melting point of one minor component a liquid phase sintering This results in shorter sintering times compared to solid state sintering

An inorganic compound is a chemical compound which is not an organic compound That means it is not a carbon based compound

The division between the two types of compound is not absolute Some carbon containing compounds are traditionally considered inorganic Many chemicals in nature are not compounds but are ions Sodium chloride and phosphate ions are essential for life as are some inorganic molecules such as nitrogen carbon dioxide water and oxygen Aside from these simple ions and molecules virtually all compounds covered by biochemistry contain carbon and can be considered organic or organometallic

Major types of inorganic compounds include

Applied mechanics also known as theoretical and applied mechanics is a branch of the physical sciences and the practical application of mechanics Applied mechanics examines the response of bodies to external forces Some examples of mechanical systems include the flow of a liquid under pressure the fracture of a solid from an applied force or the vibration of an ear in response to sound A practitioner of the discipline is known as a mechanician 

Applied mechanics as its name suggests bridges the gap between physical theory and its application to technology  

Mechanics is the branch of physics which looks at bodies that are influenced by forces and moved

The discipline has its roots in ancient Greece where Aristotle studied the way bodies behaved when they were thrown through the air However it was Galileo Kepler and especially Newton who laid the foundations for much of the so called Newtonian mechanics we know today

A person working in the discipline is known as a mechanician

Mechanics is the original discipline of physics dealing with the macroscopic world that humans perceive It is therefore a huge body of knowledge about the natural world Mechanics encompasses the movement of all matter in the universe under the four forces gravity the strong and weak interactions and the electromagnetic interaction

Mechanics also constitutes a central part of technology

The following are categorized as being part of Quantum mechanics

Paleobiology is a branch of science which studies animals plants and microbes buried in rock These stoney items are called fossils Paleobiology combines biology with the study of these fossils There are several branches of paleobiology

Baron Franz Nopcsa von Fels Szilvs started paleobiology in the late 19th century while working at the University of Vienna He tried to learn how the animals lived rather than merely put together their bones as many geologists were doing at the time

A central venous catheter or central line is a catheter put in a large vein in the neck chest or groin when a patient needs close cardiovascular monitoring for assessment of fluid status and so that intravenous drugs and fluids can be given to the patient more effectively The veins most commonly used are the internal jugular vein the subclavian vein and the femoral vein

Central line may mean

Macroscopic means physical objects that are measurable and can be seen by the naked eye 

When one uses macroscopic for abstract objects one thinks of the world as we see it without any help Lengths scales are called macroscopic if they are fall in the range of more or less 1 mm up to 1 km

One may use the term macroscopic also for a larger view namely a view only available from a large perspective A macroscopic position could be considered the big picture

In physics macroscopy is a relative term If one looks at a galaxy a star is microscopic in comparison with the whole galaxy even if it is many many orders of magnitude larger than us

Seeing with naked eye means to look at something without the help of telescope binoculars or microscope It is often used in astronomy meaning something that the general public can see a star without any help 

If one says things have the same order of magnitude one means a value that is rather near to the other value that is compared with it 

But if one would compare the surface of an orange with that of the earth one would say the surface of the earth is many orders of magnitude larger than that of the orange

Orders of magnitude are generally used to make very approximate comparisons If two numbers differ by one order of magnitude one is about ten times larger than the other If they differ by two orders of magnitude they differ by a factor of about 100 Two numbers of the same order of magnitude have roughly the same scale the larger value is less than ten times the smaller value

Pantheism is the belief that God and the universe are equivalent A pantheist believes that everything that exists is a part of God and that God is nothing more than everything that exists The name pantheism comes from the words theism and pan 

Any doctrine or philosophy that believes that the universe and everything in it is God is said to be pantheistic Most pantheists believe the universe is sacred and the earth and nature are divine Pantheists are sometimes called nature worshipers

Most of the early Greek philosophers from Thales on to Aristotle believed in some sort of pantheism

Pantheism is an important part of many eastern religions such as Hinduism and Taoism

Some western philosophers such as Baruch Spinoza and scientists like Carl Sagan and Stephen Hawking are pantheists While many hold pantheistic ideas their beliefs are hard to determine Albert Einstein was an example he held many pantheistic views but did not consider himself a pantheist

Im not an atheist and I dont think I can call myself a pantheist We are in the position of a little child entering a huge library filled with books in many different languages The child knows someone must have written those books It does not know how The child dimly suspects a mysterious order in the arrangement of the books but doesnt know what it is That it seems to me is the attitude of even the most intelligent human being toward God Albert Einstein

Some Christians Jews and Muslims are Pantheists However their majority believes that while God is in everything there is more to God than just the universe

Panentheism is the belief that the universe is part of God Followers believe that god God or gods are both part of the universe and above it To some people this is a very confusing concept and was first created by philosophers in the early centuries AD

Deuterium is an isotope of hydrogen the first element Deuterium has one proton and one neutron Hydrogen does not have a neutron only a proton Another isotope of hydrogen tritium has two neutrons The chemical symbol for Deuterium is 2H but D is also used often

A deuterium atom combined with two oxygen atoms is sometimes called heavy water This is because it is like water but heavier because deuterium has one more neutron in its nucleus Heavy water is sometimes used in nuclear reactors

Boer is the Dutch word for farmer which is used to call the descendants of the Dutch farmers of Southern Africa during the 1700s as well as those who left the Cape Colony during the 1800s to live in the Orange Free State Transvaal They did this to escape the British rule and the wars between the British imperial government and the native tribes on the eastern frontier 

In 1657 vrybriewe was granted to 9 burgers the first farmers or Boers at the Cape Although they were not known as Afrikaners they did not regard themselves as living in a European country As more and more immigrants from Europe arrived at the Cape the more international marriages took place Soon their language and culture was lost and transformed into the Dietse nation They regarded themselves as a new nation Paul Heyns born in 1696 christened his son Michiel Afrikanus One Hendrik Bieslow in 1707 proclaimed in public Ik ben een Afrikaander The Boer later created the Boer Republics which were deafeated in the 1880 1881 and 18991902 Anglo Boer wars After that many Boers emigrated to other countries but many still live in modern South Africa Swaziland and Rhodesia

Compressive stress is the stress on materials that leads to a smaller volume 

By compressive stress the material is under compression Compressive stress to bars columns etc leads to shortening

One can increase the compressive stress until compressive strength is reached Then materials will react with ductile behaviour or with fracture in case of brittle materials

Rotation is the movement of an object in a circular motion 

A two dimensional object rotates around a center of rotation A three dimensional object rotates around a line called an axis If the axis of rotation is within the body the body is said to rotate upon itself or spin which implies relative speed and perhaps free movement with angular momentum A circular motion about an external point is called an orbit or more properly orbital revolution

Rotation around a point in one plane can be in a clockwise direction or an anticlockwise direction

In flight dynamics the principal rotations are known as pitch roll and yaw The term rotation is also used in aviation to refer to the upward pitch of an aircraft particularly when starting the major climb for takeoff 

Many amusement rides provide rotation A Ferris wheel and observation wheel have a horizontal central axis and parallel axes for each gondola where the rotation is opposite by gravity or mechanically 

Rotation usually called spin plays a role in many sports Topspin and backspin in tennis English follow and draw in billiards and pool Curve balls in baseball and spin bowling in cricket Table tennis paddles are specialized to allow players to spin the ball as they hit it

In physics the moment of force means the magnitude of force that influences the rotation of an object 

In this concept the moment arm the distance from the axis of rotation plays an important role The lever pulley gear and most other simple machines create mechanical advantage by changing the moment arm The SI unit for moment is the newton meter

The principle of moments is derived from Archimedes discovery of the operating principle of the lever In the lever one applies a force in his day most often human muscle to an arm a beam of some sort Archimedes noted that the amount of force applied to the object the moment of force is defined as M rF where F is the applied force and r is the distance from the applied force to object

Tensile strength measures the force required to pull something such as rope wire or a structural beam to the point where it breaks

The tensile strength of a material is the maximum amount of tensile stress that it can take before failure for example breaking 

There are three typical definitions of tensile strength

Some typical tensile strengths of some materials

Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia was the youngest daughter of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and his wife Alexandra Fyodorovna Anastasia was murdered with her family on 17 July 1918 by the Bolshevik secret police She was a sister of Grand Duchess Olga Grand Duchess Tatiana Grand Duchess Maria and Alexei Nikolaevich Tsarevich of Russia 

During the years of Communist rule nobody knew where she was buried This led to many stories that she could have escaped and still be alive The bodies of the Tsar Tsarina and three daughters were found in a grave near Yekaterinburg in 1991 however the bodies of Alexei Nikolaevich and one of his sisters were not there

In January 2008 Russian scientists said that the remains of a young boy and woman found near Yekaterinburg in August 2007 might be the missing bodies On 30 April 2008 Russian scientists used DNA testing to prove that they were the Tsarevich Alexei and his sister In March 2009 the last results of the DNA testing were published by Dr Michael Coble of the US Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory This proved that all four Grand Duchesses were murdered

Several women have claimed to have been Anastasia The most famous was Anna Anderson However DNA testing in 1994 on pieces of Andersons tissue and hair showed that she was not related to the Imperial family

When Anastasia was born her family was disappointed They had hoped for a son who would be heir to the throne In honor of her birth her father forgave the students who had been put in prison for joining in riots in St Petersburg and Moscow Because of this Anastasias name means the breaker of chains or the prison opener It can also mean of the resurrection People often spoke of this when there were stories that she had not died Anastasia was a Grand Duchess Because this made Anastasia an Imperial Highness she was higher in rank than other Princesses in Europe who were Royal Highnesses

The Tsars children lived very simply They slept on hard camp cots without pillows when they were healthy took cold baths in the morning and had to clean their rooms and sometimes sew Most of their servants usually called Anastasia by her first name instead of calling her Her Imperial Highness Sometimes they called her Anastasie Nastya Nastas or Nastenka Anastasia was also called Malenkaya meaning little or shvibzik the Russian word for imp

Anastasia was a bright lively child People described her as short and plump with blue eyes and blonde hair Margaretta Eagar Anastasias governess said that somebody had once called young Anastasia the most charming child he had ever seen Lili Dehn said that Anastasia was pretty but had more of a clever face and her eyes were wells of intelligence

Anastasia was clever but she was never much interested in studying Pierre Gilliard Sydney Gibbes and ladies in waiting Lili Dehn and Anna Vyrubova said that Anastasia was funny and good at acting Some people did not like her sharp quick remarks

Anastasias playful behavior was often punished According to Gieb Botkin in naughtiness she was a true genius He was the son of the court doctor Yevgeny Botkin who later died with the family at Ekaterinburg Anastasia tripped the servants tricked her teachers and climbed trees and refused to come down Once at a snowball fight she rolled a rock into a snowball and threw it at her older sister Tatiana Princess Nina Georgievna Anastasias cousin said that Anastasia was nasty to the point of being evil She said that Anastasia would get angry when her friends won games or when the younger Nina was taller than she was She also cared less about her looks than her sisters Hallie Erminie Rives an American writer described how Anastasia ate chocolates without taking off her white opera gloves at the St Petersburg opera house when she was 10 years old

Anastasias family called Anastasia and her older sister Maria The Little Pair This was because they shared a room often wore the same dress and played together a lot Their older sisters Olga and Tatiana were known as The Big Pair because they shared a room as well The four girls sometimes signed letters with their nickname OTMA They made this nickname from the first letters of their first names Olga Tatiana Maria and Anastasia

Anastasia was very energetic but she was often sick She had hallux valgus which hurt both of her big toes Anastasia also had a weak muscle in her back Because of this she had to be massaged twice every week She disliked this and when it was time to be massaged she would hide under her bed or in cupboards Anastasias older sister Maria is said to have hemorrhaged in December 1914 during an operation to remove her tonsils The doctor performing the operation was so shocked that Marias mother Tsarina Alexandra had to order him to continue Olga Alexandrovna said all four of her nieces bled more than was normal She believed they had the hemophilia gene like their mother Some carriers of the gene are not hemophiliacs themselves but they can have signs of hemophilia like bleeding more than most people DNA testing on the remains of the royal family proved in 2009 that Alexei suffered from Hemophilia B His mother and one of his sisters were carriers The Russians thought this sister was Maria and Americans thought it was Anastasia If Anastasia had lived she could have passed on the disease to her children Anastasia like everyone else in her family loved Baby Tsarevich Alexei very much Alexei often had attacks of hemophilia and nearly died several times

Her mother trusted Grigori Rasputin a Russian peasant and wandering holy man She thought his prayers had saved her son when he was sick many times Anastasia and her sisters were told to treat Rasputin as Our Friend and to tell him their secrets In the autumn of 1907 Anastasias aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia went to the nursery with the Tsar to meet Rasputin Anastasia her sisters and brother Alexei were all wearing their long white nightgowns

All the children seemed to like him Olga Alexandrovna said later They were completely at ease with him Rasputins friendship with the Imperial children can be seen in some of the messages he sent to them In February 1909 Rasputin sent them a telegram saying Love the whole of Gods nature the whole of His creation in particular this earth The Mother of God was always occupied with flowers and needlework

But in 1910 Sofia Ivanovna Tyutcheva told other people in the family that Rasputin was allowed to see the four girls when they were wearing their nightgowns Rasputins visits to the children were completely innocent but the family was shocked and angry Tyutcheva told Nicholass sister Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia that Rasputin visited and talked to the girls while they were getting ready for bed and hugged and patted them Tyutcheva said the children did not talk about Rasputin with her and kept his visits a secret Tatiana wrote to her mother on 8 March 1910 that she was so afr that SI can speak about our friend something bad Xenia wrote on 15 March 1910 that she did not understand the attitude of Alix and the children to that sinister Grigory Nicholas asked Rasputin not to go into the nursery after that and Alexandra later fired Tyutcheva

In the spring of 1910 Maria Ivanovna Vishnyakova a royal governess said that Rasputin had raped her The empress did not believe her saying that everything Rasputin does is holy Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna was told that they had made an investigation to see if what Vishnyakova said was true but that they caught the young woman in bed with a Cossack of the Imperial Guard Vishnyakova was kept from seeing Rasputin after she claimed that he raped her She was fired in 1913

But rumors still spread People suggested that Rasputin had seduced the Tsarina and her four daughters Rasputin had written warm but completely innocent letters to the Tsarina and her four daughters He released the letters which made people gossip even more My dear precious only friend wrote Anastasia How much I should like to see you again You appeared to me today in a dream I am always asking Mama when you will come I think of you always my dear because you are so good to me 

Soon after pornographic cartoons were printed about Rasputin having relations with the Empress her four daughters and Anna Vyrubovna After the scandal Nicholas asked Rasputin to leave St Petersburg for a time Rasputin went on a pilgrimage to Palestine Alexandra was very angry at this However though the rumors continued the imperial family continued to be friendly with Rasputin until he was murdered on 17 December 1916 Our Friend is so contented with our girlies says their souls have much developed Alexandra wrote to Nicholas on December 6 1916

Later AA Mordvinov reported in his memoirs that the four Grand Duchesses looked cold and visibly terribly upset by Rasputins death He added that they sat huddled up closely together on a sofa on the night they heard he was killed Mordvinov remembered that they were sad and seemed to feel the beginning of great political troubles Rasputin was buried with an icon signed on the back by Anastasia her mother and her sisters Anastasia went to his funeral on December 21 1916 Her family planned to build a church over Rasputins grave After they were killed by the Bolsheviks it was discovered Anastasia and her sisters were all wearing amulets with Rasputins picture and a prayer on it

During World War I Anastasia and her sister Maria visited hurt soldiers at a hospital at Tsarskoye Selo Because they were too young to become Red Cross nurses like their mother and older sisters they played checkers and billiards with the soldiers and tried to make them happy instead Felix Dassel who was treated at the hospital remembered that Anastasia had a laugh like a squirrel and walked quickly as though she tripped along 

In February 1917 Nicholas II resigned from the throne Anastasia and her family were placed under house arrest at the Alexander Palace in Tsarskoye Selo during the Russian Revolution As the Bolsheviks came nearer Alexander Kerensky moved them to Tobolsk Siberia The Bolsheviks grew more and more powerful Anastasia and her family were moved to the Ipatiev House at Yekaterinburg

Anastasia felt sad about her captivity Goodby she wrote to a friend in the winter of 1917 Dont forget us At Tobolsk she wrote a sad theme for her English teacher filled with spelling mistakes about Evelyn Hope a poem by Robert Browning about a young girl When she died she was only sixteen years old Anastasia wrote Ther was a man who loved her without having seen her butnew her very well And she herd of him also He never could tell her that he loved her and now she was dead But still he thought that when he and she will live their next life whenever it will be that 

At Tobolsk she and her sisters sewed jewels into their clothes This was because Alexandra Nicholas and Maria had had their things taken away when they arrived in Ekaterinburg Demidova wrote to Tegleva about this using code words for the jewels such as medicines and Sednevs belongings Anastasia and her sisters dressed simply and all three had their hair cut short It had been cut when they were ill with measles in 1917 and they had kept it short Pierre Gilliard remembered his last sight of the children The sailor Nagorny who attended to Alexei Nikolaevitch passed my window carrying the sick boy in his arms behind him came the Grand Duchesses loaded with valises and small personal belongings I tried to get out but was roughly pushed back into the carriage by the sentry I came back to the window Tatiana Nikolayevna came last carrying her little dog and struggling to drag a heavy brown valise It was raining and I saw her feet sink into the mud at every step Nagorny tried to come to her assistance he was roughly pushed back by one of the commisars Baroness Sophie Buxhoeveden too spoke of her last sad memory of Anastasia Once standing on some steps at the door of a house close by I saw a hand and a pink sleeved arm opening the topmost pane According to the blouse the hand must have belonged either to the Grand Duchess Marie or Anastasia They could not see me through their windows and this was to be the last glimpse that I was to have of any of them

But even in the last months of her life Anastasia could be happy She and other members of her family performed plays for their parents and others in the spring of 1918 Her tutor Sydney Gibbes said that Anastasias acting made everyone laugh On 7 May 1918 Anastasia wrote a letter from Tobolsk to her sister Maria in Yekaterinburg In the letter she described a moment of joy even though she was sad lonely and worried about her sick brother Alexei We played on the swing that was when I roared with laughter the fall was so wonderful Indeed I told the sisters about it so many times yesterday that they got quite fed up adding One could simply shout with joy In his memoirs Alexander Strekotin one of the guards at the Ipatiev House called Anastasia very friendly and full of fun Another guard said Anastasia was a very charming devil She was mischievous and I think rarely tired She was lively and was fond of performing comic mimes with the dogs as though they were performing in a circus Another guard however called her offensive and a terrorist and complained about some of her sharp remarks Anastasia and her sisters learned to wash their own clothes and make bread at the Ipatiev House

In the summer however the whole family became much sadder According to some accounts Anastasia once became so unhappy about the locked painted windows that she opened one to get fresh air A guard is said to have seen her and fired almost hitting her She did not try to open the windows again

On 14 July 1918 local priests at Yekaterinburg held a private church service for the family They later said that Anastasia and her family fell on their knees during the prayers for the dead which they had not done before They also noted that the girls had become very sad and did not reply to the service One of the priests said Something has happened to them in there But the next day on 15 July 1918 Anastasia and her sisters seemed happier They joked and helped move the beds in their shared bedroom so that the cleaning women could clean the floors Helping the women scrub the floors they whispered to them when the guards were not watching Anastasia even stuck her tongue out at Yakov Yurovsky the head of the guards when he turned his back and left the room

Anastasia was executed with her family by a firing squad in the early morning of 17 July 1918 They had been killed by the Bolshevik secret police commanded by Yurovsky

In October 1917 the Bolshevik revolution struck Russia A civil war began shortly after that Plans to release the Romanovs slowed down As the Whites came more toward Yekaterinburg the Reds felt afraid They knew that the well prepared White Army would win When the Whites reached Yekaterinburg the Imperial Family were gone It is thought that the family had been executed

The Yurovsky Note was found in 1989 and described in Edvard Radzinskys 1992 book The Last Tsar The Yurovsky Note was a description of the event by Yurovsky after the execution According to the note on the night of the murders the family was awakened and told to dress They were told they were moving to a new place for their safety They claimed it was because of the possible violence which might happen when the White Army reached Yekaterinburg When they were dressed the family and the few servants were led to a small room in the houses basement They were told to wait there Alexandra asked for chairs for herself and Alexei and she sat next to her son After a short time the executioners entered the room led by Yurovsky Yurovsky quickly told the Tsar and his family that they were going to die The Tsar cried What and turned to his family but was immediately killed when several bullets hit his chest The Tsar the empress and two servants were killed in the first round of shooting Maria Dr Botkin and Alexandras maid Demidova were hurt Thick smoke and dust filled the room from the shooting so the gunmen left the room for a few minutes They soon came back and shot Dr Botkin A gunman named Ermakov tried to shoot Tsarevich Alexei but the jewels in the boys clothes protected him Ermakov tried to kill Alexei with a bayonet but failed again At last Yurovsky fired two shots into the boys head Tatiana and Olga were near the wall They were holding onto each other and crying for their mother Tatiana was killed by a shot to her head Olga died when Ermakov shot her in the jaw

Maria Anastasia and the maid Demidova were on the floor under the rooms one window Ermakov said that he killed Maria by shooting her head Ermakov then tried to stab Anastasia failed and said he killed her by shooting her head Marias skull does not have any bullet wounds though It is unclear how she died Ermakov was drunk during the murders and it is possible his shot did not go entirely through her head She might have become unconscious and bled greatly but remained alive Then as the bodies were taken away two of the grand duchesses moved One sat up and screamed throwing her arm over her head The other bleeding from the mouth moaned and moved When Olga and Tatiana were shot they were killed instantly so Maria was probably the one who screamed Anastasia might still have been able to move Ermakov told his wife that Anastasia was killed by a bayonet and Yurovsky wrote that as the bodies were carried out one or more of the girls cried out and were hit on the back of the head with a club However the back of Marias skull does not show any signs of having been clubbed The remains of Anastasias burnt body do not show details of how she died

One of the greatest mysteries of the 20th century was if Anastasia had survived or not From 1920 to 1922 Anna Anderson the most famous person who pretended to be Anastasia grew very famous She claimed that she had pretended to be dead then escaped with the help of a kind guard that saved her from the dead bodies after seeing she was still alive Her legal struggle to be recognized as Anastasia from 1938 to 1970 was a controversy for her whole life It was the longest running case ever heard by the German courts At last the courts decided that there was not enough proof

Anderson died in 1984 and her body was cremated In 1994 a tissue sample from Andersen in a hospital was used for DNA tests with the blood of Prince Philip Duke of Edinburgh Prince Philip was a grandnephew of Empress Alexandra Dr Gill who did the tests decided that if you accept that these samples came from Anna Anderson then Anna Anderson could not have been related to Tsar Nicholas or Tsarina Alexandra Andersons DNA matched with a great nephew of Franziska Schanzkowska a missing Polish factory worker Some people who supported Anderson agreed that the DNA tests showed she could not have been the Grand Duchess

At least 10 women claimed to be Anastasia Less famous people who pretended to be Anastasia were Nadezhda Ivanovna Vasilyeva and Eugenia Smith A priest took care of two young women who said that they were Anastasia and her sister Maria in the Ural Mountains in 1919 They lived there as nuns until they died in 1964 They were buried with the names Anastasia and Maria Nikolaevna 

People reported that trains and houses were being searched for Anastasia Romanov by soldiers and secret police When she was put in prison for a short time at Perm in 1918 Princess Helena Petrovna the wife of Anastasias distant cousin Prince Ioann Konstantinovich of Russia said that a guard took a girl who called herself Anastasia Romanova to her cell and asked her if the girl was the Tsars daughter When she did not recognize the girl the guard took her away Others in Perm later said that they saw Anastasia her mother and sisters in Perm after they were killed but this was only a rumor Surprisingly the rumors that had started to hide the fact that the family was dead helped the rumors that they were alive A few days after they had been killed the German government sent telegrams to Russia asking for the safety of the princesses of German blood Russia had signed a peace treaty with the Germans and did not want to tell them that the women were dead Instead they told them they had been moved to a safer place This could have been why the Perm stories began

Another time eight people said that they saw a young woman being captured at a railway station at Siding 37 in September 1918 after trying to escape These people were Maxim Grigoyev Tatiana Sitnikova and her son Fyodor Sitnikov Ivan Kuklin and Matrina Kuklina Vassily Ryabov Ustinya Varankina and Dr Pavel Utkin Some of these people said that the girl was Anastasia when they saw photographs of the grand duchess by White Russian Army investigators Dr Pavel Utkin also told the investigators that the girl whom he had helped in Perm when she was hurt had said I am the daughter of the ruler Anastasia During that time there were similar stories of young people in Russia saying that they were Romanovs who had escaped Boris Soloviev the husband of Rasputins daughter Maria defrauded many important Russian families by asking for money for a Romanov to escape to China Soloviev was helped by young women who pretended to be one of the grand duchesses to help trick the families

Some suggest that there might have been a way for a guard to save anyone in the family who still lived Yakov Yurovsky ordered the guards to come to his office and give him the things they had stolen after the murder At that time it is said that there was a short time when the killed bodies were left in the truck and in the basement of the house Some guards who had not joined in the murders and had felt sorry for the grand duchesses were left in the basement with the bodies

There were also stories from Bulgaria that Anastasia and her brother were still alive In 1953 Peter Zamiatkin told a 16 year old person being treated at a hospital that he had taken Anastasia and Alexei to the village where he was born near Odessa He said he was a member of the guard of the Romanovs and that the Tsar had asked him to do this Zamiatkin said that after the rest of the family had been killed he escaped with the children on a ship Anastasia and Alexei lived under false names in the Bulgarian town of Gabarevo The Bulgarian Anastasia called herself Eleonora Albertovna Kruger She died in 1954

In 1991 the place where the Imperial family and their servants were supposedly buried as found in the woods outside Yekaterinburg It had actually been found almost ten years earlier but had been kept hidden by the people who discovered it They did not want the Communists who still ruled Russia at that time to know where the grave was The grave only had nine bodies instead of 11 DNA and studies on their skeletons showed that they were the bodies of Tsar Nicholas II his wife and three of the Grand Duchesses The other remains had different DNA They were the bodies of the familys doctor valet cook and Alexandras maid Dr William Maples decided that the Tsarevitch Alexei and Anastasias bodies were missing Russian scientists did not agree with this They claimed that it was the body of Maria was missing not Anastasias The Russians used a computer program to compare photos of Anastasia with the skulls from the grave When some of the pieces of bone in the skulls were missing they guessed how long or wide it was instead American scientists thought this way of studying the bodies was wrong 

American scientists thought the missing body was Anastasias This was because none of the female skeletons showed signs that it was not fully grown yet The remains of the Imperial Family were buried in 1998 At that time a body that measured about 5 feet 7 inches was buried as the body of Anastasia Photographs of her standing next to her sisters six months before she died show that Anastasia was a few inches shorter than all of them

The Yurovsky Note showed that two of the bodies were taken from the main grave and burned secretly to hide the burials of the Imperial family However people could not find the place where the bodies were burnt for many years However on 23 August 2007 a Russian archaeologist declared that he had found two burned skeletons near Yekaterinburg at a place which seemed to match what was described in Yurovskys writings The archaeologists said that the bones were from a boy who was about 10 to 13 and a young woman who was between 18 and 23 years old Anastasia was 17 years and one month old when she was killed Maria was 19 years one month old and Alexei was just two weeks before his fourteenth birthday Anastasias older sisters Olga and Tatiana were 22 and 23 when they died They used metal detectors to find the bones

Many international laboratories such as the Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory and Innsbruck Medical University did DNA tests They proved that the remains were from the body of Tsarevich Alexei and one of his sister They agreed that everyone in the family including Anastasia died in 1918 All the parents and children has his or her own special DNA

In 2000 Anastasia and her family were canonized as passion bearers by the Russian Orthodox Church In 1981 they had already been canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad as holy martyrs The bodies of Tsar Nicholas II Tsarina Alexandra and three of their daughters were buried in the St Catherine Chapel at St Peter and Paul Cathedral in St Petersburg on 17 July 1998 This was 80 years after they had been murdered

The stories of how Anastasia might have escaped became the subject of theatrical and television films The earliest made in 1928 was called Clothes Make the Woman The story was about a woman who acts the character of Anastasia in a Hollywood film and is later recognized by the Russian soldier who saved her

In 1956 a movie called Anastasia was made Ingrid Bergman acted Anna Anderson Yul Brynner was General Bounine and Helen Hayes as the Dowager Empress Marie Anastasias grandmother The film is about a woman from an asylum who came to Paris in 1928 and was captured by some Russian migrs who use her so that they can fool Anastasias grandmother into thinking Anderson actually is her granddaughter This is because they want to get a Tsarist fortune After some time they begin wondering if Madame A Anderson really is the missing Grand Duchess This story was also used for the short 1965 musical Anya

In 1986 NBC began a mini series inspired by a book published in 1983 by Peter Kurth called Anastasia The Riddle of Anna Anderson The movie Anastasia The Mystery of Anna was a series with two parts It began with the young Anastasia Nicholaievna and her family being sent to Yekaterinburg where they are killed by Bolshevik soldiers The story then moves to 1923 saying that Anna Anderson is Anastasia Amy Irving was the actress for Anna Anderson

The most recent film is 1997s Anastasia This was an animated musical adaptation of the story of Anastasias fictional escape from Russia and how she tried to be recognized The film often used wrong historical facts

In The Romanov Prophecy a 2004 novel by Steve Berry Anastasia and Alexei are saved by guards and taken away to the United States There they live under false names with a family paid by Felix Yusupov In the novel both children died in the 1920s because they became sick However before they died Alexei married and had a son

Anna Anderson was a woman who claimed she was Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia The real Anastasia had been murdered in Ekaterinburg with the rest of her immediate family on July 171918 Her remains have been found and extensively tested using DNA samples from Anastasias family comparing them to Anderson There was no match at all Anderson attempted to kill herself in 1920 in Berlin Germany She was taken to a mental hospital A short time later she began to tell her false story of escape to people there Some people believed her Most people did not Her false claims were pushed for 70 years Movies were made about her story She married Jack Manahan and called herself Anastasia Manahan They lived in Charlottesville Virginia Anna Anderson died in 1984

When she lived Maria was not old enough to be a Red Cross nurse like her sisters Instead she was patroness of a hospital and visited wounded soldiers She was very interested in the lives of the soldiers and had several innocent crushes on the young men she met She wanted to marry and have a big family She was known to be flirtaseous at a young age

She was an older sister of Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia Her sister Anastasia was famous for stories about her escape from the murder of the royal family for almost 90 years In the 1990s it was suggested that the grand duchess whose remains were not in the Romanov grave might be Maria However further remains were discovered in 2007 and DNA proved at last that the entire Imperial family had been murdered in 1918

People described Maria as a pretty flirtatious girl She was plump with light brown hair and big blue eyes that her family called Maries saucers Her French teacher Pierre Gilliard said Maria was tall and healthy with rosy cheeks Tatiana Botkina thought Marias eyes were soft and gentle When she was a baby people compared her to one of Botticellis angels Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia called her The Amiable Baby

When she was young Maria once ran away from her bath and ran naked all around the palace Her Irish nurse Margaretta Eager who was talking about politics with a friend did not even notice Fortunately I arrived just at that moment picked her up and carried her back to Miss Eagar remembered her aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia Her older sisters did not like to let Maria join in their games They once even called Maria their stepsister This was because she was so good and never got into trouble according to Margaretta Eagar However even the sweet Maria could be mischievous sometimes Once when she was young she stole some biscuits from her mothers tea table The governess and Alexandra wanted her to go to bed as a punishment but Nicholas said no He said I was always afraid of the wings growing I am glad to see she is only a human child Eagar remarked that Maria loved her father deeply She often tried to run away from the nursery to go to Papa When her father was ill with typhoid Maria covered a small picture of him with kisses every night

She was raised very simply She shared a room with her sister Anastasia where the walls were painted gray and the ceiling was painted with butterflies The furniture was simple and in white and green colors

Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna of Russia was a daughter of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and Tsarina Alexandra Feodorovna She was a sister of Olga Anastasia Maria and Tsarevich Alexei of Russia Her friends said she was more beautiful than her sisters She was a Red Cross nurse during World War I She was practical and liked to help her mother Her religion was Russian Orthodox She spoke Russian English and French fluently

Tatiana was killed by Bolsheviks on July 17 1918 with the rest of her family and some of their servants during the Russian Revolution Their mass grave was found later in Siberia after some speculation that one of her sisters mainly presumed to be Anastasia had escaped Tatiana and her family were then buried in St Petersburg Russia on July 17 1998 They were made saints by the Russian Orthodox Church in 2000

Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia was the oldest daughter of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia the last sovereign of Imperial Russia and his wife Alexandra Fyodorovna

Olgas future marriage was the subject of much speculation inside Russia while she was alive There were stories about matches with Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia Crown Prince Carol of Romania Edward Prince of Wales eldest son of Britains George V and with Crown Prince Alexander of Serbia Olga wanted to marry a Russian and stay in her home country During World War I Olga nursed wounded soldiers at a military hospital until she became ill herself After that she managed administrative duties at the hospital

Olga was murdered with her family on July 17 1918 by the Bolshevik secret police The Russian Orthodox Church canonized her as a passion bearer after her death Later many people falsely claimed to be surviving members of the royal family A woman named Marga Boodts claimed to be Grand Duchess Olga but she was not taken seriously Historians believe that Olga was killed with her family at Ekaterinburg Her remains were identified through DNA testing They were buried in a funeral ceremony in 1998 at Peter and Paul Cathedral in St Petersburg with those of her parents and two of her sisters 

Olgas sisters were Grand Duchesses Tatiana Maria and Anastasia She also had a brother Tsarevich Alexei of Russia Olegas title is best translated as Grand Princess This meant that Olega as an Imperial Highness was higher in rank than other Princesses in Europe who were Royal Highnesses Grand Duchess became the most well known translation of the title into English from Russian Olgas friends and family usually called her simply Olga Nikolaevna They also called her Olishka or Olya Queen Victoria was her great grandmother Olega was very close to her sister Tatiana They shared a room dressed similarly and were known as The Big Pair The younger sisters Maria and Anastasia were known as The Little Pair

Olega was known for her compassion and kindness from when she was young But she also had a quick temper and often spoke what she thought plainly Once when she was a small child she became impatient while posing for a portrait painter and told him You are a very ugly man and I dont like you one bit Pierre Gilliard her French teacher said that when he first saw Olga when she was 10 years old she was very fair and with sparkling mischievous eyes She examined me with a look which seemed from the first moment to be searching for the weak point in my armor but there was something so pure and frank about the child that one liked her straight off

The Tsars children lived very simply They slept on hard camp cots without pillows when they were healthy This tradition had been started in the rule of Catherine the Great when she first made her grandson Alexander do so They took cold baths in the morning and had to clean their rooms and do needlework Most people living with them including servants usually called the Grand Duchess by her first name Olega Nikolaevna instead of her title or Her Imperial Highness However once on a visit to a museum where state carriages were displayed Olga ordered one of the servants to prepare the largest and most beautiful carriage for her daily drive She was not obeyed She also felt oldest children should be respected When she was told the Biblical story of Joseph she felt sorry for the older brothers instead of Joseph She also sympathized with Goliath rather than David in the story of David and Goliath Olga loved reading Unlike her sisters she also liked school work Pierre Gilliard said that Olga had a very quick brain with good reasoning powers and a very independent manner and a gift for swift and entertaining repartee She enjoyed reading about politics in newspapers Olga also liked choosing books from what her mother read When she was found reading a book before her mother had read it Olga joked that her mother must wait until Olga had made sure that it was a proper book for her to read

Physical compression means that a material under compressive stress reduces its volume

There are different uses of compression in physics and engineering By compression it is possible to measure mechanical properties of materiels such as compressive strength or modulus of elasticity Scientists do this with press machines

Compression is also used in engines for example in the Diesel engine as in any internal combustion engine and in the steam engine 

Compressive strength measures the pushing force that one needs to break a material 

When the limit of compressive strength is reached materials are crushed Concrete can be made to have high compressive strength eg many concrete floors have compressive strength of 3000 psi

Strength of materials is important for the study of engineering materials and their mechanical behavior in general 

Strength is considered in terms of compressive strength tensile strength and shear strength namely the limit states of compressive stress tensile stress and shear stress are looked at

Cremation is the act of burning a body after it has died Cremation is a popular option to dispose of a body instead of burying it The place where cremations take place is called a crematorium or crematory

Cremated remains are returned to the persons family The family then has a few options of what to do with the remains Sometimes the cremated person has thought about what they want to be done with their remains and have shared their desires with their family

Cremated remains can be kept in a container called an urn thrown into the air or water of a place that was special to the cremated person or buried in the ground These are the most popular choices of what to do with remains There are also other less common options of how to dispose of the remains Some examples of ways to scatter the remains are through fireworks shot from guns or dropped from an airplane or hot air balloon Remains can even be sent into space or turned into a diamond The latter can be done because humans and diamonds are both made largely from carbon

A blessing is way to wish good luck for a person Sometimes in religious rituals it is said the God blesses those who are good or people can bless God In Judaism they bless God over wine The priests can also bless religious objects in order to make them become holy

The saying bless you is commonly used when someone sneezes This is done because there is a tradition carried by the superstition that a persons soul will come out of their mouth and nose if they sneezefactdateJanuary 2010 People believed that saying God bless you or bless you for short would make the soul go back inside They are wishing the person good luck so that their soul is able to come back 

People also think that if unusual good luck or a miracle comes to them it is a blessing For example if some people wanted a child badly but are having difficulty conceiving it could be considered a blessing from God if they end up having a child

To give your blessing to someone is to give permission to them For example a man can ask his girlfriends parents for their blessing before he asks her to marry him

Blessings are often thought of as the opposite of a curse

The Third Servile War also called the Gladiator War and The War of Spartacus by Plutarch was the last of several unsuccessful slave rebellions against the Roman Republic 

These are called the Servile Wars The Third Servile War was the only which was dangerous for Italia itself and was doubly alarming to the Roman people because the slaves won several battles against the Roman army between 73 and 71 BC The rebellion was defeated 71 BC by Marcus Licinius Crassus 

But the rebellion had indirect effects on Roman politics during the following years

A vibration in a string is a wave A vibrating string mostly produces a sound with constant frequency As frequency characterizes the pitch the sound produced is a constant note

Vibrating strings are the basis of any string instrument like guitar cello or piano

In physics the angular momentum of an object rotating about some reference point is the measure of the extent to which the object will continue to rotate about that point when acted upon by an external torque

In particular if a point mass rotates about an axis then the angular momentum with respect to a point on the axis is related to the mass of the object the velocity and the distance of the mass to the axis

Angular momentum is important in physics because it is a conserved quantity a systems angular momentum stays constant unless an external torque acts on it Torque is the rate at which angular momentum is transferred in or out of the system When a rigid body rotates its resistance to a change in its rotational motion is measured by its moment of inertia

The equation for torque is

 r x F 

where F is the force vector and r is the vector from the axis of rotation to the point where the force is acting 

Angular momentum is an important concept in both physics and engineering with numerous applications For example the kinetic energy stored in a massive rotating object such as a flywheel is proportional to the square of the angular momentum

Conservation of angular momentum also explains many phenomena in nature

An axle is a central shaft for a rotating wheel or gear In some cases the axle may be fixed in position with a bearing or bushing sitting inside the hole in the wheel or gear to allow the wheel or gear to rotate around the axle In other cases the wheel or gear may be fixed to the axle with bearings or bushings provided at the mounting points where the axle is supported Sometimes especially on bicycles the latter type is referred to as a spindle

Axles are an important structural component of a wheeled vehicle The axles maintain the position of the wheels relative to each other and to the vehicle body Since for most vehicles the wheels are the only part touching the ground the axles must bear the weight of the vehicle plus any cargo

Gears are mechanical parts with cut teeth designed to fit with teeth on another part so as to transmit or receive force and motion Gears are also sometimes called toothed wheels or cogged wheels or cogs The cut teeth are also sometimes called cogs

Numerous nonferrous alloys cast irons powder metallurgy and even plastics are used in the manufacture of gears However steels are most commonly used because of their high strength to weight ratio and low cost

Gear is a toothed wheel designed to transmit torque to another gear or toothed component

Gear could also mean

GEAR may refer to

The gear shift is the part of the gearbox which has the shift forks and allows the contact from the driver to the synchronisation 

Most of the time they are so much like the gear counter plus the reverse gear And they make it possible to choose the gear and to switch this in or out The invention of the gear shift is attributed to Karl Benz 

In mechanics a transmission or gearbox means gears working together The most common transmission is the transmission in a car 

In a car the engine makes the crankshaft spin The crankshaft makes the transmissions gears spin which spin some more parts which make the wheels spin But the wheels do not spin as fast as the engine makes the crankshaft spin That is because the gears are made to slow down the spinning The gears also give the spinning more force so the wheels can make the entire car move

A transmission has some gears that change the torque more than other gears That is why a transmission has a first gear second gear third gear and sometimes more gears There is also a reverse gear and neutral An automatic transmission shifts between gears by itself A manual transmission needs the driver to decide when to shift gears Manual transmission is also called standard transmission This is confusing because almost all cars in the US have automatic transmission In other words standard transmission is unusual in the US not standard

Not all transmissions are in cars For example bicycles have transmissions You can see the gears so it is easier to see how it works

Hydraulics is a topic of science and engineering subject dealing with the mechanical properties of liquids 

One of the founders of modern hydraulics was Benedetto Castelli a student of Galileo Galilei

Fluid mechanics provides the theoretical foundation for hydraulics which focuses on the engineering uses of fluid properties

A good that cannot be used by consumers directly such as an office building or capital equipment can be called a good because it can be useful if it is sold A good in economic usage does not necessarily mean that the object is good in a moral sense 

If an object or service is sold for a positive price then it is a good since the purchaser considers the utility of the object or service more valuable than the money Some things are useful but not scarce such as air and are referred to as free goods 

In macroeconomics and accounting a good is contrasted with a service A good here is defined as a physical product that one can deliver to a buyer The service is not an object but an action that benefits someone A more general term that preserves the distinction between goods and services is commodities In microeconomicss good is often used in this more inclusive sense of a commodity

In addition to the mustards the genus Brassica also includes cabbages cauliflower rapeseed and turnips

There has been recent research into varieties of mustards that have a high oil content for use in the production of biodiesel a renewable liquid fuel similar to diesel fuel The biodiesel made from mustard oil has good cold flow properties and cetane ratings The leftover meal after pressing out the oil has also been found to be an effective pesticide 

An interesting genetic relationship between many species of mustard have been observed

The mustard plant is in no way related to mustard gas an agent for chemical warfare

Sulfur mustard is a chemical compound It can be used for chemical warfare Most sulfur mustards are squishy liquids with no color and no smell when they are at room temperature When used in warfare they have a color yellowish to brown Some of them smell like culinary mustard horseradish or garlic They got their name from the smell but are completely unrelated to culinary mustard

The Law of supply and demand describes how prices are related to the number of things made available and the number of things people want 

If the demand goes up or the supply goes down then the price will go up This happens because the suppliers will raise the price when running out of items to earn as much money as possible since people are willing to pay more

If the demand goes down or the supply goes up then the price will go down This happens because the suppliers would rather lower the price than have many unsold items Usually there are multiple suppliers of the same item The buyers will buy more from the supplier with the lowest price The suppliers will lower the price so people will buy from them instead of from another supplier

Sometimes there is only one supplier When this happens the supplier chooses the price and the demand only determines how much is bought The supplier will probably raise the price very high as long as people are still willing to buy at that price

Racial segregation is the term used to describe the separation of people based on race This has been encouraged in many countries and made law in others For example the United States of America segregated African Americans and European Americans for many years In South Africa native Africans and European settlers were divided as well

When the United States of America was founded in the 1700s slaves from Africa were used to work the land In 1804 most of the Northern states of America banned slavery and wished the Southern states to do the same However the Southern states believed that slavery was right and part of their life it was something they did not want to give up The Southern states tried to leave America and the American Civil War began President Abraham Lincoln led the North to victory over the South and in 1865 slavery was banned throughout the whole country

There was still much racism and African Americans were not treated fairly There were many laws that kept them working in hard jobs for little money and laws that prevented them from marrying European Americans Slavery had ended but segregation had not Black Americans were not allowed to attend the same schools as white Americans but had to attend black only schools they were not allowed on the same buses but had to ride on black only buses they were not allowed to eat in the same restaurants or shop at the same stores as white Americans There were black and white parts of towns and cities It was not until the 1950s and 1960s that things began to change A man named Martin Luther King Jr began to rally for equal rights for blacks He led many African Americans on marches to protest the way they were treated He was killed in 1968 but four years earlier he convinced the government to allow black Americans to vote in the presidential elections In the law case Brown v Board of Education the government went on to force integration in high schools throughout the United States making it illegal to have white only schools For a while armed police officers had to escort black students into formerly white only schools and it took many years for the schooling system to change It took many more decades to get rid of all the racist laws

Nagamaki is a Japanese pole weapon with a large and heavy blade It is very much like a glaive It was introduced and used primarily during the Kamakura Nanbokucho and early Muromachi periods It was a long sword with 2 4 feet blade and a handle with 2 3 feet length The blade was single edged It was also sharpened along the back edge to reduce its weight It reminds a traditional naginata but the main difference was that the handle of the nagamaki was not constructed of wood it was made more like a katana handle Even the name nagamaki is given by the tradition of handle wrapping The word nagamaki means long wrapping The nagamaki handle was wrapped with cords in criss crossed manner very similar to the wrapping that is made on katana The nagamaki is considered to be a type of the no dachi sword This one was a variation of long samurai sword 

The way to hold nagamaki was also very specific It was held with the two hands in a fixed position in the same way a katana sword is held Unlike the naginata the hands did not change when handling the weapon and the right hand was always the closest to the blade While handling nagamaki not too many sliding actions on the handle were performed as it was in naginatas case where you use the entire length of the shaft The nagamaki was not spread and developed until much later like the naginata sword During the middle of the Muromachi period it reached its peak of usage The nagamaki is considered the favored weapon of General Oda Nobunaga

The nagamaki is designed for large sweeping and slicing strokes It also works as a spear Traditionally it was used as infantry weapon Warriors used the weapon against horsemen Still it required more time and materials to create a nagamaki than a spears or a naginata sword this is why it was not so widely spread The closest exemplar of real nagamaki you can see today is nagamaki naoshi It appears to be like a long katana shaped halberd but straighter and thinner with a very long tsuka In contrast to it naginata is shorter wider and more curved to the tip 

Naginata is a Japanese bladed weapon with a long shaft The weapon looks like a pole and is often mistaken with one The word naginata means mowing down sword or reaping sword The length of the blade varies from 1 to 3 feet The blades shape describes a leaf being more curved to the point The naginatas blade is mounted directly to a long wooden shaft its length ranges between 6 and 9 feet The part that goes inside the handle is almost as long as the blade itself This assures a perfect fixture of the blade The shaft is equipped with a sharp end cap or ishizuki which serves for piercing between the plates of armor

Historically the facts indicate that naginata have been used in China beginning with 3 BC First source it was mentioned in was the Kojiki Then it is represented in the paintings of battlefield scenes made during the Tengyo no Ran in 936 AD The sword was utilized and refined during the Nara period and by the 11th century it was widely used in battles 

The naginata was also used by warrior monks for temples defense against invaders Around the 1400s AD this weapon was no more used by monks because the temples were no longer a target The samurai used the naginata only when fighting against numerous enemies or on horseback 

Still naginata was most commonly used when the samurai was too young to handle a full length katana and when he was mostly an archer By the Edo period the naginata was no more used in combat It became the representative weapon of samurai women They engaged in trainings for self defense and defense of their children and for virtue development Moreover the fashion developed further and there appeared samurai families which displayed naginata in prominent places of their houses Later the naginata was even given as present to the bride 

There are three main theories of naginata appearance as a weapon One of the most spread is the supposition that naginata evolved from a farming tool used for chopping The tools were made as long staffs with sharp stones attached to one of the ends The tool was used in the 3rd century BC Later the stones were replaced with metal pieces Thus when the crops and lands of the farmers were under attack they defended it with their farming tools which proved to be effective weapons and later were refined 

The Chinese theory is based on the idea that Chinese halberds were brought to Japan during early migrations Most of the weaponry experts believe that even if the Chinese invented the weapon it was refined and developed by the Japanese

Another theory says that the naginata evolved directly as a weapon The blade of naginata ancestors was made of bronze Later the discovery of steel made it even more effective This theory affirms that naginata development far later than the appearance of metal in Japan from the Asian continents

The naginata was meant for foot soldiers use whereas the military elite used the katana sword There are evidences that naginata was also used by the Sohei 

The naginata was also considered a womens weapon It gave considerable advantage because of the long shaft keeping the enemy at a safe distance One of the most famous Japanese women warriors was Itagaki Her naginata skills overwhelmed even the most trained samurai During the Edo period Japanese women were thought to handle the naginata by the age of 18 

The naginata was also considered an effective weapon against horsemen The way naginata was handled required specific motions because of its length Usually it was sweeping and circular motion because it was inconvenient to use striking methods like with a traditional sword In order to fully utilize the naginata it requires the handler to rapidly shift hand positions along the length of the shaft 

This weapon was especially functional in cavalry battles acting like medieval spears running Infantry used the naginata to cut the horses legs After this the disoriented rider was easily killed 

Naginata is also known as a Japanese martial art performed by men women and children The roots of this fighting technique come for over 1000 years ago This martial art has as its centerpiece a Japanese sword  Naginata The weapon reminds a pole and is very efficient against riders as well as against foot soldiers The sword is very well balanced and weighted which makes it possible for women and children to handle it The naginata way of fighting is very graceful due to circular performance of the naginata sword 

Today Naginata is a combat system that teaches respect patience etiquette self confidence and self control The practice of Naginata educates perfect control and balanced movements of the body When into this art discipline and concentration are needed to reach the grace and effectiveness of the movements Moreover it establishes persons character by developing a moral code based on honor

The modern naginata has changed its shape during history Now it is more like a European halberd or glaive The blade looks more like a scimitar moreso rather than of a wakizashi Naginata went through the influence of westernization after the Meiji Restoration when the value of martial arts dropped and survived till the Showa period when naginata became a part of the public school system 

Different styles of naginata handling were developed creating world known schools The Atarashii Naginata School and Jikishin kage ryu are the most popular There are also known schools like Tendo ryu and Toda Ha Buko ryu Despite the differences between these schools Naginata martial art has at its base the art of wielding one of the most original weapons and the goal of developing traditional etiquette and spiritual training of a person

In chemistry a silicate is a compound consisting of one or more central silicon atoms that are surrounded by electronegative ligands 

The most common silicate species consist of silicon with oxygen as the ligand Silicate anions with a negative net electrical charge must have that charge balanced by other cations to make an electrically neutral compound

In geology and astronomy the term silicate is used to denote types of rock that consist predominantly of silicate minerals 

On Earth a wide variety of silicate minerals occur in an even wider range of combinations as a result of the processes that form and re work the crust These processes include partial melting crystallization fractionation metamorphism weathering and diagenesis Living things also contribute to the silicate cycle near the Earths surface A type of plankton known as diatoms construct their exoskeletons known as tests from silica The tests of dead diatoms are a major constituent of deep ocean sediment

Gamma rays are electromagnetic waves with the smallest wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum They were discovered in 1900 by Paul Villard and named in 1903 by Ernest Rutherford

Gamma rays are produced by some types of radioactive atoms Gamma rays are like x rays Both gamma rays and x rays are photons with very high energies Gamma rays are also a type of radiation Gamma rays can travel through thick materials 

Cobalt 60 and potassium 40 are two isotopes that emit gamma rays Cobalt 60 is created in accelerators and is used in hospitals Potassium 40 occurs naturally Small amounts of potassium 40 are in all plants and animals Gamma rays from potassium 40 each have an energy of 1460 thousand electron volts 

Gamma rays and X rays are now usually distinguished by their origin X rays are emitted by electrons outside the nucleus while gamma rays are emitted by the nucleus 

Gamma rays can also go through the skin to kill cells such as cancerous cells Doctors can use machines which produce gamma rays in hospitals to treat people with some types of cancer  

Doctors also use gamma rays to find disease In hospitals doctors can give patients radioactive medicine which emits gamma rays Doctors can find some types of disease by measuring gamma rays which come from a patient afterward You can also use Gamma Rays to clean Hospital material

The Servile Wars were a series of three slave revolts in the late Roman Republic See

Mestrius Plutarchus better known in English as Plutarch was a Greek historian writer of biographies and essays 

Plutarch was born to a prominent family in Chaeronea Boeotia Greece a town about twenty miles east of Delphi His work consists of the Parallel Lives and the Moralia

Marcus Licinius Crassus was a Roman general and politician

He commanded the left wing of Sullas army at the Battle of the Colline Gate It was he who finally suppressed the slave revolt led by Spartacus The Third Servile War began with three defeats of Roman armies against Spartacus and his followers The revolt was finally destroyed by the concentrated military effort of a single commander Marcus Licinius Crassus

The last stage of his career was as a triumvir one of the First Triumvirate with Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus and Gaius Julius Caesar One of the richest men of the era he was killed after a defeat at the Battle of Carrhae His death led to the civil wars between Julius Caesar and Pompey the other two triumvirs

When Crassus formed his army in addition to six new legions he was given other legions which had been beaten by Spartacus He decimated them This was the brutal method of executing one man in ten to encourage the others to fight harder Each group of ten men drew lots to decide who would die This punishment had not been used since the early days of Rome

Crassuss punishment of Spartacuss surviving men was just as brutal They were crucified

Crassus arranged to govern the Roman province of Syria with the transparent intention of going to war with Parthia In fact he set out on a war against Parthia using his own money and without the Senates official approval

After being informed of the presence of the Parthian army Crassus panicked His general Cassius recommended that the army be deployed in the traditional Roman fashion with infantry forming the center and cavalry on the wings At first Crassus agreed but he soon changed his mind and redeployed his men into a hollow square each side formed by twelve cohorts This formation would protect his forces from being outflanked but at the cost of mobility 

The day went badly for the Romans who were repeatedly outflanked by the Parthian cavalry The next day they received a message offering to negotiate with Crassus A truce was proposed allowing the Roman army to return to Syria safely in exchange for Rome giving up all territory east of the Euphrates Crassus was reluctant to meet with the Parthians but his troops threatened to mutiny if he did not At the meeting a Parthian pulled at Crassus reins sparking violence Crassus and his generals were murdered After his death the Parthians allegedly poured molten gold down his throat in a symbolic gesture mocking Crassus renowned greed The remaining Romans at Carrhae attempted to flee but most were captured or killed Roman casualties amounted to about 20000 killed and 10000 captured making the battle one of the costliest defeats in Roman history Parthian casualties were minimal

Anton Rubinstein was a Russian pianist and composer Rubinstein and Franz Liszt were thought to be the greatest pianists of the 19th century He was very important as a teacher and influenced many Russian musicians He composed lots of music although hardly any of it is heard nowadays As a composer he is best remembered today by a little piece of piano music called Melody in F

Rubinstein gave his first piano concert when he was ten Between 1840 and 1843 his piano teacher took him on long concert tours of Europe He met Chopin and Liszt and was received in London by Queen Victoria  Between 1844 and 1846 the family lived in Berlin His friends there included Mendelssohn and Meyerbeer 

In 1846 his father died and Anton went to Vienna where he gave piano lessons to try to earn some money When he returned to Russia in 1848 the tsars sister in law let him live in her palace He played for lots of parties Often the tsar came

In 1854 he toured Europe again Then he returned to Russia He wanted to improve music education in Russia so he started the Russian Musical Society and then he started the St Petersburg Conservatory During his long career he spent many years as director of the Conservatory as well as conducting concerts

He wrote a lot of music but although his compositions often started off with good ideas they often become rather boring His opera Tom the fool was not a success He was annoyed and wrote an article in a music magazine saying that it was not possible to write operas using Russian stories He criticized several composers who were writing music which used Russian folktunes This included the composer Mily Balakirev and his friends who were called The Mighty Handful He said that they had not learned how to compose properly

The main hero characters are InuYasha Inuyasha is the protagonist of the series He is a half demon His father was a great demon general and the ruler of the western lands his mother was a human princess who went against social standards and bore a demons child His father died the day he was born protecting his mother and his mother later dies when he is a small child He uses a weapon called the Tetsusaiga which is a sword made from his fathers fang it can kill a hundred demons in a single swing On the new moon his demon blood wanes and he becomes human for one night 

Fifty years before the start of the anime Inuyasha meets a priestess by the name of Kikyo while searching for the legendary Shikon no Toma He wants to use the jewel to become a full demon so he can become strong Kikyo is the keeper of the jewel and a fair match for Inuyasha he is never able to get the jewel from her The two form a strange relationship with each other because they are both outcasts because of their individual lots in life They fall in love with each other and Kikyo ask Inuyasha to become a human for two reasons First so she and Inuyasha can be together unhindered by social constraints and second because she believes it will purify the Shikon no Toma ending her obligation to protect the jewel Inuyasha reluctantly agrees because he wants to live a normal life

Unfortunately or fortunately depending on how you look at it a demon named Naraku foils their plan turning them against each other He first attacks Kikyo using Inuyasha image and then attacks Inuyasha using Kikyos image Inuyasha thinking Kikyo has betrayed him steals the jewel and flees the village Kikyo thinking Inuyasha has betrayed her follows him and pins him to Goshinbock using a sealing arrow She dies soon after 

Fifty years later Inuyasha awakens on the tree to the sight of Kagome Kikyos reincarnation Together they hunt for the Shikon no Toma shards after Kagome shatters the jewel At first Inuyasha hates Kagome because of her resemblance to Kikyo but eventually grows to love her very deeply Slowly Kagome teaches him to embrace his heritage and slowly heals the wounds that have been inflicted on his heart by Kikyo Naraku and the hardness of his life At the end of the anime he makes this very clear when he announces that Kagome was born to heal him and he was born to protect Kagome

At the end of the anime Inuyasha is shown to have grown into a very wise character He is no longer angry and jealous but instead wise and understanding because of all that Kagome has taught him This is especially seen when he decides to let Kagome go back to her own time instead of staying with him because he knows that Kagomes family needs her more than he does although this decision seems to greatly depress him 

Three years later after graduating from high school Kagomes longing to be with Inuyasha causes the well to open once again and she is allowed to return to the past permanently In the last scene of the anime it is implied that her and Inuyasha marry when she calls Sesshoumaru her brother in law

Kagome Higurashi is the narrator and the second protagonist of the series She is often believed to be the protagonist because she is the narrator throughout most episodes and in the movies Kagome is a fifteen year old middle school student who lives in the Sunset shrine in 20th century Tokyo Japan

On her fifteenth birthday Kagome is dragged down her families well by a demon after attempting to rescue the family cat She arrives in 15th century Japan soon after At this time she sees Inuyasha for the first time pinned to Goshinbock Upon seeing him she tweaks his ears only to find herself surrounded by angry villagers who are scared by her strange modern clothes They take her to Kaede the village Miko Kaede upon seeing Kagome realizes that Kagome is the reincarnation of her older sister Kikyo the original protector of the Shikon no Toma Shortly after Mistress Centipede attacks the village Kagome knows that the demon is after her and decides to flea so the demon will leave the innocent villagers alone She ends up at Goshinbock where Inuyasha has awakened 

At this time one of the most iconic moments of the anime happens Inuyasha who does not realize he has been on the tree for fifty years calls Kagome Kikyo and insults her Kagome retaliates by yelling at him and explaining that her name is KA GO ME Mistress Centipede reaches them and grabs Kagome at the hip ripping the Shikon no Toma from her side before she wraps herself around the tree crushing Kagome to Inuyasha Inuyasha convinces Kagome to remove the arrow from his chest so he can kill the demon Kagome obeys and he is freed He kills the demon and then turns on Kagome wanting the jewel for himself Kaede seeing the problem decides to put a rosary around Inuyashas neck She says a prayer that casts the rosary out and it goes around Inuyasha neck and only Kagome can remove She then tells Kagome to say a command word the only word Kagome can think of it sit because he looks like a dog Upon saying the word Inuyasha is slammed into the ground and the greatest love hate relationship ever is born

Kagome learns that Inuyasha wants the jewel to become a full demon Unfortunantly Kagome in her clumsy nature shatters the jewel only an episode later and it is decided that she and Inuyasha will team up to find the Shikon Shards for two reasons First because she is the only one who can see them and second because she needs someone strong to protect her during the process This causes Kagome to lead a double life Shard detector in the past and middle school student in the present 

Throughout the anime Inuyasha and Kagome met many people demon half demon and human They make many friends and learn much in the process getting closer with each episode By the end of the anime Inuyasha and Kagome are very much in love with one another despite many road blocks such as Kikyo Kagomes incarnation and Inuyashas first love being brought back to life Kikyo eventually returns to the after life and Inuyasha is free to love Kagome completely

At the end of the series Inuyasha and Kagome are separated after Naraku is defeated Inuyasha staying in the past and Kagome returning to her own time Three years pass in which Kagome attends and graduates from High School After her graduation she returns to the well in her families shrine and wishes to see Inuyasha again The well opens and with her mothers blessing she returns to the past and she returns to Inuyasha permanently 

Although it is not officially said it is implied that Inuyasha and Kagome are married in the very last scene of the anime when Kagome looks at Sesshoumaru and plainly calls him her brother in law

Miroku is the second character to join Inuyasha and Kagome in the quest to defeat Naraku and purify the Shikon no Tama He is a monk who has an unhealthy habit of groping women especially Sango another predominant character in the anime Miroku carries on a curse that was originally placed on his grandfather by the demon Naraku The curse itself looks like a black void located in the palm of his hand In the English version it is called the Wind Tunnel or Air Void and can suck anything inside of it making it Mirokus greatest weapon but also his greatest threat One day the Wind Tunnel will suck Miroku into it as well as it did to his father and his grandfather 

Because of this Miroku needs a male heir to carry on his family name should he die Therefore he is always asking women to bear his child in hopes of gaining this male heir This becomes a chronic joke in the anime almost always ending with Miroku groping a girl asking said girl to bear his child and then getting slapped hard in the face by said girl As the anime progresses Miroku becomes a much deeper character and is shown to be a man longing for love and a family which he eventually finds in Sango after the defeat of Naraku At this time Miroku and Sango marry and have three children twin girls and a boy

Sango is the third and last character to join Inuyasha and Kagome in the quest to defeat Naraku and purify the Shikon no Toma She is a demon slayer or a yokai tajiya as she is dubbed in the Japanese version of the anime At one time she lived with her father and brother in a demon exterminator village This particular village is also the location of the Shikon no Tomas birth and it is suggested that Sangos Grandfather was the one who entrusted the jewel to Kikyo fifty years ago

In episode 24 Sango first encounters Naraku on a mission to exterminate a demon at a near by Castle Her brother Kohaku is sent to help her defeat the demon Naraku disguised as the Castles Lord takes control of the young and vulnerable Kohaku and uses him to kill all of the demon exterminators and his sister Sango He nearly succeeds but comes back to his senses Naraku then orders the Castle guards to kill the pair They are both shot in the back with arrows Sango manages to live but is badly hurt and under the impression that her brother has died as well as her whole family Meanwhile Naraku destroys Sangos village and disguised as the Lord of the Castle tells her that Inuyasha was the one who attacked it and killed her family Even though she is badly injured Sango wants revenge and decides to go after Inuyasha just as Naraku had planed she would

Upon fighting Inuyasha however Sango learns that he is not bad just because he is a demon and that he did not in fact kill the people of her village Inuyasha in his blunt and rash way helps her to heal and convinces her to live to defeat Naraku She then swears revenge on Naraku and decides to join the group along with her pet cat demon Kirara Eventually she finds out Kohaku is alive but under the control of Naraku She vows to get her brother back and spends the majority of the anime trying to save him often not succeeding but living with the support of the group 

By the end she saves Kohaku and marries Miroku her love interest throughout the anime They have three children twin girls and a boy

Shippo is the first character to join Inuyasha and Kagome in the quest to defeat Naraku and purify the Shikon no Toma He is an adolescent fox demon or kitsune youkai as he is refereed to in the Japanese version of the anime Although Shippos age is never mentioned he appears approximately five years old 

He meets Kagome and Inuyasha when he attempts to steal their Shikon Shards with a fox illusion that Inuyasha easily sees through Shippo explains to them that his mother and father are dead his father having been very recently killed by the Thunder Brothers Hiten and Manten Hiten the older of the Thunder Brothers possesses Shikon shards Therefore Shippo believes that in order to get revenge he needs Shikon Shards of his own so he can be strong Eventually Shippo succeeds in stealing the Shikon shards by tricking Inuyasha Inadvertently this causes Kagome to be kidnapped soon after by the Thunder Brothers which in turn causes Inuyasha to come save them Inuyasha eventually beats the Thunder Brothers gaining their Shikon Shards in the process and begrudgingly allows Shippo into the group 

Kagome treats him with motherly affection and often brings him crayons and candy from her time as well as allowing him to bath with her and sleep with her Inuyasha treats him badly most of the time claiming the small child annoying Many fans see this as a sign of jealousy because Inuyasha does not like the attention Kagome pays to Shippo instead of himself The other central characters all seem to treat Shippo as a son or younger brother often teaching him life lessons or coddling him

Kirara is Sangos pet cat demon or neko yokai as she is referred to in the Japanese version She appears to be a small almost kitten sized cat the majority of the time but when provoked or ready for battle she transforms into a very large lion sized cat She is a very loyal demon who was originally owned by Midoriko the creator of the Shikon no Toma

She is exceptionally clever and is much more intelligent than a simple cat She is an asset in battle because of her ability to fly It is sometimes implied that Inuyasha can understand Kirara to a degree although the creator of the anime does not seem to spend much time explaining demons ability to connect with animals Although it is shown that Sesshoumaru Inuyashas older brother can in fact talk to dogs and Kouga a wolf demon in the series can in fact talk to wolves their respective animal counterparts 

Kirara and Shippo seem to have a strong connection perhaps because they are of a very similar size Oftentimes the two are shown together and when Shippo is not sleeping with Kagome he is usually seen with Kirara

Naraku is the main antagonist of the series He is an evil demon made by Onigumo who loved Kikyo When Onigumo became jealous of Inuyasha he made many demons led by a spider demon come to him with his impure mind of jealousy This is because demons like bad minds The spider demon tells Onigumo that if Onigumo wants revenge on Inuyasha he has to let the demons eat his soul and join with him to fight off Inuyasha When Onigumo agrees Naraku is created Naraku has a heart made out of Onigumos soul which still loves Kikyo But Naraku is evil because many demons joined him just like the demons made by Midorikos lover and kills Kikyo while pretending to be Inuyasha This is so that Kikyo would think the real Inuyasha killed her Naraku did this to get the shikon no tama for himself and did not want Kikyo to hand it to Inuyasha 

Kikyo seals Inuyasha because of this when Inuyasha runs away with the shikon no tama because Naraku also turned into Kikyo to say things to hurt Inuyasha who thought it was the real Kikyo Thinking that Kikyo would not give him the shikon no tama as promised he steals it Kikyo thinks then that Inuyasha is betraying her so she shoots an arrow at him 

Nobody knows about Naraku until episode 15 where Miroku tells Inuyasha and Kagome about a demon who gave a curse called Wind Tunnel on him Naraku really gave the curse to Mirokus grandfather who thought Naraku was a real woman since Naraku turned into a woman to fool the grandfather The curse has to go on until they win against Naraku This is how Miroku joins in

Naraku an evil demon made by Onigumo loved Kikyo and was jealous of InuYasha Naraku could change his shape into different people He wanted the jewel that Kikyo had the Shikon no Tama The jewel would free him from Onigumos orders telling him not to kill Kikyo In the beginning of story Naraku turned into Inuyasha and talked to Kikyo Next he turned Kikyo and talked to InuYasha He said things that hurt them He did this to make them hate each other Kikyo nearly died because Naraku turned into Inuyasha and attacked her 

Urasue a doll maker made a clay doll that looked just like Kikyo She made it to give Kikyo half the soul of Kagome Kikyos reincarnation Kikyo and the doll are the same people so the doll Kikyo would have the same soul Kikyo killed Urasue and ran away from Kagome She had found out that Kagome would control the soul inside her so that it might go back inside Kagome She hates Inuyasha too because before she died she hated him She became jealous of Kagome because of Inuyasha liking both her and Kikyo but she got over it soon Kagome was still jealous of Kikyo  even though they are the same person

Only in the manga Kikyo dies because she did not go well on destroying Naraku She tried to kill him by using her arrows to purify the finished whole Shikon no Tama when it was with Naraku because Naraku could not win over pure things and the jewel when it was complete would be make the purity even more powerful with its own power Kikyo hoped that the side of Narakus soul would win over the evil demons souls inside the jewel but Naraku was too strong for the goodness He attacked Kikyo with his badness because he did not have a heart that loved her any more and Kikyos messed up goodness of her heart made her spiritual powers go away This is why she died 

This episode ends with Kikyo dying after Inuyasha kisses her She wishes that Kagome would not cry because she is happy since her soul can rest from living a doll like life But Kagome does cry Sango is also sad because she knew that Kikyo cared for Kohaku her brother and would do anything if she could not kill him

Kohaku is alive even so because Naraku uses a piece from the Shikon no Tama on his back The jewels power made him alive again But all his memories are gone and he can only listen to whatever Naraku tells him to do He also does not remember Sango who is happy to see that he is alive But Sango is sad to find his brother killing more people because of Naraku ordering him to Sangos new aim is to also save Kohaku from Narakus control

One day a human who loved her was jealous just like Onigumo He made demons eat his soul so that they could all join together But the number of demons were so much that the human lost his love and the demons were able to fight Midoriko without any struggle Because there were so many of them joined together with so much impurity even with Midorikos own power of goodness and purity they could easily win over Midoriko But when they were about to eat her she tore out her own 4 pure souls and joined it with the demons bad soul This made the demons die and made the Shikon no Tama But Midoriko also died because of this together with the demons

In anthropology bands are the tiniest societies consisting typically of 5 80 people most or all of them close relatives by birth or by marriage In effect a band is an extended family or several related extended families Today autonomous bands are almost confined to the most remote parts of New Guinea and Amazonia but there were many others that have only recently fallen under state control or been assimilated or exterminated They include many or most African Pygmies southern African San hunter gatherers Aboriginal Australians Eskimos and Native Americans of some resource poor areas of the Americas such as Tierra del Fuego and the northern boreal forests all these modern bands are or were nomadic hunter gatherers rather than settled food producers Until at least 40000 years ago probably all humans lived in bands and most still did as recently as 11000 years ago 

Bands have no permanent single base of residence instead land is used jointly by the whole group as opposed to being partitioned among subgroups or individuals There is no regular economic specialization except by age and sex all able bodied individuals forage for food There are no formal institutions such as laws police and treaties to resolve conflicts within and between bands Organization is often described as egalitarian in the sense that there is no formalized social stratification into upper and lower classes no formalized or hereditary leadership and no formalized monopolies of information and decision making However this definition of egalitarian should not be taken to mean that there is equality in prestige and the decision making process among band members Instead leadership should of thought of as informal and acquired through qualities such as personality strength intelligence and fighting skills

Our closest biological relatives the gorillas and chimpanzees and bonobos of Africa also live in bands All humans presumably did so too until improved technology for extracting food allowed some hunter gatherers to settle in permanent dwellings in some resource rich areas The band is the political economic and social organization that we inherited from our millions of years of evolutionary history Our developments beyond it took place within the last few tens of thousands of years

Data mining is a term from computer science Sometimes it is also called knowledge discovery in databases Data mining is about finding new information in a lot of data The information obtained from data mining is hopefully both new and useful 

In many cases data is stored so it can be used later The data is saved with a goal For example a store wants to save what has been bought They want to do this to know how much they should buy themselves to have enough to sell later Saving this information makes a lot of data The data is usually saved in a database The reason why data is saved is called the first use 

Later the same data can also be used to get other information that was not needed for the first use The store might want to know now what kind of things people buy together when they buy at the store That kind of information is in the data and is useful but was not the reason why the data was saved This information is new and can be useful It is a second use for the same data 

Finding new information that can also be useful from data is called data mining 

For data there a lot of different kinds of data mining for getting new information Usually prediction is involved There is uncertainity in the predicted results The following is based on the observation that there is a small green apple Some of the kinds of data mining are 

Japanese schools of sword making can be divided into two categories by the provinces where they were developed and by the masters who created a specific tradition of sword making

The late Kamakura period is often referred to as the greatest period of sword making in Japanese history The Soshu tradition was one of the dominant traditions Smiths like Kunitsuna and Sukezane combined their knowledge with methods from Yamashiro and Bizen traditions Finally a group of famous sword smiths culminated with Masamune and his school 

The rare swords were made out of five separate pieces and heat treated at high temperatures The swords of the Masamune School were harder than any of the swords made before Masamune trained a group of at least ten followers Two of his students were from the Bizen province In this way during the early 14th century the Masamune school attracted many smiths from other schools Kanemitsu is believed to be the one who created the Soden School which combined Bizen and Soshu techniques 

At the same time Chogi was developing his school The Chogi works show a stronger influence of the Soshu tradition than Kanemitsu swords

There are several famous schools created by sword masters

The Celts were a large group of Caucasian tribes in Europe that first appeared in the Early Iron Age around 1200 BC in Austria They came from the Hallstatt and La Tne cultures Their culture and genes spread through much of Europe and by the time the Greeks and later the Romans started emerging the British Isles and parts of western southern and eastern Europe were Celtic  the most prominent Celtic tribes were located in Gaul The Celts spoke Celtic languages Today the Celtic languages that remain are the Breton Cornish Welsh and Gaelic languages

Celtic society and technology although not as advanced as the Romans was far from being primitive for its time The Celts lived a way of life based on ethical codes and honor codes and had developed a culture of their own full of unique drawings sculptures jewellery folklore and building designs and techniques They were also skilled in blacksmithing farming and diplomacy

Celtic warriors would wear war paint and try to scare their enemies by shouting war cries a lot of tribes had different dress standards for battle some warriors wore chain mail andor leather armor some wore only clothes and some were known to fight fully naked They also had their own type of sword that was very strong and a shield that was very protective When the Roman Republic started expanding the Gauls and the Romans became very hostile towards each other and clashed on many occasions however the Romans were eventually able to defeat them and ended up conquering most of the Celtic tribes in Europe and ruled them until the fall of the Roman Empire Celtic tribes also fought amongst each other After winning a battle the Celts would cut off the heads of their enemies and take them home

During the fall of the Roman Empire most of the old Celtic land ended up being ruled by migrating Germanic tribes and they merged with Romano Celtic stock to eventually form several European nations of today eg France Territories that are still considered Celtic are Ireland Wales Scotland Isle of Man Cornwall and Brittany 

In economics free good means a good that is available without production and therefore not scarce It is available in as much quantity as desired with zero opportunity cost to society 

A good that is made available at zero price is not necessarily a free good For example a shop might give away its stock in its promotion but for the production of these goods resources were needed so this would not be a free good in an economic sense 

There are three main types of free goods 

Intellectual property laws have the effect of converting some goods to scarce goods by law Although these goods are free goods when they have been produced they did require scarce resources such as artistic skill to create them in the first place Thus intellectual property laws such as copyrights and patents are sometimes used to give exclusive rights to the creators of such intellectual property to make sure that people are interested in these activities

Many futurists theorize that advanced nanotechnology with the ability to automatically turn any kind of material into any other combination of equal mass will make all goods essentially free goods since all raw materials and manufacturing time will become perfectly interchangeable

A hoist is a device used for lifting or lowering a load by means of a drum or lift wheel around which rope or chain wraps It may be manually operated electrically or pneumatically driven and may use chain fiber or wire rope as its lifting medium The load is attached to the hoist by means of a lifting hook 

A hoist normally is used for lifting and a winch is normally used for pulling

Construction sites especially for buildings of more than five floors in height often employ hoists to lift workers and building materials

The basic hoist has two important characteristics to define it Lifting medium and power type The lifting medium is either wire rope wrapped around a drum or load chain raised by a gear like wheel The power type can be either electric motor or air motor Both the wire rope hoist and chain hoist have been in common use since the 1800s

Ununquadium is a chemical element It is also named eka lead It has the symbol Uuq It has the atomic number 114 It is a superheavy element Ununquadium is radioactive

Ununquadium does not exist in nature It has to be made It is a synthetic element It is made from a nuclear reaction between plutonium and calcium The reaction that happens is a fusion reaction

The discovery of ununquadium in December 1998 was reported in January 1999 by scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna Russia The same team of scientists made another isotope of Uuq three months later and made it again in in 2004 and 2006

In 2004 in the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research checked it was made by another method They found the final products of radioactive decay 

Ununquadium is a temporary IUPAC systematic element name It is likely to get a new name and symbol in the future

Not enough ununquadium has been made to measure its physical or chemical properties It is thought that it would be a soft dense metal that changes colour in air It may have a low melting point of about 200 C

Ununquadium can be made by bombarding a plutonium 244 target with calcium 48 as a beam of ions

Fate or destiny is the idea that the future is already planned even if people do not know what their fate is Humans in nearly all cultures have had ideas about their fate being predetermined 

People who live unhappy lives may believe that their misery is because of their fate and that they can do nothing about it This is called being fatalistic Other people may believe that they can control their fate by being brave and trying to overcome fate by improving themselves and their lives

In Greek mythology there were three Fates They were three goddesses who determined when every person was going to be born how they would live and when and how they would die Human beings in many cultures had lots of ways in which they would try to read their fate Sometimes they would try to read their fate in the stars In other cultures they might ask a person with powers of magic like a shaman The Ancient Greeks often went to Delphi to ask the oracle

There are lots of references to fate in literature from almost every country and period from Greek tragedy to Shakespeare and Russian literature

Composers may express fate in music Beethoven was thinking about Fate when he wrote his Fifth Symphony and Tchaikovsky when he wrote his Sixth Symphony just before he committed suicide

The Tanto is a Japanese short sword or dagger 

The tantos traditional overall length was 1193 in The blades length was about 5in to 12in Blades that were bigger were called ko wakizashi or small short sword The tantos which varied from the traditional size were called O tanto or Sunobi tanto 

The tanto was a weapon with a single edged blade and a curved shape It was designed for soft targets and was thought to be a hidden weapon of the samurai It was extremely effective in close fighting

The tanto appeared during the Heian Period and developed as a weapon during the Kamakura Period At that time the tanto was not just a weapon but also a work of art It was richly decorated using the most spread styles hira tsukuri and uchi sori Later in the Nambokucho period tantos become longer than 1575 inches Blades become thinner and broader and thus even more dangerous Different styles developed and the shape changed During the Muromachi Period the tanto becomes once more narrow bladed 

By this time the quality of the blade was better It was the time when professional smiths appeared and there were several styles of tanto making The best known smiths were Sukesada and Norimitsu Kanemoto and Kanesada Muramasa and Masashige The beginning of Edo period was a period of relative peace after Japanese unification and although not so many were made they were of good quality The heat treated blades edge becomes more waved and so more beautiful 

A great number of tantos were made in the last 700 to 800 years Some of them were for civil use Others were made especially for samurai One of the classifications is based on the hand guard type 

The most popular of the three tantos were aikuchi and hamadashi This was because of the fact that these two types had a small guard and they were easier to hide and carry The tanto was not widely used on the battlefield so the guard was mostly unnecessary

Other styles of tanto differed by the shape of the blade The best known are 

When the tanto was used on the battlefield it was supposed to go through the armor of the opponent when he was close The best tantos for this were those with a long narrow blade and with a thick spine The blow was applied with the point directed under or through the armor The tanto was usually carried in a wide cloth belt with the edge up and the handle turned to the right In the samurai house the tanto was often placed with the wakizashi Samurai women were taught to use the tanto in case they needed to defend themselves or if violated to take their own life

It is also considered that tantos of different type were used for suicide ritual Still it was mainly used by women samurai whose suicidal ritual was to cut their own throat The men samurai had a different ritual they used a wakizashi sword for disembowelment

The claymore is a Scottish sword It is double edged The word itself is of Gaelic origins and means great sword The Claymore is indeed a big sword and was held only with two hands In some sources the broad claymore sword is called claidheamh da lamh which means two hand sword It was very popular in the 16th century when Scottish warriors used it against the Englishmen

The claymore sword was in average about 55 inches  overall length the blade was about 42 inch long It weighed around 55 lb It possessed a very broad blade and a slim channel for blood flood 

There also existed a version of Claymore that had a single edged blade and a basket shaped handle The basket of the handle was used as protection to the hand The blade was very long so the basket was designed for balance too The making of these swords was widespread especially during the mid 1600s The places where the claymore swords were made were Edinburgh Canongate Stirling and Glasgow 

Beginning around 1350 very long claymore swords were used The handles and the blades became longer This was because of the heavy armour that was almost impossible to penetrate The Scottish Claymore was one of the two swords which could cut through the armour The second was the Germanic Landsknecht sword 

Tamahagane tah mah ha ga nay is a high quality metal made in the Japanese tradition The word tama means round and precious like a gem or jewel The word hagane means steel On the market it costs 50 times more than ordinary steel Tamahagane steel is used to make Japanese swords knives and other kinds of tools

Good tamahagane contains around 1 of carbon and should not go over 15

Tamahagane is made of iron sand There are 2 main types of iron sands acome and masa Acome is of lower quality and masa is of better quality The man who decides the amount of the mixing parts is called the murage Depending on the desired result the murage mixes one or more types of sands

The iron sand is put in a clay tub called a tatara The clay tub measures about 4 feet tall 12 feet long and 4 feet high The tub is then dried and heated The clay tub is heated to a high temperature about 1000 C Then it is mixed with charcoal to give tamahagane hardness 

The process of making tamahagane continues for 36 to 72 hours depending on how many people work and how much metal is to be obtained The iron sand is added every 10 minutes and the mixture is frequently turned over 

When the tamahagane is finished the clay tub is broken and the steel is removed The best steel is on the edges of metal block because this is the where the oxidation process is stronger The quality of tamahagane is determined by its color bright silver pieces are very good for making blades

A graviton is a very small thing that some scientists think is responsible for gravity At this time it is just an idea because scientists have not yet found or seen a graviton

Because the graviton is a particle that has force it is classed as a gauge boson Other gauge bosons include the photon the gluon and the W and Z particles

If someone found one it could lead to a theory which would join together the four main physical forces electromagnetism gravity strong force and weak force

An autotroph is an organism that makes organic compounds from simple molecules

Autotrophs are needed in every food chains of all ecosystems They take energy from the environment and use it to make other organic molecules that are used to carry out various biological functions such as cell growth or repairing broken tissue

Plants and other organisms that carry out photosynthesis are phototrophs Bacteria that use inorganic compounds like hydrogen sulfide phosphorus or iron are called chemoautotrophs Other organisms called heterotrophs eat autotrophs 

There are some species that need organic compounds as a source of food but are able to use light as a source of energy These are not autotrophic but heterotrophic A mixotroph is aorganism that can use a mix of different sources of energy and carbon

This procedure may also be necessary because many cryptographic methods operate on blocks of code If a block is not full additional characters need to be filled in Filling in random text has proven very useful

A Dictionary attack is a method used in cryptography To find a key a large number of words are tried These words usually come from a special collection called a dictionary 

Rocco Francis Marchegiano better known as Rocky Marciano was an American boxer Marciano was the World Heavyweight Boxing Champion from 1952 until 1956 He had the shortest reach of any heavyweight champion at only 68 inches He was also short for a champion standing only 511 Marciano is the only heavyweight champion in professional boxing history who never lost or drew in a professional match He won 43 fights by a way of knockout or TKO an 878 KO rate

Before becoming a professional fighter Marciano had an amateur record of 11 3 Marcianos first professional fight was in March 1947 He won the championship from Jersey Joe Walcott on September 23 1952

Marciano was named fighter of the year by Ring Magazine three times His three championship fights between 1952 54 were named fights of the year by that magazine Marcianos last title fight was against Archie Moore on September 21 1955 Marciano was knocked down in the fight but he got up and knocked out Moore in the 9th round Marciano announced his retirement in a press conference on April 27 1956

Marciano considered a comeback in 1959 when Ingemar Johansson won the heavyweight championship from Floyd Patterson on June 26 1959 However Floyd Pattersons contract demanded a rematch with Ingemar within one year After a period in training and thinking about a comeback Marciano decided against it and never seriously considered a comeback again 

In 1969 on the eve of his 46th birthday Marciano was a passenger in a small private plane a Cessna 172 headed to Des Moines Iowa It was at night and bad weather set in The pilot tried to land the plane on a small airfield outside Newton Iowa but the plane hit a tree two miles short of the runway The passengers died almost instantly He is entombed in a crypt at Forest Lawn Memorial Cemetery in Fort Lauderdale Florida His wife who died five years after him at the age of 46 is entombed next to him 

Exponentiating by squaring is an algorithm It is used for quickly working out large integer powers of a number It is also known as the square and multiply algorithm or binary exponentiation It implicitly uses the binary expansion of the exponent It is of quite general use for example in modular arithmetic The algorithm has been known for a long time It is already written down in a book called Chandah stra That book was published in India around 200 BC 

This algorithm is much faster than the ordinary method to compute such a value Multipliying x by itself n operations are needed to calculate x n With the method shown above only log2 operations are needed 

A smart card is a card with a microchip in it Such cards are used as a method of identification and authentication 

Plastic cards that allow to withdraw money from a cash machine often are smart cards nowadays The very often the user is identified with a PIN If the pin is entered correctly money can be withdrawn If the PIN is not entered correctly the card is blocked

At first smart cards were used in public telephones in France in 1983 There the card simply stored a pre paid credit This credit was reduced when calls were made Another way to solve the problem is that the balance is stored in a remote database To make calls a is first called From there additional calls can be made This eleiminates the need for cards with chips on them

In mathematics two integers are coprime if they share no common factors In other words there is no number other than 1 that divides both a and b

As an example 6 and 35 are coprime 6 and 27 are not coprime because 3 divides both 6 and 27

Prime numbers are always coprime to each other

In cryptography a key is a piece of information that allows control over the encryption or decryption process

There are two basic types of cryptographic algorithms

The Sami people are an ethnic group of people living in Lapland Lapland is area in the far north of Europe Lapland is shared between the countries of Norway Sweden Finland and Russia Sami people live in all of those countries The number of Sami people in the world today is between 80000 to 135000

There are 10 distinct different Sami languages which are spoken and six of these can be written

The best known of the Sami people were the Lapp nomads who raised reindeer The Lapps survived in their harsh homeland by domesticating the reindeer The Lapps were able to get everything they needed from the deer They ate mostly meat milk and cheese Their clothes were made froom reindeer skins and wool Their tents were also made from deer skins They are known for the beautifully decorated woolen clothing they made

The Lapps protected the herds moving with them as they migrated from summer to winter pastures They used trained reindeer to pull sleds carrying their supplies During the winter the herds moved south of the treeline The Lapps would live nearby in homes made of logs or sod The Lapps were very careful not to waste anything they got from the reindeer Milk was taken from the reindeer to drink or make cheese Meat was taken for food The blood was frozen in chunks and used for soup and pancakes Knives and belt buckles were carved from the bones and antlers The sinews were used as sewing thread Cleaned out stomachs were used to carry milk or cheese Every part of a dead reindeer was used

Winter clothing was made from layers of deer skin The inside layer would be worn with the fur facing in toward the persons skin The second layer was worn with the fur facing out Boots were also made of fur lined with grass that had been gathered during the short summer Every evening the grass would be taken out and dried by the fire so it would be ready to use again the next day This way a Lapp could be warm and comfortable in even the coldest weather

Today only a few of the Lapp people still follow the herds Those few use modern tools on their ancient migration They use snowmobiles to herd the reindeer and rifles to kill the wolves that chase them Even helicopters and radios are used to locate and move the reindeer Most of the Lapp people now live on small farms in one of the four nations of Lapland They raise crops and animals including a few reindeer to meet their needs The sale of reindeer meat is an important source of income for the Lapp people

Sami crafts are called Duodji The men make knives drums and guksi from wood bone and antlers The women use leather and roots to make gakti Women also use birch and spruce to weave baskets

Sami clothing is called gakti and was originally made from reindeer leather but now it is usually made from wood cotton or silk Traditionally there are different types of clothing for men and women

Sami shamanism is the main religion of the Sami people These beliefs are connected to the land animalism and the supernatural Sami shamanism is a polytheistic religion which means that there are many gods The Sami shaman are called the Noadi There are some wise men and wise women who often try to heal sick people through rituals and traditional herbal remedies Some Sami people have converted to Christianity to either the Russian Orthodox Church or Lutheranism

Lapland is the most northern part of Fennoscandia Fennoscandia is peninsula in northern Europe Some people say Santa Claus lives in Lapland in Finland

Area of Lapland is shared between four countries These countries are Norway Sweden Finland and Russia Original people of Lapland are Samis Sami people are also called Lapps

Weather of Lapland is cold and summer is short There are big hills with no trees on top of them Reindeer live in Lapland You can see northern lights in sky

The Kingdom of Judah was a Jewish kingdom that existed from 930 BCE to 586 BCE It was in the southern part of what is now called Israel

The kingdom was created after the death of Saul when the tribe of Judah picked King David to rule them After the death of King Solomon son of David ten of the twelve of the tribes of Israel did not want Solomons son Rehoboam to lead them This caused the kingdom to split the Northern Kingdom the Kingdom of Israel and the Southern Kingdom the Kingdom of Judah Jerusalem was the capital of the Kingdom of Judah In 586 BCE the king of Babylon took over Jerusalem and with it Judah

A mind map is a drawing used to show words ideas tasks or other things Everything is written around a word or idea in the middle This word or idea is the main topic of the mind map and the things linked to it are related to the main idea It is used to store and order ideas and is very useful for study ordering things solving problems and making choices

Dia is open source software that is used to make diagrams It lets people draw many different types of technical drawings for example flow charts and circuit diagrams Technical diagrams are needed when doing work in subjects such as electronics and resistant materials A flow chart can also be used to show how to plan out how to solve a problem for example how to bake a cake

Talent means the skill that someone has quite naturally to do something that is hard Someone who has talent is able to do something without trying hard It is an ability that someone is born with People may have talent for music dancing acting sport or other skills Someone who has talent is talented

Mozart had a talent for music He had a great talent He was very talented

We say that someone is born with a talent

If someone has talent they still have to work very hard if they want to be very good at something Some people become quite good at something even if they do not have much talent but if they are willing to work very hard at the skill Some people waste their talent

Other words for talent are aptitude or gift A talented person is a gifted person

The Broadway musical Fame is about a group of talented young people in a dancing school

The word talent used to mean a weight and a piece of money in Assyria Greece and Rome This is the sense in which it is used in the Bible in the parable of the five talents

The word gift can mean

A talent is an ancient unit of mass It corresponded generally to the mass of water in the volume of an amphora ie a one foot cube

The Babylonians and Sumerians had a system in which there were 60 shekels in a mina and 60 minas in a talent The Roman talent consisted of 100 libra which were smaller in magnitude than the mina

When used as a measure of money it refers to a talent weight of gold or of silver The gold talent is reported as weighing roughly the same as a person and so perhaps 50 kg Some authorities say that the talent typically weighed about 33 kg varying from 20 to 40 kg The international price of gold is about US600 per troy ounce One gram costs about 20 At this price a talent would be worth about 660000 Similarly at the 2005 price of about 760troy ounce or 25 centsgram a 26 kg silver talent would be worth about 6500 Thus when we read that King Auletes of Egypt paid Gaius Julius Caesar the sum of 6000 talents of gold to grant him the status of a Friend and Ally of the Roman People This amount was about 3 billion USD These estimates are only rough values because they are based on modern estimatesThe value of silver in comparison to gold drastically changed This is because of the output of the Spanish silver mines in the New World In ancient times the same amount of silver was often worth more than gold The estimates do not account for the less technical mining ability of the time nor that there were still native deposits available Later in Roman history during the medieval Byzantine period the emperor Basil II was said to have stockpiled the legendary amount of 200000 talents of gold which in modern terms would be worth approximately 100 billion USD At any rate he did save enough money that the Byzantine government was able to remit all taxes paid during the final two years of his reignFactdateFebruary 2007

Another way to calculate the modern equivalent to a talent is from its use in estimating military pay During the Peloponnesian war in Ancient Greece a talent was the amount of silver needed to pay the crew of a trireme for one month Hellenistic mercenaries were commonly paid one drachma for every day of service which was a good salary in the post Alexander days 6000 drachma made a talent Based on this fact assuming a crew of roughly 200 rowers paid at the basic pay rate of a junior enlisted member of the US armed forces a talent would be worth nearly 300000

Bede lived around 672 or 673 to 27 May 735 He was a monk and an early historian of the church in England

He worked at the Northumbrian monastery of Saint Peter at Wearmouth today part of Sunderland and of its companion monastery Saint Pauls in modern Jarrow Both were in the English county of Durham He is well known as an author and scholar whose best known work Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum gained him the title The father of English history

Bede became respectfully known as Venerable Bede soon after his death but this was not linked to consideration for sainthood by the Roman Catholic Church

Almost all that is known of Bedes life is contained in a notice added by himself when he was 59 to his Historia which states that he was placed in the monastery at Wearmouth at the age of seven that he became deacon in his nineteenth year and priest in his thirtieth remaining a priest for the rest of his life 

His works show that he had at his command all the learning of his time It was thought that the library at Wearmouth Jarrow was between 300 500 books making it one of the largest and most extensive in England

The most important and best known of his works is the Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum giving in five books and 400 pages the history of England ecclesiastical and political from the time of Caesar to the date of its completion 

Phototrophs or photoautotrophs are organisms which carry out photosynthesis 

With their plastids and the help of energy from sunlight carbon dioxide and water are converted into sugar by photosynthesis Sugar is then converted into other organic molecules which can be used in cellular functions Such a function might be for example respiration 

NTFS is a file system It was developed by Microsoft A file system is a way of storing computer files NTFS stands for New Technology File System Microsoft introduced it with the Windows NT operating system A version of NTFS is also included in the most recent operating systems developed by Microsoft Windows XP Windows Server 2003 and Windows Vista

NTFS was made to replace the old file system used by earlier versions of Windows like Windows 95 Windows 98 and Windows 98SE That file system was also used by MS DOS and is called FAT

A File system is a way of storing all data on a data storage device The data is usually organized in computer files in directories Below the file system there is usually a physical device where the files are stored This might be a hard disk USB flash drive compact disc or DVD The file system might also talk to a remote server over a network where the file is stored The file system might also only use RAM to store the files 

The underlying storage mechanism usually has no concept of a file A hard disk knows of disk blocks which are numbered in a certain way These disk blocks contain binary data 

The file system does the translation between the large numbers and the view the users see that is that of files organized in a certain way

More recently concepts from databases have been used to develop file systems That way there are two different kinds of data

It then becomes possible to always keep the file system in a consistent state With databases this is known as ACID That way an operation on a file is either done or it is not done There are however no states in between The file being written to the filesystem is no longer visible This is usually done using transactions But with filesystems it is called journaling

He was married on July 17 1328 aged only four to Joan of the Tower daughter of Edward II of England and Isabella of France

At the age of five David became King of Scotland after the death of his father on June 7 1329 He was crowned at Scone in November 1331 

Edward Balliol with support from Edward III of England fought against David so that he could become king He defeated David at the Battle of Dupplin on 12 August 1332 Balliol was crowned king and in July 1333 the nine year old David and his queen were sent to France for their safety In June 1341 he came back and began to rule In 1346 he invaded England but was defeated and taken prisoner at the Battle of Nevilles Cross on October 17 1346 and remained in England for eleven years living mainly in London and at Odiham in Hampshire In October 1357 he was allowed to go back to Scotland for a payment of 100000 marks The money was never paid completely In 1371 David died in Edinburgh Castle 

Lied is the German word for song 

The word Lied is used in music to describe the songs that were written by German speaking composers of classical music Songs composed by classical composers are sometimes called art songs

Lieder are normally songs for a singer with piano accompaniment They were mostly composed in the 19th century which was the period known as the Romantic period The most famous composers of Lieder were Franz Schubert Robert Schumann Johannes Brahms Hugo Wolf and Richard Strauss

In German culture the Lied as an art song goes back to the Middle Ages Walther von der Vogelweide was a 12th 13th century minnesinger who composed and sang songs for important people at the royal court Like most minnesinger he was a poet as well as a composer writing words for his own songs The Lied in the Romantic period was usually written by two different people the poet wrote the words and then the composer set the words to music 19th century composers mostly took great care to choose good poetry for their songs The poetry was often by famous poets such as Goethe and Schiller Although most Lieder were composed in the Romantic period the beginnings were there in the Classical music period Mozart wrote a song called Das Veilchen and Beethoven wrote several songs

It was Schubert who was to be the greatest of all Lieder composers Schubert wrote over 600 songs Very often he wrote in a form which had been used by Walther von der Vogelweide three verses of which the first two have the same music Other songs of his are what is known as durchkomponiert Here each verse is different so that the composer can express the words of each verse with different music The wonderful thing about Schuberts songs is the way in which the piano accompaniments help the voice and show the meaning of the words The piano was a fairly new instrument at the time and could do things that would have been impossible on the harpsichord  One of his earliest songs is the famous Erlknig The piano accompaniment is very difficult to play because the right hand has continuous repeated octaves which describe the galloping of the horse in the wild stormy night Grettchen am Spinnrade is a song which sets a poem from Goethes Faust The young girl is sitting at the spinning wheel thinking of her lover The piano has a rippling accompaniment which sounds like the gentle clatter of the spinning wheel At the moment when the girl imagines her lovers kiss the piano part comes to a stop then gradually starts up again as the girl wakes up to the world around her The effect is magical

Composers often composed groups of songs which belong together These are called a song cycle Schubert wrote two long ones Die Winterreise and Die schne Mllerin Both are about love affairs which end sadly 

Robert Schumann wrote many fine songs He was a pianist before he became a composer so it is not surprising that the piano parts of his songs are at least as important as the voice part  His song cycle Dichterliebe contains some of his best songs They often have a dream like atmosphere He especially liked setting words by the poets Joseph von Eichendorff and Heinrich Heine

Johannes Brahms always made the singers part more important than the piano part He learned a lot by studying Schuberts songs and wrote some very famous Lieder One of his best is the humorous Vergebliches Stndchen His Four Serious Songs are very powerful His famous Wiegenlied a tune which everybody knows is one of his songs

Hugo Wolf is known almost only for his songs They are very dramatic and he used some unusual harmonies which he had learned by listening to Wagners music Some of Wolfs songs are very short he says a lot in a short space of time His Italian song book and Spanish song book have some of his best songs

Richard Wagner and Gustav Mahler both wrote wonderful Lieder although they are mostly with orchestral accompaniment Mahlers songs are inspired by folksong He even uses them in his symphonies Das Lied von der Erde is a song cycle for two singers and orchestra

Richard Strauss is one of the last great Lieder composers His Four last songs seem to be saying goodbye to a great period of music history

An Aurora is a flickering light caused by the suns radiation usually found near the poles They come in red green and occasionally blue and can sometimes resemble fire In fact the Roman Emperor Tiberius thought a city was on fire so he sent fire engines to that city The city on fire was actually a city against a backdrop of a red aurora

An aurora can happen in the Arctic around the North Pole or in the Antarctic around the South Pole An aurora can often be seen for a long way many hundreds of kilometers or miles

Auroras can only be visible at night because their light is not as strong as the light of day However they do happen during the day as well 

Aurora happens when the Sun sends off stuff we call particles to the empty space These particles are charged which means they have lots of electricity These particles flying in space are called solar wind Sometimes solar wind hits Earth Earth has a protection shield of energy around it This is called the magnetic field The magnetic field wards off solar wind At the cold area magnetic field is less powerful and it can not protect Earth from the solar wind There the particles of the solar wind hit the particles in the air When they hit the electricity gets away and we see that as light An aurora can also happen in a CME coronal mass ejectionwhen the charged particles rip through the electromagnetic field because of their power

A group of people called the Sami people who live in Sweden Norway and Finland think that an Aurora is a tail of a Fox

Nordic countries are a group of countries in the northern Europe These countries are Denmark Finland Iceland Sweden and Norway Scandinavia is not the same thing as Nordic countries even though some people say they are Scandinavia is a peninsula while the Nordic countries are countries Sweden and Norway are located on the Scandinavian peninsula Scandinavia and Finland together belong to bigger peninsula that is Fennoscandia

Nordic countries have similar state law and culture In history Nordic countries been very close Nordic countries are welfare states with a very high taxes Nordic countries have some political co operation like the Nordic council Co operation with a larger group European Union makes the Nordic co operation even smaller Finland is the only country that uses the euro

There is a long and cold winter in Nordic countries but only a small part of northern Norway and about a half of Iceland is arctic

Going Underground was The Jams first number one song on the UK charts The song is arguably The Jams finest moment in their career Although it did not appear on any of their studio albums it did appear on several best of Jam albums

Paasselk devils are stories about balls of light at lake Paasselk Finland Local people say that bright balls sometimes move above lake Paasselk or near the lake in the forest This kinds of lights are said to appear around the world They are sometimes called ghost lights or will o the wisps Scientists does not know what ghost lights or will o wisps are 

People have told these stories for a long time so it is a part of folklore there People thought that balls of light are devils Some still believe that balls are alive or have mind because they seem to act like that Ball can follow fishermans boat of go to hide if you use your torch

Lake Paasselk appeared when big stone dropped from the sky millions of years ago Such lake is called crater lake Magnetism in the middle of the lake is not normal

You can see the balls from this website

Aurora was the ancient Roman equivalent of Eos Eos was the ancient Greek goddess of the dawn Aurora is the Latin word for dawn

Aurora renews herself every morning at dawn and flies across the sky She announces the mornings arrival She has a brother and a sister Her brother is the sun and her sister is the moon She also has many husbands and four sons one for each cardinal direction North East South and West

Aurora is comparable to Eos in Greek mythology and to Ushas in Hindu mythology

One of her lovers was Tithonus Aurora asked Zeus to grant immortality to Tithonus However she failed to ask him for eternal youth As a result Tithonus ended up aging eternally 

In Shakespeares Romeo and Juliet Montague says of his lovesick son Romeo

In the poem Tithonus by Lord Alfred Tennyson Aurora is described as folllows

The asteroid 94 Aurora was named after her

Ukko was the biggest god in Finnish paganism a religion that was in Finland before Christianity Ukko was god of sky and thunder Ukko was an old man and he lived on the sky He had a weapon  hammer or axe called Ukonvasara Lightning is from this weapon

Finnish pagans had an image of this weapon made from metal on their necks They believed that lightning does not hit people who have this image

At Midsummer Finns gathered together and drank beer to honour Ukko That was called toast of Ukko

Ukko is similar to Thor that was a sky god of most Scandinavians and Perun that is a Baltic sky god

Vinminen is an important person in Finnish mythology He was a wise man and he knew magic He was a hero and had many adventures

Vinminen was also a god As such he was worshipped

Magic of Vinminen was in his songs When he sings hills shake and water moves He sings his enemy Joukahainen to sink in swamp

Vinminen was bornt before Earth He was floating in the sea He was born a grown man Her mother Ilmatar got pregnant by the water and wind and carried her son for 30 years A bird made a nest on Ilmatar s knee and when the bird hatched her eggs it burned Ilmatar s knee and finally Ilmatar moved her knee and all the eggs flew into the sky and on the earth and were broken From those pieces the Earth and sky the stars The sun and the moon were born

Ilmarinen is an important person in Finnish mythology He is a very good smith who made the sky He also made the Sampo a magical machine that makes salt gold and food He tried to create a new moon and a sun but failed Ilmarinen married one of Louhi s daughters

Finnish paganism was a pagan religion in Finland and Karelia before the Finnish people were Christian Finnish paganism is close to Scandinavian paganism and Baltic paganism The Finns believed that there were many gods 

Finnish paganism was animistic This means that they believed that nature was full of little and big spirits The biggest spirits were Gods who had names the God of the sky was Ukko the God of the forest was Tapio and the God of water was Ahti There were many other spirits that had names

A Shaman was a wise person who could perform magic They beileved that when spirits helped him he could heal ill people and curse enemies

Humans had many souls Self and me were two different souls If ones self soul left him he was not dead but very ill A Shaman could go to the spirit world to bring the soul back

The Bear was a holy animal to them if bear was killed to make food he or she was celebrated with a ritual called Peijainen The purpose of the ritual was to make the soul of the bear happy A happy soul of a bear wants to be reincarnated into another bear so that people can eat bears in the future The swan was a holy bird they believed if you killed a swan you died

Some trees and stones were holy to them along with some forests Close to holy places people made sacrifices Sacrifice means that people gives a gift to a spirit Sacrifices made the spirits happy A happy spirit then wants to help humans For example a happy spirit can give lots of fish to a fisherman At later times things that were given to spirits were small things like money flowers pieces of silver alcohol or food

The Finns believed that Earth was flat like a disc Above Earth was sky dome a pot that was upside down In the middle of the Earth was a pillar that held the sky making sky so that it did not drop The North star was a nail in the top of this pillar Land of dead people Tuonela was under Earth Way to Tuonela was at the base of pillar that holds the sky There was a great whirl of water called Kinahmi 

People hoped that their dead relatives went to Tuonela because people did not like ghosts However some times dead relatives were asked to help living people Sometimes shamans went to Tuonela to ask souls for help

Feedback is when the effect of a process have a connection to its cause

Sometimes output from an electronic source affects future input This can form what is called a feedback loop In some cases the output reinforces the input making it stronger this is called self reinforcing positive runaway or amplifying In other cases the output blocks or stops some of the input this is called a negative feedback loop

Think about a sound system with input from a microphone and output to a loudspeaker If the sound coming out of the loudspeaker is heard by the microphone a loop is created from speaker to the microphone through the cord and back into the speaker The loop is made up of sound and the electrical energy that the microphone and loudspeaker use to create that sound If nothing stops the sound and electricity in the loop it will travel faster and faster which is why feedback starts out as a low hum and turns into a high squeal very quickly

This is an example of a positive feedback loop the output reinforces the input it makes the imput stronger

Think about two mirrors that face each other The mirrors reflect each other infinitely or forever but in each reflection the image in the mirror is slightly smaller than the image it reflects The images get smaller and smaller until they are no longer visible

This is an example of a negative feedback loop the output reduces the input it makes the input smaller

Warm temperature caused a glacier to melt As the glacier melts areas that were at one time covered by snow and ice are now water or land Because snow and ice reflect heat but water and land absorb heat this causes the glacier to melt faster as more snow and ice is melted This is not a feedback loop it is a feedforward loop which accelerates the process

American mathematician Norbert Wiener made feedback loops more well known in 1948 in his book Cybernetics Cybernetics is the study of feedback loops and their role in communication and control

A phosphate is a salt of phosphoric acid Phosphates are important in biochemistry Phosphates have the formula PO43 and a molar mass of 94973 gmol An example of a phosphate is sodium phosphate Three different types of phosphates are known They are orthophosphate PO43 metaphosphate PO32 and pyrophosphate P2O73 

Phosphates are made of one phosphorus atom surrounded by four oxygen atoms Many phosphates do not dissolve in water

The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain It lies in the front part of the brain 

The cerebrum is divided into two cerebral hemispheres These two cerebral hemispheres are connected by nerve fibres called corpus callosum 

The outer layers of the cerebrum are made up of the grey matter The inner layers are made up of the white matter

There are three main areas in the cerebrum The sensory area the association area and the motor area

All the lobes of the brain are found in the cerebrum

The cerebrum has about 10000 billion neurons

In the cerebrum specific regions for each kind of stimulus and its response are located For example occipital lobe is the region for visual reception temporal lobe for auditory reception and partial lobe for touch smell temperature and conscious association Frontal lobe is for muscular activities

Karelia is area in eastern fennoscandia to the east from where Finnish people lives There are many opinions about what places exactly belong to Karelia

Most parts of Karelia belong to Russia today Small parts of Karelia belongs to Finland In Russian side Karelia is Republic of Karelia In Finnish side there are provinces of North Karelia and South Karelia

Original people of Karelia are Karelians Karelian people speaks Karelian that is a Finnic language very close to Finnish Karelians knew many old poems Many poems of Finnish book Kalevala are from Karelians Today in republic of Karelia Karelians are minority and Russians are majority Some people fear Karelian culture and language die out

Most parts of Karelia was part of Finland until Second World War East Karelia was not While making peace Finland had to give most parts of Karelia to Soviet Union that is now known as Russia After peace many people from Soviet Union came to live in Karelia

Kalevala is the Finnish national epic This means it is a book that is very important to Finnish people

Kalevala has many stories in it The stories of Kalevala are poems that are very old Long ago people sang these poems The poems have a unique metre that is not known outside Finnic languages There are many themes in these stories from different times in the past The oldest themes are from the stone age Many of the poems are collected from Karelia and areas nearby

Heroes have adventures in these stories The most important heroes are Vinminen Ilmarinen Lemminkinen and Kullervo The enemies of heroes are Louhi and Joukahainen Many stories in Kalevala are about two countries fighting each other These countries are the land of Kalevala and land of Pohjola The Land of Kalevala is the land of Heroes Pohjola is the land of enemies Pohjola is an evil and cold place somewhere far north

Elias Lnnrot was a man who collected these poems and made a book of them Kalevala has been translated into many languages There is also an English Kalevala

King Edred or Eadred was King of England from 946 until his death He was a son of King Edward the Elder and Edgiva of Kent He was king after his brother King Edmund I Like both his older brothers Edred was successful against the Vikings Edred was a very religious man but had very poor health He died on November 23 955 at Frome in Somerset and was buried in the Old Minster at Winchester His nephew King Edwy became king after him

Plant pathology or phytopathology is the study of plant diseases Like humans plants can get sick from Viruses bacteria and fungi

The chytrids are the most primitive of the fungi Many chytrids are found in fresh water There are approximately 1000 chytrid species in 127 genera distributed among 5 orders

Chytrids get their energy mostly from non living organic matter

Both zoospores and gametes of the chytrids are mobile by their flagella one whiplash per individual

Some chytrid species are known to kill amphibians in large numbers The actual process however is unknown

This is a list of traditional abbreviations for US states and territories These abbreviations were used in mailing addresses before the introduction of two letter US postal abbreviations The traditional abbreviations are still commonly used in other ways besides mailing addresses For example they can be used in writing after a city In 1987 the Secretary of Commerce switched to the two letter State Alpha Code for state abbreviations

A Saprotroph is an organism that gets its energy from non living organic matter This may be decaying pieces of plants or animals This means that saprobes are heterotrophs They are consumers in the food chain Many fungi are saprobes This is also true for many bacteria and protozoa To put it simply most dead organic matter is eventually broken down and used by bacteria and fungi It i heterotroph because ities t search fot its own food and is therefore a consumer 

There is also an older name Saprophyte for these kinds of organisms phyte usually means plant The problem with that name was that no embryophytes are true saprotrophs Bacteria and fungi are no longer considered plants either

Giacomo Puccini was the most famous Italian opera composer after Verdi He wrote 16 operas most of which are performed very often today Many of his operatic songs are known by many people especially the aria Nessun dorma from Turandot which was sung by Luciano Pavarotti for the BBCs television coverage of the Football World Cup which was held in Italy in 1990

Puccini was born into a musical family He was expected to follow the family tradition and become a church organist He started playing the organ in churches near Lucca He liked to improvise on the organ playing popular tunes from Verdis operas He soon realized that he wanted to be an opera composer Eventually he persuaded his family to let him study at the Milan Conservatory His earliest compositions showed that he had a great talent for writing beautiful melodies and that he was good at writing for the orchestra His first opera to be published Edgar had a story similar to that of Bizets Carmen but it was not a suitable story for Puccini

Manon Lescaut was the first opera for which Puccini chose the story himself It is the same story as Massenets opera Manon This made Puccini internationally famous His next opera La bohme produced in 1896 is often thought to be his best opera He worked with two poets on this opera and although they quarrelled a lot the result was a work in which the music flowed beautifully like a conversation 

His next opera was Tosca When it was first performed in Rome in 1900 there were rumours that a bomb would be thrown but nothing happened Tosca was a great success However Madame Butterfly was hissed and booed at its first performance in Milans famous opera house La Scala in 1904

It was at this time that Puccini married He already had a son by Elvira his wife who had been married to someone else When her husband died she was able to marry Puccini The marriage was not without difficulties Elvira accused Puccini of having an affair with their servant girl This servant girl committed suicide and there was a court case which resulted in Elvira being found innocent Puccini was very upset by all this and did not compose much for several years

When he finally started writing again his new opera La fanciulla del West was set in the American West at the time of the Goldrush The music has very Impressionistic harmonies like that of Debussy The way he writes for the orchestra shows the influence of Richard Strauss The opera was first performed in New York The world famous tenor Enrico Caruso sang the main hero part and Arturo Toscanini was the conductor With such a star cast it had to be a great success

Puccini followed this by writing an operetta and two one act operas The best of these is Gianni Schicchi His last opera is Turandot which has a fairy tale like story While he was working very hard at it he developed throat cancer He died in the autumn of 1924 The whole of Italy went into mourning and Mussolini spoke at the funeral Puccini had not quite managed to finish Turandot A man called Franco Alfano finished it using the sketches that Puccini had left

An orchestra pit is the space where an orchestra plays in a theatre or opera house The actors or singers are on the stage and the orchestra pit is normally lower than the stage so that the audience can watch the play or opera Depending on where they sit the audience may just be able to see the heads of the musicians in the orchestra pit It is important that singers can see the conductor so that they can watch the beat out of the corner of their eye Opera houses nowadays often have close circuit television monitors at the sides so that singers can watch the conductor even when they are not facing him

The orchestra pit in the Bayreuth Festspielhaus is unusual This opera house was designed by the composer Richard Wagner for the performance of his own operas He did not want the audience to be able to see the orchestra at all so it is very low The orchestra members do not have to dress up in ties and jackets because they cannot be seen anyway

There are many different ways to tell what will o the wisps are Some says they are gas like methane that goes up from the ground and burns Other people says they are electric things like ball lightning 

Some people thinks will o the wisps are souls spirits or spaceships Scientists think these ideas are foolish  they think that there must be a natural explanation One flying ball of light was explained it was an owl that had a bright stomach Sometimes animals or fungus make some light  this is called bioluminescence by scientists and foxfire by old people

There are many old and new stories about will o the wisps around the world These lights have different names in different cultures and languages 

Ghost lights are lights in the air that are not well understood by scientists Ghost lights are not seen much Ghost light can be close to ground or in the sky Ghost light close to ground is mostly called will o the wisp Ghost light in the sky is often called UFOs There are very different kinds of ghost lights Some are like balls of light others look like flame and some look like a bright cloud Many ghost lights move

Different cultures have understood ghost lights differently People believed that they are dragons spirits or ghosts Today some believe they are spaceships There are many theories about what ghost lights are Some people say they are methane gas that comes from ground and burns in the air Others say they are electric things like ball lightning The fact that some animals and fungus glows may explain some ghost lights

Booing means shouting BOO If people shout boo after a performance they are showing that they did not like it It is the opposite of applause

Booing and hissing used to be very common especially at the opera In the early days of opera opera audiences often behaved badly They went to the opera to chat with their friends to cheer their favorite singers and to boo the singers they did not like not to listen carefully to the music

Booing has recently become less common in Western culture except at sports events because people think it is rude Audiences today are more likely simply not to clap if they do not like a performance Slow hand clapping is also a way of showing sarcastic applause

Applause is the noise made by an audience who are clapping their hands to thank someone for a performance People at a concert usually applaud when the performers come onto the stage This is a way of welcoming them At the end of a performance people applaud again to thank the performers

People may applaud after someone makes a speech or at a sporting match They will applaud after a play in the theatre or at the end of an opera The length of applause may depend on how much they liked the performance If they liked it very much they may also shout BRAVO When an audience applauds with really wild excitement it is called an ovation Very occasionally an audience might all stand up as well This is called a standing ovation

The Caesar cipher is a method of cryptography It is named after Julius Caesar who used it to communicate with his army 

To make a message secret with the Caesar cipher each letter in the message is changed using a simple rule change by three So each letter is replaced by the letter three letters ahead in the alphabet A becomes D B becomes E and so on For the last letters we think of the alphabet as a circle and wrap around W becomes Z X becomes A Y becomes B and Z becomes C To change a message back each letter is replaced by the one three before it

Changing by three is the rule that Julius Caesar used but the same idea works for any number 

The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher each letter is replaced by another No substitution cipher is really safe

Social Engineering is a way to influence people with the goal to illegally obtain sensitive data Social Engineers observe the personal environment of their victims and use fake identities to gain secret information or free services In most cases Social Engineering is used to infiltrate third party computer systems to spy on sensitive data in that case social engineering is also called Social Hacking

An early way of Social Engineering first occurred in the 1980s and was named Phreaking Phreakers called phone companies and claimed to be system administrators and asked for passwords which they used to connect illegally and free of charge to the Internet

A more modern form of Social Engineering is called Phishing which is an attempt to get access to Internet users data via faked WWW addresses The most common way of Phishing is Fraud Mailing also known as Scam Mailing where the victim is being sent a fake E Mail ie of a bank In most Scam Mails the letter includes a link that is redirecting to a fake website which is logging the login id and the appropriate password of the victim The hackers are often using DNS Spoofing to fake the senders E Mail address

The main model of Social Engineering shows up with faked phone calls the Social Engineer calls employees of a company and impersonates a technician who needs sensitive data to complete important technical operations In advance the attacker has gathered information about work routines of the target company from public sources or former raid attempts that gives him advantage in further Social Engineering trials The invader tries to confuse his victims and to seem trustful using trade language and involving the victims in small talk Further the assaulter pretends authority to frighten his victims Under circumstances the employee actually requested technical support and is expecting such a phone call

The prevention of Social Engineering is difficult By influencing the victim subconsciously the invader abuses typical human behavior like helpfulness in emergency situations or to respond with help to the seemingly helpful attacker General mistrust would disturb the efficient and trustful team work of an organization The most effective way to avoid Social Engineering is to assure the identity of the caller This can already be done by asking for the callers name and phone number and to politely ask for patience even if the callers issue seems to be very urgent Even if one could verify the callers identity one should only hand out the absolutely necessary information 

Social Engineering became generally known through Kevin David Condor Mitnick who became one of the most wanted persons of the United States of America because of successfully invading government systems such as the Pentagon and the NSA

Further well known Social Engineers are the check scammer Frank Abagnale

Hydroponics or Hydroculture is the method of growing plants in the nutrients that they need instead of soil There are many ways of doing it

Static Solution Culture is placing or floating the plants on water containing nutrients in a container The water is renewed by a control system to prevent the plants roots from becoming dry The water does not flow through the container but remains static Because the water is still algae often grows using nutrients and covering the plants roots so that they are not able to take in the nutrients so well Algae growth can be reduced by using some method to prevent light from reaching the roots for example black plastic or aluminium foils The static solution has to be changed every week or two to ensure it has the correct amount of nutrients

Continuous flow solution is growing plants in a stream of continuously running water The plants can be placed in a shallow container and the water containing the nutrients runs through the roots This can be carried out in several different ways either passing the water over the bare roots inside a tube or hollow container or passing the water through a mat of fibre into which the roots have grown or variations between the two One of the main advantages of this system is that the nutrient water can be kept in a storage container and if any changes need to be made to the nutrient it is easy to do this to the storage container The system usually runs be gravity the storage container is placed in a higher position than the plants and the water trickles downwards until it has passed though the roots of the plants and into a lower storage container where it is pumped back up to the higher container The advantage of this method is that it uses the nutrients efficiently it allows oxygen to reach the roots and the water can be adjusted very easily The main disadvantages are that if any fault occurs with the circulation system the plants have little water to live on until the fault is corrected and the flow channels must be regular in their slope if they are not then water can remain in the non sloping areas and this can cause problems

Gravity Fed Systems do not use electricity to circulate the water containing nutrients The system has a large container positioned higher than the plants and the water runs down through and to the plants in a controlled way This system is used with plants that are grown in pots with the water being delivered to the base of the pot and capillary action drawing the water up into the pot

Aeroponics uses a system where the roots of the plants are contained in a chamber which is sprayed continuously or discontinuously with a fine mist of water containing nutrients The roots of the plant hang in the air and the advantage of this system is that the roots have good access to oxygen This system was invented in 1983 by Richard Spooner and has become a successful way of growing a wide range of crops including seed potato production tomato production leaf crops and small salad leaves Other advantages of aeroponics are that a much wider range of plants can be grown with this system plants grow with only one quarter of the nutrients needed in normal hydroponics and NASA has an interest in this system because managing a spray is easier than handling liquids in zero gravity Finally plants grown by this method can be transferred to soil or another growing medium without suffering from a slowing of growth while they adjust to the new conditions The main disadvantage is that this system is more costly to build and maintain than the normal hydroponic systems

Passive Sub Irrigation is also known as passive hydroponics or semi hydroponics This system has the plants growing in a porous material like special clay granules vermiculite fibre glass coconut husk perlite or a similar substance that holds water has lots of air spaces but does not act directly on the plants roots The water is run through the material to keep it wet and the material keeps the plants roots separated to allow a good contact with the air to help the plant use oxygen and carbon dioxide this method is easy to set up and control and is suitable for a number of plants like orchids or bromeliads that in nature grow with their roots in warm damp air

Ebb and Flow or Flood and Drain Sub irrigation use a method that has a large container of water with nutrients positioned below the level of the plants being grown and at intervals the water is pumped or manually lifted to irrigate the plants and then drain back into the container This is a simple method to build and can be easily controlled with an automatic mechanism

Run to Waste is a method where plants are grown on a material that holds some water but has many air spaces such as vermiculite perlite fibreglass or coarse sand The water with nutrients is controlled by a timer and the amount of irrigation will depend on several factors such as temperature the size of the plants the type of material the plants are growing in and other more technical things The water runs to a collecting container after irrigating the plants and may be used again or discarded This system is used very widely for growing commercial crops of vegetables such as tomatoes and cucumbers

Deep Water Culture involves the growing of plants hanging in water with nutrients The plants are held in nets with their roots in the water The nets may or may not contain a material to separate the roots The water has air pumped through it to increase the oxygen in the water which assists the roots to grow

Bubbleponics is a method which is used together with the above method of Deep Water Culture In the early stages of growth the roots of the plants are irrigated with water and nutrients that are pumped through an air stone to introduce a high level of dissolved oxygen into the water which greatly helps the young roots to grow It is usually used only in the early stages of growth when the plants are forming roots clumps

Crop rotation is the practice of moving different crops on the same land If this process was not done harmful organisms and other pests would spread when the crop is prepared for raising Crop rotation also helps stop the loss of water in soil nutrients

A normal way to do crop rotation is to mix green manure and other organic matter in with the soil This adds nitrogen and other nutrients that plants need to grow When this is added it can help different crops be able to grow at the same time in the same space 

Cycling crops can also help aeration when plants with deep roots are changed with plants that have shallow roots

In stories a changeling is the child of a troll elf or fairy that has been left in the place of a human child The stolen human child then lives with the troll family A changeling is like a human baby but ugly always hungry and with a bad temper Sometimes the changelings are much wiser than a human baby would be 

It is thought that changeling stories came from actual events A family who had a handicapped or sick child may have traded their sick child for a healthier better looking child

Folklore says that it might be possible for parents to figure out that their child has been replaced with a changeling If they discovered the changeling quickly enough they could get their human child back One way to get the child back was to put the changeling in an oven Another way was to put the changeling in a forest so that the troll could take its child back Sometimes children died in the oven or forest

SWOT Analysis is a tool to find out the Strengths Weaknesses Opportunities and Threats that are to be expected in a project or in a business venture or in something similar It means that the marketing environment is looked at The technique was developed by Albert Humphrey who led a research project at Stanford University in the 1960s and 1970s using data from the Fortune 500 companies 

SWOT analysis is part of the Harvard Policy Model which has been developed as part of the business policy courses taught at the Harvard Business School since the 1920s

A project is a temporary broken wikt linkendeavorendeavor undertaken to create a unique product or service 

The word project comes from the Latin word projectum from projicere to throw something forwards which in turn comes from pro which denotes something that precedes the action of the next part of the word in time and jacere to throw The word project thus actually originally meant something that comes before anything else is done When the word was initially adopted it referred to a plan of something not to the act of actually carrying this plan out Something performed in accordance with a project was called an object This use of project changed in the 1950s when several techniques for project management were introduced With this advent the word slightly changed meaning to cover both projects and objects However in certain projects there may still exist so called objects and object leaders reflecting the older use of the words

Projects differ from operations because operations are continuous and repeating and operations deliver the same or almost the same results

A project usually needs resources to deliver its results Most of the time project execution is based on detailed plan which considers also external factors and constraints Planning execution and controlling of project is the primary field of project management For major projects it is necessary sometimes to set up a special temporary organization consisting of a project team and one or more work teams

Major projects can be divided into subprojects and program denotes collection of related projects

Projects can be categorised based on different aspects

Based on project content

Based on initiating or participating organisation

Based on complexity

Gioachino Rossini was an Italian composer He was the most famous composer of operas in his time His operas had lots of new ideas Italian operas had become rather unimaginative with composers such as Cimarosa and Paisiello writing the same sort of thing each time Rossini made his operas interesting by writing skillfully for the singers giving them good tunes as well as giving the orchestra interesting music and by choosing a variety of stories for his operas The opera for which he is best known today is the Il Barbiere di Siviglia Many of the overtures to his operas are played at orchestral concerts The most popular is the overture to his opera Guillaume Tell with its famous galloping tune

During the last 40 years of his life Rossini wrote no more music His friends begged him to write another opera but he always refused

Rossini was born on 29 February of the leap year 1792 His birthplace was Pesaro a small town in Italy on the Adriatic coast His father played the horn in military bands and opera houses and his mother sang in operas Often his parents toured together and the young Rossini was left in the care of his grandmother The family eventually settled in Bologna Rossini had lessons in singing cello piano and counterpoint He did not like the counterpoint lessons but it did help him to study different styles of music and he became very good at writing harmony in a clear way

Italian opera at this time needed a new composer to bring more life into it Five of his first nine operas were written for the Teatro S Moise in Venice Other theatres soon asked him to write operas In 1812 he wrote La pietra del paragone for the Teatro alla Scala in Milan It was a great success Many of these early operas were comic operas Sometimes he had to produce so many new operas that he kept reusing some of the music he had already written in another opera Nevertheless they include a lot of fine music and Rossini was developing his musical personality His overtures have a fine sense of orchestral colour He often started with a slow section and then went into fast music with a crescendo Because he did this a lot it is often called a Rossini crescendo or Rossini rocket

It was not easy for him to earn enough money to keep himself He only got paid for the operas he took part in There were no copyright laws in those days The important singers were well paid but the composers earned much less We know very little about his life at this time but we do know that he travelled a lot His most famous operas from this period are Tancredi La Gazza Ladra and Il barbiere di Siviglia which has often been called the greatest of all comic operas

By 1815 Rossinis operas were famous everywhere in Western Europe except in Naples Neapolitan opera had been famous throughout the 18th century and the city was proud of its tradition The Neapolitans did not want a young composer from the north to continue their operatic tradition Nevertheless Rossini soon won their hearts He wrote for the Teatro S Carlo which had a fine orchestra and very good singers He wrote many of his best serious operas for Naples and this tradition which he built up made it possible for Verdi to take over thirty years later as Italys leading opera composer

Rossinis international fame took him to Vienna where he met Beethoven After returning to Italy for a while he travelled to Paris and England He was only 31 years old and had written 34 operas The Paris audiences already knew his operas In London a Rossini Festival was organized Most of the time in England he spent at social parties at the houses of rich people who were glad to pay him money to come and be their guest Soon after this he settled in Paris for five years He was director of the Thtre Italien until 1836 His two greatest operas from this period were Le Comte Ory and Guillaume Tell which was based on a play by Schiller These works have beautifully flowing tunes as well as grand drama 

In 1829 at the age of 37 Rossini decided to retire He had lots of money but his health was not particularly good Although he wrote a few small pieces of music he never composed another opera He went back to Bologna although he returned to Paris nearly 20 years later with his wife Here his health improved and he wrote a little music His Petite messe solennelle for 12 voices two pianos and harmonium is still performed today When he died in 1868 thousands of people came to his funeral

Rossinis music is a link between the Classical and the Romantic periods He was brought up hearing 18th century opera and much of his best known music is still Classical in style but he developed a lot as he matured and was writing in a more Romantic way by the end of his career He gradually stopped writing music which has set numbers all the time music divided sharply into arias and recitative His recitative became more expressive and was accompanied by the orchestra instead of by a harpsichord This helped to make his music more continuous He did not often write for castrati as they were going out of fashion The chorus have an important part in the drama of his operas

An opera house is a building where operas and ballets are performed It is similar to a theatre

The first opera houses were built in the 1630s in Italy about thirty years after the first operas were written Traditionally they have a stage where the action takes place and a proscenium archway with a curtain that can be drawn back when the performance begins In front of the stage is an orchestra pit which is a little lower than the stage so that the audience can still see the stage The audience sit in the auditorium which is often horse shoe shaped The downstairs seats are called stalls Round the stalls there are two or three tiers of boxes Each box can seat a small number of people At the top towards the back there is a balcony and often a gallery along the sides as well Some seats in the gallery may have restricted view

Some of the most famous opera houses in the world are Teatro alla Scala in Milan the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden London the Metropolitan Opera House in New York the War Memorial Opera house in San Francisco the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow and the Sydney Opera House in Sydney which is a very modern building

Kullervo is a person in the Finnish national epos Kalevala He is a good looking man with golden hair Bad things happen to him his destiny is tragic

In folk stories Kullervo is the son of the giant Kaleva In the Kalevala however Kullervo is the son of a man called Kalervo

In the Kalevala Kullervos family is killed by Untamos family before Kullervo is born Only one woman is not killed She gives birth to Kullervo who will be a slave of Untamo Every work that Kullervo tries goes ill This is why Untamo sells him to a smith called Ilmarinen

Ilmarinen puts Kullervo to shepherd cows Ilmarinens wife gives Kullervo bread that has stones in it While Kullervo cuts the bread his knife hits the stone and breaks Kullervo gets angry and curses bears to eat cows and Ilmarinens wife Then he escapes

While travelling Kullervo has sex with a girl He does not know that this is his own sister When he finds out he goes very angry and attacks Untamo and kills him and his family Then he commits suicide

The story of Kullervo differs from all other folktales in the respect that it describes the effects of child abuse in a very realistic way and in the end of the poem Vinminen especially warns all parents from abusing their children

 Between 1725 and 1727 Konarski learned at the Collegium Nazarenum in Rome where he became a teacher of rhetoric  the art of good speaking After that in order to make better his own learning he traveled through France Germany and Austria In 1730 he went back to Poland and began to work on a new text of Polish law 

From 1736 Konarski taught at the Collegium Resoviense in Rzeszw and in 1740 he started the Collegium Nobilium in Warsaw a school for sons of the people of high social class Thereafter he improved teaching of Piarists in Poland in a way that agrees with his program of teaching His improvements became an important point in the fight of 18th century to make the system of Polish teaching more modern

In the beginning Konarski was joined politically with King Stanislas Leszczynski later he came near to Czartoryskis Familia and to King Stanislas August Poniatowski He took part in the well known Thursday dinners Stanislas August Poniatowski caused that a medal was made in the honor of Konarski with his likeness There was written in Latin Sapere auso 

Gaetano Donizetti was an Italian composer He was the most famous composer of operas in Italy in the years between the death of Bellini and the time when Verdi was becoming well known Bellini and Donizetti wrote operas in the bel canto style music with beautiful smooth melodies

Donizettis family were very poor His talent was discovered by Simon Mayr who was maestro di cappella at S Maria Maggiore in Bergamo He opened a school which trained boys to sing in the church choir and gave them a good musical education Donizetti learned a lot from Mayr and was always very grateful to him

Donizettis first operas were performed in Venice A rich lady who realized he was very talented paid so that he did not have to do military service His opera Zoraida di Granata was very successful in Rome and he was given a contract for an opera for Naples For several years he composed between two and five operas every year They were not particularly successful One of the reasons was that the libretti he was given were not very good 

In 1828 he married None of their three children lived very long and his wife died in 1837 which made him very sad during his last years This can be felt in his music

His opera Anna Bolena made him internationally famous It was performed in London and Paris His opera Maria Stuarda was based on a play by Schiller It was not popular at first The audience did not like the tragic ending Today it is recognized as containing some great music especially in the final scene After a visit to Paris he returned to Naples to produce Lucia di Lammermoor which was based on Scotts novel The Bride of Lammermoor There is a French version as well as an Italian version of this opera 

In 1838 he moved to Paris where he had his operas performed in four theatres Berlioz wrote very critical articles about him in a music journal Donizetti had gone to Paris hoping that he would earn lots of money so that he could then retire just like Rossini had done However his health was not good and he found it harder to concentrate He managed to composed Don Pasquale which is one of the best comic operas every written but it does have a lot of music that he had written earlier He was obviously finding it difficult to think of new ideas Soon he became really ill He was suffering from syphilis He was put in a sanatorium near Paris for 17 months In 1847 some friends arranged for him to stay with them but he was very ill by then He was paralysed and almost unable to speak His friends looked after him until he died

He was buried in Bergamo His remains are now in a church there The house where he was born is a museum

Baltic countries are three countries in Northern Europe at the eastern side of the Baltic Sea and at the southern side of Gulf of Finland Baltic countries are Estonia Latvia and Lithuania Lithuanian and Latvian people speak Baltic languages and Estonian people speak Finnic language

By their culture and history Baltic countries are close to Nordic countries The biggest difference in the history was that Baltic countries were occupied by Soviet Union while Nordic countries were not occupied Baltic countries had their freedom back when the Soviet Union came to an end Today the Baltic countries are some of the richest and most advanced of those countries that were part of Soviet Union

Paganism was the religion of Baltic people before most of them took Christianity long long ago Baltic paganism never died out and some people are still pagans

Crucifixion is a method of execution or capital punishment which is the killing of someone usually because they have committed a crime It was used by the government of Rome A prisoner was beaten with whips and made to carry their own cross They were either tied or nailed to the cross The Romans used different types of crosses T shaped X shaped and sometimes just trees It killed people by making them bleed go into shock and making it hard for them to breathe eventually dying of suffocation Some of the people would live for several days before dying The Roman soldiers would often break the legs of the criminal to speed it up

The most famous person to have been crucified was Jesus Christ the Son of God according to Christianity He was crucified along with two thieves The cross later became a symbol of Christianity Six of the twelve apostles of Jesus were also crucified later on but most of them asked to be crucified in a different way from what Jesus was For example Andrew was crucified on an X shaped cross In the year 337 AD Emperor Constantine I abolished crucifixion in the Roman Empire

A steeple is the tower at the top of a church which is a building or temple of the Christian religion It often has a cross at the top in memory of Jesus crucifixion

When we say Baltic Paganism we actually mean many different religions and mythologies that people had in Baltic countries before Christianity and that some people still have All of those religions have their own features but also between these religions many things are similar Baltic pagans just like Scandinavian and Finnish pagans believes that greatest god is a male god of sky and thunder He has a hammer or axe that makes lightning This belief is very old We think that in Stone Age Corded Ware culture already had this kind of a god and that his weapon was boat shaped stone axe Corded Ware culture lived in large area and many features of Nordic and Baltic people are from it

Yellowstone National Park was the first national park in the world It was created on March 1 1872 when United States President Ulysses S Grant signed a law to create it It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site

Yellowstone National Park is famous for its geysers and hot springs The Park contains about half the worlds geysers The worlds most famous geyser the Old Faithful Geyser is in Yellowstone National Park It also is a home for grizzly bears wolves bison and elk Many tourists visit the park each year to see the geysers and animals there

The park is the center of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem This is the largest remaining nearly intact ecosystem in the Earths northern temperate zone It includes many types of ecosystems but the subalpine forest is dominant

Most of the park is in Wyoming it is about 350000 sq miles in extent bigger than Rhode Island or Delaware

The park sits on the Yellowstone Plateau at an average elevation of 8000 feet above sea level The plateau is bounded on nearly all sides by mountain ranges of the Middle Rocky Mountains which range from 9000 to 11000 feet in elevation 

Three deep canyons are in the park cut through the volcanic tuff of the Yellowstone Plateau by rivers over the last 640000 years The most famous is called the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone

The Continental Divide of North America runs diagonally through the southwestern part of the Park This separates the Pacific from Atlantic water drainage areas The origins of the Yellowstone and Snake Rivers are near each other but on opposite sides of the divide As a result the waters of the Snake River flow to the Pacific Ocean while those of the Yellowstone find their way to the Atlantic Ocean via the Gulf of Mexico

Yellowstone is the site of a huge ancient volcano whose remains are called the Yellowstone Caldera The caldera is the largest volcanic system in North America

The cause of the volcano was a hotspot in the Earths mantle over which the American continental plate moved 640000 years ago a huge volcanic explosion blew 240 cubic miles of rock and lava into the air It was 1000 times larger than the Mount St Helens eruption 

Yellowstone is still geologically active and is monitored by the US Geological Survey There is ground movement geysers and swarms of small earthquakes The floor of the caldera has been rising but experts say there is no immediate danger of eruption

Yellowstone is widely considered to be the finest megafauna wildlife habitat in the lower 48 states There are almost 60 species of mammals in the park including the gray wolf the threatened lynx and grizzly bears Other large mammals include the bison black bear elk moose mule deer white tailed deer mountain goat pronghorn bighorn sheep and mountain lion

Bison once numbered between 30 and 60 million throughout North America Yellowstone is one of their last strongholds Their populations had increased from less than 50 in the park in 1902 to 4000 by 2003 

The parks bison population reached a peak in 2005 with 4900 animals Despite a summer estimated population of 4700 in 2007 the number dropped to 3000 in 2008 after a harsh winter and controversial brucellosis management sending hundreds to slaughter APHIS has stated that with vaccinations and other means brucellosis can be eliminated from the bison and elk herds throughout Yellowstone

Starting in 1914 the US Congress gave funds for the purposes of destroying wolves prairie dogs and other animals injurious to agriculture and animal husbandry on public lands After the wolves were gone from Yellowstone the coyote became the parks top canine predator However the coyote cannot bring down large animals The result was a great increase in lame and sick megafauna

By the 1990s the Federal government had reversed its views on wolves In a controversial decision by the US Fish and Wildlife Service wolves imported from Canada were reintroduced into the park A survey conducted in 2005 showed there were 13 wolf packs totaling 118 individuals in Yellowstone and 326 in the whole ecosystem 

The recovery of populations throughout the states of Wyoming Montana and Idaho has been so successful that they are no longer on the endangered species list

About 600 grizzly bears live in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem with more than half living within Yellowstone

Population figures for elk are over 30000the largest population of any large mammal species in Yellowstone The northern herd has decreased enormously since the mid 1990s This may be caused by wolves Also elk use more forested regions to evade the wolves and make it harder for researchers to count them The northern herd migrates west into southwestern Montana in the winter The southern herd migrates southward and the majority of these elk winter on the National Elk Refuge southeast of Grand Teton National Park The southern herd migration is the largest mammalian migration remaining in the US outside of Alaska

In 2003 the tracks of one female lynx and her cub were spotted and followed for over convert2mikmabbrofflkoff Fecal material and other evidence obtained were tested and confirmed to be those of a lynx No visual confirmation was made however Lynx have not been seen in Yellowstone since 1998 though DNA taken from hair samples showed that lynx were at least passing through the park Other less commonly seen mammals include the mountain lion and wolverine The mountain lion has about 25 individuals parkwide The wolverine is another rare park mammal and accurate population figures for this species are not known

Yellowstone is also home to six species of reptiles such as the painted turtle and Prairie rattlesnake and four species of amphibians including the Boreal Chorus Frog 

Eighteen species of fish live in Yellowstone including the core range of the Yellowstone cutthroat trouta fish highly sought by anglers The Yellowstone cutthroat trout has faced several threats since the 1980s including the suspected illegal introduction into Yellowstone Lake of lake trout an invasive species which consume the smaller cutthroat trout The cutthroat trout has also faced an ongoing drought as well as the accidental introduction of a parasitewhirling diseasewhich kills younger fish Since 2001 all native sport fish species caught in Yellowstone waterways are subject to a catch and release law 

311 species of birds have been reported almost half of which nest in Yellowstone As of 1999 twenty six pairs of nesting bald eagles have been documented Extremely rare sightings of whooping cranes have been recorded only three examples are known to live in the Rocky Mountains out of 385 known worldwide Other birds considered to be species of special concern because of their rarity in Yellowstone include the common loon harlequin duck osprey peregrine falcon and the trumpeter swan

A national park is a park that was created by a nations government National parks are often made to protect the animals that live inside them or the land inside them There are many National Parks in the world

The first one established in 1872 was the United States Yellowstone National Park 

An international organization the International Union for Conservation of Nature and its World Commission on Protected Areas has defined National Parks as its category II type of protected areas The largest national park in the world meeting the IUCN definition is the Northeast Greenland National Park which was established in 1974 According to the IUCN there are about 7000 national parks worldwide

In 1969 the IUCN declared a national park to be a relatively large area with 

While national parks are generally understood to be administered by national governments in Australia national parks are run by State Governments and predate the Federation of Australia

A plantation is a large farm The crops grown on plantations are usually for export and not for local use Crops grown on plantations include banana sugarcane coffee tea cotton and tobacco 

Some of the problems with plantations come from the fact that they are monocultures that is there is only one kind of crop that is grown there This makes them vulnerable to pests for example Among the earliest examples of plantations were the latifundia of the Roman Empire They produced large quantities of wine and olive oil for export Plantation agriculture grew rapidly with the increase in international trade Like every economic activity it has changed over time Earlier forms of plantation agriculture were associated with large disparities of wealth and income foreign ownership and political influence and exploitative social systems such as indentured labor and slaverystub

Pines are a family of conifers It includes many well known conifers such as cedars firs hemlocks larches pines and spruces 

It is the largest living conifer family with between 220250 species in 11 genera and the second largest in geographical range Pines live in almost the entire Northern Hemisphere In North America they live in the southern part of Arctic to Nicaragua and Hispaniola In Europe they live from Portugal and Scotland to Russia In Asia they live from Russia to Japan and the Philippines They also live in the Himalayas and some northern parts of Africa They also live in the North of Majorca on the rugged mountains

Pine is a genus in the Pinaceae family of the conifer division The wood that comes from it is also called pine Pine is a softwood with many uses It is often used in furniture This is because of its natural durability and it is less expensive than hardwoods All softwoods take up to 1020 years to grow whereas deciduous trees may take up to 100 or more years to grow

Pines usually have male and female cones on the same tree The male cones are small typically 15 cm long and only present for a short period usually in spring They fall as soon as they have shed their pollen The female cones take 153 years to mature after pollination with actual fertilization delayed one year At maturity the female cones are 360 cm long Each cone has numerous spirally arranged scales with two seeds on each fertile scale the scales at the base and tip of the cone are small and sterile without seeds The seeds are mostly small and winged and are wind dispersed Some are bird dispersed In others the fire climax pines the seeds are stored in closed cones for many years until a forest fire kills the parent tree the cones are opened by the heat and the stored seeds are then released in huge numbers to re populate the burnt ground

Pohjola is an evil country in Finnish and Karelian ancient stories Pohjola is at north and it is very cold place Ruler of Pohjola is Louhi an evil witch woman We think that Pohjola does not really exist but long ago when people thought about Pohjola they thought about Lapland and a region of Pohjanmaa

There was high wall around Pohjola and there were gates of Pohjola that could be seen from far away 

Many evil things like diseases and cold are from Pohjola In Pohjola lives people of Pohjola They are great warriors and magicians The ruler of Pohjola Louhi is ugly but powerful old woman who can do great magic She had a husband and daughters Daughters of Louhi were very beautiful They were so white and bright that they were actually transparent you could see flesh through their skin bones through their flesh and bone marrow through their bones Daughters of Pohjola were sitting on the sky weaving gold and silver threads

Many heroes went to Pohjola to ask daughters of Louhi them to be their wifes Louhi did not give her daughters easily She made men to do almost impossible missions to have her daughters One such mission was to make Sampo a machine that would do money crop and salt One hero Ilmarinen did this machine but still Louhi did not let her daughter to marry Ilmarinen Ilmarinen and other heroes then stole Sampo from Louhi Louhi attacked them There was a big battle and Sampo was destroyed Some pieces of Sampo drifted on sea and they came to shores of Finland Since that they have made wealth to Finnish people

The Household income in the United States is a measure of current private income commonly used by the United States government and private institutions To measure the income of a household the pre tax money receipts of all residents over the age of 15 are combined Most of these receipts are in the form of wages and salaries but many other forms of income such as unemployment insurance disability child support etc are included as well The residents of the household do not have to be related to the householder for their earnings to be considered part of the households income While the use of household income remains among the most widely accepted as households tend to share a common economic fate the size of a household which is commonly not considered may off set gains in household income

In 2005 the median annual household income according to the US Census Bureau was determined to be 46326 similar to that of Canada which was roughly 41510 in the year 2000 The median income per household member in the year 2003 was 23535 In the year 2005 there were approximately 113146000 households in the United States 1723 of all households had annual incomes exceeding 100000 while another 127 fell below the federal poverty threshold while the bottom 20 earned less than 19178 While the aggregate income distribution tends to tilt towards the top with the top 637 earning roughly one third of all income those with upper middle incomes also controlled a large though declining share of the total earned income Households in the top quintile 77 of which had two income earners had incomes exceeding 91705 Households in the mid quintile with a mean of one income earner per household had incomes between 36000 and 57657

The 2005 economic survey also found that households in the top two income quintiles those with an annual household income exceeding 55331 had a median of two income earners while those in the lower quintiles had median of only one income earner per household Due to high unemployment among those in the lowest quintile the median number of income earners for this particular group was determined to be zero Overall the United States followed the trend of other developed nations with a relatively large population of relatively rich households outnumbering the poor Among those in between the relative extremes of the income strata a large and quite powerful section of households with moderately high middle class incomes and an even larger number of households with moderately low incomes While the median household income has increased 44 since 1990 it has decreased very slightly when considering inflation In 1990 the median household income was determined to be 30056 44603 in 2003 dollars While personal income has remained relatively stagnant since over the past few decades household income has risen due to the rising percentage of households with two or more income earners Between 1999 and 2004 household income stagnated showing a slight increase since 2004

Households are often divided into quintiles according to their gross income Each quintile represents 20 or one fifth of the population 

Household type is strongly correlated with household income Married couples are disproportionately represented in the upper two quintiles compared to the general population of households Cross referencing shows that this is likely due to the presence of multiple income earners in these families Non family households are disproportionately represented in the lower two quintiles Households headed by single males are disproportionately found in the middle three quintles single females head households concentrated in the bottom three quintiles

The highest income households are almost ten times as likely to own their homes rather than rent but in the lowest quintile the ratio of owners to renters is nearly one to one

The New York Times has used the quintiles to define class It has assigned the quintiles from lowest to highest as lower class lower middle class middle class upper middle class and upper class

Despite great advances made to lift minorities out of poverty and many African Americans and Latino Americans joining the middle class there is still an uneven racial distribution among the income quintiles While White American who were not of Hispanic descent made up roughly 751 of all persons in 2000 8793 of all households in the top 5 were headed by a person who identified as being White alone Only 475 of all household in the top 5 were headed by someone who identified him or herself as being Hispanic or Latino of any race versus 125 of persons identifying themselves as Hispanic or Latino in the general population Overall 8601 of all households in the top two quintiles with upper middle range incomes of over 55331 were headed by a head of household who identified him or herself as White alone while only 721 were being headed by someone who identified as being Hispanic and 737 by someone who idenitified as being African American or Black Overall households headed by Hispanics and African Americans or Blacks were underrepresented in the top two quintiles and overrepresented in the bottom two quintiles Households headed by persons who identified as being Asian alone on the other hand were overrepresented among the top two quintiles In the top five percent the percentage of Asians was nearly twice as high as the percentage of Asians among the general population European Americans were relatively even distributed throughout the quintiles only being underrepresented in the lowest quintile and slightly overrepresented in the top quintile and the top five percent

Household income as well as per capita income in the United States rise significantly as the educational attainment increases In 2005 graduates with a Masters in Business Administration who accepted job offers are expected to earn a base salary of 88626 They are also expected to receive an average signing bonus of 17428 According to the US Census Bureau persons with doctorates in the United States had an average income of roughly 81400 The average for an advanced degree was 72824 with men averaging 90761 and women averaging 50756 annually Year round full time workers with a Professional degree had an average income of 109600 while those with a Masters degree had an average income of 62300 Overall average earnings ranged from 18900 for high school dropouts to 25900 for high school graduates 45400 for college graduates and 99300 for workers with professional degrees 

Considering how education significantly enhances the earnings potential of individuals it should come as no surprise that individuals with graduate degrees have an average per capita income exceeding the median household income of married couple families among the general population Higher educational attainment did not however help close the income gap between the genders as the life time earnings for a male with a professionals degree were roughly forty percent higher than those of a female with a professionals degree The life time earnings gap between males and females was the smallest for those individuals holding an Associate degrees with male life time earnings being 2777 higher than those of females While educational attainment did not help reduce the income inequality between men and women it did increase the earnings potential of individuals of both sexes greatly enabling many households with graduate degree householder to enter the top household income quintile

Household income also increased significantly with the educational attainment of the householder The US Census Bureau publishes educational attainment and income data for all households with a householder who was aged twenty five or older The biggest income difference was between those with some college education and those who had a Bachelors degree with the latter making 23874 more Income also increased substantially with increased post secondary education While the median household income for a household with a household holding an Associates degree was 51970 the median household income for those with a Bachelors degree or higher was 73446 Those with doctorates had the second highest median household with a median of 96830 18289 more higher than that for those at the Masters degree level but 3170 lower than the median for households with a professionals degree holding householder

Household income in the United States varies substantially with the age of the person who heads the household Overall the median household income increased with the age of householder until retirement age when household income started to decline The highest median household income was found among households headed by working baby boomers Households headed by persons between the ages of 45 and 54 had a median household income of 61111 and a mean household income of 77634 The median income per member of household for this particular group was 27924 The highest median income per member of household was among those between the ages of 54 and 64 with 30544 The group with the second highest median household income were households headed by persons between the ages 35 and 44 with a median income of 56785 followed by those in the age group between 55 and 64 with 50400 Not surprisingly the lowest income group was mainly comprised of those households headed by individuals younger than 24 followed by those headed by persons over the age of 75 Overall households headed by persons above the age of seventy five had a median household income of 20467 with the median household income per member of household being 18645 These figures support the general assumption that median household income as well as the median income per member of household peaked among those households headed by middle aged persons increasing with the age of the householder and the size of the household until the householder reaches the age of 64 With retirement income replacing salaries and the size of the household declining the median household income decreases as well

Since 1967 the median household income in the United States has risen modestly fluctuating several times Even though personal income has risen substantially and 42 of all household now have two income earners the median household income has increased only slightly According to the US Census Bureau this paradoxial set of trends is due to the changing structure of American households For example while the proportion of wives working year round in married couple households with children has increased from 17 in 1967 to 39 in 1996 the proportion of such households among the general population has decreased Thus while married couple households with children are the most economically prosperous type of household in the United States their share of the population has been dwindeling in the United States In 1969 more than 40 of all households consisted of a married couple with children By 1996 only a rough quarter of US households consisted of married couples with children As a result of these changing household demographics median household income rose only slighly despite an ever increasing female labor force and a considerable increase in the percentage of college graduates

Overall the median household income rose from 33338 in 1967 to an all time high of 44922 in 1999 and has since decreased slightly to 43318 Decreases in household income are visible during each recession while increases are visible during economic upturns These fluctuations were felt across the income strata as the incomes of both the 95th and 20th percentile were affected by flactuations in the economy Yet it is important to note that income in the period between 1967 and 1999 grew faster among wealthier households than it did among poorer households For example the household income for the 80th precentile the lower threshold for the top quintile rose from 55265 in 1967 to 86867 in 2003 a 572 increase The median household income rose by 30 while the income for the 20th percentile rose by only 28 from 14002 to 17984 One should note that ht majority of households in the top quintile had two income earners versus zero for the lowest quintile and that the widening gap between the top and lowest quintile may largely be the reflection of changing household demographics including the addition of women to the workforce

While per capita disposable income has increased 469 since 1972 it has only increased moderately when considering inflation In 1972 disposable personal income was determined to be 4129 19385 in 2005 dollars In 2005 disposable personal income was however 27640 showing a moderate 43 increase Since 1990 household income has fallen slightly but this does not take into account the decrease in average household size

The median household income by state ranged from 32589 or 267 below national median in West Virginia to 57352 or 29 above national median in New Hampshire Connecticut which is often referred to as the nations wealthiest state came in at number four with a median household income of 55970 California which had the highest median home price in the nation where home prices have far outpaced incomes only ranked number thirteen with a median household income of 49894 While Californias median income was not near enough to afford the average California home or even a starter home West Virginia which had the nations lowest median household income also had the nations lowest median home price The northeastern states more specifically those located in New England as well as the western states had the highest median household income Of the top fifteen states all were located in the Northeast and West with the sole exception of Minnesota which ranked fifth The southern states had the by far lowest median household income with nine out of the countrys fifteen poorest states being located in the South It should be noted however that New York Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia also fell below the national median Overall median household income tended to be the highest in nations most urbanized northeastern north mid western and western States while rural and mostly southern states had the lowest median household income

The median income divides households in the US evenly in the middle with half of all household earning more than the median income and half of all households earning less than the median household income In 2004 the median household income in the United States was 43389 According to the US Census Bureau the median is considerably lower than the average and provides a more accurate representation Considering other racial and geographical inequities in regards to household income it should come as no surprise that the median household income varies with race size of household and geography The state with the highest median household income in the United States was New Hampshire with 57352 followed by New Jersey Maryland and Connecticut making the Northeastern United States the wealthiest area by income in the entire country In terms of region the median household income was as follows Northeast West and South Median household income in the Mid West declined by 28 to 44657 The exception was the Midwest where income declined 28 percent to 44657 While median household income has tendency to increase up to four persons per household it declines thereon after This indicated that while four person households have larger incomes than those with one two or three members household with seem to earn progressively less as their size increases beyond four persons According to the US Census Bureau 2004 Community Survey two person households had a median income of 39755 with 48957 for three person households 54338 for four person households 50905 for five person households 45435 for six person households with seven or more person households having the second lowest median income of only 42471 In terms of race Asian Americans households had the highest median household income of 57518 European American households ranked second with 48977 Hispanic or Latino households ranked third with 34241 African American or Black households had the lowest median household income of all races with 30134

Another common measurement of personal income is the mean household income Unlike the median household income which divides all households in two halves the mean income is the average income earned by American households In the case of mean income the income of all households is divided by the number of all households The mean income is usually more affected by the relatively unequal distribution of income which tilts towards the top As a result the mean tends to be higher as the median income with the top earning households boosting it Overall the mean household income in the United States according to the US Census Bureau 2004 Economic Survey was 60528 or 17210 higher than the median household income

The mean household income for households headed by persons identifying as White alone was 65317 40685 for those headed by persons identifying as African American or Black 45871 for those headed by persons identifying as Hispanic or Latino and 76747 for those households headed by persons identifying as Asian alone Approximately one third or 365 of all households earned more than the mean income while 635 earned less than the mean

Toxicology is the study of the negative effects of chemicals on living things The main factor in the toxicity of a substance is the dose as almost all substances can be toxic under the right conditions 

Many chemicals that we call poisons are only toxic when made into different chemicals by the body Many chemicals are made toxic in the liver by enzymes for example paracetamol which is a common drug There is also some variation in liver enzymes in different people that can cause a substance to be more toxic in one person than it is in another Some substances are also only toxic when they are with other chemicals as one liver enzyme can cause activity in another enzyme

Trickery is the act of misdirection or an illusion 

For example magic tricks are when someone makes the person seeing it think that the magic they are doing is true but it actually is not But magic tricks can also be good since children can enjoy the magic more 

A trick can also mean to lie or misdirect a person so that someone who is tricking the person can enjoy winning the game they are playing for example gambling

A useful action taught to an animal for example from shaking hands to handing back tools or dropped objects so that people seeing the action can enjoy the trick

Loki is the God of trickery and cunning in the Norse Mythology

Slideshow means a show of slides It is a display of several slides for information or for artistic purposes 

Slideshows are conducted by a presenter using an apparatus such as a slide projector an overhead projector or in more recent years a computer running presentation software The word comes from the use of slides which have been around for many years Slides originally were projected on movie theater screens by magic lanterns as part of early movie house shows

The word slideshow does not appear in the Websters New Twentieth Century Unabridged Dictionary but is accepted as correct spelling in Microsoft Word in both Office 2000 and Office XP editions 

In photography a slide is a thin translucent photograph bound in paper plastic or similar frame and often used for projection with use of a slide projector for a slideshow The terms reversal film and transparency are also used

Slide could be related to any of these

Projection can be any of

A slide projector is an instrument to view photographic slides 

It has four main elements 

A flat piece of heat absorbing glass is often placed between the condensing lens and the slide to avoid damaging the slide This glass absorbs infrared Light passes through the transparent slide and lens and the resulting image is enlarged and projected onto a screen So the audience can view its reflection 

The image may be projected onto a translucent rear projection screen That is used for continuous automatic display for close viewing This form of projection also avoids that people who look at the show interrupt the light stream or bump into the projector

Slide projectors were common in the 1950s and 1960s as a form of entertainment family members and friends would gather to view slideshows

In home photographic slides and slide projectors have largely been replaced by low cost paper prints digital cameras DVD media video display monitors and digital projectors

As of October 2004 Kodak no longer manufactures slide projectors It is also increasingly difficult in some countries to locate photo processors who will process slide film

A video projector takes a video signal and projects the corresponding image on a screen using a lens system All video projectors use a very bright light to project the image and most modern ones can correct any curves blurriness and other inconsistencies through manual settings Video projectors are widely used for conference room presentations classroom training and home theatre applications

A video projector may also be built into a cabinet with a rear projection screen to form a single unified display device now popular for home theater applications 

Common display resolutions for a portable projector include SVGA XGA and 720p 

The cost of a device is not only determined by its resolution but also by its light output acoustic noise output contrast and other characteristics 

A peanut is a herbaceous plant in the legume family Fabaceae It is native to South America Central America and Mexico Peanuts are annual herbaceous plants growing 30 to 50 cm tall 

The peanut plant flowers above ground then develops its pods underground Because of this peanuts are often called groundnuts Other names include arachides goobers mani and pinders This strange legume yields shell covered pods that contain one or more seeds A nut is a hard shelled fruit that comes from a plant whose fruit does not open to release its seed A nut is a composite of the fruit and seed some examples of true nuts are acorns beechnuts chestnuts and hazelnuts So despite the name the plant is not a nut in the biological sense but a legume Peanuts grow by starting out as an above ground flower that due to its heavy weight bends towards the ground The flower eventually burrows underground which is where the peanut actually matures 

The veined brown shell or pod of the peanut contains two or three peanut kernels Each oval shaped kernel or seed is comprised of two off white lobes that are covered by a brownish red skin Peanuts have a hardy buttery and nutty taste 

Peanuts go by various names throughout the world with goober or goober pea being one of the most popular Goober is derived from nguba the name for peanut in the Bantu language spoken in parts of Africa Peanuts are known scientifically as Arachis hypogaea

Peanuts are a favorite food whether eaten alone as a snack food or mixed into candy cookies pies and other bakery products Peanut butter made by grinding the roasted seeds accounts for about one half the peanuts grown in the United States Worldwide however peanuts are grown chiefly to provide peanut oil Farmers in Africa and Asia grow about 90 percent of the worlds peanuts 

Peanuts have been cultivated in South America for a very long time Today most peanuts are eaten roasted and salted Peanut butter peanut brittle and candy bars are also often eaten There are two kinds of peanut butter  chunky and creamy Most American children prefer the chunky kind

The US introduced the peanut to the tropical South America and India China West Africa and itself to become the largest commercial producers of peanuts The peanut was grown mainly for its edible oil except in the US where it was produced for grinding into peanut butter for roasted salted nuts and for use in candy and bakery products A small percentage of the US crop is crushed for oil In the southern US the peanut is used extensively as feed for livestock 

Peanuts are a very good source of monounsaturated fats the type of fat that is important in the heart healthy Mediterranean diet Studies of diets with a special emphasis on peanuts have shown that this little legume is a big ally for a healthy heart

In addition to their monounsaturated fat content peanuts feature an array of other nutrients that in numerous studies have been shown to promote heart health Peanuts are good sources of vitamin E niacin folate protein and manganese In addition peanuts provide resveratrol the phenolic antioxidant also found in red grapes and red wine that is thought to be responsible for the French paradox the fact that in France people consume a diet that is not low in fat but have a lower risk of cardiovascular disease compared to the US With all of the important nutrients provided by peanuts it is no wonder that numerous research studies including the Nurses Health Study that involved over 86000 women have found that frequent nut consumption is related to reduced risk of cardiovascular disease

Four types of peanuts are the most popular Spanish Runner Virginia and Valencia There are also Tennessee Red and Tennessee White types Certain types are preferred for particular uses because of differences in flavor oil content size and shape For many uses the different types are interchangeable Most peanuts marketed in the shell are of the Virginia type along with some Valencias selected for large size and the attractive appearance of the shell Spanish peanuts are used mostly for peanut candy salted nuts and peanut butter Most Runners are used to make peanut butter The various types are distinguished by branching habit and branch length There are numerous varieties of each type of peanut 

Each year new varieties of peanuts are introduced somewhere in the peanut belt of the US or in other countries Introducing a new variety may mean change in the planting rate adjusting the planter harvester dryer cleaner sheller and method of marketing There are two main growth forms bunch and runner Bunch types grow upright while runner types grow near the ground

Spanish Types The small Spanish types are grown in South Africa and in the southwestern and southeastern US Prior to 1940 90 percent of the peanuts grown in Georgia were Spanish types but the trend since then has been larger seeded higher yielding more disease resistant varieties 

Varieties of the Spanish type include Dixie Spanish Improved Spanish 2B GFA Spanish Argentine Spantex Spanette Shaffers Spanish Natal Common White Kernel Varieties Starr Comet Florispan Spanhoma Spancross and Wilco I 

Runner Types Since 1940 there has been a shift to production of Runner type peanuts in the southeastern US This is due to higher yields and wider use in peanut butter and salting as compared to Spanish types 

Varieties of Runners include Southeastern Runner 56 15 Dixie Runner Early Runner Virginia Bunch 67 Bradford Runner Egyptian Giant Rhodesian Spanish Bunch North Carolina Runner 56 15 Florunner and Shulamit 

Virginia Types The large seeded Virginia types are grown in Virginia North Carolina Tennessee and parts of Georgia They are increasing in popularity due to demand for large peanuts for processing particularly for salting confections and roasting in the shells 

Virginia type peanuts are either bunch or running in growth habit The bunch type is upright to spreading It attains a height of 18 to 22 inches and a spread of 28 to 30 inches with 33 to 36 inch rows that seldom cover the ground The pods are borne within a few inches of the base of the plant 

Varieties of Virginia type peanuts include Virginia Bunch Large Virginia Bunch 46 2 Virginia Bunch Small Virginia Bunch 67 Virginia Bunch G2 Virginia Runner G26 NC 4X NC 2 NC 5 Georgia Hybrid 119 20 Holland Jumbo Holland Station Runner Adkins Runner Virginia Runner 26 Virginia Runner G Virginia 56 R Virginia 61 R Florigiant Georgia Hybrid 119 18 Virginia B22 15 Virginia A17 12 Virginia A23 7 and Florida 416 

Valencia Types Valencia types are coarse and they have heavy reddish stems and large foliage They are comparatively tall having a height of 50 inches and a spread of 30 inches Peanut pods are borne on pegs arising from the main stem and the side branches Most of the pods are clustered around the base of the plant and only a few are found several inches away Valencia types are three seeded and smooth with no constriction between the seeds Seeds are oval and tightly crowded into the pods There are two strains one with flesh and the other with red seeds The seed count is 65 to each ounce 

Tennessee Red and Tennessee White Types These are alike except for the color of the seed The plants are similar to Valencia types except that the stems are green to greenish brown and the pods are rough irregular and have a smaller proportion of kernels

The Trans Asian Railway is a project to build a freight railway across Europe and Asia The TAR is a project of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific

The project was started in the 1960s The idea then was to have 8750 miles of rail link between Singapore and Istanbul Turkey Further connections to Europe and Africa were also considered At that time there was not as much shipping and air travel as today and the project promised to make shipping times faster and lower costs between Europe and Asia Progress in developing the TAR was slowed by political and economic problems during the 1960s 1970s and early 1980s By the 1990s the end of the Cold war and normal relations between some countries made it seem more possible to create a rail network across the Asian continent

The TAR was seen as a way to handle the huge increases in international trade between Eurasian nations It was also supposed to make more movement of goods between countries easier It was seen as a way to improve the economies of landlocked countries like Laos Afghanistan Mongolia and the Central Asian republics and make them easier to reach

Much of the railway network already exists but there are still some major gaps A big challenge is the differences in rail gauge across Eurasia There are four different major rail gauges across the continent most of Europe as well as Turkey Iran China and the Koreas use the 1435 mm gauge known as Standard gauge Finland Russia and the former Soviet republics use a 1520 mm gauge most of the railways in India Pakistan Bangladesh and Sri Lanka use a 1676 mm gauge and most of Southeast Asia has metre gauge For the most part the TAR would not change national gauges large machines would be built to move shipping containers from train to train at the breaks of gauge

Levi Strauss was a German born American maker of clothing 

Born as Lb Strauss into a Jewish family in Buttenheim in Franconia Bavaria now a part of Germany In 1847 Strauss his mother and two sisters moved to New York City to join his brothers Jonas and Louis Lb in their dry goods business By 1850 he had adopted the name Levi Strauss 

In 1853 Strauss moved to bustling San Francisco California where the California Gold Rush was still in high gear Levi expected that the mining camps would welcome his buttons scissors thread and bolts of fabric additionally he had yards of canvas sailcloth intended for tent making and as covers for the Conestoga wagons that dotted the landscape next to every stream and river in the area

It was on California Street that Levi and his brother in law David Stern opened a dry goods wholesale business called Levi Strauss Co Levi was often found leading a pack horse heavily laden with merchandise directly into the mining camps found throughout the region The story goes that both prospectors and miners often complaining about the easily torn cotton britches and pockets that split right out gave Levi the idea to make a rugged overall trouser for the miners to wear These were fashioned from bolts of brown canvas sailcloth with gold ore storage pockets that were nearly impossible to split Levi exhausted his original supply of canvas as the demand grew for his hard wearing overalls and so he switched to a sturdy fabric called serge made in Nimes France Originally called serge de Nimes the name was soon shortened to denim

In 1872 Levi received a letter from Jacob Davis a Reno Nevada tailor Davis was one of Levi Strauss regular customers who purchased bolts of cloth from the company to use for his own business In this letter Davis told Levi about the interesting way in which he made pants for his customers he placed metal rivets at the points of strainpocket corners and on the base of the fly As he did not have the money to patent his process he suggested that Levi pay for the paperwork and that they take out the patent together

On May 20 1873 Strauss and Jacob Davis received United States patent 139121 for using copper rivets to strengthen the pockets of denim work pants Levi Strauss Co began manufacturing the first of the famous Levis brand of jeans in San Francisco using fabric from the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company in Manchester New Hampshire 

Levi Strauss died on September 26 1902 at the age of 73 He left his thriving manufacturing and dry goods business to his four nephewsJacob Louis Abraham and Sigmund Sternwho helped rebuild the company after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire The following year Jacob Davis sold back his share of the company

Peter Haas and his family are the primary heirs to the Levi Strauss fortune

Princess Peach Toadstool is a character in the Mario game series In most of the games she appears in she is kidnapped by the reptile monster King Bowser She is the Princess of the Mushroom Kingdom

Princess Peachs looks are different than what they used to be In her first game Super Mario Bros she had red hair and her dress was white She had dark red hair in Super Mario Bros 2 In Super Mario World her looks changed She had blonde hair In the Mario sport series games she wears different dresses because she cannot play well in her normal long pink dress

Her name has been changed In Japan her name was always Peach When Nintendo sold Super Mario Bros in other countries she was called Princess Toadstool In Super Mario 64 her name became Princess Peach Toadstool

Peach appears most often as the damsel in distress always being kidnapped by Bowser Mario must always rescue her In Super Princess Peach the tables are turned and Bowser kidnaps Mario instead Peach must then rescue Mario

Peach has been voiced by two different actresses The first was Leslie Swan The second was Jen Taylor

Princess Daisy is a character from the Super Mario video games series Princess Daisy is the second major female of the Mario series next to Princess Peach

In her first appearance Daisy had pale skin long orange hair and a white pattern on her dress Her appearance in NES Open Tournament Golf is more or less the same aside from her hair now being more of an auburn color In later games such as Mario Tennis and Mario Party 3 her appearance was refined giving her a rounder face a slightly darker skintone and a daisy motif for her accessories with flower jewels appearing on her crown earrings and brooch The daisy motif has stuck ever since though it should be noted that the daisy motif was readily apparent in her concept art for Super Mario Land 

In Mario Party 4 Daisys character design was altered yet again giving her shorter hair a new dress design and once again a paler skin tone Nowadays Daisy no longer has a pale skin complexion instead it is now more of a pink tone Daisy and Peach also have consistently different gloves while Peachs gloves end at around mid triceps Daisys gloves end at the wrists Daisy looks equal in height to Peach though she may appear shorter in some games In her early game depictions Daisy wore a red crown and during some of the Nintendo 64 games she wore a pink crown Nowadays she wears a gold one the same as Peach 

In most of her game appearances Daisy has consistently worn a yellow andor orange color scheme usually in the form of a collared dress with white and orange accents meant to parallel that of Peachs pink themed fashion just as Luigis outfit does to Marios 

In Mario sports titles Daisy are the only two characters to always wear different outfits from their regular ones She is usually depicted in orange shorts with a yellow shirt and daisy accessories In Super Mario Strikers Daisy wears a two piece outfit In Mario Hoops 3 on 3 Daisy normally appears in her usual sports outfit but has a second unlockable costume In Mario Strikers Charged she pretty much looks the same as in Super Mario Strikers but she has cover herself up with armor plating along with other characters leaving a quarter of her leg and her belly exposed

After the Mario Bros defeat Koopa Daisy stays behind in Dinohattan to help her restored father The movie ends with Daisy showing up at Mario and Luigis apartment to alert them that there is a problem apparently setting up a never made sequel

The fixed dose procedure was proposed in 1984 to test a substances acute oral toxicity using fewer animals with less suffering than the older LD50 test which was developed in 1927

FDP uses 10 20 animals to find the dose that produces toxicity signs but not death and from there predicts the lethal dose LD50 uses 60 80 animals to find a dose that kills 50 of animals in a given time FDP sometimes needs retesting using slightly higher or lower doses

Matter is the substance of which all material things are made Matter can be directly experienced through the senses

Matter exhibits various quantitative measurable properties such as mass weight volume density color as well as qualitative properties such as taste and smell for instance

All physical objects in the universe are made of matter galaxies stars and planets rocks water and air Living organisms like plants animals and humans are also composed of matter

These objects can contain energy which is not made of matter but allows them to interact with each other by exchanging kinetic energy  heat light sound waves etc

Humans and probably other animals can also experience emotions or have ideas which are made neither of matter nor of energy as defined in physics

Scientists have long sought to understand the structure and composition of matter by cutting or breaking matter into smaller and smaller pieces Hence living organisms are made up of cells which are composed of molecules which are sets of atoms bounded together Each atom in turn is an assemblage of elementary particles

Physicists also classify matter in a few broad categories called states with quite different properties

A given amount of matter may change from one state to another depending on its temperature and pressure On Earth water can exist simultaneously in three states solid liquid water and gas

Innocence is the opposite of guilt  The adjective is innocent

If someone is innocent of a crime it means that they did not do it If someone is accused of a crime they have to go to court The court will decide whether they are guilty or not guilty People must be treated as innocent unless they are found guilty

Innocence and innocent can also be used in a slightly different way Children are often described as innocent meaning that they think the world is all good and do not yet know about the bad things in life People talk about living in a state of innocence ie children or people with simple minds who have not yet learned that some people are evil In Christian cultures this was sometimes used to mean that children did not know about sex

A symphonic poem or tone poem is a piece of orchestral music which has a story attached to it or describes something such as poem or a painting or any idea which is not music A symphonic poem is a kind of programme music

Symphonic poems were mostly written in the 19th century at the time known as the Romantic period They are normally in one movement lasting perhaps between 10 and 20 minutes Some of the longest ones such as Ein Heldenleben by Richard Strauss are much longer like a symphony with four movements which run into one another

The idea can be seen in Beethovens overtures which tell the story of the opera or play which is about to be performed Composers such as Felix Mendelssohn then started to write overtures which told a story but were not attached to any opera Fingals Cave describes the sea lapping against the rocks of a cave in the Scottish Hebrides 

Franz Liszt was the composer who made the symphonic poem an important musical form He wrote twelve works which he called Symphonische Dichtung because the music developed in the same way as in a symphony One example is Mazeppa which describes the poem by Victor Hugo about a wild horse that carries a man tied to his mane until he is rescued by the Ukrainians and made into their chief

Other composers who wrote symphonic poems include Sergei Rachmaninoff Modest Mussorgsky Camille Saint Sans Claude Debussy Jean Sibelius Bedich Smetana Antonn Dvok Pyotr Tchaikovsky and Csar Franck

The opening of Richard Strausss tone poem Also sprach Zarathustra has become particularly famous in recent years through its use in the movie 2001 A Space Odyssey

A melody in music is a group of notes of various pitches which are played one after another Together they make a tune in the same way that a group of words make a sentence Some people like to sing melodies Melodies have rhythm

In music melody contrasts with harmony Harmony means notes which are played at the same time like chords Composers often think of a melody and then add harmony to it 

Some music has more than one melody happening at the same time When this happens throughout the whole piece it is called polyphonic music Rounds and fugues are types of polyphonic music If the other melody only happens sometimes then the second melody is called a countermelody

The adjective of melody is melodic There is also the adjective melodious which means a sweet sounding melody 

Music that does not have an obvious melody may be hard to understand

Many melodies are easy to sing while others are difficult to sing Still other melodies are impossible to sing Those melodies can still be played on instruments such as the piano or guitar
