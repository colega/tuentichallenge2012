Oceanic crust is the part of Earths lithosphere that is under the ocean basins

Oceanic crust is primarily composed of mafic rocks or sima It is thinner than continental crust or sial generally less than 10 kilometers thick however it is more dense having a mean density of about 33 gcm3 

Oceanic crust generally does not last longer than 200 million years It is continuously being created at oceanic ridges At these ridges hot magma rises into the crust and cools pushing the crust apart at the ridge The continuous formation of new oceanic crust pushes the older crust away from the mid ocean ridge As it moves away from the ridge the crust becomes cooler and denser while the sediment may build on top of it

The continental crust is the layer of granitic sedimentary and metamorphic rocks which form the continents and the areas of shallow seabed close to their shores known as continental shelves 

It consists mostly of sialic rock It is less dense than the material of the Earths mantle which consists of mafic rock Continental crust is also less dense than oceanic crust though it is considerably thicker mostly 35 to 40 km versus the average oceanic thickness of around 7 10 km About 40 of the Earths surface is now underlain by continental crust

Shift work is a working practice which is designed to use all 24 hours of a day and not only the standard working day hours

A day for example can be divided into three eight hour shifts An employee only works one of the shifts in each day The first shift is in the morning the second shift is in the afternoon and evening and the third shift is overnight

The second shift also known as the swing shift in some places is the work shift which takes place in the afternoon and evening It usually extends from 4 PM to midnight or from 3 PM to 10 PM

The third shift the night shift is usually from 12 midnight to 07 or 08 in the morning

The World Health Organization decided in December 2007 that shift work especially work at night probably causes cancer

Value Added Tax is often called by its initial letters VAT or VAT It is the English name of a tax that is added to things sold in the European Union It is like a sales tax that is charged in some US States

The tax is paid every time goods are sold

The tax can be complicated to work out because every business or person has to charge the tax and have an invoice to show they have paid some tax The only person who pays the full amount of tax is the customer of the shop

The government also charges VAT on some services This is because some companies do not make a thing which can be used instead they do something to help a customer

For example a garage owner might sell a spare part for a customers car The garage owner charges VAT because spare parts are goods If the garage owner helps the customer by fitting the spare parts into the car the garage owner would charge extra for his time and would also charge VAT on the amount he charged for the service of fitting the parts

The movie was also made into an award winning stage musical The stage show first opened on November 13 1997 in New York City and was a big success A version opened later in London England Many other shows of The Lion King have been shown across the world

Scar lies to Simba about a dangerous place called the Elephant Graveyard Scar says that only brave lions go there causing Simba to be interested even though Mufasa has forbidden Simba from going there Simba lies to his mother Sarabi about going to the Water Hole when he is actually going to the Elephant Graveyard Simbas friend Nala and Zazu the kings friend go with Simba Simba and Nala trick Zazu with the song I Just Cant Wait to be King and run away from him Simba and Nala find the Elephant Graveyard but are chased by the three hyenas Shenzi Banzai and Ed Mufasa saves his son and Nala and takes them both home Mufasa speaks to Simba alone and explains to Simba that being brave is not about looking for danger He also explains that the great kings of the past look down from the stars and watch over Simba Scar in the Elephant Graveyard is angry with the hyenas because they did not kill Simba It is revealed that the hyenas are working for Scar during Scars song Be Prepared

The next day Scar takes Simba into a gorge where he explains that Mufasa has a wonderful surprise waiting Scar has actually planned a wildebeest stampede with the hyenas Simba is trapped in the gorge as the wildebeest run towards him Scar tells Mufasa that Simba is in trouble and Mufasa rescues his son Scar then throws Mufasa into the stampede and Mufasa dies Scar blames Simba for the death of Mufasa and Simba runs away Scar becomes king and tells everyone that Simba and Mufasa are dead Simba runs to a desert and collapses He is rescued by Timon the meerkat and Pumbaa the warthog Timon and Pumbaa live in the jungle and are very relaxed which they show in their song Hakuna Matata Timon and Pumbaa look after Simba until Simba is an adult lion

One day a lioness comes to the jungle and tries to kill and eat Pumbaa Simba fights the lioness because he wants to save Pumbaas life While the two lions are fighting Simba finds out that the lioness is his friend Nala They are very happy to see each other and they fall in love Nala wants Simba to go home and fight Scar because Scar is a bad king Simba will not go home because he thinks that he killed Mufasa and he does not want his family to know Rafiki comes to the jungle and takes Simba to a field In the sky above the field Mufasas ghost appears and tells Simba that he must go home because Simba is the right king After this Simba goes home to Pride Rock Nala Timon and Pumbaa follow him When they get to Pride Rock they find that the land is dry and the animals have gone

At Pride Rock Simba sees Scar hitting Sarabi This makes Simba angry and he tries to make Scar leave Pride Rock Scar does not leave and makes Simba fall over the edge of Pride Rock Simba does not fall and holds on to the edge Scar thinks that he was won so he tells Simba the truth about the death of Mufasa  that Scar actually killed Mufasa Simba is upset and a big fight happens The lionesses fight the hyenas and Simba fights Scar While the fighting is going on lightning hits a dead tree and starts a fire Scar and Simba fight on top of Pride Rock Scar does not want to die and lies to Simba that the hyenas are to blame for everything Another fight happens and Simba throws Scar over the edge Scar does not die after the fall but the hyenas attack and kill him the hyenas are angry that Scar blamed them Rain falls and puts out the fire Simba walks to the top of Pride Rock and roars Much later the animals come back At the end of the movie Rafiki picks up Simba and Nalas daughter and lifts her up high above Pride Rock so the animals below can see

The X Window System is a set of protocols and programs It is also known as X11 or simply X It can manage windows and other components of a graphical user interface on a bitmap display This way of doing graphics is most common in Unix like operating systems

X provides the basic components to build GUI environments drawing and moving windows on the screen and interacting with a mouse or a keyboard X does not say what the user interface should look like different client programs handle this Different X11 based environments have radically different designs X is not a part of the operating system instead it is built as an additional application layer on top of the operating system kernel

Unlike previous display protocols X was specifically designed to be used over network connections rather than on a display near the computer X has network transparency the machine where an application program runs need not be the users local machine

X was developed at MIT in 1984 The current protocol version X11 appeared in September 1987 The XOrg Foundation leads the X project with the current reference implementation version 11 release 73 available as free software under the MIT License and similar permissive licenses

Mammaliaformes is a clade that contains the mammals and their closest extinct relatives 

Living members of the clade include the monotremes marsupials and the eutherians 

Mammaliforms have highly specialized molar teeth with cusps and flat regions for grinding food This system is unique in present mammals although it seems to have evolved convergently in pre mammals more than once Instead of having many teeth that are frequently replaced mammals have one set of baby teeth and later one set of adult teeth which fit together precisely This may help to grind food and make it easier to digest 

Lactation and fur along with other features also characterize the Mammaliaformes though these traits are difficult to study in the fossil record The fossilized remains of Castorocauda lutrasimilis are an exception to this

Alternatively Class Mammalia takes place of Mammaliaformes and includes all members of that clade

The pineal is a small endocrine gland in the middle of the brain of humans and other vertebrates It makes and releases the hormone named melatonin

There is almost no melatonin in the blood in the daytime At the end of the day melatonin in the blood allows sleepiness in humans and other animals which sleep at night There is melatonin in the blood all night while the person or animal is sleeping In the morning there is less and less melatonin in the blood When light enters the eyes the melatonin of the blood goes away

Some people have circadian rhythm sleep disorders which make them sleepy much earlier or much later than normal The most common one is Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder People with DSPD usually go to bed at 3 in the morning or later but they sleep normally for at least eight hours

Gamma Hydroxybutyric acid is a chemical substance Small quantities of it can be found in the central nervous system of many animals It can also be discovered in wine beef and small citrus fruits In the central nervous system GHB is involved in the exchange of information It interacts with other neurotransmitters such as gamma Aminobutyric acid 

Many countries have regulated it as an illegal drug even though it can be used in medicine It can be used as an anesthetic and a sedative In the past it has been used to treat insomnia and depression It can also help people who have a problem with alcoholism or cataplexy In patients with narcolepsy it has been used to treat sleepiness during the day Athletes have used it to make their performance better

The drug has been used as a recreational drug This is because it can make a person euphoric Many countries have made it illegal if it is not used as medicine Its most common name as an illegal drug is probably liquid Ecstasy However ecstasy is a different drug that is unrelated to GHB

GHB is naturally produced in the human bodys cells Its chemical structure is similar to that of ketone body beta hydroxybutyrate As a supplement or drug it is used most as a salt GHB is also produced as a result of fermentation Small amounts of the substance can be found in some beers and wines 

GHB can cause GHB comas This is when people faint or become unconscious This is what causes most deaths

GHB is a depressant of the central nervous system Its effects have been described as similar to those of alcohol or ecstasy People feel in a good mood They also lower their inhibitions If the dose is increased the symptoms include nausea drowsiness breathing problems amnesia unconsciousness and death The effect of GHB lasts between 15 and 3 hours but may be longer They can be longer if the drug is mixed with alcohol or a large dosis was taken

Certain substances are changed to GHB in the stomach One such drug called pro drug is gamma butyrolactone Such products are also a problem Lots of them are used in industrial processes An example of this are paint strippers What is fine for use in industry may be bad for humans

The Co operative Party is a small socialist political party in the United Kingdom Its candidates must be members of the Labour Party as well and stand as Labour and Co operative Party candidates

It is the political part of the wider British co operative movement and all members of the party must be members of a co operative business Those who want to stand for election must also be members of the Labour Party

Most of the partys money is from grants made by the retail co operative societies and from the fee charged for managing the political affairs of Co operatives UK formerly known as the Co operative Union Local parties are not based on constituencies but around a major local retail society which gives most of the money a local Party Council has The Party council organises local branches to organise local activity and liaise with Constituency Labour Parties Some Parties exist without Society support known as voluntary parties 

At first the Co operative Party was mostly concerned with the problems of the co op movement Since the 1930s it has become a more mainstream political but it still wants better recognition and protection for co operative business the social economy and to advance support for co operatives and co operation across Europe and the developing world The party also stands for a sustainable economy and society

In 2005 there were 29 MPs in the Co operative Parliamentary Group who are also members of the Parliamentary Labour Party in the British House of Commons 8 Members of the Scottish Parliament 4 Members of the Welsh Assembly and 11 Members of the House of Lords as well as over 700 local councillors There is also an informal Co operative Party group in the European Parliament

The election agreement between the Co operative and Labour Parties means that 30 candidates can stand as Labour Co operative candidates and get money for election expenses from the Co operative Party There are many other Labour MPs who are Co operative Party members but are not sponsored One of these was Gareth Thomas MP chair of the Co operative Party since 2001 and of the Co operative Congress in 2003 who was invited to join the parliamentary group in 2003 The Party has not registered a logo with the electoral commission for use on ballot papers as candidates use the Labour Party Rose logo Under UK law a party and a logo must be registered if either are to be used on a ballot paper in an election

The Party holds an annual conference The 2006 conference was held in Sheffield in September 2006

The current General Secretary is Michael Stephenson

The Joint Parliamentary Committee was set up in 1881 by The Co operative Union It was not set up to get MPs elected but to watch over what was happening in parliament and to lobby sympathetic MPs The Co operative Union Annual Congress tried to get a regular party set up but the retail societies would not give any money

At the start of the war the many retail societies in the Co op movement grew partly because they were very public about anti profiteering Making a large profit in war time was seen as not being patriotic or helping the country When conscription was started and food and fuel supplies restricted the co op societies began to suffer The co ops were started by ordinary workers but the government distribution committees and draft tribunals were usually run by members of the upper classes and gentry Co ops smaller amounts of food to sell and coop managers were often drafted whereas business opponents were able to have even clerks declared vital for the war effort Co op Societies were also made to pay excess profits tax even though as co operatives they made no profits

The 1917 Congress in Swansea decided to set up a Co operative Party the decision was passed by 1979 votes to 201

An Emergency Political Conference was held on 18 October 1917 As a result the Central Co operative Parliamentary Representation Committee was formed in 1917 with the objective of putting co operators into the House of Commons This was soon re named the Co operative Party 

At first the party put forward its own candidates The first was H J May later Secretary of the International Co operative Alliance He was unsuccessful at the 1918 Prestwich by election 

Ten people stood in the 1918 general election One candidate was elected Alfred Waterson who became a Member of Parliament for the Kettering seat Waterson took the Labour whip in Parliament In 1919 151 Co operative Party local councillors Waterson retired from Parliament in 1922 but four new Co operative MPs were elected that same year including AV Alexander All of them took the Labour whip Six were elected in 1923 and five in 1924

However since the 1927 Cheltenham Agreement the party has had an electoral agreement with the Labour Party which allows for a limited number of Labour Co operative candidates This means that the parties do not waste resources by opposing each other The agreement has been changed several times most recently in 2003 The 2003 agreement was the first between the Labour Party and the Co operative Party instead of the Co operative Societies After the first formal agreement nine Labour Co op MPs were elected at the 1929 general election and Alexander was made a cabinet minister However only one was returned at the 1931 election against the backdrop of a massive defeat for Labour

The Labour party recovered from the bad election of 1931 and was in government during World War II This helped the Co operative Party through the formal election links In 1945 23 Labour Co op MPs were elected and two had high office in the Labour government  Alexander and Alfred Barnes who had been chair of the Party

After the war the co operative movement declined and so did the influence of the Party By 1983 only eight Labour Co op MPs were elected However in 1997 all 23 candidates won seats in Parliament and in 2001 only one was defeated Faye Tinnion who had stood against the Leader of the Conservative Party William Hague Gordon Brown is very interested in the co operative principles of self help and this support allowed the co operative movement to make representations and sponsor important bills on updating company law employee share ownership and micro generation of energy

A Wild Weasel is a nickname for an aircraft in the United States Air Force that is supposed to destroy enemy anti aircraft guns surface to air missiles and other ground attack weapons by seeking them out with radar and destroying them with missiles

The idea was first though of in 1965 during the Vietnam War because North Vietnamese surface to air missiles or SAMs were destroying American aircraft The first Wild Weasel airplane was the F 100 Super Sabre a variant of the F 86 Sabre In 1966 the F 105 Thunderchief took the job 

After that a new kind of F 4 Phantom IIs the G model was used as a Wild Weasel During the Gulf War of 1991 Wild Weasel missions were done by the F 16 Fighting Falcon a light fighter bomber that can also battle enemy fighter aircraft Currently the F 16 still does this They were being used in the Iraq War 

In the Vietnam War the main missile used by Wild Weasels was the AGM 45 Shrike Currently some of the weapons used by the Wild Weasel planes includes the AGM 88 HARM and the AGM 65 Maverick air to ground missiles They can also have ALQ 131 and ALQ 184 pods that can mess up enemy radar 

The F 105 Thunderchief was a bomber during the Vietnam War It first flew in 1955 and was introduced in 1958 It was used as a bomber but was later replaced by the F 4 Phantom II and the F 111 Raven But it was still in service for a while as a Wild Weasel It could carry an electronic counter measures pod that could mess up the enemy radar

A heraldic badge is not a part of an armigers coat of arms but it is granted by the same body as a coat of arms

The badge is designed to be used by the supporters of an armiger A mediaeval knight would have a coat of arms but his supporters or followers would not be allowed to use the coat of arms instead they would use a badge to help identify themselves to each other and to other people

Today many English towns and cities have a coat of arms Usually the mayor and council are the only ones allowed to used the full coat of arms The departments of the council use a badge and it is the badge which is painted on council vehicles etc to identify them

Badges like coats of arms can only be used with the permission of the person to whom they were granted

A Postal code is a series of numbers or letters and numbers used by a post office to help identify where a letter or parcel should be sent The code can be read by machines this speeds up sorting mail

In the United Kingdom the first part of the post code has one or two letters and one or two numbers This identifies the post town and an area in the post town The second part is used to identify an even smaller area down to just one street or a few house in a long street

The post town is the main town in an area Sometimes this is a lot bigger than the real town Ipswich for example is the post town for most of east Suffolk

In Europe most postal codes are all numbers Often the one or two letter country code is put in front of the code to make sure that towns and cities are not mixed up or for international post

In France the first two numbers of the postal code relate to the department Codes for Monaco start with 98 as if it was part of France but has the letters MC instead of F for international mail

The Bethlehem Housing Authority provides social housing in Bethlehem Pennsylvania

The Bethlehem Housing Authority was formed in 1939 Its job was to build houses for the people living in Bethlehem which is a city in eastern Pennsylvania 

The National Housing Act was one of President Franklin Delano Roosevelts first tries to make better the living conditions of Americans badly affected by the Great Depression of the 1930s Bethlehems Housing Authority was one of the first in the nation Robert Nuemeyer became the Authoritys first executive director in 1939 BHAs first board consisted of chairman Robert Pfeifle Weir Jepson Merritt Kreidler Lt Colonel William Coyle and Andrew W Litzenberger

The first thing the BHA built was low income public housing That means the houses were built for people who did not earn a lot of money and they were not built to be sold to make money The new houses were called Pembroke Village They were on reclaimed farmland in the northeast part of the city This area was near the border with the boroughs of Freemansburg Steel City and Bethlehem Township 

Pembroke Village was planned to have 202 houses or apartments and a community buildingoffice At about this time the US entered into World War II The war meant there was very little building in the US But Bethlehem Steels factory was more or less turned over completely toward providing goods for the war effort Thousands of workers were brought into Bethlehem to help the plant work for 24 hours a day This meant a lot of houses were needed in the city The government and the housing authority got extra land and built three communities as temporary war housing 700 homes for these workers were built at Parkridge South Terrace and Clearfield Pembroke Village was hurried to completion and its 202 units were set aside as permanent war housing meaning that at the end of the war Pembroke would revert to low income housing while the others would be demolished

After the end of WWII Bethlehem had another housing crisis Men were leaving the armed forces and going back home From about the start of 1946 the population of the United States increased greatly In Bethlehem the city population increased from 50000 to 75000 by 1960 

This meant that a lot of affordable housing was needed The BHA decided to keep the Parkridge South Terrace and Clearfield units and use them as public housing 

The BHA also planned to build another 500  600 units next to Pembroke on a former family farm along Pembroke Road These buildings would increase Bethlehems public housing stock to more than 1400 units 

By June of 1950 firms had offered to build Fairmount for 96200000 By the end of the year the Marvine Village bid was also approved for 39 million A lot of the Fairmount project was paid for by the State of Pennsylvania It stayed part of the states housing inventory until the late 1970s 

By 1952 Mr Nuemeyer became ill and stepped down He was replaced by Ralph J Bartholomew who was a longtime member of the banking community During Mr Bartholomews tenure the housing authority started an expansion program designed to help the growing needs of the elderly population

In 1962 BHA showed plans for its first development designed for older people The Robert Pfeifle Homes was a 50 unit community located in the northeast area It had ten buildings They were among the very first of their type in the United States In the next ten years the BHA would design and build more public housing for seniors including the Litzenberger House the Bodder Building and the Bartholomew Building and the Monocacy Tower BHA wwwbha645comnow has some 450 apartments to serve the older adults in need of affordable housing

At around this time Mr Bartholomew passed away and his successor was brought in from the Department of Housing and Urban Development Frank V Loretti with a background in labor relations became the BHAs third director

Frank Loretti wanted to modernize the way the authority worked and was organized He wanted to use computers for the authoritys records and other functions In addition the board wanted to begin an authority wide building modernization program

During this time a plan was formulated to address the authoritys aging infrastructure The war time era South Terrace Parkridge and Clearfield projects were demolished South Terrace and Parkridge were rebuilt between 1985 and 1991 and all other buildings were modernized using capital fund money which was made available by the federal government 

Also during this period various management functions were centralized for greater organization and efficiency The maintenance shops were also centralized within one modern facility in 1978 A Central Supply facility was dedicated in 1977

The current executive director is Clara A Kendy Today BHAs challenge is similar to all other housing agencies Federal subsidy reductions of up to 15 have caused housing authorities to become leaner and to look toward innovation in order to succeed

BHA has several new ideas including homeownership initiatives where the authority connects eligible tenants with opportunities to help them own their own home One such example is a partnership with Habitat For Humanity Economic self sufficiency is a goal that BHA continuously tries to help its residents achieve

Today the Bethlehem Housing Authority manages 1430 conventional housing units within ten developments serving the city of Bethlehem In addition there are nearly 500 Housing Choice Vouchers available for eligible families HCV was formerly known as Section 8 housing The authority also has various recreational and social programs for tenants of all ages 

In 2007 BHAs new First Tee Golf Learning program received a national merit award recognizing it as an innovative recreationlearning program for children During its 70th anniversary in 2009 it proudly broke ground for a brand new community in northeast Bethlehem The first Bayard Homes will be rented during the first months of the year

Les Six is French for The Six Les Six were a group of six French composers who were friends around the year 1920 They were young at the time and they shared a lot of ideas about music The composer Eric Satie called them Les Nouveaux Jeunes but then a man called Henri Collet called them Les Six in an article he was writing and that name was always used for them after that

In their music they tried to be different from Richard Wagner and other composers of Romantic music and different from Debussy and Ravel who had been writing Impressionistic music They also wanted to write in a simple way instead of using complicated rhythms such as those of Stravinsky or twelve tone music like Arnold Schoenberg Many of their pieces were quite short They liked strong masculine music especially jazz 

The six composers did not stay together for very long as they soon developed their own personal styles in their compositions

It was really only in 1920 that all six composers were together They had all been inspired by Jean Cocteau and Eric Satie By 1921 Louis Durey had already left the group Les Six continued to be associated with the style of French music from around the 1920s They still remained friends and used to visit a bar known as La Gaya which became Le Boeuf sur le Toit the title of Milhauds ballet The group published an album of piano pieces together called Album des Six Five of the members worked together on the music for Cocteaus work Les Maris de la Tour Eiffel 

The name The Six was a reference to the group of Russian composers who had been known as The Five

Georges Auric was a French composer He was one of the six composers who became known as Les Six

Auric was a child prodigy He composed a lot of music from the age of 10 but most of these early works he destroyed later He grew up in Montpellier In 1913 his parents moved to Paris so that he could study at the Paris Conservatoire He studied with the composer Vincent DIndy at the Schola Cantorum

By the time he had joined Les Six he had already become a composer with a strong personal style of writing His music is often energetic and aggressive 

Auric wrote ballet music for Diaghilev When Jean Cocteau started making motion pictures at the beginning of the 1930s Auric began writing film music He wrote soundtracks for a number of French and British films and then for Hollywood movies too The Song from Moulin Rouge made it to the hit parade 

In 1962 he gave up writing for moving pictures when he became director of the Opra National de Paris and then chairman of SACEM the French Performing Rights Society Auric continued to write classical chamber music especially for wind instruments for the rest of his life

Louis Durey was a French composer He was the oldest but probably the least well known of the six composers who are called Les Six

Louis Durey was the son of a businessman He had no idea that he wanted to be a composer until he heard the opera Pllas et Mlisande by Claude Debussy He was then already 19 years old He taught himself how to compose

Durey became a member of the group called Les Six in 1920 However he did not take part in the music they wrote together in 1921 called Les Maris de la Tour Eiffel This made Jean Cocteau very annoyed 

Durey became interested in left wing politics and later joined the Communist Party During the years of the Nazi occupation of World War II he worked with the French Resistance and wrote anti Fascist songs After the war he had strong Communist ideas This made it difficult for him to be successful in the world of music In 1950 he got the job of music critic for a communist newspaper in Paris

He wrote a lot of music during his life but there were many years when he wrote nothing He composed songs chamber music and choral works

Louis Durey died at Saint Tropez Provence Alpes Cte dAzur France

Arthur Honegger was a Swiss composer who was born in France and lived a large part of his life in Paris He was a member of the group of composers called Les Six His most popular piece of music is an orchestral work called Pacific 231 which imitates the sound of a steam locomotive

In the early 1920s Honegger became famous with the dramatic psalm Le Roi David which is still often sung by choirs He wrote a lot of music between the wars including the oratorio Jeanne dArc au bcher one of his best works It tells the story of Joan of Arc

During World War II Honegger could not leave Paris He joined the French Resistance He continued to write very serious music including four symphonies and some religious music

Honegger loved trains As a student he had spent some time travelling to Paris twice a week by train from Le Havre His popular orchestral work Pacific 231 describes a train on the Canadian Pacific Railway It was an early piece written in 1923 

In 1947 Honegger suffered a very severe heart attack and after that he composed little A second heart attack killed him eight years later 

Honeggers music is different to that of the other members of Les Six partly because Honegger liked the Romantic music of Wagner Strauss and Reger His music is tonal but with numerous strong dissonances His musical style was also influenced by the music of Bach

Darius Milhaud was a French composer He was a member of the group called Les Six He is one of the most important French composers of the 20th century He wrote more than 400 compositions His music is often influenced by jazz and polytonality

Milhauds family were Jewish He grew up in Aix en Provence His father was an almond dealer When he was very small he often listened to the songs that were being sung by the women who were sorting out the nuts They were folksongs from the Provence When he was a young man he liked to go for walks in the Provence country This was an important part of his life

Milhauds parents liked music His father was a pianist and often played at local music gatherings His mother had a nice contralto voice When he was seven he learned to play the violin He loved the music of Claude Debussy whom he met once 

Milhaud studied in Paris at the Paris Conservatory where he met Arthur Honegger and Germaine Tailleferre who were also to become members of Les Six He studied composition under Charles Marie Widor and harmony and counterpoint with Andr Gdalge He also studied privately with Vincent dIndy He taught himself to play the piano In Paris he was able to listen to music by a lot of great composers

He was terribly sad when a close friend was killed in World War I He decided to go to Brazil He worked there for nearly two years deciphering codes He liked the sounds of the jungle These sounds were to have an impact on his music The other great influence was jazz which he heard in 1922 in New York

Milhaud returned to France and worked very hard He often travelled In 1940 he had to emigrate to the United States because the Nazis were arresting Jewish musicians In America he gave lectures

His health became poor He had rheumatoid arthritis for nearly all his adult life and by 1948 he was in a wheelchair He still continued to travel and to teach for as long as possible Probably his most famous student was Dave Brubeck

In 1925 Milhaud married his cousin an actress called Madeleine Milhaud She often performed speaking parts in her husbands musical works In his final years she devoted herself to looking after him She died in Paris on 17 January 2008 at the age of 105

Difference in electric potential is also known as voltage or electric potential energy difference The unit for electric potential is the volt in memory of Alessandro Volta Electric potential is like a push Electrons are pushed through a wire by the voltage

A good analogy is water in a river The water is like electrons flowing When the river goes over a waterfall the water drops and loses energy When the electrons go through a circuit or wire they drop in voltage and lose energy

What happens is there are positive ions on one side and negative ions on the other side The negative ones are attracted to the positive ones but can not get to them because there is a wall between them in the battery So you make them go around the house and through the back door ie you make a circuit which goes from the negative side to the positive side Then the negative ions go through the wire and mix with the positive ones When all the negative ones go to the other side the battery is flat and needs to be recharged this takes awhile though because there are 10 to the 25 of negative electrons Think of a turbine in water Water passes through it moving down and turns it When the negative ions move through the wire they go through things like bulbs kettles etc instead of moving them they crash into them only some go through when they crash the make light and heat and this is why we have all these electrical things today because negative ions crash into things

In 1923 Tailleferre began to spend a great deal of time with Maurice Ravel at his home in Monfort LAmaury Ravel encouraged her to enter the Prix de Rome Competition In 1925 she married Ralph Barton an American caricaturist and moved to Manhattan New York She stayed in the United States until 1927 when she and her husband returned to France They divorced shortly afterwards

Tailleferre wrote many of her most important works during the 1920s including her 1st Piano Concerto The Harp Concertino the Ballets Le Marchand dOiseaux and La Nouvelle Cythre which Diaghilev had asked her to write for his ballet company 

In the 1930s she composed the Concerto for Two Pianos Choeurs Saxophones and Orchestra the Violin Concerto the Operas Zoulana and Le Marin de Bolivar and her masterwork La Cantate de Narcisse which she wrote with Paul Valry Her work in film music included Le Petit Chose

After the war in 1946 she returned to her home in France where she composed a lot more music much of which was not published until after her death She was accompanist at a childrens music and movement class She wrote shorter pieces towards the end of her life because her arthritis made writing difficult

Tailleferre carried on composing until a few weeks before her death in November 1983

A clade is a group of organisms with a common ancestor and all its descendents Such a clade is monophyletic The term clade was coined by English biologist Julian Huxley

Cladistics is the method of classifying species of organisms into groups called clades 

Birds dinosaurs crocodiles and all other descendants of their most recent common ancestor form a clade In the terms of biological systematics a clade is a single branch on the tree of life a monophyletic group Biological classification needs such a natural group of organisms to be put together and given a taxonomic name 

This brings classification in line with phylogeny In cladistics clades are the only acceptable units 

Some versions of cladistics have been the subject of controversyp226

The term clade was introduced in 1958 by Julian Huxley cladistic by Cain and Harrison in 1960 and cladist by Mayr in 1965 Hennig referred to his own approach as phylogenetic systematics From the time of his original formulation until the end of the 1980s cladistics remained a minority approach to classification 

In the 1990s it rapidly became the dominant method of classification in evolutionary biology Computers made it possible to process large quantities of data about organisms and their characteristics At about the same time the development of effective sequence analysis techniques made it possible to apply cladistic methods of analysis to biochemical and molecular features of organisms as well as to anatomical ones

For some decades in the mid to late twentieth century a commonly used methodology was numerical taxonomyp221 This made made no attempt to resolve phylogeny only similarities The weakness of this approach was that it left out the connection between classification and evolution

Phylogenetic nomenclature is classification using cladistics to show evolutionary relationships It is now the most usual type of classification used for groups where there is good evidence of how they evolved

Proponents of phylogenetic nomenclature enumerate key distinctions between phylogenetic nomenclature and Linnaean taxonomy as follows

Critics of phylogenetic nomenclature include Ashlock Mayr and Williams Some of their criticisms include

Pangaea was the global supercontinent which formed in the Palaeozoic era The process started about 450 million years ago and was complete by 250 mya

The collisions between continental plates formed the greatest mountain ranges in the history of the Phanerozoic eon The mountain building included the Caledonian orogeny and the Alleghenian orogeny The low mountains of Scotland Scandinavia and eastern North America are the ground down remains of these vast events

Pangea was the latest of a series of global supercontinents They have formed at various times since plate tectonics began on Earth

There were three major phases in the break up of Pangaea 

Pangaea broke up about 180200 million years ago in the early middle Jurassic It broke into supercontinents Laurasia and Gondwana before each of these broke into the current continents One rift resulted in a new ocean the North Atlantic Ocean

The second major phase in the break up of Pangaea began in the Lower Cretaceous when Gondwana separated into multiple continents

The third major and final phase of the break up of Pangaea occurred in the early Cenozoic Laurasia split when North AmericaGreenland broke free from Eurasia opening the Norwegian Sea about 6055 Ma The Atlantic and Indian Oceans continued to expand closing the Tethys Ocean

The break up of Pangaea continues today in the Great Rift Valley

Al Anbar is a Western Region of Iraq The largest province in Iraq by area it shares borders with Syria Jordan and Saudi Arabia Al Anbar is overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim Arab Its capital is Ar Ramadi

The name of the province is from the Arabic Anbr and means granaries in Arabic as this region was the primary entrepot on the western borders of Lakhmid Kingdom The famous Sunni theologian Abu Hanifa an Numan who developed Hanafi one of the Sunni Madhhabs is associated with this region

Before 1976 the province was known as Ramadi before 1962 it was known as Dulaim

All the inhabitants are Sunni Muslims from Dulaim tribe

The Euphrates River flows diagonally from the north to the southeast passing through six of the eight districts Al Qaim Anah Haditha Ht Ramadi Fallujah Abu Ghraib Ar Rutba forms the majority of the Governorates area occupying the large desert area in the southwest

According to recent statistics There are an estimated 20 million weapons in Al Anbar opposed to an estimated population of 2 million according to official reports a ratio of ten firearms for every citizen Its traditional for Dulaim tribe members to keep a weapons at home The arms included mortars surface to air missiles anti tank shells rocket propelled grenades as well as large quantities of mines explosives and ammunition

The city of Fallujah is also in Anbar The Iraqi resistance were widely considered to be stronger in this province than in any other in Iraq and hostility toward Against American forces

In late 2004 to 2007 a series of operations by US forces was not successful in driving resistance from Anbar Additionally in early 2006 several clanssome including resistance groups raids against Americans forces in the area the increase of sectarian violence in baghdad and the continued resistance control of several cities in Anbar showed that fighting in the region was far from over Reports in March 2006 suggested that the Anbar capital Ramadi had largely fallen under resistance control along with most of the region as a result the US sent an additional 3500 Marines to re establish control of the region

The Iraq war website icasualties has reported that 1842 Iraqi soldier and 2220 US Soldier and 7542 Mercenary were killed in action in Anbar province between the start of 2004 and the end of February 2006 Many of these died in and around Fallujah and Ramadi

Anbar with Ramadi and Haditha and Hit and Al Qaim and Fallujah in particular is known for its inhabitants strong tribal and religious traditions Allegedly former President Saddam Hussein was constantly wary of the volatile nature of the area All the inhabitants of the province are Sunni Muslims from the Dulaim tribe

The Washington Post reported on September 11 2006 that according to a recent U S Marine Corps secret report the prospects for securing that countrys western Anbar province are dim and there is almost nothing the US military can do there reporting that there are no functioning Iraqi government institutions in Anbar leaving a vacuum that has been filled by the Resistance group which has become the provinces most significant political force Another person familiar with the report said it describes Anbar as beyond repair a third said it concludes that the United States has been defeated in Anbar

according to local government tribal resistance had yet to materialize and Islamist forces affiliated with the Shura Council staged military parades in cities throughout Anbar province including Ramadi and Haqlaniyah and Fallujah 

In November another US military report was filed confirming the earlier warning that Anbar was falling under resistance control The report stated that the social and political situation has deteriorated to a point that US and Iraqi troops are no longer capable of militarily defeating the insurgency and Dulaim tribe in al Anbar and that nearly all government institutions from the village to provincial levels have disintegrated or have been thoroughly corrupted and infiltrated by Al Qaeda in Iraq or a smattering of other resistance groups leaving the insurgency and al Qaeda in Iraq as the dominant organization of influence in al Anbar 

for that the American commanders threatened the Dulaim Sheikhs that ramadi be over Attack like Fallujah or you Fighting Al Qaeda resistance in Anbar but the Sheikhs of the Dulaim tribe rejected that until Al Qaeda killed one of the Sheikhs of Albu Resha clan

Sattar Abu Risha the son of Sheikh who killed by Al Qaeda had put on him self to fighting Al Qaeda

Sheikh Sattar Abu Risha Asked from Americans to release the Sunni arrestees and Establishment Sunni Federalism in Western Iraq and The Sunni areas and provinces led by him Versus to fight Al Qaeda in Anbar and the American commanders agreed Sheikh Sattar Abu Risha with 60 thousand man from his clan It a short time Expelled Al Qaeda from Anbar

After the Americans forces Stop attacking and bombing The Sunni Towns and cities included ramadi A recent New York Times article describes Anbar as undergoing a surprising transformation Violence is ebbing in many areas shops and schools are reopening police forces are growing It continues Yet for all the indications of a heartening turnaround in Anbar the situation as it appeared during more than a week spent with American troops in Ramadi and Falluja in early April is at best uneasy and fragile citing a lack of municipal services weak local government and failure to stop all the insurgent attacks Still There are some people who would say weve won the war out here Im cautiously optimistic as were going forward 

However these challenges have been overcome as January 10th 2008 Marine Major General Walter E Gaskin has reported that the province is ready to be turned over to People of Anbar as the population has embraced the emerging Awakening Council Sunni clans that are responsible for driving Al Qaeda from Iraq

but until now the Americans have not Establishment Sunni Federalism in Iraq and the Dulaim Sheikhs Angry cause the American commanders has Brought the Iraqi forces to Anbar and have not Withdraw from Anbar and have not release the Sunni arrestees and in Baghdad and Diyala and Babil province the Shiite militias Cooperation with the Iraqi forces Still Kidnapping and Arrested and killing sunnis and Dulaimi sunnis in particular

for that the Coming days Perhaps witness fighting and Clashes between the inhabitants of Anbar and Iraqi forces that are not Welcome in Anbar

According to The UN statistics in 2003 the Population of Al Anbar is 1230169 Ramadi Fallujah Al Qaim Hit Haditha Anah Ar Rutba

But The governor of Al Anbar Mamoun Sami Rashid Alwani says The UN statistics are Incorrect and just included 7 major Cities from 80 cities and towns in Al Anbar It continues We know our country more than strangers And Al Anbar Population about more then 3 million citizen

Most eggs that are eaten by humans including birds eggs and turtles eggs have a protective oval eggshell the albumen the vitellus and various thin membranes that are layers like skin Every part of the egg is edible although the eggshell is usually thrown away Eggs are a good source of protein and choline

Roe and caviar are edible eggs produced by fish

Birds eggs are a common food source The most commonly used bird eggs are those from the chicken the duck and the goose but smaller eggs such as quail eggs are occasionally used as a gourmet ingredient as are the largest bird eggs from ostriches Most commercially produced chicken eggs intended for human consumption are unfertilized because hens are kept without any roosters Fertile eggs can be bought and eaten as well There is no difference in the food value of fertilised and unfertilised eggs Fertile eggs for eating do not have a baby bird inside This is because eggs have to be kept cool before they are sold and the cold stops the young inside from starting to grow

Chicken eggs are widely used in many types of cooking Dishes that use eggs range from both sweet to savoury dishes Eggs are versatile that means they can be used and cooked in many different ways They can be pickled hard boiled soft boiled scrambled fried and refrigerated or eaten raw Roasted eggs are used at the Jewish holiday of Passover Eating raw eggs is not recommended for people who may be likely to catch to salmonella such as the elderly the infirm or pregnant women 

Cooking does not change the taste of eggs or the way they look The body can use about 91 of the protein of a cooked eggs nearly twice as much as from a raw egg             

There is no difference in taste or food value between white or brown eggs The colour of a chickens egg depends on the breed

In most of the United States eggs are generally white while in the northeast of that country and in the United Kingdom eggs are generally light brown People in Brazil and Poland prefer brown or reddish eggs because white eggs are though of as industrial that is for use in commercial bakeries The reason some people prefer one colour of egg and other people prefer a different colour is probably because of what the colours are linked with in their minds For example white is linked with purity and brown shelled eggs with greater wholesomeness in

The following is a list of egg dishes

A leitmotif is a German word meaning leading motif It is a little musical theme that is often repeated in a piece of music very often in opera The leitmotif is linked in the musical story with a person or a thing or an idea The leitmotif might be a short tune but it can also be a rhythm or just a chord

The word leitmotif is sometimes used in other things such as literature In a book it might be an idea that keeps coming during the story It can also be used in movies or video games

The word leitmotif is particularly associated with the operas of Richard Wagner The leitmotif helps to make the story dramatic and bind it together because it makes the music easier to understand Sometimes a leitmotif will change during an opera as the character changes Various dramatic effects can be made with leitmotifs For example a leitmotif might be played before a character comes onstage so the audience will know who is coming before the actor can be seen Three examples of leitmotifs from Wagners Ring Cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen are the leitmotif for the chief god Wotan the leitmotif for the Tarnhelm the invisibility helmet and the leitmotif for the Renunciation of Love

The use of leitmotif was not completely new in the 19th century For example the first four notes of Beethovens Fifth Symphony are used like a leitmotif during the whole symphony It was however Carl Maria von Weber who first used it a lot in his operas A music critic called F W Jhns used the word to describe Webers work Hector Berlioz wrote a symphony called Symphonie Fantastique which has a tune which he called ide fixe to represent the love between the two characters

Wagner did not actually use the word leitmotif He preferred to call such themes Grundthema or simple Motiv Some people such as Eduard Hanslick who did not like Wagners music thought that Wagners use of leitmotifs made the music too simple Claude Debussy said the use of leitmotifs in operas was like having a world where crazy people would always use visiting cards to introduce themselves and then start singing their names to be sure everyone knew what was going on

Many other composers used leitmotifs in a similar way to Wagner eg Richard Strauss in his operas Elgar in his oratorios The Kingdom and The Apostles or Alban Berg in his opera Lulu 

Leitmotifs or music themes are also used to dramatise movies For example the famous Jaws theme uses a leitmotif for the shark

Karbala is a province in Iraq with 710274 people living there The capital of the province is also called Karbala that is a holy city for Shia Muslims

Pointe shoes are special shoes worn by ballerinas They are made with a wide flat front end so that the ballerina can stand on the tips of her toes In normal flat ballet shoes people can not do this because the shoe will not support their feet properly 

Pointe shoes are normally only worn by female ballet dancers male dancers may wear them for unorthodox roles such as the Ugly Stepsisters in Cinderella or Bottom in A Midsummer Nights Dream

Girls will usually start en pointe between the ages of 11 and 14 Some start a little earlier than this Starting too early may be bad for the feet of the dancer Some girls will never go en pointe This is usually because they are not strong enough as going en pointe means one has to have enough strength 

It takes considerable strength in the feet ankle leg knee and abdomen to dance en pointe Students must be at least 11 or 12 years of age before attempting pointe work The bones and growth plates in the feet are usually not fully hardened and developed before that age Serious foot deformities can result from starting pointe too early even if the student is strong and skillful Attempting to dance en pointe before the feet and toes are fully grown can cause career ending damage that will prevent dancing en pointe for a lifetime Top ballet schools have specialist orthopaedic consultants and foot X rays are an obvious and necessary safeguard before pointe work begins

Mid 18th century dancer Marie Camargo of the Paris Opra Ballet was the first to wear a non heeled shoe enabling her to perform leaps that would have been difficult if not impossible in the old shoes

The first dancers to rise up on their toes did so with the help of an invention by Charles Didelot in 1795 His flying machine lifted dancers upward allowing them to stand on their toes before leaving the ground This lightness and ethereal quality was well received by audiences and as a result choreographers began put more pointework into their pieces

As dance progressed into the 1800s the desire grew to dance en pointe without the aid of wires When Marie Taglioni first danced La Sylphide en pointe her shoes were nothing more than modified satin slippers Because the shoes of this period offered no support dancers would pad their toes for comfort and rely on the strength of their feet and ankles for support

The birth of the modern pointe shoe may be due to the early 20th century Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova who was one of the most famous and influential dancers of her time Pavlova had particularly high arched insteps which left her vulnerable to injury when dancing en pointe To compensate for this she would put tough leather soles into her shoes for extra support and would flatten and harden the toe area to form a box While this practice made dancing en pointe easier for her it was regarded by her peers as cheating

All pointe shoes are handmade There are many different companies which make these shoes Some of them include Bloch Capezio Gamba Grishko Gaynor Mindens Sansha and Freed Of London

There are many different parts to a pointe shoe

Its important that pointe shoes fit correctly If they do not it can cause the dancers feet to become sore It can also affect the way the dancer performs in them and may cause injury to the dancer A dancer may need to try on many pairs of pointe shoes before they find ones that fit correctly Also when the pointe shoes are dead the shoes will need to be replaced

Ballet companies order pointe shoes in huge quantities at maybe 100 a pair A soloist or principal dancer will have her shoes specially hand made to her needs and may get through several in a single performance Dancers feet take a terrific battering and few end their careers without having some damage to their feet This is the reality behind the light airy graceful sight on the stage

Licchavi was an ancient republic which existed in what is now Bihar state of India before the birth of Mahavira Its capital was Vaishali 

From about 400 to 750 there existed a kingdom in Nepal in the Kathmandu Valley with the same name Licchavi

Early Buddhist legends tell that Licchavi was a ruling family during Gautama Buddhas time in India however links to the Nepalese kingdom are speculative The language of Licchavi inscriptions is Sanskrit and the particular script used is closely related to official Gupta scripts That means that India was a significant cultural influence This was likely through Mithila  the northern part of modern Bihar India

Republicanism is the ideology of governing a nation as a republic with an emphasis on liberty and the civic virtue practiced by citizens Republicanism always stands in opposition to aristocracy oligarchy and dictatorship More broadly it refers to a political system that protects liberty especially by incorporating a rule of law that cannot be arbitrarily ignored by the government According to John Adams They define a republic to be a government of laws and not of men Much of the literature deals with the issue of what sort of values and behavior by the citizens is necessary if the republic is to survive and flourish the emphasis has been on widespread citizen participation civic virtue and opposition to corruption

Scrambled eggs is a dish made from beaten whites and yolks of eggs The dish often contains other ingredients Cream butter milk water or oil will dilute the egg proteins to create a softer texture

The eggs and a large piece of butter are put into a saucepan over a low heat The egg whites and egg yolks are then scrambled or mixed together  The mixture should be mixed together all the time they are being cooked

When cooked a little crme friche is added This is because the eggs will be hot enough to carry on cooking themselves Adding a cool liquid will stop the eggs from overcooking Some salt and pepper or other seasoning can be added to taste as well

In the home the eggs can be mixed together first and then poured into a pan The crme friche does not need to be added if the eggs will be eaten almost straight away

Properly made the eggs should be moist and creamy consistency If any liquid is coming from the eggs it means the eggs have been overcook or that the add the vegetables were undercooked

Using a double boiler or bain marie means that the heat is constant and does not to be adjusted to make sure the eggs do not brown or burn  The baine marie method is slower than cooking directly in a pan over a heat but makes it easier to cook the eggs perfectly The eggs must be taken out of the bain marie when cooked otherwise they will carry on cooking and spoil

Twittys book Loving Natalee A Mothers Testament of Hope and Faithwritten under the name Beth Holloway which she has resumed following her divorce from Jug Twitty was released on October 2 2007 The release was accompanied by a number of TV appearances including a full hour on On the Record A television movie titled Natalee Holloway based in part on Beth Twittys book was made by LMN Twitty continues to make television appearances when there are new developments in the case

In October 2008 the Lifetime Movie Network announced plans to create a television movie The Natalee Holloway Story based on Beth Twittys book Loving Natalee A Mothers Testament of Hope and Faith The senior vice president of original movies Tanya Lopez stated in the announcement that the network was pleased to be working closely with Natalees mother and that they intended to tell the story of Holloways disappearance sensitively and accurately The movie was expected to focus on Beth Twittys involvement in the search for Holloway The movie which aired April 19 2009 under the title Natalee Holloway stars Tracy Pollan as Beth Holloway Grant Show as George Jug Twitty and Amy Gumenick as Natalee Holloway The movie brought in the highest television ratings in Lifetimes 11 year history with average viewership of 32 million people and more than 1 million women in the 18 49 age bracket Although the movie set ratings records for Lifetime the movie was not received well by critic Alec Harvey of The Birmingham News Harvey called the movie sloppy and uneven a forgettable look at the tragedy that consumed the nations attention for months

US television networks devoted much air time to the search for Holloway the investigation of her disappearance and rumors surrounding the case Greta Van Susteren host of Fox News On The Record and Nancy Grace on CNNs Headline News were among the most prominent television personalities to devote time to the incident Van Susterens almost continuous coverage of the story caused On The Record to get its best ratings to date while Graces show became the cornerstone of the new Headline Prime block on Headline News which ran two episodes every night during prime time As the case wore on much of the attention was given to Beth Twitty and her statements Aruban government spokesman Ruben Trapenberg stated The case is under a microscope and the world is watching Locally the Aruban press published extensive news on the story in Dutch English and Papiamento

The saturation of coverage triggered a backlash among some critics who argued that such extensive media attention validates the missing white woman syndrome theory which argues that missing person cases involving white skinned women and girls receive disproportionate attention in the media compared with cases involving white males or people of color CNN ran a segment criticizing the amount of coverage their competitors gave to the story despite what they characterized as a lack of new items to report with CNN news anchor Anderson Cooper calling the coverage downright ridiculous

Early in the case political commentator and columnist Arianna Huffington wrote If you were to get your news only from television youd think the top issue facing our country right now is an 18 year old girl named Natalee who went missing in Aruba Every time one of these stories comes up like say Michael Jackson when its finally over I think what a relief now we can get back to real news But we never do

In March 2008 El Diario commented But if doubts persist about cases involving missing Latinas there are reasons why These cases rarely receive the attention and resources we see given to other missing persons The English language media for example appear to be focused on the stories of missing white women such as with the disappearance of Natalee Holloway in Aruba Cases of missing Latina and African American women often remain faceless when they are even covered

Liberty means the condition in which an individual has the ability to act following his or her own will and alternatively achieve their potential within the context of other words like political freedom It is term that has contested meanings

Traditional Liberalist conceptions of liberty concieve mainly of the freedom of the individual from outside compulsion in terms of freedom from restraint and social liberalist perspective on the other hand highlights the need for social and economic equality as in the power and resources to fulfill one potential As such a social liberalist connects liberty to the equal distribution of political power in the sense of positive liberty They argue that liberty without equality means the domination of the most powerful Thus freedom and democracy are seen as connected and ultimately antagonistic 

John Stuart Mill in his work On Liberty was the first to recognize the difference between liberty as the freedom to act and liberty as the absence of coercion Mill also sought to define the nature and limits of the power which can be legitimately exercised by society over the individual and as such he describes an inherent and continuous antagonism between liberty and authority and thus the prevailing question becomes how to make the fitting adjustment between individual independence and social control 

Liberty generally means the condition in which an individual has the ability to act following his or her own will

Pausanias Description of Greece takes the form of a tour in Ionia on the coast of Asia Minor and in the Peloponnese and part of northern Greece He constantly describes ceremonial rites or superstitious customs He frequently introduces narratives from the domain of history and of legend and folklore and it is only rarely that he allows the reader to see something of the scenery

The word does not have a direct connotation or translation in English Some interpretations include dignity and prestige The Oxford Latin Dictionary defines the expression as fitness suitability worthiness visual impressiveness or distinction dignity of style and gesture rank status position standing esteem importance and honor

Authors who had used dignitas extensively in their writings and oratories include M Tullius Cicero Julius Caesar Cornelius Tacitus and T Livius The most prolific user was Cicero who initially related it to the established term auctoritas These two words were highly associated auctoritas was thought to be the expression of a mans dignitas

Over the course of Ancient Roman history dignitas took on different meanings over time adjusting for the gradually changing viewpoints of society politicians and the various authors

A Margrave is a German nobleman 

Originally the Holy Roman Emperor would give a Markgraf an area of the borders to look after The Margrave would have to protect the people in the area from invaders and at the same time protect the empire 

A Markgraf ranked higher than a count or earl but lower than a duke The Margraves of Brandenburg were in control of such an important area that they were made Electors of the Holy Roman Empire which was the highest honour in the Imperial Parliament There were no Kings in the Empire so when the Margraves of Brandenburg took control of some territory outside the empire as well they could call themselves King in Prussia

As the Middle Ages ended and Europe and the Holy Roman Empire became more secure the military importance of the Margraves became less At the end of the German Empire in 1918 there were no Markgrafs left All had been given higher title but may have kept the Markgraf title as an extra The Kings of Prussia for example always kept the lower title Margraves of Brandenburg

In order to understand fully the difference between denotation and connotation in the media studies and semiotics uses it is necessary to become familiar with some examples

Several parts of meaning may be called denotation That depends on the contrast being drawn

In logic and semantics denotational always attracts the extension meaning in the pair but the other element genuinely varies See intension for some more discussion

A denotation is the strict literal dictionary definition of a word devoid of any emotion attitude or colour 

Denotation often links with symbolism as the denotation of a particular media text often represents something further a hidden meaning is often encoded into a media text

The murder of Meredith Kercher happened on the night of 1 November 2007 Meredith Kercher was born in London on 28 December 1985 and was 21 years old at the time of her death She was a student at Leeds University in England but moved to Italy in August 2007 Meredith went to a university in Perugia Italy as part of her course of study She lived in a house upstairs with three other female students Police investigators concluded that Kercher had been killed with a knife and locked in her bedroom

An American student called Amanda Knox who lived in the house with Kercher came home the next day At 1207 pm she called Kerchers local Italian mobile phone but it rang without being answered for 16 seconds Then she called another roommate Filomena R and said that there were drops of blood in the house and that Kercher did not answer her phone Knox then tried calling Kercher again two times but there was still no answer on either her local Italian phone or her UK phone Immediately Filomena called back to Knox to say she was coming home and Knox then announced that Filomenas window had been broken with glass all over her clothes and the computer on the floor

After Filomena had called Knox again two police officers came to the house because two mobile phones had been found in gardens about one kilometer from the house When Knox had called Kercher her phone was found ringing in some garden bushes It was found by a neighbour who then called the communications police

Entering the house the police noted all the drops of blood that Knox showed them and they confirmed that Kerchers bedroom door was locked A friend of Filomenas broke the door to open it The police looked in the bedroom and found Kerchers body under a duvet She was naked except for her T shirts pulled up to her shoulders There was a lot of blood on her body and around the room Someone had stabbed her neck with a knife Her clothes were laying scattered towards the door Two credit cards 300 euros and her house keys were missing

The next day the police arrested three people They arrested Knox her 2 week boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito They also arrested Knoxs boss at a local pub where she worked but later released him Sollecito was Knoxs new boyfriend and she had met him just eight days before the murder Weeks later police arrested another person called Rudy Guede Originally from the Ivory Coast Guede later acquired dual citizenship in Italy After the murder he went by train to Germany Police in Germany caught him and took him back to Italy

Guede was put on trial in Italy in October 2008 He was found guilty and sent to prison for 30 years

Knox and Sollecito were also put on trial Sollecito was sent to prison for 25 years and Knox for 26 years They both appealed their sentences

The prosecutors said that Guede Knox and Sollecito killed Kercher together The lawyers of Knox and Sollecito said that Guede killed her alone and undressed and moved the body hours later In June November 2009 their lawyers presented evidence and witnesses to support a lone wolf theory that Guede killed Kercher and later undressed and moved her body away from the window of her bedroom in the house where she lived with Knox

Guede had claimed that he had been invited to her house as a date planned with Kercher on Halloween While in her house he claimed he became sick and while in the bathroom he heard a loud scream In his story Guede claimed that he saw a brown haired Italian man holding a knife over Kercher on the floor of her room He then claimed that the man fought him and ran from the house saying in perfect Italian Trovato negro trovato colpevole Guede said that he tried to help Kercher as she was bleeding quickly but he became scared and ran from the house without calling the police or anyone for help Guede had told officials that Kercher was fully dressed when she was stabbed and he left her with the bed quilt and pillow on her bed However witnesses and CSI experts from the Forensic Police in Rome presented evidence that contradicted Guedes story about that night

At Guedes trial the judge and jury did not believe Guedes claims and they convicted him of the murder He had been caught because his palm print on the pillow matched his police file including the Milan school incident when Milan police had released him just 5 days before the murder Guede was sentenced to 30 years in prison but that was reduced to 16 years after his first appeal trial

In a separate trial both Knox and Sollecito were tried for the murder but the evidence was much less than with Guede No witnesses testified that they had seen or heard Knox or Sollecito enter or leave the house that night Also the small amounts of DNA connecting them to the murder were in such low amounts that it could be considered contamination and such small amounts of DNA are inadmissible during trials in British or US criminal courts Although numerous shoe prints had been found matching Guedes Nike shoe there were no shoe prints matching any of the shoes which police had taken from the houses of Knox and Sollecito The main issues about them were that they said things that seemed suspicious

Because no other witnesses could confirm the couple stayed in his house during the murder at Knoxs house they were both sent to trial The evidence against them was very limited

When Knox was convicted in the first trial the verdict was questioned by some as anti Americanism but Sollecito was also convicted at the same time

Guede appealed against his sentence and it was changed from 30 to 16 years in prison He still says that he did not kill Kercher His second appeal trial ended in December 2010 with upholding the verdict of guilty

Knox and Sollecito filed the proper legal documents to appeal their convictions and they were still considered presumed innocent as if the previous trial verdicts were suspended Their appeal trial began in November 2010 with a new judge who ruled to re examine DNA evidence against them The judge also granted a re questioning of witness Antonio C about which days he saw what

On 3 October 2011 murder convictions against Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito were overturned and they were both set free that same night

Lulu is an opera by the composer Alban Berg Berg took the story from two plays called Erdgeist and Die Bchse des Pandora by the German playwright Frank Wedekind Berg wrote the libretto himself

Many people found Lulu very shocking because the story is very decadent There is a lot of blood murder sex and violence in it Also Bergs music was quite difficult to understand He uses twelve tone music which is not in any particular key although he uses it to make a style of music which is often very Romantic and expressive

Berg started to write the opera in 1929 but then he stopped working on it to write his Violin Concerto When Berg died he had not finished the last act of the opera he had only sketched it Schoenberg was asked whether he would finish the opera but he thought it would be too much work When the opera was first performed in 1937 there were only two acts the opera was unfinished Bergs widow Helene said that nobody was allowed to finish it and that it should stay unfinished For more than 40 years that is how the opera was performed

When Helene died in 1976 a man called Friedrich Cerha finished the opera guessing what Berg might have written This completed version was performed in 1979 at the Opera Garnier conducted by Pierre Boulez

Famous sopranos who have sung the main part of Lulu include Teresa Stratas Anja Silja and Christine Schfer

The shape of the whole opera is often said to be like a mirror Lulus popularity in the first act is mirrored by the poverty she lives in during Act III Also Lulus husbands in Act I are played by the same singers as her clients in Act III In the middle of the opera is the movie Even some of the music is a palindrome

Some of the characters have their own music which in each case is a theme made of twelve notes This is the twelve tone system which was invented by Bergs teacher Arnold Schoenberg By giving each character a theme he is using the idea of a leitmotif which was used a lot by Wagner

A Coelacanth is a fish that lives in the Indian Ocean It is a lobe finned fish Coelacanths are very rare today only two species survive from this once plentiful group Their fossil record goes back 400 million years before any land vertebrates had evolved

Coelacanth is pronounced see la canth

The Coelacanth is the only living example of the otherwise fossil Coelacanth fishes They are also the closest link between fish and the first amphibian creatures which made the transition from sea to land in the Devonian period It was thought to have been extinct for 80 million years until one was caught alive off the east African coast in 1938 It is probably the best known Lazarus taxonThat such a creature could have existed unrecorded for so long is rare but perhaps the cold depths of the West Indian ocean at which the Coelacanth thrives and the small number of predators it has may have helped the species survive for so long Its disgusting taste means that fishermen did not deliberately try to catch it that is before scientists started offering rewards

The Coelacanth was first discovered in 1938 by Marjorie Courtenay Latimer the curator of a small museum in the South African port town of East London as she was visiting a fisherman who would let her search through his boats catch for interesting specimens The second species was found off the Comoros islands in the Indonesian archipelago in 1952 The largest specimen was about 18 metres 

The population living off Tanzania is threatened by Japanese trawlers but the fish is not edible They are simply caught in trawls by accident More than 20 have died this way and their total numbers cannot be large

The term tent city is used to describe a variety of temporary housing facilities made using tents Informal tent cities may be set up without authorization by homeless people or protesters As well state governments or military organizations set up tent cities to house refugees evacuees or soldiers Tent cities set up by homeless people may be similar to shanty towns which are informal settlements in which the buildings are made from of scrap building materials

Since Hurricane Katrina made landfall in August of 2005 the term has been used to describe temporary housing sites set up for Gulf Coast residents who were left homeless by the storm Some of the tents that were built by Seabees and funded by FEMA are wooden structures covered by tents With the exception of indoor plumbing most of the tents have heat air and lights The tent city can hold as many as 250 occupants Displaced residents are only expected to stay for three to six months In late December 2006 the St Vincent de Paul Society in Saint Petersburg Florida established an encampment on their property when dozens of homeless moved off of public land across the street from the society In early January 2007 city officials noted city codes that prohibit living in tents and gave the society one week to evict the occupants of the tent city 

Every year the Saudi Arabian governments Ministry of Hajj sets up a tent city to support Muslim pilgrims in the village of Mina where the ritual Stoning of the Devil takes place as part of the overall Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca A tent city is also established annually at Mount Arafat another essential stop during the Hajj Because up to four million pilgrims may be performing the Hajj annually the tent cities are densely inhabited with 20 40 people per tent As such fire and disease outbreaks are constant concerns Since the late 1990s Saudi authorities have started using fireproof tents to reduce the risks of a major fire

In the military the term tent city usually refers to temporary living quarters erected on deployed military bases such as those found in Bosnia or Iraq Depending on the branch of service and the length the tent city has been in place the living space may be equipped with most modern amenities For sanitary reasons military tent cities place toilet shower and laundry facilities at least 50 feet from living quarters Also tents are typically divided into clusters of 8 10 to prevent the rapid spread of fire which is of utmost concern because of the tent and bedding materials

Euphemism is the use of a word that replaces another one that one thinks to be too offensive or vulgar 

It also may be a replacement of a name or a word that could reveal a secret or holy and sacred names to the uninitiated It may also be used to obscure the identity of the subject of a conversation from potential broken wikt linkeavesdroppereavesdroppers A well known example for many is the replacement of Lord Voldemorts name by You Know Who or He Who Must Not Be Named in Harry Potter Some euphemisms are intended to be humorous 

When a phrase is used as a euphemism it often becomes a metaphor whose literal meaning is dropped Euphemisms may be used to hide unpleasant or disturbing ideas even when the literal term for them is not necessarily offensive This type of euphemism is used in politics

Examples for euphemisms are

Examples of dysphemism are dead tree edition for the paper version of an online magazine or the American soldiers calling their common breakfast of creamed chipped beef on toast shit on a shingle

In Christianity worship has been thought as by most Christians to be the central act of Christian identity throughout history Many Christian theologians have called humanity homo adorans which means worshipping man and so the worship of God is at the very centre of what it means to be human 

Throughout most centuries of Church history Christian worship has been primarily liturgical symbolised by prayers and hymns whose texts were closely related to the Scripture Set times for prayer during the day were made and a festal cycle throughout the Church year pointed out the celebration of feasts and holy days relating to the events in the life of Jesus the lives of the saints and features of the Churchs view of God 

A large amount of importance was placed on the forms of worship as they were seen in terms of the Latin phrase lex orandi lex credendi that is the details of someones worship show teach and govern the principle beliefs of the community To change the patterns and content of worship were to change the faith itself So even though there was always a certain amount of variety in the early Churchs liturgical worship there was also a great deal of unity Each time a heresy appeared in the Church it normally came by a shift in worship for the heretical group Orthodoxy in faith also meant orthodoxy in worship and vice versa

The very early development of Christian worship is lost in history but Christian worship is normally fixed in the worship of Judaism The Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles present the very early Christians as visiting both the Temple and synagogues as well as worshipping in private homes frequently to break bread a term which signifies both the sharing of a meal and when used in that context celebrating the Eucharist Acts 242 shows the very early Church of Jerusalem as continuing in the Apostles teaching and fellowship or communion the breaking of bread and the prayers

In general worship for the Eastern churches and for the Catholic and Anglican churches in the West is centered in regular celebration of the Lords Supper celebrated by a priest with more or less participation from the whole body of believers that are there This tradition variously known as the Mass Divine Liturgy Eucharist or Communion continues in the Anglican church and among some Protestants A worship service in these traditions is centered on the sharing of bread although it also includes prayer the reading of Scripture and usually singing and some form of teaching or sermon

In many Protestant traditions however Communion is celebrated rarely or not at all and corporate worship is centered on a formal sermon which may resemble a lecture Worship in such a context also generally is described by spoken prayer Scripture and music mainly hymns

In virtually all Christian traditions this regular public worship is accompanied by other forms of worship such as prayer and study small group prayer and formal ceremonies on special occasions including weddings funerals and events of Church or state

The most popular religious holidays in the Christian calendar are Christmas which is after the Advent season and Easter which is after Lent and Holy Week While Christmas is very popular especially in Western countries Easter is liturgically by far the most important celebration

Prose is the ordinary form of the written language Not poetry and not any special format such as lists or tables In writing it is without special rhythm and is similar to everyday communication That makes the most important distinction with poetry and with theatrical works such as plays

The word prose comes from the Latin prosa meaning straightforward hence the term prosaic Prose writing is usually adopted for the description of facts or the discussion of whatever ones thoughts are incorporated in free flowing speech It may be used for newspapers novels magazines encyclopedias broadcast media letters stories history philosophy biography and many other forms of media

Prose generally has no formal structure like meter or rhyme that is often found in poetry Therefore it is used to describe literature which is non poetic and non theatrical There is however a blend of the two forms of literature is known as prose poetry 

The caper story is a special sort of crime story In the typical caper story one or more crimes happen in full view of the reader The actions of the police or detectives may also be told but are not that important for the story

The typical elements of caper stories are humor adventure or unusual cleverness or audacity 

The Dortmunder stories of Donald E Westlake are very funny tales where unusual thefts happen in another story Dortmunders gang steals the same gem several times steals an entire branch bank and kidnaps someone from an asylum by driving a stolen train onto the property

This article is about the death of Christina Mae Watson ne Thomas known as Tina to her family and often called Christina in Australia She was a 26 year old American woman from Alabama She died on her honeymoon on the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland Australia in 2003 She had only been married to her husband David Gabriel Gabe Watson for 11 days when she died The doctor who performed the autopsy said she drowned in a scuba diving accident Six years later Gabe Watson was charged for murder and manslaughter He pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sent to prison for a year by an Australian court Six months were added to the prison sentence after an appeal that took place just six weeks later The appeal was held as soon after the trial as possible because of concerns raised by Tinas father with the trial itself However the appeal judges agreed with the trial judge on most of the issues except the six month increase in the prison sentence 

Tina was a Southern Baptist and a graduate of the University of Alabama She worked as a departmental manager at the small Southern department store chain Parisian She was buried at the Southern Heritage Cemetery in Pelham Alabama USA

While scuba diving at the site of the SS Yongala a passenger ship that sank in 1911 in the main southern shipping channel to the Australian port of Townsville Tina Watson either lost consciousness or died and then sank 24 meters to the sea floor below Tinas death of accidental drowning was not a criminal investigation in itself in Australia It was a coronial enquiry Mr Watson gave evidence to the Coronial Inquiry through his lawyers He returned to Australia voluntarily and spoke to investigators on a number of occasions Some of these interviews are available on the Internet At trial prosecutors said that Mr Watson had made a mistake in not trying to rescue his wife They said that mistake was the same as manslaughter Tinas father broken wikt linktestifytestified that immediately before their wedding Gabe had asked Tina to increase her life insurance policy to the maximum possible and make him the sole beneficiary He also said that several hundreds of thousands of dollars of insurance money after Tinas death until they named him as a possible murder suspectfactdateJuly 2010see talk page Insurance

After hearing that flowers and gifts left for Tina at her grave were being destroyed or were disappearing even when held down by a chain Sergeant Flynn investigated it On a hidden videotape he saw Gabe Watson taking them away with bolt cutters and then throwing them in the trash angrily Gabe then married Kim Lewis on August 15 2008

Gabe Watson was tried for the murder of his wife Christina in the Queensland Supreme Court at Brisbane on 5 June 2009 He said he was not guilty of murdering his wife To the charge of manslaughter accidental killing he said he was guilty The trial judge said the murder charges made against him were not true and sentenced him to one year in prison with a further three and a half years suspended This sentence resulted into Tinas father calling the Australian justice system a sham He also said one of Australias most senior government lawyers Mr Tony Moynihan had been misleading the public

The reason Gabe received the one year in prison was explained by the judge He said that Gabe had been accused of things of which he had not been guilty had suffered considerably since Tinas death and had co operated with the Court He said the media reporting had been unfair The judge said Gabe had come back to Australia of his own free will in May of 2009 and given himself up The judge said Gabe loved his wife deeply regretted her death and felt guilty because he had been unable to save her He said that Gabe had not caused the accident but had failed to save Tina when she ran into difficulty with her breathing while underwater

Three judges heard an appeal started by the State of Queensland on 17 July 2009 The state wanted Gabe to serve two and a half years in prison Gabes Australian lawyers said the extra time was unfair because of the history of the case The judges published their decision on 18 September 2009

To understand the outcome of the appeal it is necessary to understand a little of the legal process and thinking that lawyers put into an appeal On one side we have the State of Queensland Australia In Australia as in England and countries such as Canada and New Zealand the State is usually called the Crown in court proceedings In the US the State is usually referred to as The People or simply the State The appeal was heard before three judges of the Queensland Court of Appeal which is the States highest court

The Crown had said that Gabes sentence should be increased because it believed the sentence was wrong Gabes lawyers replied this was not the case They said that Gabe had never done anything wrong in the past and he was a good person The death of Tina resulted from an error or mistake and the short prison sentence was a fair in his lawyers opinions

The Court of Appeal judges also said that the murder claim was not true The judges were in agreement about most of the trial However they did not agree about the prison sentence On one hand Justice Muir said the appeal court should not change the decision of the trial judge On the other Chief Justice De Jersey said prison time should be increased to two and a half years In the third opinion Justice Chesterman said it ought to be increased from twelve months to eighteen months To reach agreement the Chief Justice went with Chestermans opinion 

With the agreement of two of the three judges the sentence was increased to eighteen months Each judge carefully explained their view Finally Chesterman said of Gabe Watson That the respondent himself promptly provided the information which proved the case against him and that for years he has borne the unjust charge made very public of murder are factors requiring substantial amelioration in sentence

For four years no one took much notice of the death as there is a drowning in the Australian state of Queensland about once a week Tinas parents however set out to get the attention of the media and by 2007 had succeeded Other people were diving near Gabe and Tina when Tina died One diver photographed Tina lying on the ocean floor while taking a picture of another diver on holiday This picture was not known until a couple of weeks later when the pictures were developed Investigators are uncertain if Tina was already dead in the picture or if she was unconscious The picture gives no clues as to what made Tina sink to the bottom

After being informed by Tina Watsons family that flowers and gifts were repeatedly being vandalized or disappearing from the grave site even when chained down Sergeant Flinn investigated On hidden surveillance videos he saw Gabe Watson removing them with bolt cutters and putting them into the trash which Flinn then showed to media

Tina Watsons father told the media in November 2009 two months after the appeal decision that he thinks Gabe is a copy cat killer He might have got the idea for the murder by a copying the way another almost successful murder was done in the British Virgin Islands 

The death of Tina Watson was shown in a 90 minute account that was shown on Dateline NBC on Monday May 19 2008 Watsons death caused media attention in both Australian and American media and also from media around the world because of the unusual case

However media in particular from the Australian state of Queensland have continually described Tinas death as murder while Queensland Courts have found it to be manslaughter by way of a failure to rescue This issue finally came to a head with the Townsville Bulletin on 10th February 2010 They again described Tinas death as murder Seven days later they published an apology and correction which says 

On February 10 2010 an article was published concerning murdered US bride Tina Watson The Townsville Bulletin accepts that Gabe Watson has not been convicted of murdering Tina Watson Tina died while scuba diving at the Yongala wreck on October 23 2003 Gabe Watson pleaded guilty to manslaughter by reason of his failure to take Tina Watson to the surface when it was apparent she was in distress and by this inaction this constituted criminal neglect

On July 17 2010 a leading Australian daily newspaper The Age published a complete review of the Watson case Death on Reef Mystery The author was award winning investigative journalist Peter Patrick This is the first media account to contain first hand interviews from both Gabe Watsons family and Tinas family Relying on technical experts the story reports that Gabe was exonerated by the Queensland Court of Appeal of murder but convicted of failing to comply with a previously unused and little known part of the Queensland Penal Code This is a violation of section 290 He says the court decided to call this manslaughter The story says the charge amounts to a crime by Gabe of failing to rescue his wife once she got into trouble It also explains Tinas extensive history of heart irregularity and the medication she was taking the morning of her death including anti sea sickness pills Patrick says that Tina gave a no answer to the medical question at her diving induction which asked about prior heart disease He also states that because Watson had been absent from diving for some years his level of rescue skill would have been that of beginner

The story would eventually have world wide ramifications for in a footnote Patrick revealed he had written to Australias Attorney General Robert McClelland MP requesting Watson not be deported to Alabama because of the risk he faced from the death penalty in that state and because he had already been tried in the Australian State of Queensland with a comprehensive review by the Queensland Court of Appeal This brought an instant response from an Alabama police web site questioning the link between the journalist and Watson 

Ignoring Alabamas wishes the Australian Government then advised Watson would not be deported and invited him to request a Visa that would allow him to remain in Australia

Watson was deported in November to face new charges by a grand jury in his home town of Birmingham Watson arrived at Los Angeles Airport on the Thursday 25th November 2010 accompanied by Queensland police officers and Australian immigration officials He was immediately imprisoned in California to await extradition to Alabama the following week 

After eighteen months in an Australian prison Watson spent the 2010 Thanksgiving he wished to spend at home in a Los Angeles County Lockup facing the prospect of life in prison in Alabama He was transferred to the Birmingham Al Lockup ten days later

On December 15 2010 Watson appeared before Judge Tommy Nail in the 10th Judicial Circuit Jefferson County Alabama and requested bail

The court room was packed with his friends and relatives both Australian and US media with a smaller showing from Tinas family

Don Valeska Alabamas assistant attorney general told the judge the basis of the Grand Jury indictment of Gabe Watson was evidence from Tommy Thomas that Gabe Watson had murdered Tina Watson for insurance money 

In often heated argument Judge Nail said that motive could not be substituted for evidence He asked what hard evidence the State had against Watson Mr Valeska replied that the question of motive was a question for the jury

After an hour long hearing Watson was granted bail with a bond of 100000 He must wear a monitoring radio bracelet and remain in doors at his home from sundown to sunup

On hearing that bail was to be granted those in the Court room rose and cheered causing Judge Nail to respond with the words Sit down sit down this is not a spectator sport

On January 31st 2011 Gabe Watson appeared in Judge Nails court to formally answer two charges firstly that he had kidnapped Tina and taken her to Australia with the intention of murdering her and secondly that he had then murdered her while Scuba diving on the Great Barrier Reef 

He pleaded Not Guilty to both charges

The trial date was set at the 23rd May 2011 Mr Valeska told Judge Nail that important witnesses were to be flown in from Australia He then added that a previous witness Mr David Glasgow the Queensland Magistrate who was the Australian official responsible for Gabes indictment of murder in Australia would not now be called No reason was given as to the reason why the State had changed its mind on calling Mr Glasgow 

The arraignment lasted just fourteen minutes

With Watsons arraignment occurring in late January 2011 and the trial not commencing until mid February 2012 there has been a number of significant and new developments Not the least being questions as to who is available to give evidence of the States case for murder

On 22nd April 2011 Australian journalist Peter Patrick published the second of his major stories on the case Documented for the first time is the account of Mr Colin McKenzie a 50 year diving veteran who says he recanted earlier evidence because he felt he had been misled Under the headline Watson a coward but not a killer McKenzie says I gave that evidence to the police but then I found out his rescue course was over two days  in Australia we do it over four days  in a quarry in AlabamaHe had no hope of being competentNow the storys come out that he couldnt even put his fins on I just dont see that it could have been premeditated 

Patrick reveals he is an experienced scuba diver and while diving on the Yongala to investigate Tinas death had an abnormally high air consumption which he puts down to constantly swimming against unpredictable currents flowing across the wreck

The strongest criticism of the Watson murder theory is made in the Sydney Morning Herald and comes from Dr Carl Edmonds It is written by Jennifer Cooke one of the authors of Honeymoon Dive a book recommended as compulsory reading by Alabama Prosecutor Don Valeska

Here Dr Edmonds who was previously Chief Medical Officer to the Royal Australian Navys elite clearance diving teams and is a world expert on diving accidents says in a story headlined Honeymooners diving death an accident not murder

If you listen to Gabes story it is very consistent with a really straightforward panicking diving accident Dr Edmonds said Its all very plausible In fact its like so many other diving accidents

Should Watson be found guilty of the murder of his former wife in a US jurisdiction both the Federal Government and State of Alabama have assured the Australian Government he will not be executed

Io is a moon of the planet Jupiter It is Jupiters third biggest moon with a diameter of 3642 km being slightly bigger than Earths moon Io has about 400 active volcanoes

Io is the most volcanically active body in the Solar System Volcanoes erupt massive volumes of silicate lava sulphur and sulphur dioxide constantly changing Ios appearance This new basemap of Jupiters moon Io was produced by combining the best images from both the Voyager 1 and Galileo Missions Although the subjovian hemisphere of Io was poorly seen by Galileo superbly detailed Voyager 1 images cover longitudes from 240 W to 40 W and the nearby southern latitudes 

In the same way that the Moon always has the same side facing Earth Io always has the same side facing Jupiter The movie shows two speeded up rotations of Io and begins with a view of the Jupiter facing hemisphere With rotation in an easterly direction after two seconds the volcano Prometheus comes into view The massive red deposit around Pele is the most distinctive expression of volcanic activity on Io and just to the north west is the horse shoe shaped Loki Patera the most powerful volcano on Io

Giordano Bruno born Filippo Bruno was an Italian philosopher priest mathematician and astronomer He is best known as believing in the infinity of the universe His cosmological theories went beyond the Copernican model 

Bruno thought the Sun was just one of an infinite number of independently moving heavenly bodies He is the first man to have thought the stars we see at night are identical in nature to the Sun For publishing these and other beliefs he was burnt at the stake as a heretic by the Inquisition of the Roman Catholic Church

Bruno also wrote extensive works on the art of memory a loosely organized group of mnemonic techniques and principles

The Catholic Church made the following accusations against Bruno

Bruno did accept and promote Copernicus idea that the Earth revolves round the Sun Many believe this was one of main reasons for his downfall others think his theological beliefs were more critical In 1584 he published two dialogues which argued for his idea on astronomy Eight years later he was arrested and his trial took another eight years His accusers demanded complete recantation of all his erroneous beliefs He refused and went to his death Later the Inquisition used his example to terrify Galileo into withdrawing his works from publication

Wheel of Fortune is a game show on television It was created by Merv Griffin in 1975 It was originally hosted by Chuck Woolery from 1975 until 1981 Pat Sajak has been hosting the show since 1981 The show has been aired in syndicated format since 1983

The game combines hangman with a wheel that gives away cash and prizes At the beginning of the show there is a 1000 toss up puzzle During a toss up puzzle one letter at a time appears on the board Contestants can ring in to solve the puzzle before the last letter is revealed An incorrect solution disqualifies that contestant for the rest of that round A second toss is worth 2000 and determines who starts round one The contestant who wins the second toss up starts the first round There are 24 spaces on the wheel A contestant who lands on a cash space is credited with that amount multiplied by how many of a particular letter is in the puzzle A contestant can buy a vowel for 250 Any contestant who lands on lose a turn loses is or her turns but not his or her winnings accumulated during the round If a contestant lands on Bankrupt he or she will lose all of his or her winnings accumulated during the ongoing round as well as a Wild Card The Wild Card is used to call for more consonants while the wheel is still on the cash space a contestant landed on If a contestant lands on Free Play he or she will not lose his or her turn for an incorrect guess or incorrect solution A consonant is worth 500 for a Free Play The top dollar value on the wheel is 2500 in round one 3500 in the second and third rounds and 5000 from the fourth round on The first round is the Jackpot round The jackpot starts at 5000 It increases in value by adding the value of each cash space landed on during that round Round three is the mystery round Two mystery wedges are added to the wheel One hides 10000 and the other hides a Bankrupt A contestant who lands on a mystery wedge calls for a letter He or she may take 1000 per letter occurrence or turn over the wedge If one wedge was turned over the other acts as a regular 1000 cash space and cannot be turned over A third toss up puzzle worth 3000 determines who starts the fourth round When time runs short a bell sounds The host spins the wheel Remaining consonants are worth 1000 plus the value in front of the left most contestant The contestants take turns calling for letters A vowel is called with no cost Then the contestant in control has three seconds to solve The contestant with the most cash at the end of the game advances to the bonus round If the game ends in a tie an additional toss up puzzle is played to simply determine who advances to the bonus round The contestant spins the bonus wheel A category is announced A bonus puzzle is revealed The contestant is given the letters R S T L N and E The contestant then calls for three more consonants and a vowel If a contestant has a Wild Card in the bonus round a fourth consonant is called The contestant who has solved the puzzle wins the prize they have selected Any contestant who fails to solve the puzzle automatically loses The host then reveals the prize concealed in the envelope regardless of the result

Shalom is a Hebraic word which means peace Like in English it can mean the peace between two parts as well as an inner peace being calm or the quietness of a person It is also used as a method of greeting like hello good day or good bye

The root of the word shalom can be related to le shalem which means to complete to reward to pay to compensate This means that it is more than the absence of conflict or struggle or the breaking of unfriendliness It also means a return to the balance to justice and to the complete equality 

In general one uses the word shalom as the short form of the sentence Shalom Aleichem that can be translated as good day This is very similar to the Arabic phrase Salam Alaykum which is again a greeting meaning Peace be with you

A number line is a line with integers on it extending into infinity Usually zero is placed in the middle of the line The numbers have an equal space from each other Other numbers in between the numbers on the line represent rational irrational and other types of real numbers

There is another number line equally valid and useful that extends vertically through 0 at right angles to our traditional number line and uses imaginary numbersalso extending into infinity These so called imaginary numbers extend above and below the traditional number line and are used in very real calculations in many areas of science and technology 

Tunicates are a subphylum of the Chordates They are filter feeders living mainly from plankton The adults are sessile stuck to rocks They are called tunicates because the adult form is covered by a leathery tunic This tunic supports and protects the animal  Many of them are colonial or semi colonial in their adult stage They are quite a large group containing about 3000 species The adults live mostly on the sea floor in the littoral zone

The sea squirt has two openings in its small body One opening called the oral siphon sucks water into the animal the other opening called the atrial siphon squirts water out of the animal Inside is a little basket like sieve which traps food so these sea squirts are filter feeders The Sea squirt can close the holes in its siphons like a drawstring can close the opening in a bag 

When in its larval state it looks like a tadpole and is sometimes called a tadpole larva Like many sea creatures a sea squirt larva looks very different from an adult sea squirt The larva swims for a short time and then attaches itself to something on the sea floor like a rock transforming into its adult form It usually stays in one place for the rest of its life

Tunicates are more closely related to craniates than to lancelets echinoderms hemichordates or other invertebrates

Chemical substances which might help fight diseases like cancer or various viruses have been found in some species 

Scientists have also found out that some species can heal some damage done to them over several generations A similar process might be possible for humans

Zheng He was an explorer diplomat and admiral from Ming Dynasty China Zheng He was the leader of a very large fleet of Chinese ships that traveled all over the Indian Ocean and Southwest Asia Zheng He was an eunuch of Chinas Imperial Court The fleet that Zheng He commanded had 317 ships that were very large 28000 Chinese soldiers were on board these ships

Zheng He was born in Yuannan Province His birth name was Ma He He came from Kunyang which was Mongolian territory In 1381 the Ming Dynasty sent an army to stop the Mongolian rebellion Zheng He was captured and became a servant Because Prince Zhu Di wanted him as his eunuch servant he had him castrated This was in 1385 when he was 13 years old Ma He became a servant at the Imperial Court The name Zheng He was given to him by the emperor Also the name Sanbao was used for him meaning Three Treasures

Austalopithecus africanus was first discovered by Raymond Dart in 1925 He found a well preserved skull of a young australopithecine three to four years old This skull is often called the Taung Child for Taung South Africa where it was found It is perhaps the most complete skull of A africanus known 

Australopithecus africanus had a dish shaped facial structure with teeth that were large compared to modern humans While it had larger front teeth compared to the back the emphasis was on back tooth grinding Males had a sagital crest on the tops of their skulls Large muscles were attached to this ridge that helped to support the heavy jaw

Australopithecus is a genus of extinct hominids closely related to humans 

The first Australopithecus described was the Taung Child discovered by Raymond Dart and described in 1925

Their remains are mostly found in East Africa and the first fossil is from 39 million years ago The split from other apes would have taken place earlier perhaps about 5 mya

It is widely believed that the group of which they are part gave rise to the genus Homo and hence to human beings

The genus Australopithecus originally included two rather different forms One form was lightweight the gracile australopithecines The other form was bulkier the robust australopithecines 

It is still under discussion whether they should be put in separate genera Here we treat the gracile forms the robust forms are described elsewhere as Paranthropus

Gracile australopithecines shared several traits with modern apes and humans They were widespread throughout Eastern and Northern Africa 39 to 3 million years ago

The brains of most species of Australopithecus were roughly 35 of the size of that of a modern human brain This is not much more than the brain of a chimpanzee Brain size in hominins does not increase significantly until the arrival of the genus Homo

The Taung specimen had short canine teeth and the position of the foramen magnum was evidence of bipedal locomotion 

Most species of Australopithecus were diminutive and gracile usually standing between 12 to 14 m tall There is a considerable degree of sexual dimorphism Modern hominids do not show sexual dimorphism to the same degree particularly modern humans display a low degree of sexual dimorphism with males being only 15 larger than females on average 

In Australopithecus however males can be up to 50 larger than females though usually less pronounced than this

The skeleton the fossil footprints found at Laetoli Tanzania the canine teeth and the foramen magnum all show that these apes had achieved bipedalism

Australopithecus africanus used to be regarded as ancestral to the genus Homo 

However fossils assigned to the genus Homo have been found that are older than A africanus Thus the genus Homo either split off from the genus Australopithecus at an earlier date or both developed from a yet possibly unknown common ancestor independently

According to the Chimpanzee Genome Project both human and chimpanzee lineages diverged from a common ancestor about 5 to 6 million years ago if we assume a constant rate of evolution 

However hominins discovered more recently are somewhat older than the molecular clock would suggest Sahelanthropus tchadensis commonly called Toumai is about 7 million years old and Orrorin tugenensis lived at least 6 million years ago Since little is known of them they remain controversial because the molecular clock in humans has determined that humans and chimpanzees had an evolutionary split at least a million years later 

One theory suggests that the human and chimpanzee lineages diverged somewhat at first then some populations interbred around one million years after diverging More likely the assumptions behind molecular clocks do not hold exactly The key assumption behind the technique is that in the long run changes in molecular structure happen at a steady rate Researchers such as Ayala have challenged this assumption

Homo is the genus is separated from the earlier hominids because of the emergence of tool use language and culture

The genus begins about 23 million years ago The characteristics of these species are bigger brain the forehead rises straight up the skull becomes rounder the teeth are reduced arms are shorter and legs are longer and the skeleton becomes more delicate

India suffers from a lot of poverty which means that many people there do not have enough money 275 of the population was living below the poverty line in 20042005 Monthly per capita consumption expenditure is below Rs 35635 for rural areas and Rs 53860 for urban areas 1 out of every 4 Indians earns less than 040 per day 75 of the poor are in rural areas Most of them are daily wagers and landless labourers

A study was done by the McKinsey Global Institute This study found 54 of the people living in India were living on a household income of less than 90000 rupees a year That means about a dollar per person per day

National Commission for Enterprises in the Unorganised Sector published a report in 2007 This report state 77 of Indians lived on less than 20 rupees per day Most of them have no job or social security They live in abject poverty

One of the problems with estimating poverty in India is a lack of consistent and reliable numbers McKinsey study quoted above is off by a factor compared to 77 under 05 a day by NCEUS To add insult to injury here are some industry numbers that do not fit well with 77 under 05 a day

There are two views on the cause of poverty in India

In 1828 he became interested in politics and joined a group which later on probably became the Gieen and Darmstadt section of the Gesellschaft fr Menschenrechte In Strasbourg he studied not only medicine but French literature and political thought as well

While Bchner continued his studies in Gieen he started a secret society which wanted revolutionary change With the help of the Protestant theologian Friedrich Ludwig Weidig he published the leaflet Der Hessische Landbote a revolutionary text that criticized social problems in the Grand Duchy of Hesse The authorities charged them with treason and issued a broken wikt linkwarrantwarrant of broken wikt linkapprehensionapprehension While Weidig was arrested tortured and died imprisoned in Darmstadt Bchner fled across the border to Strasbourg where he wrote most of his literary work and translated two plays by Victor Hugo Lucrce Borgia and Marie Tudor Two years later his dissertation Mmoire sur le Systme Nerveux du Barbeaux was published in Paris and Strasbourg The ideas of Franois Nol Babeuf and Claude Henri de Saint Simon had an important influence on his work In October 1836 he got a job at the University of Zrich as a lecturer in anatomy and went back to Zrich where he spent his final months writing and teaching until he died of typhus at the age of twenty three

The Wheel of Fortune or Rota Fortuna is a concept in medieval and ancient philosophy and means the unpredictable nature of Fate The wheel belongs to the goddess Fortuna who spins it at random changing the positions of those on the wheel  some suffer great misfortune others gain windfalls

The concept developed in antiquity it was used by Cicero The Wheel originally belonged to the Roman goddess Fortuna whose name seems to derive from Vortumna she who revolves the year Fortuna eventually became Christianized the Roman philosopher Boethius was a major source for the medieval view of the Wheel writing about it in hisConsolatio Philosophiae

The Wheel of Fortune motif appears significantly in the Carmina Burana over one thousand poems and songs often profane in content written by students and clergy in the early 13th century Excerpts from two of the collections better known poems Fortuna Imperatrix Mundi and Fortune Plango Vulnera read

Fortune and her Wheel have remained an enduring image throughout history

William Shakespeare in Hamlet wrote of the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune and of fortune personified to break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel And in Henry V Act 3 Scene VI are the lines

Selections from the Carmina Burana including the two poems quoted above were set to new music by twentieth century classical composer Carl Orff whose bombastic and well known O Fortuna is based on the poem Fortuna Imperatrix Mundi

Fortuna does occasionally turn up in modern literature She is often associated with gamblers and dice could also be said to have replaced the Wheel as the primary metaphor for uncertain fortune

Raster graphics is one of two kinds of computer graphics With raster graphics images are modeled as big collections of pixels Usually they form an image shaped like a rectangle Each pixel holds something like color or transparency Raster images are used very often Computer screens are made of a raster of points Vector graphic images are rasterised that way Images that are difficult to make as a vector like photographs are often made in the form of a raster image

Many printers today use computer languages like Postscript or PCL These languages are based on vectorized images most of the time To be printed these images need to be translated into raster graphics first This is done by a part called a Raster Image Processor Most modern printers have those processors inside the printer Some printers use a special piece of software on the computer to do that job

Postscript is a programming language It was developed by Adobe in 1984 It is a standard used by many computer printers There are three different versions of it Postscript Level 1 Level 2 and Level 3 

The Portable Document Format is another standard also from Adobe It is better adapted to printing Many things computer languages have have been dropped to develop PDF 

And finally a Hello World program the customary way to show a small example of a complete program in a given language might look like this in Postscript

Rules vary from area to area but the common trait is that the ball is struck with a bare or almost bare hand The general rule involves two teams made from two up to five players each 

The second characteristic is that it is not played against a wall Instead similarly to modern tennis two individuals or teams are placed face to face separated either by a line on the ground or a net A distinctive trait of Valencian pilota is that the spectators are often seated or standing very close to the court which means that they may be impacted by the ball and thus become an part of the game

Valencian pilota origins are not known with certainty but its commonly supposed to be a variant from the middle aged Jeu de paume as many other European handball sports similar to the actual Valencian llargues variant

Jeu de paume is documented at Paris in 1292 since there were 13 ball workshops and many tripots it was first played with the hands and the scoring system was very similar to the current Valencian one There were so many resemblances with the Valencian pilota sport that in the 16th century Joan Llus Vives compared both games in his Dialogues and claimed them to be exactly the same despite some minor differences

A trapezoid or trapezium is a quadrilateral which is defined as a shape with four sides which has one set of parallel sides 

Frisian handball is a traditional Frisian sport related to American handball and fives that is most commonly practiced by people from the northern province of Frysln or Friesland It is believed to be one of the oldest ballgames The score is similar to tennis The first team that scores six games wins the match It is played by the ethnic group of the Frisians

In parts of Belgium a similar game is played there called Jeu de Pelote This game is played by teams of 5 players on a trapezium shaped field mostly on marketplaces

Gaelic Football commonly referred to as football or Gaelic is a form of football played mainly in Ireland It along with Hurling is the most popular spectator sport in Ireland

Gaelic football is played by teams of 15 on a rectangular grass pitch with H shaped goals at each end The object is to score by kickingstriking the ball with your hand and getting it through the goals The team with the highest score at the end of the match wins

Players advance the ball up the field with a combination of carrying soloing kicking and hand passing to their team mates 

Gaelic football is one of four Gaelic Games run by the Gaelic Athletic Association the largest sporting organization in Ireland It has strict rules on player amateurism The game is believed to have come from ancient Irish football known as caid which dates back to 1537 although the modern game took shape in 1887

The grass pitch is rectangular stretching 130145 metres long and 8090 metres wide There are H shaped goalposts at each end with a net on the bottom section The same pitch is used for hurling the GAA which organizes both sports decided this to facilitate dual usage Lines are marked at distances of 13m 20m and 45m from each end line Shorter pitches and smaller goals are used by under 12s an under 10s 

Caid was the name given to several ancient and traditional Irish football games Caid is now used by some people for modern Gaelic football

The word caid originally meant the ball which was used It was made out of animal skin with a natural bladder inside

Some people believe that caid has influenced the modern sport of Gaelic football the rules of which were officially published in 1887 

The first recorded mention of football in Ireland was in 1308 when John McCrocan a spectator at a football game was charged with accidentally stabbing a player named William Bernard Football games are mentioned in the Statute of Galway 1527 which allowed the playing of football and archery but banned hokie the hurling of a little ball with sticks or staves as well as other sports  Caid was especially popular in rural areas 

There is some evidence that caid was taken around the world by the Irish diaspora and that it may have influenced the development of Australian rules football although this is controversial 

By the late 19th century caid like many aspects of native Irish culture was in steep decline

Longue paume is an outdoor version of jeu de paume and therefore an ancestor of modern lawn tennis Hundreds of years ago it was quite popular particularly in France It was part of the Paris 1900 Summer Olympics but not all think that the medals that were awarded for longue paume at that Olympics have full value Today the sport is played regionally in Picardie The governing body of the sport is the Fdration Franaise de Longue Paume with its headquarter in Amiens

Pallone is the name of several traditional ball games played in various regions of Italy with minimal differences in regulations

Pallone col bracciale Pallone col bracciale was particularly popular throughout Italy in the 18th century then in 19th century and 20th century until 1930 was the most popular sport of ancient Italian national sports its first official regulations date back to 1555 The pallone col bracciale players are called pallonisti and during 19th century Italian professional pallonisti were richest and best rewarded sportsmen of all the world This sport and his champions were described by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe Giacomo Leopardi Edmondo de Amicis Antonio Francesco Grazzini Ottavio Rinuccini Gabriello Chiabrera Tommaso Grossi Giuseppe Gioachino Belli Where Angels Fear to Tread includes a brief film depiction of this game

Balls are struck back and forth with a wooden cylinder called bracciale worn over the forearm if carelessly played a broken arm can result in fact bracciale weighs 2 or 1 kilogram Originally the ball of 934 grams was inflated but now hard rubber ball of 350 grams is used Scoring is by fifteens as in tennis and the team which wins 12 games is final winner of the match A special feature is that the ball is put into play by a designated server who otherwise is not part of the game The receivers can reject serves at will Pallone is played on courts marked out on town streets Registered players of official championships dispute their matches in a kind of stadium named sferisterio or sferodromo in Italian languageNowadays they play two forms of this sport 3 players a side with lateral wall and 4 players a side in open playing field without lateral wall

Celebrated former professional champions include

Pallapugno Pallapugno one time named pallone elastico is a game from Piedmont and Liguria and it is played with a bandaged fist rubber ball has diameter of 105 centimetres and weighs 190 grams Scoring is also by fifteens but in this version a second bounce can result in a chase rather than an outright point similar to real tennis Every team has 4 players and the team which wins 11 games is final winner of the match Professional players dispute their matches in sferisterio 90 metres long and 18 metres large with lateral wall Professional Italian pallapugno league is top level of competitions in 2008 10 teams competed

This sport is played in various nations and they dispute a world championship

Pallapugno leggera is played in courtfield which has same size of volleyballs courtfield without net Each team has 4 players with 2 reserve players A match consisted of one set or three sets

The meteorological history of Hurricane Katrina started on August 23 2005 Hurricane Katrina was extremely destructive Category 5 hurricane which formed as Tropical Depression Twelve near the Bahamas The next day the tropical depression strengthened to a tropical storm and was named Katrina Katrina continued on to make landfall on the southern part of the US state of Florida as a Category 1 hurricane

While passing across Florida Katrina weakened to a tropical storm however the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico allowed it to rapidly intensify to the sixth strongest Atlantic hurricane in recorded history Afterwards Katrina made landfall as a Category 3 hurricane near Buras Triumph Louisiana and once more near the MississippiLouisiana border Katrina continued northward through the central United States and finally dissipated near the Great Lakes when it was absorbed by a cold front

Tropical Depression Twelve formed over the southeastern Bahamas at 500 pm EDT on August 23 2005 partially from the remains of Tropical Depression Ten which had dissipated from the effects of a nearby upper tropospheric trough While the normal standards for numbering tropical depressions in the Atlantic shows that the old namenumber is kept when a depression dissipates and regenerates satellite data indicated that a second tropical wave combined with Tropical Depression Ten north of Puerto Rico to form a new much more advanced system which was then named as Tropical Depression Twelve Simultaneously the trough in the upper troposphere weakened causing the wind shear in the area to decrease also allowing the new tropical depression to develop In a later re analysis it was found that the low level circulation of TD Ten had completely detached and dissipated with only the remnant mid level circulation moving on and merging with the second tropical wave mentioned before As a result the criteria for keeping the same name and identity were not met

As the atmospheric conditions surrounding Tropical Depression Twelve were favorable for tropical development the system began to strength and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Katrina on the morning of August 24 A burst of convection allowed Katrina to become the fifth hurricane of the 2005 season on August 25 only two hours before it made landfall around 630 pm EST between Hallandale Beach and Aventura Florida

Katrina struck the peninsula with 80 mph winds and had a well defined eye on Doppler radar which managed to stay undisturbed throughout its passage over Florida The storm weakened over land on August 26 to a tropical storm but recovered its strength to hurricane status at 200 am EDT about one hour after ending its passage through Florida and entering the Gulf of Mexico Parts of the Florida Keys experienced tropical storm winds throughout August 26 with the Dry Tortugas briefly experiencing hurricane force winds

At first the National Hurricane Center forecasts predicted that Katrina would begin turning northward after landfall eventually to make its second landfall on the Florida Panhandle about three to four days later Katrina however continued a westerly and west southwesterly track which eventually made the forecasts change their predictions and forecast Katrina to move westward into New Orleans

Right after the storm entered the Gulf of Mexico the low wind shear good upper level outflow and the warm sea surface temperatures of the Gulf Loop Current caused Katrina to intensify rapidly On August 27 the storm was upgraded to Category 3 strength becoming the third major hurricane of the season An eyewall replacement cycle stopped Katrina from strengthening its maximum winds for about 18 hours but almost doubled the size of the storm as a result The storm then began a second period of rapid intensification starting at 700 pm CDT on August 27 and by 1240 am CDT on August 28 Katrina was upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 145 mph It became a Category 5 storm by 700 am CDT twelve hours after the beginning of the second round of rapid intensification and reached its peak intensity at 100 pm CDT with maximum sustained winds of 175 mph gusts of 215 mph and a central pressure of 902 mbar The minimum pressure made Katrina at the time the fourth most intense Atlantic hurricane on record As the hurricane came closer New Orleans the Weather Forecast Office in Slidell Louisiana gave out two strongly worded warnings of the storms danger

By the afternoon of August 28 the storm was large enough that some areas of the Gulf Coast were already experiencing tropical storm force winds The center of Katrina was about 180 statute miles from the mouth of the Mississippi River but tropical storm force winds extended 230 mi from the center of the storm and hurricane force winds extended about 105 miles away

Overnight on August 29 and into the morning of the next day Katrina quickly weakened as it began to enter another eyewall replacement cycle The inner eyewall disappered before an outer eyewall had fully formed which was one of the reasons of its rapid weakening In 18 hours the hurricanes maximum sustained winds decreased from 170 mph to 125 mph However storm surges remained high at landfall because large waves greater than 30 feet in height were generated beforehand when Katrina was at Categories 4 and 5 on the Saffir Simpson Hurricane Scale The waves then combined with the storm surge of the large Category 3 hurricane

Katrina made its second landfall at 610 am CDT on August 29 as a Category 3 hurricane with winds of 125 mph near Buras Triumph Louisiana Because Katrina had just weakened from Category 4 strength and also because of the shape of the coastline Category 4 force winds are believed to have existed on land while the eye was over water At landfall hurricane force winds were recorded 120 miles from the center the storms central pressure was 920 mbar and its forward speed was 15 mph As it made its way up the eastern Louisiana coastline most communities in Plaquemines St Bernard Parish and Slidell in St Tammany Parish were severely damaged by storm surge and the strong winds of the eyewall which also swipped over eastern New Orleans creating 1 billion worth of damage to the city from intense flooding and wind damage

Original estimates recorded that Katrina had made this landfall as a Category 4 hurricane with 135 mph winds however as mentioned above the storm weakened just before landfall to Category 3 intensity The reasons for this weakening are not completely understood yet while the eye wall replacement cycle played a part slightly increasing shear dropping sea surface temperatures dry air on the western semicircle of the storm and interaction with the continental landmass also may have played a role in weakening the cyclone This follows the trend of previous strong cyclones in the Gulf of Mexico all cyclones with minimum central pressures of 973 mbar or less have weakened over the 12 hours before making landfall in the Gulf Coast of the United States

A few hours later after weakening slightly Katrina made its third landfall near the Louisiana Mississippi border with 120 mph sustained winds and 928 mbar pressure still at Category 3 intensity Its minimum pressure at its second landfall was 920 mbar making Katrina the third strongest hurricane on record to make landfall on the United States behind Hurricane Camilles 909 mbar reading in 1969 and the 1935 Labor Day Hurricanes 892 mbar record

Because the storm was so large its highly destructive eye wall winds and the strong northeastern quadrant of the storm pushed record storm surges onshore smashing the entire Mississippi Gulf Coast including towns in Mississippi such as Waveland Bay St Louis Pass Christian Long Beach Gulfport Biloxi Ocean Springs Gautier and Pascagoula and in Alabama Bayou La Batre The surges peaked at 28 feet in Bay St Louis Mississippi and at 13 feet as far away as Mobile Alabama which saw its highest storm surge since 1917 Storm surge was particularly high due to the hydrology of the region the hurricanes extreme size and the fact that it weakened only shortly before landfall As Katrina moved inland diagonally over Mississippi high winds cut a swath of damage that affected almost the entire state 

Katrina stayed at hurricane strength in Mississippi but it soon weakened It lost hurricane strength more than 150 miles inland near Meridian Mississippi Katrina was then lowered into a tropical depression near Clarksville Tennessee and broke in half One half of the storm continued to race northward affecting the Central United States and it was last noticeable in the eastern Great Lakes region On August 31 it was absorbed by a frontal boundary and became a powerful extratropical low causing 197669 inches of rain in 12 hours It also caused gale force wind gusts from 31 to 61 mph in southeastern Quebec and northern New Brunswick In the region of Saguenay and Cte Nord rain caused breakdowns and failure in roads The Cte Nord region was isolated from the rest of Quebec for at least 1 week However the other half of Katrina broke off in the eastern part of the Appalachians which caused a major tornado outbreak in the area from central Georgia to central Pennsylvania The tornadoes were strong killing two people and creating severe damage

At 1100 pm EDT on August 31 the center of the remnant storm that was once Katrina was absorbed by another weather system in southeastern Canada

The troposphere is the lowest part of Earths atmosphere It contains about 75 of the atmospheres mass and almost all of its water vapor and aerosols

It is where Earths climate like rain snow thunder or storms occur It is where people live

Rapid deepening is a condition that happens when the minimum sea level atmospheric pressure of a tropical cyclone goes down at lot very quickly The National Weather Service describes rapid deepening as a decrease of 42 millibars in less than 24 hours However this phrase is usually applied to most storms that are quickly becoming stronger

Doppler radar uses the Doppler effect to measure the radial velocity of targets in the antennas directional beam The Doppler effect shifts the received frequency up or down based on the radial velocity of target in the beam allowing for the direct and highly accurate measurement of target velocity

The horseshoe crab or king crab is a benthic or bottom dwelling creature Its main habitat is river estuaries

It is not a crab at all but a relative of the arachnids

On its dome shaped carapace the horseshoe crab has four small eyes It has two compound eyes at the sides of the carapace and two simple eyes on the front 

A horseshoe crab has twelve legs five pairs of walking legs and a set of tiny pincers The long spiky tail is not used as a weapon or for defense instead it is just used for steering and flipping the body over if it gets turned upside down

Atlantic horseshoe crabs Limulus polyphemus can be found all over the eastern coast of North America and Mexico Buried under mud or sand they eat small clams crustaceans and worms All over the coast you will find their shells washed up on shore Some of these shells are quite big as the horseshoe crab can grow up to two feet long and a foot wide Horseshoe crabs will go through moults to reach that size

The horseshoe crab population ranges from the Yucatn Peninsula to northern Maine but they are most commonly found in the mid Atlantic region between Virginia and New Jersey Each major estuary along the coast has its own horseshoe crab population distinguished from one another by size colour and eye pigment The females lay about 100000 eggs

The other three species are also called horseshoe crabs The Japanese horseshoe crab is found in the Seto Inland Sea and is considered an endangered species because of loss of habitat Two other species occur along the east coast of India Tachypleus gigas and Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda All four are quite similar in form and behavior

Horseshoe crabs are quite ancient They were definitely present in the early Ordovician 450 million years ago in a Burgess Shale type environment They are relatives of the Eurypterids whose first fossils come from the same time Their body shape has not changed much since then and they have been called living fossils However the Atlantic horseshoe crab itself has no fossil record at all and the genus Limulus goes back only some 20 million years not 200 million

The order they belong to the Xiphosura are basal to a clade of the Eurypterida and the Arachnida It is estimated that the Xiphosura diverged from the Arachnida 480 million years ago

An Atlantic hurricane refers to a tropical cyclone that forms in the Atlantic Ocean usually in the Northern Hemisphere during the summer or autumn with one minute maximum sustained winds of at least 74 mph When applied to hurricanes Atlantic generally refers to the entire Atlantic basin which includes the North Atlantic Ocean Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico

Most Atlantic tropical storms and hurricanes form between June 1 and November 30 The United States National Hurricane Center monitors the basin and gives out reports watches and warnings about tropical weather systems for the Atlantic Basin as one of the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers for tropical cyclones as defined by the World Meteorological Organization

Tropical disturbances that reach tropical storm intensity are named from a pre determined list On average 101 named storms form each season with an average of 59 becoming hurricanes and 25 becoming major hurricanes The climatological peak of activity is around September 10 every season

The P 47 Thunderbolt was a fighter aircraft made by Republic Aviation It first flew in 1941 and was introduced in 1942 It had a very big Pratt and Whitney R 2800 59 engine which had more than 2000 horsepower Because of this the P 47 could go more than 430 miles per hour In fact it was the biggest engine ever at the time It had 8 machine guns 2 more than most fighters Its shape and speed made it similar to the Fw 190

During 1944 the P 51 Mustang was lighter faster and could turn better Because of this it started replacing the P 47 as a fighter The P 47 was then used for bombing in late World War II It was retired from the American Air National Guard in 1955

Now there is a jet called the A 10 Thunderbolt II and it is named after the P 47

Judo meaning Gentle Way comes from the ancient Samurai art in Japan named Jiujitsu

Jujitsu was a deadly art that used chokes throws joint locks and strikes to knock out or kill opponents Kano Jigoro who created Judo took the safest techniques from Jiujitsu and combined them to create this new Japanese martial art

Judo is very scientific in its training methods and fighting techniques

Humus is often described as the life force of the soil 

Yet it is difficult to define humus in precise terms it is a highly complex substance the full nature of which is still not fully understood

In the earth sciences humus means any organic matter which has reached a point of stability where it will break down no further and might if conditions do not change remain essentially as it is for centuries or millennia

In agriculture humus is often used simply to mean mature compost or natural compost extracted from a forest or other spontaneous source for use to amend soil

Physically the difference between humus and organic matter is that organic matter is rough looking material with coarse plant remains still visible while once fully humified it becomes more uniform in appearance and amorphous in structure That is it has no determinate shape structure or character 

Soil science deals with soil as a natural resource on the surface of the earth 

It includes soil formation classification and mapping 

But many more sciences deal with knowledge of soils and the advancement of the soil sciences engineering agronomists chemistry geology geography biology microbiology sylviculture public health archaeology and regional planning

Soil refers to anything between the top of the dirt and the top of the underlying rock Soil is often broken into layers The top layer is high in organic matter Then there is a layer of layer of soil where rain water has removed some metals Those metals get collected in another lower layer Finally there is a layer made up mostly of broken bits of bedrock A soil can have all of these layers or only a few 

Soils are important because most groundwater which is used in everything from city water supplies to farming is found in soil not bedrock 

Queens Counsel during the reign of a male sovereign known as Kings Counsel are senior lawyers in various Commonwealth countries

They are appointed by letters patent to be one of Her Majestys Counsel learned in the law They are not a separate type of lawyer They are more than long serving lawyers because their status is given by the Crown and recognised by the courts 

Queens Counsel have the privilege of sitting within the Bar of court and wear silk gowns of a special design  The special robes are the reason why becoming a QC is often called taking silk

In order to take silk a lawyer usually has to serve as a barrister or a Scottish advocate for at least 10 years Recently solicitors have also been appointed Queens Counsel

A QCs status means they generally charge higher fees than ordinary barristers and always have another barrister as an assistant This assistant is called a junior even if the junior has been a lawyer longer than the silk

Pedogenesis or soil evolution is the process by which soil is created 

Climate regulates soil formation Soils are more developed in areas with higher rainfall and more warmth The rate of chemical weathering increases by 2 3 times when the temperature increases by 10 degrees Celsius Climate also affects which organisms are present affecting the soil chemically and physically

The organisms living in and on the soil form distinct soil types Coniferous forests have acidic leaf litter and form what are known as inceptisols Mixed or deciduous forests leave a larger layer of humus changing the elements leached and accumulated in the soil forming alfisols Prairies have very high humus accumulation creating a dark thick A horizon characteristic of mollisols

The rock from which soil is formed is called parent material The main types are eolian glacial till glacial outwash alluvium lacustrine parent material and residual parent material or bedrock

Pedogenesis is the major topic of the science of pedology whose other aspects include the soil morphology classification of soils and their distribution in nature present and past

Eleven is a number It comes between ten and twelve is an odd number and is a prime number after 2 3 5 and 7

In Roman numerals 11 is written as XI

Twelve is a number It comes between eleven and thirteen and is an even number It is divisible by 2 3 4 and 6 Its ordinal is 12th In Roman numerals it is written as XII It is the base of duodecimal numbers Twelve is also the number of monkeys in a Bruce Willis movie

Sedimentary rocks are rocks formed from sediment They are deposited over time and often show layers which can be seen in cliffs 

Sediments are usually formed from matter which falls to the bottom of oceans and lakes The matter includes tiny pieces of other rocks and dead animals plants and microorganisms Also inorganic chemicals may be precipitated from solution in the water

Sedimentary rocks cover 75 80 of the Earths land area Other types of rock are igneous rock and metamorphic rock

Squeezed and compressed over time the sediments become consolidated into layers of rock 

Cementation occurs when dissolved mineral components deposit in the interstices of sediments It is the sticking together of sediment that forms a rock 

Otherwise rocks may have the water squeezed out yet remain for long periods with their character unchanged There are many quarries of unconsolidated deposits where sand and pebbles are removed for the construction industry Such quarries may be taking out sand which has lasted as sand since the Jurassic period But consolidated sand sandstone can be a very hard rock

Consolidated rocks mady be changed some more by water seeping through or by heat and extreme pressure

Sediments are formed by three processes 1 Solids swept down from the land 2 Bits pieces laid down in water eg shells 3 Chemicals in solution which may be precipitated These sedimentary processes weathering transportation and deposition reach three final end products quartz sand shale and limestone Most sedimentary rocks are variations on this general pattern

Chalk limestone and dolomite are all basically made from calcium carbonate This comes from a mixture of minerals and pieces of animals They are mostly formed in oceans Shales sandstones and conglomerates are all clastic rocks They are made from pieces of other rocks The pieces may have come from erosion by water ice or wind Coal is made from ancient plants oil and natural gas is also organic in origin 

Sedimentary rocks may be found anywhere on Earth When sedimentary rocks are heated and squeezed they become metamorphic rocks Igneous rocks have a volcanic origin Over a very long time rocks get recycled in two ways When marine sediments are raised above sea level they get weathered and the pieces carried down to the sea On a much longer time scale continental plates may collide Then one plate goes under the other and all its material is recycled emerging much later

Fourteen is a number It comes between thirteen and fifteen and is an even number It is divisible by 2 and 7 10 4 14 fourteen

14 is also an age A person of age 14 would be a teenager

In Roman numerals 14 is written as XIV

A rock is a naturally occurring solid made of minerals The minerals in the rocks vary making different kinds of rock The Earths crust is made of rock Rock is often covered by soil or water Rock is beneath the oceans lakes and rivers of the earth and under the polar icecaps Petrology is the scientific study of rocks

Rocks are classified by their minerals and chemical make up The processes that formed them are also noted Rocks may be igneous sedimentary and metamorphic Rock types may change in a so called rock cycle

Igneous rocks are formed when molten magma cools They are divided into two main categories plutonic rock and volcanic rock Plutonic or intrusive rocks are made when magma cools and crystallizes slowly within the Earths crust Volcanic or extrusive rocks result from magma reaching the surface either as lava or ejecta

Sedimentary rocks are the most common rocks on Earth They form at or near the Earths surface Sedimentary rock is formed in layers which were laid down one by one on top of another Some of the layers are thin some are thick Layers are made by deposition of sediment organic matter and chemical precipitates Deposition is followed by squeezing of sediment under its own weight and cementation This process is called consolidation it turns the sediment into a more or less hard substance

The approximate amounts of different kinds of sedimentary rock are

Only sedimentary rocks have fossils

Metamorphic rocks are formed by rocks coming under great consistantpressure and high temperatures These temperatures and pressures are found under mountains and volcanoes especially when continental plates move together These conditions change the make up of the original minerals

Rocks have had an impact on human life They have been used by humans for over 2 million years The mining of rocks for their metal has been one of the most important things in human advancement 

Fifteen is a number It comes between fourteen and sixteen and is an odd number It is divisible by 3 and 5

Weathering is the decomposition of rocks soils and their minerals through direct contact with the Earths atmosphere 

Weathering is the first of two processes which break down the surface of the land The second is erosion where broken material is moved downhill towards the sea

Dynamic movement is always taking place on Earth One type of change raises the land surface upwards to form huge mountain ranges This orogeny is formed as a result of plate tectonics such as the collision of continental plates

At the same time all land surfaces are being ground down gradually all the time Material from the land ends up in the seas or lakes and forms the sediment which finally ends up as sedimentary rock Rocks and minerals break up under the influence of water ice wind and gravity and other causes

The two main types of weathering are mechanical and chemical

Mechanical or physical weathering means the breakdown of rocks and soils through direct contact with atmospheric conditions such as heat water ice and pressure 

Wind processes are called aeolian Wind erodes the Earths surface by removing loose fine grained particles called deflation

Wind carrying sand wears grinds down surfaces with its windbourne particles

Regions which have intense and sustained erosion are called deflation zones Most aeolian deflation zones are composed of desert pavement a sheet like surface of rock fragments that remains after wind and water have removed the fine particles Almost half of Earths desert surfaces are stony deflation zones The rock mantle in desert pavements protects the underlying material from deflation

Rain is another force that works slowly The force of raindrops on some rocks make them wear down Rain also can make a chemical change in some rocks The water mixes with the minerals in the rock to break it down

Changing temperature can make a rock crack Every day when the sun shines on the rock its surface is heated Heat causes the surface to expand a little The inside of the rock though does not heat up as fast as the outside of the rock The inside of the rock stays cooler At night the surface cools down and contracts The expanding and contracting makes some places on the surface weak and a crack is made

Also if water gets into a crack in a rock and the temperature goes below the freezing point the water will freeze and expand After some time the rock may be weak enough to break into pieces

Ice which can be miles thick grinds the surface of the rock below it The particles are carried with the ice and if a glacier ends up in the sea so does all the material carried with it

Chemical weathering is the direct effect of atmospheric or biological chemicals in the breakdown of rocks soils and minerals

The carbon dioxide cycle is most important for weathering CO2 is put into the atmosphere mostly by volcanoes and it is taken out of the atmosophere by photosynthesis and by one other process 

While it is in the air CO2 can dissove in water droplets to form dilute carbonic acid

In fact since volcanoes have not been very active in the Cainozoic the supply of CO2 has been run down somewhat It is thought this may have led to the Pleistocene ice ages

When rain hits rock it does so with mechanical energy and dilute acid The acid dissolves many types of minerals and rocks though of course very slowly When a mineral like feldspar is dissolved it lets sodium ions into the sea chlorine ions come from other minerals The sea tastes salty because of the elements which have been dissolved out of rocks

Recrystallization is an essentially physical process that has meanings in chemistry metallurgy and geology

In chemistry recrystallization is a procedure for purifying compounds A crystal compound often has other compounds on it that make it less useful To get rid of these extra items the crystal is placed in a boiling liquid Soon the crystal dissolves The boiling solution or the mix of the liquid and the dissolved crystal gets colder The crystal will form again The unwanted compounds stay in the solvent or the liquid Now the crystal is pure and made of only the compound Each type of compound works best in a certain type of liquid Sometimes two or more liquids mixed together are needed to dissolve a crystal

In geology solid state recrystallization is a metamorphic process that occurs under situations of intense temperature and pressure where grains atoms or molecules of a rock or mineral are packed closer together creating a new crystal structure Limestone is a sedimentary rock that undergoes metamorphic recrystallization to form marble and clays can recrystallize to muscovite mica

In metallurgy recrystallization is the nucleation and growth of new undeformed grains in a deformed metal

For ice recrystallization means the growth of larger crystals at the expense of smaller ones Some biological antifreeze proteins have been shown to inhibit this process and the effect may be relevant in freezing tolerant organisms

General licences under the Wildlife Countryside Act 1981 are issued each year by the Department for Food and Rural Affairs in England

Killing most mammals and almost all birds is illegal in the United Kingdom except for certain types and for certain reasons 

DEFRA can give a licence to kill or disturb birds It also gives out a general licence This allows any authorised person that is someone who has the landowners permission to kill certain birds or to destroy their eggs or nests if there is no other way to get rid of the birds This table shows the name of the bird and the reasons that type of bird can be destroyed 

1or to prevent serious damage to livestock or damage to foodstuffs for livestock crops vegetables fruit growing timber fisheries or inland waters

Soil classification means that one finds categories of soils that are based on general characteristics as well as criteria that decide about the use that is possible

Soil classification can be approached from both the perspective of pedogenesis and from soil morphology But in both cases interpretations do not vary widely 

A manor house or fortified manor house is a country house which has historically formed the centre of a manor The term is sometimes used for relatively small country houses which belonged to gentry families as well as to grand stately homes particularly as a technical term for minor late medieval castles more intended for show than for defence

In general terms the manor house was the house of a feudal lord of a manor which he occupied only on occasional visits if he held many manors Although not built with strong fortifications as castles were many manor houses were partly fortified they were enclosed within walls or ditches Often the farm buildings were within these walls as well Many of manor houses were equipped with small gatehouses and watchtowers 

The main feature of the manor house was its great hall By the beginning of the 16th century manor houses as well as small castles began to acquire the character and amenities of the residences of country gentlemen This late 16th century transformation produced many of the smaller Renaissance chteaux of France and the many country mansions of the Elizabethan and Jacobean styles in England 

In France the terms chteau or manoir are often used synonymously to describe a French manor house Maison forte is another French word to describe a strongly fortified manor house In the western France provinces of Brittany and Normandy certain large manors enjoyed real means of protection 

In modern usage the term manor or manor house is often used especially outside Europe to mean simply either a country house or indeed any other house considered to resemble one without any reference to age or to the historical sense of the term

The English country house is generally accepted as a large house that was once in the ownership of an individual who in most of the cases owned another great house in the West End of London The country house was not only a weekend retreat for aristocrats but also often a full time residence for the minor gentry

The country houses of England have developed over the last 500 years Before this time larger houses were fortified in most of the cases because their owners were feudal lords or overlords of their manor The Tudor period of stability in the country saw the first of the large unfortified coutry houses 

With the rise of modern industry when people left the country to go to the big cities the popularity of country houses declined as there were less people in the country After 1945 it became very difficult to pay for the huge staff that was required to maintain these houses

The larynx is an organ in the neck of mammals and other animals It helps to protect the wind pipe by stopping it from inhaling food It also helps with breathing and making sounds The larynx houses the vocal cords It is also known as the voicebox 

Sound is created in the larynx Both pitch and loudness are manipulated here This source sound is changed as it travels through the vocal tract It becomes a different sound based on the position of the tongue lips mouth and pharynx 

During swallowing the backward motion of the tongue forces part of the larynx called the epiglottis over the laryngeal opening This is to prevent swallowed material from entering the lungs The larynx is also pulled upwards to help with this process If the larynx is irritated by something that is swallowed a strong cough reflex is used to protect the lungs 

There are several things that can cause a larynx to not function properly Some symptoms are hoarseness loss of voice pain in the throat or ears and breathing difficulties Larynx transplant is not done very often The worlds first successful operation took place in 1998 at the Cleveland Clinic and the second took place in October 2010 at the University of California Medical Center in Sacramento

An endangered species is a group of plants animals or other organisms that is in danger of becoming extinct This could happen because there are few of that animal left its predators have grown in number or the climate that it lives in is changing or the places it lives in have been destroyed The World Conservation Union has worked out that endangered species are 40 of all organisms 

Many countries have laws to protect these plants and animals These laws can save species by stopping hunting land development or making parks and reserves Only a few plants and animals at risk of extinction are put on the lists and get legal protection Many more species become extinct or will become extinct without people knowing about it

Some of the animals that are listed as endangered are

Archosaurs are a group of reptiles including all crocodiles birds dinosaurs and pterosaurs There are also a number of smaller extinct groups mostly from the Triassic period

They have these diagnostic features called synaptomorphies in cladistics talk

The archosaurs or their immediate ancestors survived the catastrophic PermianTriassic extinction event Then in the early and middle Triassic there was rapid evolution into the types of land reptile which dominated the rest of the Mesozoic era

The MS Explorer was a cruise ship It had been known as MS Lindblad Explorer and MS Society Explorer It was registered in Liberia It was designed for sailing in cold areas such as around Antarctica The MS Explorer was originally ordered by the Swedish explorer Lars Eric Lindblad The ship was sold several times Its last owner was the Toronto based travel company GAP Adventures It had bought the Explorer in 2004 

Besides being the first cruise ship ever built specifically to ply the frigid waters of the Antarctic Ocean the Explorer became the first ever to sink there when it struck an unidentified submerged object possibly ice on November 23 2007 which caused a 10 by 4 inch gash in the hull Everyone escaped from Explorer in the early hours of November 23 2007 after taking on water near the South Shetland Islands in the Southern Ocean which is usually stormy but was calm at the time The Explorer was confirmed by the Chilean Navy to have sunk at approximately position 62 degrees 24 minute South and 57 degrees 16 minutes west between South Shetlands and Grahams Land in the Bransfield Strait where the depth is roughly 2000 feet 

Commissioned by Lars Eric Lindblad the Swedish American pioneer of exotic expedition tours the Explorer was built in 1969 at Nystads Varv shipyard in Uusikaupunki Finland The ship was built to stay afloat with two of its compartments filled with water and its ice class on the HELCOM scale was IC

The vessel was originally named the Lindblad Explorer in honor of Lars Eric Lindblad On February 11 1972 the Explorer ran aground near La Plaza Point Antarctica its passengers Lars Eric Lindblad among them were rescued by the Chilean Navy It was towed to Buenos Aires Argentina and then to Kristiansand Norway for repairs 

In 1998 Explorer was the first ship to sail around the James Ross Island

The Explorer was depicted on at least two postage stamps issued by South Georgia 

The ship left Ushuaia Argentina on November 11th 2007 on a 19 day cruise intended to trace the route of 20th century explorer Ernest Shackleton through the Drake Passage After visiting the Falkland Islands and South Georgia Island the Explorer hit an unidentified submerged object in the Bransfield Strait close to King George Island in the Antarctic Ocean near the South Shetland Islands on November 23 2007 The object struck by the Explorer caused a 10 by 4 inch hole to the ships port side which allowed sea water to enter the ship 

A passenger reported sea water in the cabin at about 0300 UTC Although some reports indicate there had been no noticeable impact or at least nothing more than the normal crunching of ice experienced when sailing through icy waters other reports say that there was a loud bang Some reports also indicate that the ship drifted into an iceberg on the Explorers starboard side while the crew was assessing damage caused by the original impact to the port side of the ship

Calcite is one of the most widely distributed minerals on the Earths surface It is a common constituent of sedimentary rocks limestone in particular It is also the primary mineral in metamorphic marble

It is a chemical or biochemical calcium carbonate corresponding to the formula CaCO3 and belongs to the carbonate mineral One can find it as a vein mineral in deposits from hot springs and in caverns as stalactites and stalagmites

A stalagmite is a form that can be found on the floor of a cave It rises from the floor of a limestone cave when mineralized solutions drip from the ceiling and deposits of calcium carbonate form columns on the ground The corresponding formation on the ceiling of a cave is known as a stalactite 

There are several methods to help remember which formation hangs from the ceiling and which rises from the floor

When touring caves with stalactites and stalagmites you might be asked to not touch the rock formations This is generally because the formation is considered to still be growing and forming Since the rock buildup is formed by minerals solidifying out of the water solution skin oils can disturb where the mineral water will cling So the development of the rock formation will be affected and not natural anymore

Stalactites and stalagmites can also form on concrete ceilings and floors but they form much more rapidly there than in the natural cave environment

Deposit could mean

Deposition is the geological process where by material is added to a landform 

This happens when wind and water lay down grains of material that has been eroded and transported from another geographical location Deposition happens when the forces that transport sediments are weaker than the forces of particle weight and friction which resist motion 

Calcium carbonate is a chemical compound with the chemical formula CaCO3 It is a common substance found as rock in all parts of the world and is the main component of seashells snails and eggshell Calcium carbonate is usually the main cause of hard water It is used as a calcium supplement or as a treatment for antacid but too much can be bad for your health

Calcium carbonate is found naturally as the following minerals and rocks

To test whether a mineral or rock contains calcium carbonate strong acids such as hydrochloric acid can be added to it If the sample does contain calcium carbonate it will fizz and produce carbon dioxide and water Weak acids such as acetic acid will react but less quickly All of the rocksminerals mentioned above will react with acid

Hard water is water that has a high mineral content

The main components of these minerals usually are calcium and magnesium ions But there are also dissolved metals bicarbonates and sulfates Calcium usually enters the water as either calcium carbonate in the form of limestone and chalk or calcium sulfate in the form of several other mineral deposits The main source of magnesium is dolomite Hard water is generally not harmful But in extreme case can cause death or make you very sick 

With soft water one describes types of water that contain few or no minerals like calcium or magnesium ions The term is usually relative to hard water which does contain significant amounts of such ions

Soft Water mostly comes from peat or igneous rock sources such as granite but may also come from sandstone sources since such sedimentary rocks are usually low in calcium and magnesium

However soft water does have negative side effects and can be bad for the heart Thus it should be drunk in moderation if at all 

Moorland or moor is a type of habitat that one can find in upland areas that are characterised by acidic soils 

Moorland habitats are rather common in the neotropics and tropical Africa but one can find them also in small scattered places in northern and western Europe northern Australia North America Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent In the tiny areas of European moorlands tend to be environments with only very few species They are often dominated by heather In the far more extensive moorlands of the tropics species diversity can be extremely high 

Moorlands differ from typical heathland in being colder and much wetter often with extensive bogs

Notable areas of upland moorland in Britain include the Dark Peak the Forest of Bowland the Lake District the Pennines Mid Wales the Southern Uplands of Scotland the Scottish Highlands and a few very small pockets in western Herefordshire

In Europe if the heather and other vegetation is left for too long a large volume of dry and combustible material builds up This is may cause a fire which may burn out a large area But generally moorland wildlife copes with even major fires and are easily able to recover if such intense burnings are not too frequent

Moorland could mean

In geography

In other fields

In context of biogeography Neotropic or Neotropical means one of the worlds eight terrestrial ecozones

This ecozone includes South and Central America the Mexican lowlands the Caribbean islands and southern Florida because these regions share a large number of plant and animal groups 

It is sometimes used as a synonym for the tropical area of South America although the ecozone also includes temperate southern South America Its fauna and flora are distinct from the Nearctic because of the long separation of the two continents The formation of the Isthmus of Panama joined the two continents 2 to 3 million years ago

The Neotropic includes more tropical rainforest than any other ecozone They extend from southern Mexico through Central America and northern South America to southern Brazil and include the Amazon Rainforest These rainforest ecoregions are one of the most important reserves of biodiversity on Earth Extensive deforestation in the late 20th century has reduced this diversity to a degree

For the thoroughbred racehorse see Nearctic

The Nearctic is one of the eight terrestrial ecozones dividing the Earths land surface

In ecology an ecozone is a large land mass that contains many terrestrial ecoregions each of which has unique plants and animals

The Nearctic ecozone covers most of North America including Greenland and the highlands of Mexico 

Southern Mexico southern Florida Central America and the Caribbean islands are part of the Neotropic ecozone together with South America

The World Wide Fund for Nature divides the Nearctic into four Bioregions defined as geographic clusters of ecoregions that may span several habitat types but have strong biogeographic affinities particularly at taxonomic levels higher than the species level

Nearctic was a Canadian bred Thoroughbred racehorse He had his most successful season in racing at 4 years old when he won nine races Nearctic was retired to stand at stud at Windfields Farm in Canada where he became father of a Kentucky Derby winner and the Northern Dancer He died at age 19 on July 27 1973

Stud could mean

Lockerbie is a small town in Scotland that was devastated on December 21 1988 when a Pan American 747 400 aeroplane crashed after a bomb exploded on board The bomb was hidden in a hand held radio in the rear cargo hold It had been transferred onto the flight from a connecting flight from Amsterdam All passengers and crew aboard the aeroplane and 11 people in the town of Lockerbie were killed The total number of people killed was 270 The Libyan government was found to have organized the bombing The United Nations placed sanctions on Libya which stopped people buying and selling items with Libya In 2003 Libya agreed to pay compensation to the families of the people killed

A circadian rhythm is a rhythm that repeats about every 24 hours Plants and animals have these built in cycles which allow them to flower at the right time sleep at the right time etc The word circadian comes from the Latin circa around and diem or dies day meaning about a day The study of biological time keeping rhythms such as daily tidal weekly seasonal and annual rhythms is called chronobiology

Circadian rhythms are built in so that without time signals from the environment they keep time at the rate of about 24 hour periods When kept in total darkness plants and animals continue to behave by the built in period which is about 24 hours The rhythms are also affected and re set by time signals such as daylight and the length of the day and the night It is important that the rhythms be re set regularly to the natural lightdark cycle Adult humans of all ages have a circadian rhythm which averages 24 hours and 11 minutes

The circadian rhythms also called the biological clock or the body clock of humans and other animals regulate many bodily functions including feeding sleeping body temperature and hormone production

The primary body clock in humans and other mammals is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus a pair of groups of cells in the hypothalamus in the brain Destruction of the SCN results in the complete absence of a regular sleepwake rhythm The SCN receives information about light through the eyes and directs the pineal gland to release the hormone melatonin at night

Some people have circadian rhythm sleep disorders which cause them to sleep much too early much too late or in several bouts throughout the day and night

A stud in animal breeding is a male animal such as a horse or dog that is employed for breeding The terms for the male of a given animal species usually mean that the animal is entire that is not castrated and therefore capable of standing at stud A specialized vocabulary exists for de sexed animals

A stud farm in animal husbandry is an establishment for selective breeding using stud animals

Castration is any action surgical chemical or otherwise by which a male loses the functions of the testes or a female loses the functions of the ovaries

Castration is commonly performed on domestic animals not intended for breeding Domestic animals are usually castrated in order to avoid unwanted or uncontrolled reproduction to reduce or prevent other ways of sexual behaviour such as territorial behaviour or aggression or to reduce other consequences of sexual behaviour that may make animal husbandry more difficult such as fence destruction when animals try to get to nearby females of the species

Male horses are usually castrated because stallions are rather aggressive The same applies to male mules although they are sterile Male cattle are castrated to improve muscling and docility for use as oxen

A specialized vocabulary has arisen for neutered animals of given species

A bullock is a bull that has been castrated  its testicles have been removed They are castrated so that the animal can be calmer or to put on weight more quickly

Bureaucracy is typical for large organizations and government It means the structure and set of regulations that control the activities of people that work for these organizations 

It is characterized by standardized procedure formal division of responsibility hierarchy and impersonal relationships In practice the interpretation and execution of policy can lead to informal influence

Bureaucracy is a concept in sociology and political science Four structural concepts are central to any definition of bureaucracy a well defined division of administrative labor among persons and offices a personnel system with consistent patterns of recruitment and stable linear careers a hierarchy among offices such that the authority and status are differentially distributed among actors and formal and informal networks that connect organizational actors to one another through flows of information and patterns of cooperation 

Examples of everyday bureaucracies include governments armed forces corporations hospitals courts ministries and schools

Sion is the capital of the Swiss canton of Valais In 2002 it had a population of 27700 

Landmarks include the Basilique de Valre and Chteau de Tourbillon

The city is home to 28013 people as of 31 December 2005factdateApril 2009 It is in the center of the Rhne valley Sion is the economic and commercial hub of the region and canton

The older area of the city still stays and is well preserved As well as the two Chteaus a number of other important buildings are there such as the Chteau de la Majorie the Htel de Ville and the Cathdrale Notre Dame de Sion

Sion really started to develop during the time when Celts were big

It takes its name from the Latin word Sedunum It housed the Romans with the rest of the surrounding area in the first century BCE  

The Roman Catholic bishop of Sion is the oldest in Switzerland and one of the oldest north of the Alps

The tertiary sector is the main economic sector in Sion Tourism is also an important sector due to its historic chteaus and museums 

Sion is the third largest wine making region in Switzerland however the valuable agricultural land and vineyards are undergoing constant regression due to the process of urbanisation

Sion has also become an important medical site The Sion Region hospital is here next to the central institute of Valaisan hospitals and the Romande clinic for physical rehabilitation

Finally the commune hosts a waste incinerator which disposes of the waste from 44 surrounding communes This incinerator is equipped with a catalytic converter something that reduces harmful gases to below unacceptable levels The heat created from the burning is converted into electrical energy that is then provided to local communes

Public Airshows have been held at the airfield of Sion Participated Aerobatic teams have been for example the Frecce Tricolori from Italy was well as the Patrouille de France

Sion is on the main railway line the motorway and also has an airport

It has a population of 14355 It is situated at the language border of the German speaking upper part of the Wallis and the French speaking Valais This city counts as one of the three official bilingual towns in Switzerland Sierre is starting point for the tourist sites of the Val dAnniviers including the villages of Vercorin Chandolin St Luc Vissoie St Jean Chandolin Grimentz Zinal and Ayer Sierre is connected with Crans Montana by a cable car

At the beginning of the 20th century Sierre became economically important as very early aluminium smelting is enabled by its access to hydroelectricity 

The historic town of 5000 people is part of the Brig Glis municipality The name Brig comes from Briva or bridge Its medieval name was Briga dives It is a small town in the Swiss canton of the Valais at the foot of the northern slope of the Simplon Pass on the right bank of the Saltine stream and a little above its junction with the Rhone Its older houses look very Italian Its buildings were built during the 17th century because of a single member of the local Stockalper family

Brig is close to the Swiss Italian borders The language used when talking between one another is a unique German dialect used only in this canton Brig is popular among winter sport athletes since it is surrounded by many Alp summits The town itself is close to Rhone river Due to the height the temperatures in winter often remain below zero resulting in frost During the summer season heat can be intense

The place of meeting in the town is the train station which links it to other Swiss cities

The wealth of Brig is because of the Simplon Pass  The opening of the carriage road across the Simplon and of the tunnel beneath the pass as well as the fact that above Brig is the steeper and less fertile portion of the Upper Valais greatly increased the importance and size of the town

The Pennine Alps are a mountain range in the western part of the Alps They are in Switzerland and Italy

It is near the valley of the Rhone River from its springs to Lake Geneva that separates Pennine Alps from the Bernese Alps The canton is one of the drier parts of Switzerland in its central Rhone valley It is also one of most well watered parts having large amounts of snow and rain up on the highest peaks in Switzerland It is perhaps best known world wide for the Matterhorn 

The canton of Valais is in the south of Switzerland To its south is Italy to the southwest France To the north the canton there are the Swiss cantons of Vaud and Bern the cantons of Uri and Ticino lie to its east

The wide icy Rhone valley dominates the area There are many side valleys off the main valley At the head of the Mattertal valley is Zermatt a pretty tourist village dominated by views of the Matterhorn Fifty of the mountains are more than 4000m high with the highest Monte Rosa that reaches to 4638m and there are many glaciers 

The Rhne drains the main valley from east to west up to Martigny Switzerland then in a right angle north to its mouth in the Lake Geneva After the small town of Saint Maurice the northern banks of the river belong to the canton of Vaud The main valley is between the Bernese Alps in the north and the Pennine Alps in the south Only about half of the total area is considered productive

The Romans called the area Vallis Poenina 

In 888 Valais became a part of the kingdom of Jurane Burgundy 

King Rudolph III of Burgundy gave the area to the Bishop of Sion in 999 and made him Count of the Valais The count bishops had to defend their area against the dukes of Savoy

Wine production and tourism are some of the main industries of the canton The Matterhorn near Zermatt is one of the biggest tourist attractions in the Swiss mountains as is its sister valley immediately east Saas Fee Other parts of the mountains of the canton farther west are popular as well such as the more French speaking resorts near Verbier and the Evolene Arolla region The resorts on the north side of the main Rhone river valley are popular looking out southwards towards the Peninne Alps and still part of the southern slope of the Bernese Alps such as the family oriented resort of Crans Montana The resorts in the Goms region are slightly less known yet also receive attention during the summer hiking season and the winter ski season 

Apart from tourism agriculture is still important particularly cattle breeding in the mountains and dairy farming in the plains The wine industry of the canton is the largest in Switzerland There are also a large number orchards in the area and saffron is also gathered here

The most industrial western region of the canton is called Chablais The area is very important for the economy There are a lot of factories the most important are the subsidiaries of Novartis and Syngenta in Monthey In the town of Collombey there is an oil refinery

Near Visp there is a large plant of aluminium manufacturing Other metal products and chemicals are produced around Visp and Sierre 

Despite the thriving tourist industry high level of infrastructure and the many vineyards canton Valais is still one of the poorest of the Swiss cantons and not near the wealthier bankingfinancial cantons A large portion of the cantons land and houses are now owned by foreigners

A small airport is at Sion but the main routes of transport are rail and road Both networks are large and benefit from tourism Many of the road passes are well known such as the Grimsel Pass The longest land tunnel in the world the Ltschberg Base Tunnel will soon be working in late 2007 perhaps connecting by rail the town of Frutigen in canton Bern with the town of Visp in canton ValaisWallis This is to better spread car traffic in the highly scenic Kandertal and also to provide faster transport through the Bernese Alps from the populous Mittelland in the north to the southern canton of Valais Cars may be loaded onto the trains as freight

Valais is mostly French speaking The eastern part of the canton Upper Valais however speaks Walliser German The French speaking population makes up a two thirds of the population

The people of the canton are spread thinly The largest towns are the capitals Sion Sierre and Brig There is no major city in the canton Most of the population is Roman Catholic

The following are the cities of the canton by district

Conthey is a district in the canton of Valais Switzerland It contains the following municipalities

Martigny is the capital city of the French speaking district of Martigny in the canton of Valais in Switzerland

It is 495 meters high It has a population of about 15000 people Martigny is at the joining of Italy France and Switzerland one road linking this town over the Great St Bernard Pass to Aosta and the other one over the col de la Forclaz to Chamonix In winter Martigny is appreciated for its nearby ski resorts like Verbier

In the first century BCE present day Martigny was an oppidum or vicus of a Celtic tribe the Veragri It was then called Octodurus or Octodurum When Julius Caesar was in Gaul he sent Servius Galba with the twelfth legion and some cavalry into the country of the Nantuates Veragri and Seduni His purpose in sending this force was to open the pass over the Alps the pass of the Great St Bernard by which road the mercatores had been used to travel at great risk and with the payment of great tolls The people of the Alps allowed the Italian merchants to pass because if they plundered them the merchants would not come but they got as much out of them as they could Galba after taking many strong places and receiving the submission of the people sent off two cohorts into the country of the Nantuates and with the remaining cohorts determined to winter in Octodurus which was in a valley with no great extent of level ground near it confined on all sides by very lofty mountains There is some level ground at Martigny and the valley of the Rhone at this part is not very narrow Caesar says that the town of Octodurus was divided into parts by a river but he does not mention the rivers name It is the Dranse Galba gave one part of the town to the Galli to winter in and assigned the other to his troops He fortified himself with a ditch and rampart and thought he was safe He was however suddenly attacked by the Galli before his defences were complete or all his supplies were brought into the camp Thus began the Battle of Octodurus The Romans obstinately defended themselves in a six hours fight when seeing that they could no longer keep the enemy out they made a sortie which was successful The Romans estimated the Galli at more than 30000 and Caesar says that more than a third part were destroyed The slaughter of the enemy was prodigious which has been made an objection to Caesars veracity or to Galbas who made his report to the commander It has also been objected that the valley is not wide enough at Martigny to hold the 30000 men There may be error in the number that attacked and also in the number who perished After this escape Galba prudently withdrew his troops and marching through the country of the Nantuates reached the land of the Allobroges where he wintered

The region joined the Roman Empire In 47 Emperor Claudius founded Forum Claudii Augusti later renamed Forum Claudii Vallensium to avoid confusion with another city that was dear to him Octodurus was the principal town of the area until the displacement of the episcopal see to Sion in the 4th century Pliny says that the Octodurenses received the Latinitas The town appears in the Antonine Itinerary and in the Tabula Peutingeriana In the Notit Prov the place is called Civitas Vallensium Octodurus At a later period it was called Forum Claudii Vallensium Octodurensium as an inscription shows One authority speaks of the remains of a Roman aqueduct at Martigny Many coins and other memorials of the Roman time have been found about the place

The name Octodur is manifestly Celtic The second part of the name is Dur water The first part probably some corrupt form is not explained The town sat on the Roman road from Augusta Praetoria in Italy

The Romans left many ruins The city is known for the amphitheatre which was restored in 1978 Cow fights are held in the amphitheatre during early autumn for the Comptoir The city is also famous for its museum the Pierre Gianadda Foundation built on top of Roman ruins

Mattertal is a valley in the Alps of Switzerland which begins on the side of the Matterhorn The Matterhorn is one of the most famous mountains in the world because of its beauty and because it is hard to climb 

The Mattertal is a valley that was made by a glacier moving down from the mountain This can be seen from the deep U shape of the valley Because the sides of the valley are very steep there are often landslides One can be seen in the photo taken near Randa village Many houses in the villages are called chalets These can be seen in the picture of Tsch village

In the Mattertal are villages which include Zermatt Tsch Randa Grchen and St Niklaus Many tourists like to stay in the villages to see the view to go walking skiing or mountain climbing The traditional work of the people is dairy farming but many people work in the tourist industry

Zermatt is a famed ski resort and is a tourist destination Until the mid 1800s it was mostly a farming community its name as well as that of the Matterhorn itself derives from the alpine meadows or matten in the valley In the German language the town is Zur Matte or in the meadow 

The town was discovered mid century by British mountaineers most notably Edward Whymper whose conquest of the Matterhorn made the village famous worldwide

Zermatt is a closed village which means that non Swiss nationals are not permitted to buy property within the area May is the worst time to visit this city as most of the streets are muddy

Zermatt is a good place to start many hikes into the surrounding mountains such as the Haute Route that ultimately leads to Chamonix in France A complex of cable cars and chair lifts carry skiers in the winter and hikers in the summer the highest of them leads to the Klein Matterhorn a small outcropping on the ridge between Breithorn and Matterhorn that offers cool views in all directions It is possible to cross into Italy via the Cervinia cable car station

Any automobile that uses an engine is not allowed in Zermatt because of concerns for air pollution Electric vehicles are allowed for local commerces The Cantonal police allow some people to park in the northern section of this city Some emergency vehicles are also allowed to use combustion engines

The Corvidae are the crow family They are all passerines There are over 120 species in this family which includes

The word crow is also used to describe birds in the genus Corvus This genus includes true crows jackdaws and ravens

Crows are found on every continent except for the southern area of South America and Antarctica Most crows are found in South America Central America Europe and Asia There are only 10 species each in Africa Australia and North America

A group of crows is called a murder

Most members of the crow family are black such as crows rooks choughs ravens and jackdaws However not all crows are black Magpies and treepies can be black and white or blue and green or brown Jays are often blue and white

Crows are some of the most intelligent birds in the world Crows and rooks are good at using tools for example sticks or twigs Magpies can see themselves in a mirror and they understand that it is a reflection Many crows live near to humans in towns and cities Some crows live in forests They are more shy than the crows that live in cities

Some crows in North America Europe and northern Asia migrate This means they travel to different places in summer or winter Most crows are resident birds This means they live in the same place all year round 

Many crows live in large groups For example many rooks nest together in large groups at the top of trees This is called a rookery Crows in big groups are often noisy However when it is the breeding season crows can become angry and will scare off other crows

Crows eat lots of different types of food They will eat baby birds and eggs from nests small animalsand rats carrion vegetables and garbage Because they eat babies birds sometimes crows are mobbed by other birds This is when the parents and other birds will try to chase off the crow to stop it from eating the babies Also on farms crows will eat vegetables and seeds Farmers do not want this to happen so they make a scarecrow This is a object made of straw and old clothes It looks like a man and it scare the crows away 

Crows make their nests in tall trees They make the nest from large sticks The usually lay 3  8 eggs Both parents will look after the baby crows

Microbiotheria are a small order of marsupial mammals with only one living species the Monito del Monte

It is the sole New World representative of the superorder Australidelphia all other New World marsupials are members of Ameridelphia 

The species is nocturnal and arboreal and lives in thickets of Chilean bamboo in the temperate rain forests of the southern Andes It eats mainly insects and other small invertebrates supplemented with fruit

At one time they were placed in the order Didelphimorphia the opossums but due to several morphological differences were placed in a separate order The skulls shape is peculiar with several technical differences from the opossums

It has long been suspected that South American marsupials were ancestral to those of Australia The two continents were connected via Antarctica in the early Cainozoic 

Australias earliest known marsupial is Djarthia a primitive mouse like animal that lived about 55 million years ago Djarthia had been identified as the earliest known australidelphian and this research suggested that the Monito del Monte was the last of a clade which included Djarthia 

In 2010 analysis of retrotransposon insertion sites in the nuclear DNA of marsupials confirmed the placement of the Monito del Monte in Australidelphia It also showed its position as the most basal of that superorder 

The study also confirmed that the most basal of all marsupial orders are the other two South American lineages This indicates that Australidelphia arose in South America and probably reached Australia in a single dispersal event after Microbiotheria split off

Dasyuromorphia are fair sized order of some of the more unusual carnivorous or insectivorous marsupials They vary in appearance from rodent like to cat like to dog like This order includes the ever famous Tasmanian devil In this order most of the marsupials have a pouch located on the belly However some of the broad footed marsupial mice have only folds of skin instead of true pouches and the numbat lacks a pouch entirely There are 63 species in 3 families although one of the families is probably extinct

Goat Rock Beach is a beach in Sonoma County California United States It is part of the Sonoma Coast State Beach which is owned by the State of California The mouth of the Russian River is located in the northern part of the beach Goat Rock is located in the southern part of the beach The beach itself was named after the rock The naming of Goat Rock is unknown but many sources say some goat herders around the early 20th century used the grassy flat rock for goats because few other animals could live there

Goat Rock Beach has many visitors It usually has the most people in the middle of summer The beach is a popular spot for swimming and surfing It is home to seagulls harbor seals and sea lions as well as other animals from the Pacific Ocean

The oldest natural history of the area is related to marks made by mammals in an area of rock about one third of a mile south of Goat Rock Beach In uplifted sea stack formations there are rubbing marks about two to four meters above the ground surface too high of a rubbing mark for modern bovids Mammoths are thought to have traveled here as recently as 40000 years ago and are thought to have made these rubbing marks Mammoth fossils have been found at Bodega Head which is a few miles south of Goat Rock Beach

The earliest known humans to settle at Goat Rock Beach were the Native American Coast Miwok and Pomo tribes During the mid 1800s Mexican ranchers lived in California and Goat Rock Beach was part of a Mexican land grant called the Bodega Rancho The Russians are thought to have begun cutting down the forests just north of the beach in the early 19th century

The Russian River which has its mouth at the north end of Goat Rock Beach is Sonoma Countys biggest watercourse and river Just north of the Russian River mouth is the small town of Jenner and the beach Jenner Beach Goat Rock is located at the south end of the beach Visitors can walk onto Goat Rock going on a small isthmus which is also known as a land bridge Blind Beach is just south of Goat Rock Beach with only Goat Rock between the two beaches and Goat Beach is southwest of it

Goat Rock Beach has much marine erosion and erosion from the wind This causes about one to three feet of land mass lost each year Erosion is when water and wind remove the top layer of rock or mud During big storms there can be even more erosion 

The sea stacks along the Goat Rock Beach coast are rocks from the Franciscan Complex rock formations which were made during earthquakes in California About 200 years to 30 million years ago the North American Plate collided with the Farallon Plate causing earthquakes Different rock types came from these collisions including pillow basalt chert and sandstone Goat Rock has a flat topped sea stack made of greywacke The rock formations are made of sandstone with layers of quartz

Greywacke is a type of sandstone It is hard and dark in color It has different sized grains of quartz feldspar and small rock fragments set in a compact fine clay matrix It is mostly found in Palaeozoic strata The larger grains can be sand to gravel sized and matrix materials make up more than 15 of the rock by volume 

The origin of greywacke was a problem Gravel sand and mud should not be laid down together because river outflow drops heavier grains first Now geologists think greywacke is formed by submarine avalanches or strong turbidity currents These actions churn sediment and cause mixed sediment slurries to occur When this happens the resulting rocks show various sedimentary features Support for the turbidity current origin is the fact that deposits of greywacke are found on the edges of the continental shelves at the bottoms of oceanic trenches and at the bases of mountain formational areas It also occurs in association with black shales of deep sea origin

Carmina Burana is the name given to a collection of texts form the 11th and 12th century There are over 240 texts in the collection most of them written in Latin some in Middle High German Most of the texts are moral or satirical in nature There are also texts about spring or about love Some of them are drinking songs some of them were used as Minnesang Some of the songs contain hints for the melodies For some the melodies can be reconstructed

The texts were written down around 1230 This happened either in an abbey in Styria or near Brixen They were discovered by Johann Christoph von Aretin in Benediktbeuern Abbey in 1803 Today they are in the Bavarian State Library in Munich There they can be found there as Codex Buranus with the signature clm 46604660a

Johann Andreas Schmeller edited them and published them as Carmina Burana Lieder aus Benediktbeuern 

Carl Orff took 24 of them as Carmina Burana He wrote the music for them The work was first performed in 1937 in the Opera house in Frankfurt am Main Together with his works Catulli Carmina and Trionfo di Afrodite he made a work containing all three called Trionfi Trionfi is performed much less than the Carmina Burana alone though

To the north of Thurgau is Lake Constance across which are Germany and Austria The river Rhine makes the border in the northwest To the south is the Canton of St Gallen to the west are the cantons of Zrich and Schaffhausen

The area of the canton is 991 km2 and is usually divided into three hilly areas One of these is along Lake Constance to the north Another is inland between the rivers Thur and Murg The third one makes the southern border of the canton and comes together with the Hrnli mountain in the pre Alps

In prehistoric times the lands of the canton were inhabited by people of the Pfyn culture along the lake During Roman times the canton was part of the province Raetia until in 450 the lands were settled by the Alamanni It was only in the 8th century that the canton became a political unit similar to what it is known today as a Gau of the Frankish Empire At the time however the area was not so clearly defined and changed frequently Overall the size of the Thurgau was larger but during the Middle Ages the canton became smaller in size The dukes of Zhringen and the counts of Kyburg took over much of the land The town of Zrich was part of the Thurgau until it became reichsunmittelbar in 1218 When the Kyburg dynasty became extinct in 1264 the Habsburgs took over that land The Swiss confederation allied with ten freed bailiwicks of the former Toggenburg seized the lands of the Thurgau from the Habsburgs in 1460 and it became subject territory of Zrich 

In 1798 the land became a canton for the first time as part of the Helvetic Republic In 1803 the canton of Thurgau became a member of the Swiss confederation The current cantonal constitution dates from 1987

The canton of Thurgau is known for farm produce such as apples pears and other fruits and vegetables The many orchards in the canton are used for the making of cider Wine is produced in the Thur valley

There is also industry in the canton of Thurgau The main industries are printing clothing and arts and crafts Small and middle sized businesses are important for the economy Many of these are concentrated around the capital

The population is mostly German speaking Most of the population are Protestants with the rest being Roman Catholics

The Canton of Thurgau is divided into eight districts and each is named after its capital

There are 80 municipalities in the canton

The area of the canton is 7105 km Only one third of this land is used for farming Forests cover 20 of the total area The canton has many mountains that make up the highlands of the Rhine and Inn river valleys Many of its scenic areas are part of the Swiss National Park or the Ela Nature Park

There are many important peaks in the Grison Alps including the Tdi at 3614 meters and the highest peak Piz Bernina at 4049 meters Many of the mountain ranges feature huge glaciers such as at the Adula the Albula the Silvretta the Bernina the Bregaglia and the Rtikon ranges The mountain ranges in the central area contain many of the deepest vallies in Switzerland

The canton borders Liechtenstein to the north Austria to the north and the east Italy to the south and the cantons of St Gallen to the northwest Glarus and the canton of Uri to the west and Ticino to the southwest The capital city is Chur Davos and St Mortiz are world famous resorts and can be found in this area

Most of the lands of the canton were once part of a Roman province called Raetia that was established in 15 BC The area later was part of the lands of the diocese at Chur

In 1367 the League of Gods House was founded against the power of the Bishop of Chur This was followed by the making of the Grey League sometimes called Oberbund in 1395 in the Upper Rhine valley The name Grey League is derived from the homespun grey clothes worn by the people The name of this league later gave its name to the canton of Graubnden 

The first step towards the naming of the canton into Graubnden was when the league of the Ten Jurisdictions allied with the League of Gods House in 1450 In 1471 the two leagues aligned with the Grey League This meant that the leagues allied with the Swiss Confederation The Habsburgs were defeated at Calven Gorge and Dornach helping the Swiss confederation and the allied leagues of the canton of Grisons to be recognized

The last traces of the bishop of Churs jurisdiction were abolished in 1526 The Musso war of the 1520 drove the Three Leagues closer to the Swiss Confederacy The lands of the canton of Graubnden were part of the Helvetic Republic but the perpetual ally of Switzerland became a canton in 1803 The constitution of the canton dates from 1892

The arms of the three original leagues are now all part of the coat of arms of the canton

Private cars were only allowed in the canton of Graubnden after several votings in 1926

The Graubnden are known for a dried beef delicacy called Bndnerfleisch and for a nut and honey pie known as Bndner Nusstorte Another specialty made mostly in the western part of Grison is Capuns a filling meal of pasta and a little bit of meat rolled into Chard leaves eventually baked in mode of a gratin with cheese

Agriculture and tourism make up most of the cantons economy Agriculture combines forests and mountain pasturage in summer mostly beef but also sheep and goats Tourism is all around the canton mainly around the towns of DavosArosa Flims and St MoritzPontresina which are important in both winter and summer There are a great number of other resorts people visiting the country can go to in the canton

There is wine production around the capital Chur Chur is also the center of industry In the southern valleys of MesolcinaMisox and Poschiavo there is corn and chestnut farming

The languages spoken in Graubnden are German in the northwest Romansh in the Engadin and around DisentisMustr and Standard Italian in the valleys MesolcinaMisox Calanca Val Bregaglia and Poschiavo

The main religions are Protestantism and Catholicism Both are well represented in the canton with Roman Catholics forming a slight majority

Graubnden is divided into 11 districts

There are 209 municipalities in Graubnden

Nidwalden is in the center of Switzerland To the north is Lake Lucerne Mountain ranges block in the rest of the canton on the other sides

In 1291 the people of Nidwalden joined Uri and Schwyz to form an alliance At the time there was no state but towards the end of the 14th century early forms of government were established This included institutionalized assemblies and courts In the 14th and 15th century the people of Nidwalden joined the people of Obwalden to discuss important matters but the two cantons were never really one For example Obwalden did not participate in the annexation of Bellinzona Riviera and Blenio areas

Around 1500 many people in Nidwalden worked as mercenary soldiers Many of these soldiers later emigrated This helped to lessen the pressure of a growing population A popular destination was the Alsace After rejecting a new constitution by Napoleon the ideas of the French Revolution were not popular in such an agricultural area Nidwalden was attacked by French troops on 9 September 1798 Random destruction was caused and at least 400 people were killed After the end of Napoleons rule in 1814 most of the changes were reverted Only in 1877 did Nidwalden introduce a new constitution The open assembly was abolished in 1997

The government is composed of seven members The local parliament has 60 seats

Nidwalden sends only one deputy to the Swiss Council of States

Up to the 1900s Nidwalden was taken over by agriculture Cattle and cheese were exported mainly to northern Italy Around 1500 many people in Nidwalden worked as mercenary soldiers 

From the middle of the 19th century onwards trade industry and tourism gained momentum Still until the 1950s agriculture took over the canton Today many small and middle sized businesses fill the economy The largest employer is the airplane constructor Pilatus The small and middle sized businesses work in a lot of areas Many provide work in machine construction medical equipment international trade optics and electronics

Traditional areas such as forestry and agriculture are still important Most farming is done with cattle and dairy products Family farms are still common in Nidwalden today

In recent years Nidwalden is becoming an increasingly popular place to live and work This is caused by its low taxes its central location between Zrich and Milan and the pretty countryside

Because of the mountainous geography tourism is important to Nidwalden The lake and mountains attract many tourists around the year 

Many local charities have kept local traditions intact There is traditional music yodeling dances theaters and festivals There are a number of modern cultural events such as concerts and galleries

Loan sharks are otherwise known as usurers as they often charge a lot of interest for very short term loans

Usury is illegal in many parts of the world In some countries charging any interest at all is illegal

The plan of Ovando was to develop the West Indies economically and expand the Spanish influence in the region

A Coaxial cable is a special electrical cable It is used to transmit signals The cable is specially insulated This makes it quite stiff Today coaxial cables are used for things like Cable TV Coaxial cables can also be used for computer networks but this is more rarely the case now as twisted pair cables can be used there more easily 

Such cables are usually made of a conducting wire Then there is some insulation then there is another layer of conducting material Finally there is the mantle Such cables are used as a high frequency transmission line to carry a high frequency or broadband signal Because the electromagnetic field carrying the signal exists only in the space between the inner and outer conductors it cannot interfere with or suffer interference from external electromagnetic fields

There are different types of coaxial cables which satisfy different standards

The Gulf Coast region of the United States comprises the coasts of states which border the Gulf of Mexico The states of Texas Louisiana Mississippi Alabama and Florida are known as the Gulf States All Gulf States are located in the Southern region of the United States

 The Florida Panhandle is the region of the state of Florida which includes the westernmost 16 counties in the state It is a narrow strip lying between Alabama and Georgia to the north and the Gulf of Mexico to the south Culturally and in terms of history and climate the region is more closely tied to the Deep South than to peninsular Florida

Part of the Gulf Stream the Loop Current is a warm ocean current in the Gulf of Mexico that flows northward between Cuba and the Yucatn Peninsula moves north into the Gulf of Mexico loops west and south before exiting to the east through the Florida Straits

Around 1970 it was believed that the Loop Current exhibited an annual cycle in which the Loop feature extended farther to the north during the summer Further study over the past few decades however has shown that the extension to the north does not have a significant annual cycle

The Loop Current and its eddies may be detected by measuring sea surface level Sea surface level of both the Eddies and the Loop on September 21 2005 was up to 60 cm higher than surrounding water indicating a deep area of warm water beneath them 

The National Weather Service bulletin for the New Orleans region of 1011 am August 28 2005 was a vividly worded release issued by the local Weather Forecast Office in Slidell Louisiana warning of the devastation that the Gulf Coast of the United States could experience as a result of Hurricane Katrina Partly due to this bulletin people in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi those most affected by the storms impact followed evacuation orders more closely resulting in a reduced fatality number

On the evening of August 25 2005 Hurricane Katrina made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane near the Miami Dade Broward county line in southern Florida and weakened into a tropical storm as a result The next morning after passing over the state Tropical Storm Katrina moved into the Gulf of Mexico strengthened back to hurricane strength and from the influence of the warm waters from the Loop Current began undergoing rapid deepening

At 1100 pm EDT August 26 approximately 56 hours before Katrinas landfall near Buras Louisiana the National Hurricane Center had predicted that the New Orleans metropolitan area could face a direct hit by the storm As New Orleans is located on the Mississippi River delta and much of the city is below sea level a strong hurricane could have a devastating effect on the city Previous warnings such as the one made by the Houston Chronicle in 2001 told of a disaster that would strand 250000 people or more and probably kill one of 10 left behind as the city drowned under 20 feet of water following a severe hurricane making landfall on the city The National Hurricane Centers director Max Mayfield mentioned that the MississippiLouisiana area has the greatest potential for nightmare scenarios and that this has been known for at least the three decades he has worked at the NHC Other publications such as Popular Mechanics Scientific American and The Times Picayune predicted doomsday situations in which a sinking city would drown and its residents would be left homeless

In 1965 Hurricane Betsy made landfall just south of New Orleans causing widespread flooding in the city As a result a system of levees was authorized by Congress to handle future storm events However the protection given by this system was limited to hurricanes up to Category 3 intensity on the Saffir Simpson Hurricane Scale

Three days before Katrinas second and third landfalls the National Hurricane Center began predicting that the storm would make landfall as a major hurricane By the next morning on August 27 the NHC gave out a hurricane watch that included the New Orleans metro area which was upgraded to a hurricane warning by 1000 pm CDT that same evening At this point Katrina was a Category 3 hurricane with 115 mph winds and about 335 miles to the south southeast of the Mississippi Rivers mouth

That night the storm underwent another period of rapid strengthening strengthening to a Category 5 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 175 mph by 1000 am CDT on August 28 At that time the Weather Forecasting Office in Slidell Louisiana issued an urgent weather message describing the destruction Katrina would likely cause in the region

At 1011 am CDT Robert Ricks a meteorologist with the New OrleansBaton Rouge NWS office issued the following statement

An equally explicit bulletin was repeated at 413 pm CDT

In the following months after the storm Congress appointed a two party system committee to look into the response to Hurricane Katrina and the preparations before to its landfall The committee concluded that the forecasts given by the National Weather Service were timely were not responsible for failures in other agencies and were likely responsible for saving thousands of lives

During an internal assessment by the National Weather Service the 1011 bulletin and its impact were examined The report called the bulletin a significant moment for the NWS during Katrina as its detailed and specific language did not have any previous precedent The strongly worded statement persuaded people to evacuate and was highlighted by national news media As a result the level of detail was highlighted as an innovative best practice in the NWS assessment which recommended issuing warnings with similar levels of detail in the future

Otters are animals that live near and around water They are a part of the animal family Mustelid A group of otters is called a romp because they play together and are energetic They live in nests called holts There are many different kinds of otters Some live near rivers some in the sea Otters live on every continent except for Australia and Antarctica

Otters are long and slim animals with four short legs that can be longer than a meter They usually stay on all four legs but they can stand up as well but they are expert swimmers and spend a lot of time in water They have a thick fur coat that keeps them warm even in freezing water Their fur is often brown at the top and lighter on the bottom of the Otter They eat meat and hunt for fish and small animals so they have sharp claws and teeth that allow them to catch prey then eat them They are great swimmers and divers they can stay underwater for 8 minutes Their thick and long tail helps them steer while swimming underwater Also their feet are webbed which helps them swim On they ground they can run very fast 

Otters live 8 to 9 years in the wild and as many as 21 years when living with people

Otters are carnivores they must eat a lot of meat to live so they spend three to 5 hours every day fishing and hunting They can die of hunger more quickly than most animals They eat fish crayfish crabs and frogs They will eat any small animals and birds they can catch Much of their food is found in water They dive in rivers lakes and streams until they can find a suitable animal to eat which they then chase Once they catch it they bring it to the top of the water where they eat it If the animal has a hard shell otters can use a rock as a tool to break open the shell

Otters are playful and energetic They can be seen sliding down hills and slopes as well as chasing other otters for fun Some kinds of otters live in groups while others are almost always alone Because they spent so much time in cold water they have to groom their fur often to stop themselves from freezing

Otters talk to other animals and otters with whistles growls chuckles and screams as well as chirps squeals and some kinds of otters might even purr They also leave their smell on plants so that other animals can know where an otters territory is

Asynchronous Transfer Mode is a set of protocols used for computer networks It is mostly used for Wide Area Networks It splits the data and encodes it into packets of a fixed size Each packet can be routed differently along virtual paths set up in the network 

ATM has been very successful in WANs as well as in Local Area Networks Today many ADSL implementations use ATM technology

Standards like Ethernet usually are quite simple When there is little traffic on the network they work well However when there is a lot of traffic it is difficult to predict how an Ethernet network will behave For this reason Ethernet cannot give any service guarantees It is not possible to say that an Ethernet packet will take a maximum delay but after that time it is guaranteed to arrive

ATM is more complex but this complexity allows to give guarantees as to data rate maximum delay and jitter These are usually called Quality of Service 

Blood type or blood group is a medical term It describes the type of blood a person has This blood type is based on whether or not there are substances on the outside of red blood cells that can cause an allergic reaction when it comes into contact with certain other blood cells These substances are called antigenic substances or also antigens 

When a blood transfusion or an organ donation takes place it is important to know what type of blood the donor and the receiver have so that the receivers blood does not have an allergic reaction to the donors blood This can be very dangerous for the receiver 

There are many different blood group systems Of these systems the ABO blood group system in combination with the Rhesus blood group system are the most important In this system the presence or absence of the A antigen the B antigen and the RhD antigen are determined

In a laboratory blood is tested for antigens When a certain antigen is found there are also always particular antibodies found These antibodies will attack any antigens that it does not recognise 

The blood is thus tagged as being A positive O negative for instance where the letter refers to the ABO blood group and positive or negative refers to whether or not the RhD antigen of the Rhesus blood group system was found

People with type O negative blood are often called universal donors because they can give blood to any other bloodgroup People with type AB positive blood are called universal recipients because they can receive blood from any other bloodgroup

Of course before a transfusion takes place the blood is also tested thoroughly for all sorts of other things that might cause problems for the receiver

Trance music is a kind of electronic music It centers around a bass drum on each beat and melodies with themes Most trance usually has 140 beats per minute Trance music is played in clubs The origin of the term trance is unclear The genre borrows elements from techno house and other kinds of electronic music

Acuminite is a colorless mineral made from crystals It is named for the Latin word acuminis for the way the crystals are made It is easily found in Greenland in the Ivigtut cryolite deposit It is easily scratched with a copper penny

Warthog are remarkable animals They are found in most of Africa south of the Sahara and are widely distributed in East Africa They are the only pigs able to live in areas without water for several months of the year By tolerating a higher than normal body temperature the warthog is perhaps able to conserve moisture inside its body that might otherwise be used for cooling

Warthogs are found in moist and arid savannas They avoid rainforest deserts and high mountains

Moraines are accumulations of debris that are found in regions where there are glaciers or were glaciers formerly

Moraines which are found far off from existing glaciers were created during a past ice age The debris may have been taken off the valley floor as a glacier moved or fallen off the valley walls as a result of weathering Moraines may be made of silt like glacial flour to large boulders Moraines may be on the glaciers surface or deposited as piles or sheets of debris where the glacier has melted Moraines may also develop when glacier or iceberg transported rocks fall into the sea as the ice melts

Silt is soil or rock that developed from granular material of a specific grain size 

Silt particles range between a Fraction1256 and Fraction116 mm larger than clay but smaller than a sand Silt is chemically distinct from clay and unlike clay grains of silt are approximately the same size in all dimensions 

Silt may occur as a soil or alternatively as suspended sediment in a water column of any surface water body It may also exist as deposition soil at the bottom of a water body and it can occur as a deposit or as material transported by a stream or by a current in the ocean Silt is easily transported in water and is fine enough to be carried long distances by air as dust Thick deposits of silty material that result from wind deposition are often called loess or limon Silt and clay contribute to broken wikt linkturbidityturbidity in water

Silt is a type of soil or earth material It may also refer to

A catalytic converter is a device fitted onto the tailpipe of a car to help reduce the amount of greenhouse gases it sends out into the air It also helps the efficiency of the car It works by using a catalyst  usually Rhodium The catalytic converter converts carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide Rhodium can also be found in the rear of a cow or on its recent produce Rhodium is toxic and is illegal in Mexico and Japan

Samuel Pepys was an English administrator at the Admiralty and Member of Parliament He is famous for his diary 

Pepys rose to be to be the Chief Secretary to the Admiralty under Charles II and later under James II Although Pepys had no maritime experience he rose by patronage hard work and his talent for administration 

The detailed private diary that he kept from 16601669 was first published in the nineteenth century It is one of the most important primary sources for the English Restoration period It provides a combination of personal notes and eyewitness accounts of great events such as the Great Plague of London the Second Dutch War and the Great Fire of London

Pepys was a key person in the fire of 1666 Seeing that the wind was driving the fire westward he ordered the boat to go to Whitehall and became the first person to inform the King of the fire The King told him to go to the Lord Mayor and tell him to start pulling houses down 

Pepys took a coach back to Old St Pauls Cathedral before setting off on foot through the burning city He found the Lord Mayor who said Lord what can I do I am spent people will not obey me I have been pulling down houses but the fire overtakes us faster than we can do it 

At noon Pepys went home and had an extraordinary good dinner and as merry as at this time we could be In the evening he and his wife watched the fire from the safety of Bankside Pepys writes that it made me weep to see it Returning home Pepys met his clerk Tom Hayter who had lost everything Hearing news that the fire was advancing Pepys started to pack up his possessions by moonlight

A cart arrived at 4am on 3 September and Pepys spent much of the day arranging the removal of his possessions Many of his valuables including his diary were sent to friend The next day Pepys continued to arrange the removal of his possessions By this point he believed that Seething Lane was in grave danger and suggested calling men from Deptford to help pull down houses and defend the kings property He described the chaos in the city and his curious attempt at saving his own goods

On Wednesday 5 September Pepys who had taken to sleeping on his office floor was woken by his wife at 2am She told him that the fire had almost reached All Hallows by the Tower and that it was at the foot of Seething Lane He decided to send her and his gold about 2350 to Woolwich In the following days Pepys witnessed looting disorder and disruption On 7 September he went to Pauls Wharf and saw the ruins of St Pauls Cathedral of his old school and of his fathers house Despite all this destruction Pepyss house office and diary had been saved

The complete and definitive edition of Pepyss diary by Robert Latham and William Matthews was published by Bell Hyman London in 19701983

Some of the older editions of the diary are available online

Albatrosses are large seabirds which belong to the biological family Diomedeidae They live in the region of the Southern Ocean and the North Pacific Ocean They are not found in the North Atlantic region but their fossils have been found there which shows that they used to live there There are four main species of albatross Great Albatrosses North Pacific Albatrosses Mollymawks and Sooty Albatrosses These are divided into twenty one species identified by the World Conservation Union

Great Albatrosses are among the largest of flying birds All albatrosses are very good at flying spending much of their life in the air They eat squid fish and krill Albatrosses come ashore to make their nests mostly on islands and usually near the nests of other birds

Nineteen of the twenty one species of albatross are endangered This is partly because animals such as rats and cats attack their eggs chicks and sometimes adult birds as well Pollution of the oceans such as plastic waste and oils spills also kills albatrosses Sometimes there may be not enough fish to eat because of over fishing The main reason why albatross are endangered is longline fishing which causes many albatross to get caught on hooks that have been baited to catch fish This causes the birds to drown

Albatrosses are very large The bill is large strong and sharp This bill is made of horny plates Along the sides are the two tubes They are actually long nostrils The tubes of all albatrosses are on the sides of the bill They help the albatrosses develop their sense of smell a lot The feet have no last toe and the three other toes are all webbed Their legs are quite strong and they can walk well on land unlike other sea birds

Albatrosses need to take salt out of their body because they drink ocean water All birds have a large gland at the top part of their bill above their eyes This gland is sometimes useless to birds that do not need it However albatrosses use them to help take out saltwater Scientists are not sure how it works exactly However they know that it helps take out the salt It makes a liquid that makes the saltwater drip out of their nose

The adult albatrosses usually have a dark upper wing and back and white undersides when they are getting ready to take flight Albatrosses take several years to get their full adult feathers

The wings of the largest albatrosses can be up to convert340cmftabbron

Albatrosses flying north from their family sometimes fly in a clockwise direction and those flying south will fly the opposite The most energy used up in their journey is not when they travel a long way but when they land take off and hunt This helps the albatross fly more longer distances and find good food They can fly easily over wind and waves However because their long wings does not have strong muscles or energy they cannot flap while they fly Because of this albatrosses in calm seas must stop and rest on the surface of the ocean until the wind begins to blow harder When taking off albatrosses need to run first to help the wing make lift Albatrosses are known for their clumsyness when landing

Most albatrosses are found in the southern hemisphere from Antarctica to Australia South Africa and South America However the four North Pacific albatrosses live elsewhere Three of them are in the North Pacific from Hawaii to Japan California and Alaska The last one the Waved Albatross is in the Galapagos Islands and finds food in the coast of South America

It is not known clearly why the albatrosses became extinct in the North Atlantic Some think that it was because the sea level rose at that time Some kind of albatrosses that live in the south have usually been trapped in the North Atlantic and are forced to stay there for a long time

Sometimes scientists may use the satellite when trying to learn about albatrosses They try to find out about the way albatrosses go across the ocean to find food with the satellites There is proof that the sea separates different kinds of species of the Albatross There is also proof of different pathways for the two sexes of the same kind of species A study of Tristan Albatrosses living on the Gough Island showed that males look for food on the west and the females go around the east

The albatross eats cephalopods fish crustaceans and offal Sometimes they may also eat carrion and or other kinds of zooplankton However the importance of each food is different according to each species Some may like to eat only squids or others might eat more krill or fish From the two albatross species that live in Hawaii one of them the Black footed Albatross eats mostly fish The other one the Laysan Albatross eats more squids instead

Sometimes albatrosses may use the help of other animals to eat For example some squids are too big to be caught alive by the albatross Instead albatrosses eat squids that die after mating or after they have been vomited by squid eating whales Other species like the Black browed Albatross or the Grey headed Albatross eats smaller species of squid that sink after they die and they do not scavenge a lot Also sometimes the Waved Albatross has been seen stealing food from other birds

Until now it was thought that the albatrosses ate and found their food at the surface of the sea such as dead squid and fish pushed to the surface by the waves other animals that had eaten them or death This was thought because some species do not dive deeper than a metre However this theory was not true because some species have a mean diving depth of almost 5 m and can dive as deep as 125 m They have now been seen to eat from the surface and diving and sometimes also plunge from the air to snatch their prey

Albatrosses live together and they usually nest on islands where no people live Many Bullers Albatrosses and Black footed Albatrosses nest under trees in open forest Albatrosses usually come back to their own group after leaving for a while to find a mate This is one of their strongest instinct and the study of Laysan Albatross showed that the normal distance between the place where it was hatched and the place where the bird made its own territory was 22m

Like most seabirds albatrosses live much longer than other birds They also do not look for their mate for a long time and do not have a lot of young Some kinds of albatrosses live up to 50 years The oldest albatross recorded was the Northern Royal Albatross that lived for 61 years 

Before albatrosses mate they group together and spend lots of years practicing the mating rules and special dances that the family is famous for

When the albatrosses learn these kind of actions and dances they also learn things such as pointing calling making noises with their bill staring and sometimes all of them put together When a bird first comes it will dance with many other albatrosses but after a few years the number of birds it will dance with will lessen until one of the birds are chosen After becoming a pair they will never use that dance again

Albatrosses have a hard time laying their children It takes a lot of time for an albatross to lay an egg and raise a chick The great albatrosses take over a year to raise a chick Albatrosses lay one egg white with reddish brown spots But if the egg is taken by other predators or accidentally broken the parents will not lay another egg for that whole year The larger eggs weigh from 200510 g Two albatrosses do not usually divorce This sometimes may happen if several years passed without being able to lay a single egg

All the albatrosses in the south live in large nests They make it with grass soil and sometimes penguin feathers The Waved Albatross however does not make a nest but instead moves its egg around the pairs territory as much as 50 m This may sometimes make it lose the egg In all albatross species both parents incubate the egg from between one day and three weeks Incubation lasts around 70 to 80 days This time may become more longer for the larger albatrosses When they do this it takes a lot of energy and the adult can lose as much as 83 g of body weight a day

After hatching the chick is taken care of and guarded for three weeks until it is large enough to take care of and fight for itself During this time the parents feed the chick small meals After the chick has grown a little older it is fed in bigger meals by both parents The parents both take turns to go and find food that are about 12 of their body weight They find food such as fresh squid fish and krill

Albatross chicks take a long time to fledge In the case of more bigger albatrosses it can take up to 280 days And even for the smaller albatrosses it can take from 140 to 170 days Like many seabirds albatross chicks later become even heavier than their mother and father When they are preparing their body for flying they may also grow flight feathers which makes them sometimes as heavy as their parents Between 15 and 65 of those who fledged survive to find their mate after Albatross chicks learn to fly on their own Their parents do not teach them and instead they return to the nest even after their chick has left

The name albatross came from the Arabic word al cdous or al as This means a pelican or can mean the diver This word later became English also mixed with the Portuguese word alcatraz which means gannet This is also where the name of the prison Alcatraz comes from The OED explains that the word alcatraz was at first supposed to be used for the frigatebird But perhaps the change of the word to albatross was because of the Latin word albus This means white which is opposite to the frigatebirds which are black In Portuguese the word still presently used for the bird albatroz came from the English albatross

They were once known as Goonie birds or Gooney birds especially the albatrosses in the North Pacific In the southern hemisphere most people still call the albatross mollymawk which came from the word malle mugge an old Dutch The name Diomedea given to the albatrosses by Linnaeus is from the story about the Greek warrior Diomedes becoming a bird

Albatrosses have been described as the most legendary of all birds When people have a sad occasion or a burden they may use the expression to have an albatross around their neck Also there is a myth that sailors do not shoot or eat albatrosses because they think it is bad But in truth this is just a myth because sailors regularly killed and ate them However they were often thought of as the souls of lost sailors The Maori people used the bones in the wings of the albatross to carve tattoos into their skin at ceremonies

Even though they are legendary birds of many myths albatrosses are still attacked by humans In the beginning Polynesians and Aleut Indians hunted albatrosses As Europeans began to explore the world they too began to hunt albatross They fished for them from boats and ate them or killed them for sport

On the Midway Atoll there were many airplane crashes because of the Laysan Albatrosses They crashed together while flying very often casing lots of people and birds to die Tall towers killed 3000 birds in between the years 1964 1965 Because of this the towers had to be taken down Recently people have tried to stop human activity on the island and this helped lessen the number of birds dying

Another threat to albatrosses are introduced species like rats or feral cats which attack the albatross or its chicks and eggs Albatrosses have lived on islands where there are not much land mammals and they are not adapted to defend themselves against them Even animals such as mice can be dangerous for the albatrosses For example on Gough Island the chicks of Tristan Albatrosses are attacked and eaten alive by house mice

Sometimes albatrosses and also many kinds of seabirds are killed because they ate plastic The amount of plastic eaten in the seas have increased very quickly since the first record in the 1960s This is because of the waste thrown out by ships and trash dumped into the ocean Sometimes the litter on beaches can also be washed into the sea by rivers It is impossible to digest plastic and the undigested plastic stops other food from being digested This makes the bird starve and die This plastic is sometimes vomited out and fed to the chicks from the parents Although plastic is not the most main reason why albatrosses die it still makes the chick very sick and is a serious problem

Scientists and people who try to help albatrosses are working with governments and fishermen to stop these threats They come up with solutions such as fishing at night dying the bait in a blue color to hide it from the albatrosses setting the bait under the water and more For example a study made by some scientists and fishermen in New Zealand was to make the fishing people put the lines below the reach of some certain kinds of albatross species The use of some of these ideas are also successful by stopping the number of many Black browed Albatross that died in the last 10 years Conservationists have also worked on taking away the introduced species to protect the albatrosses

One important step towards protecting albatrosses and other seabirds is the 2001 treaty by the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels which eight countries Australia Ecuador New Zealand Spain South Africa France Peru and the United Kingdom agreed with The treaty asks these countries to do certain things to help the albatrosses The treaty has also been signed by another three countries Argentina Brazil and Chile

Proxima Centauri is a red dwarf star that is likely a part of the Alpha Centauri star system and is the closest star to the Sun at a distance of 422 light years It is in the constellation of Centaurus

Proxima Centauri was found to share the same proper motion as Alpha Centauri in 1915 by Robert Innes while he was Director of the Union Observatory in Johannesburg South Africa

In 1951 Harlow Shapley said that Proxima Centauri was a flare star Past photographic records showed that the star displayed a measurable increase in magnitude about 8 of the time making it the most active flare star then found

Red dwarfs are usually far too faint to be seen with the naked eye It has an apparent magnitude of 11 while its absolute magnitude is a very dim 155 Even from Alpha Centauri A or B Proxima would only be seen as a 5th magnitude star

Proxima Centauri has been the closest star to the Sun for about the last 32000 years Barnards Star will make its closest approach to the Sun around AD 11700 when it approaches to within about 38 light years However at that time it will not be the nearest star since Proxima Centauri will then have moved even closer to the Sun

The Matterhorn or Cervino is perhaps the most familiar mountain in the European Alps On the border between Switzerland and Italy it towers over the Swiss village of Zermatt and the Italian village Breuil Cervinia in the Val Tournanche The name of the mountain comes from the German words Matte meaning valley or meadow and Horn which means peak

Jura is a department in the east of France It is named after the Jura mountains 

Historically Jura belonged to the Free County of Burgundy known in French as the Free County Dole was the capital until the region was conquered by Louis XIV and it was moved to Besanon It is now a sous prfecture of Jura 

As early as the 13th century inhabitants of the southern 23 of Jura spoke a dialect of Arpitan language It continued to be spoken in rural areas into the 20th century

Jura is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on March 4 1790 It was created from part of the former province of Free County The departments of Jura Doubs and Haute Sane form the modern Free County region of France The prefecture is Lons le Saunier

Jura is one of four departments of the Free County region The French departments of Doubs Haute Sane Cte dOr Sane et Loire and Ain are next to it The Swiss canton of Vaud is to the east

The Jura mountains are wooded and rolling not craggy and rocky like the Alps

Many lakes can be found throughout the Jura The largest natural lake is called Lac De Chalain It is 3km long and 1km wide Lac de Vouglans was formed after the building of a hydro electric dam It is one of the largest man made lakes in France

The climate of the Jura varies greatly by elevation The lower valleys are temperate and pleasant but the high mountain valleys have bitterly cold winters

Jura is a wine growing region The Jura wines are very distinctive and unusual wines such as vin jaune which is made by a similar process to sherry It develops under a flor of yeast This is made from the local Savagnin grape variety Other grape varieties include Poulsard Trousseau and Chardonnay

Fray is an eight issue comic book series It is a spin off of the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer The series is written by Buffy creator Joss Whedon Fray tells the story of a Slayer named Melaka Fray She is the chosen one in a time where vampires are common and the difference between rich and poor people is even greater 

The series was published by Dark Horse Comics beginning in 2001 In a short video promoting the charity Equality Now Joss Whedon said that Fray is not done Fray is coming back More than that I will not say This was repeated in 2007s Comic Con where Joss said that he would absolutely would be returning to that world 

The series was closely linked to the seventh season of Buffy It includes the Slayers mystical scythe and her origins Melaka Fray also appears in the story Tales in the comic book Tales of the Slayers 

Frays scythe was used in the last three episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer Buffy Summers also a vampire Slayer found the scythe stuck in rock in Sunnydale The scythe was later used to create fully developed Slayers of the many Potential Slayers It has never been stated as to how the scythe travelled from Sunnydale California to New York City through the centuries or who had it during that time

In Fray it is also explained that sometime in the twenty first century a Slayer possibly with some mystical allies faced an apocalyptic army of demons And when it was done they were gone All demons all magicks banished from this earthly dimension The Slayer whose fate is unknown was the last to be called

Discussing her connection to the Slayer line Urkonn tells Melaka In your dreams youre someone else A slave A princess A girl in school in a sunlit city The scar Fray has and her personality are similar to Buffy in the alternate universe created in season 3 episode The Wish 

Erik Satie was a French composer He is mainly remembered today for the strange ways he behaved He often gave his music unusual titles such as Piece in the form of a pear His best known musical compositions are the three piano pieces which he called Gymnopdies The first of these pieces is a very famous piece of music it is a simple tune over a gentle accompaniment Satie sometimes used unusual instruments such as sirens and typewriters

Satie was more than just an unusual man He was very important in the development of music in France in the late 19th and early 20th century He was important because of the ideas he had and many people were influenced by him Satie used ways of composing such as very chromatic music and Minimalism before many other people These ways of writing music became more common later in the century Satie was not a brilliant composer but he was happy to compose well in a simple way He was also interested in other arts such as literature and painting and he was associated with the new ideas called esprit nouveau which was fashionable in France around the time of World War I

He was born Alfred Eric Leslie Satie but as a grown up he always spelt his name Erik His father had been in the shipping business but the family then moved to Paris He was still quite young when his mother died and he was sent back to his birthplace Honfleur to be brought up by his fathers parents However his grandmother drowned so he was sent back to Paris again where his father taught him His father had married again His new wife was a pianist and sent young Eric to have piano lessons at the Paris Conservatoire

Satie hated his piano lessons His teacher said that he was the laziest pupil in the Conservatoire He was bad at sight reading but he continued with his lessons because this would make it possible for him to do just one year of military service instead of five In fact he did less than a year in the army because he deliberately got himself ill with bronchitis While he was getting better he started to compose His father published a few songs he had written However he did not get on well with his family and he left home in 1887

Satie soon got to know many people in the famous cabaret Chat Noir He grew his hair long and wore a frock coat and a top hat He wrote a ballet which most people found shocking He became friends with Debussy who was one of the only people who understood the serious reasons for Saties unusual behaviour

In 1890 he moved to new rooms on a top floor of a house so that people to whom he owed money could not get at him He tried to compose in a simple style and became interested in mystical religion and Gothic art He inherited a small amount of money with which he bought himself seven velvet suits which were all exactly the same one for each day of the week He started a church called glise Mtropolitaine dArt de Jsus Conducteur but nobody belonged to the church except himself

At the end of 1898 he moved to Arceuil a suburb of Paris He spent the rest of his life there He stopped performing in public and earned money by playing the piano in cafs and pubs Every morning he walked the 10 kilometres into Paris stopping on the way at cafs to drink or compose He wore a bowler hat wing collar and always carried a rolled up umbrella If it was raining he kept his umbrella underneath his coat to keep it dry He also carried a hammer in case anyone attacked him Late at night he walked home again or took the last train back His flat was a terrible mess

In 1905 at the age of 39 he became a student again and studied music at the Schola Cantorum He wanted to become a better composer He learned how to write fugues He still liked to use parody in his music

In 1911 Maurice Ravel played some of Saties piano pieces in public Suddenly people began to take notice of Satie They realized that he had been one of the first Impressionist composers Debussy conducted his Gymnopdies in his arrangement for orchestra Music critics started to write articles about Satie He was at last becoming famous He had some humorous piano pieces published He was earning some money from his compositions so he was able to give up playing in cabarets He met Jean Cocteau who introduced him to Diaghilev for whom he wrote the music for Parade Some people loved it some hated it but people were taking notice of him He was asked to write more theatre music He was a very important influence on the six composers who were known as Les Six He was asked to write a symphonic drama which he called Socrate Many musicians think it is his best piece

In the 1920s he wrote many articles for newspapers and journals and became associated with the art movement known as Dada His ballets Relche and Mercure both shocked the audiences when they were first performed Relche is an early example of what later became the theatre of alienation

Satie drank a lot of alcohol and became ill He got cirrhosis of the liver and died in 1926 When his friends entered his flat after he died there was so much mess that they had to throw away two cartloads of rubbish before they could get at his papers and manuscripts

Satie was involved with dance theatre and cabaret for most of his life and that is what much of his music is written for He was always trying out new ideas in his music He was capable of writing in a late Romantic style with chromatic harmonies but he also wrote in more modern styles often using very simple ideas He was always more interested in beautiful melodies than in writing complicated rhythms His three Gymnopdies are still extremely popular They seem to come from an old fashioned world where there is great simplicity His three Gnossiennes sound more Oriental and Satie wrote some very strange remarks in the music His piano piece Vexations is a short piece with strange chromatic chords which the pianist is then supposed to play 840 times Uspud was an early example of what later became the Theatre of the Absurd The text was all written in lower case letters the first time this had ever been done He wrote many cabaret songs

Later after he had studied at the Schola Cantorum he became famous and then wrote lots of piano pieces with funny titles and strange comments Parade has strange instruments such as typewriters Socrate was his most serious work

After his death all the people he had insulted wrote about Satie that he was a bad composer As a result he was almost forgotten until the 1960s when John Cage became interested in his music and made it popular again Many Surrealist artists were often inspired by Saties music and ideas

Arachniodes is a genus of fern in family Dryopteridaceae It has the following species

The Dryopteridaceae is a family of ferns that can be found almost anywhere on the world

Many are cultivated as ornamental plants

In some schemes gravel is anything larger than sand and includes granule pebble cobble and boulder in the above table In this scheme pebble covers the size range 4 to 64 mm

Rock flour or glacial flour consists of clay sized particles of rock generated by glacial erosion or by artificial grinding to a similar size Because the material is very small it is suspended in river water making the water appear cloudy If the river flows into a glacial lake the lake may appear turquoise in color as a result Examples of this are Lake Louise Canada and Gjende lake in Norway

Some agronomists believe that rock flour has a powerful effect in restoring trace minerals to soil An early experimeter was the German miller Julius Hensel author of Bread from Stones who reported successful results with steinmehl in the 1890s His ideas were not taken up through technical limitations and according to proponents of his method opposition from the champions of conventional fertilisers

The Virginia Opossum sometimes called a possum is a marsupial There are lots of marsupials in Australia but the Virginia Opossum is the only North American marsupial

A folded mountain is created when two tectonic plates come together This causes them to rise out of the earth These mountains are formed by compression The process of mountain building is called orogeny 

Fold mountains make up some of the highest mountains in the world Folded mountains commonly form along borders where two continents are colliding They tend to look like an accordion Some really complex folds are in parts of the Alps Himalayas Rockies Appalachians and Russias Ural Mountains These long mountain chains also show extensive signs of folding

Fold mountains are created by uplift and folding of tectonic plates as they move towards each other and collide This is known as a compressional plate margin An example is the Andes Mountain range in South America 

The plates may be either continental and continental or continental and oceanic The plates move towards each other but there is not a free space for them to move into because they are already touching each other With two massive plates of rock pushing against each other and continually moving all that rock has to go somewhere 

The 2 plates push against each other and are continually moving At a destructive plate margin where oceanic and continental plates collide the oceanic plate is subducted pulled under the continental plate  whilst the continental plate is crumpled upwards to form a mountain range The Andes are an example of fold mountains formed at a destructive plate margin 

When two continental plates move towards each other both plates are forced upwards in a series of folds This caused big problems for early geologists who struggled to explain why they were finding fossils of sea creatures high up in mountains such as the Himalayas We now know that the fossils got there due to uplift of sedimentary rocks along the edges of the plates 

You can simulate this process using two flat strips of modeling clay or old carpet Put them side by side and push them together One or both will crumple up and form a mini mountain range on your table top 

Folded mountains are created when tectonic plates are pushed together slowly and continueously with pressure and heat

Radlin is a town in Wodzisaw County Silesian Voivodeship Poland with about 17673 people

The term particle size is used to compare dimensions of different small material objects 

Larger objects are usually called stone rock a piece of something etc The term particle indicates small size usually less than centimeter Particle might be either solid or liquid or even gas Liquid particles are called droplets Gaseous particles are bubbles All of them can be characterised in terms of size  

But a typical material object is likely to be irregular in shape This causes ambiguity in definition of particle size Existing definitions are based on replacent of a given particle with imaginary sphere that has one of the properties identical with the particle

Hurricane Camille was the third named storm and second hurricane of the 1969 Atlantic hurricane season Camille was the second of three Category 5 hurricanes to make landfall in the United States during the 20th century which it did near the mouth of the Mississippi River on the night of August 17 resulting in catastrophic damage Camille was the only Atlantic hurricane with official winds reported to reach 190 mph until Allen equalled that number in 1980

The storm formed on August 14 and rapidly deepened It scraped the western edge of Cuba at Category 3 strength Camille strengthened further over the Gulf of Mexico and made landfall with a pressure of 905 mbar estimated sustained winds of 190 mph and a peak storm surge of 24 feet by maximum sustained wind speeds Camille was the strongest landfalling tropical cyclone recorded worldwide and one of only four tropical cyclones worldwide ever to achieve wind speeds of 190 mph The hurricane flattened nearly everything along the coast of the US state of Mississippi and caused additional flooding and deaths inland while crossing the Appalachian Mountains of Virginia In total Camille killed 259 people and caused 142 billion in damages

The Labor Day Hurricane of 1935 was the strongest tropical cyclone during the 1935 Atlantic hurricane season The second tropical cyclone second hurricane and second intense hurricane of the season was the most intense Atlantic hurricane that affected the United States and it remains the first of three Category 5 hurricanes that struck the country After forming as a weak tropical storm east of the Bahamas on August 29 it slowly proceeded westward became a hurricane on September 1 and underwent rapid intensification prior to striking the upper Florida Keys on September 2 After landfall at its peak intensity it continued northwest along the Florida west coast and it weakened prior to landfall near Cedar Key on September 4

The large and strong hurricane caused severe damage in the upper Florida Keys and a storm surge about 18 to 20 feet affected the region The hurricanes strong winds destroyed most of the buildings in the Islamorada area and many World War I veteran workers were killed by the storm surge Portions of the Key West Extension of the Florida East Coast Railroad were severely damaged or destroyed The hurricane also caused additional damage in northwest Florida Georgia and the Carolinas In total more than 400 people were killed

The ICRC has a special job based on the Geneva Conventions as well as other international law to protect the victims of international and internal armed conflicts This includes people hurt in war prisoners refugees civilians and other non combatants But the ICRC is a private organisation It is not controlled by any government group of governments or international organisation

It is the oldest organisation within the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and one of the most widely recognized organizations in the world It is also the most honoured The ICRC has won three Nobel Peace Prizes in 1917 1944 and 1963

Up until the middle of the 19th century there was no organized army nursing for casualties and no way safe place to house and treat the injured soldiers

Swiss businessman Henry Dunant saw the Battle of Solferino in the Austro Sardinian War The battle only lasted one day but about 40000 soldiers on both sides were killed or were left severely hurt on the battlefield 

Dunant was shocked by the suffering of the wounded soldiers and the lack of medical help He cancelled his trip to see Emperor Napoleon III and spent several days helping to treat and care for the wounded

He wrote a book about what he saw called A Memory of Solferino he published it with his own money in 1862 and sent copies of the book to leading political and military figures throughout Europe The book did not only describe what Dunant saw but called for the setting up of national voluntary relief organisations to help nurse wounded soldiers in the case of war Dunant also called for international treaties to guarantee the neutrality and protection for the wounded and for medics and field hospitals

The Geneva Society for Public Welfare set up a committee to try to organise an international conference about Dunants idea The Committee of the Five met on 9 February 1863 the members were

The committee soon changed its name to the International Committee for Relief to the Wounded 

In October 1863 the international conference it organised took place in Geneva to talk about improving medical services on the battle field 

31 people joined the committee at the conference eighteen official delegates from national governments six delegates from other non governmental organisations and seven non official foreign delegates The official delegates came from

The conference wanted

Only one year later the Swiss government invited the governments of all European countries as well as the United States Brazil and Mexico to attend an official diplomatic conference Sixteen countries sent a total of twenty six delegates to Geneva On 22 August 1864 the conference adopted the first Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded in Armies in the Field Representatives of 12 states and kingdoms signed the convention Baden Belgium Denmark France Hesse Italy the Netherlands Portugal Prussia Switzerland Spain and Wrttemberg The convention contained ten articles establishing for the first time legally binding rules guaranteeing neutrality and protection for wounded soldiers field medical personnel and specific humanitarian institutions in an armed conflict 

Also the convention had two requirements before a national relief society would be recognised by the International Committee

The first national societies were founded in Belgium Denmark France Oldenburg Prussia Spain and Wrttemberg Also in 1864 Louis Appia and Charles van de Velde a captain of the Dutch Army became the first independent and neutral delegates to work under the symbol of the Red Cross in an armed conflict Three years later in 1867 the first International Conference of National Aid Societies for the Nursing of the War Wounded was convened

Dunant left the committee in 1867 after arguing with other members In 1876 the committee changed its name to theInternational Committee of the Red Cross which is still its official name today Five years later the American Red Cross was founded through the efforts of Clara Barton More and more countries signed the Geneva Convention and began to respect it in practice during armed conflicts The Red Cross quickly became an internationally respected movement and the national societies became increasingly popular as a venue for volunteer work 

When the first Nobel Peace Prize was awarded in 1901 the Norwegian Nobel Committee opted to give it to Henry Dunant and Frdric Passy a leading campaigner against war The International Committee of the Red Cross officially congratulated Dunant and was a tribute to his key role in the formation of the Red Cross Dunant died nine years later in the small Swiss health resort of Heiden Only two months earlier his former friend and committee member Gustave Moynier had also died

By the start of the First World War in 1914 there were 45 national relief societies throughout the world The movement had grown beyond Europe and North America to Central and South America Asia and Africa The Geneva Convention had been changed to include fighting at sea as well as on land

In World War I Red Cross nurses came from around the world including the United States and Japan came to help the medical services of the armed forces of the countries involved in the war in Europe 

On 15 October 1914 immediately after the start of the war the ICRC set up its International Prisoners of War Agency By the end of the war the Agency had sent about 20 million letters and messages 19 million parcels and about 18 million Swiss francs to POWs of all affected countries The Agency also arranged for about 200000 prisoners to be released and returned to their home country The Agency collected about 7 million records from 1914 to 1923 about prisoners or missing people The card index helped to identify about 2 million POWs and to contact their families The complete index of 7 million cards is on loan from the ICRC to the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Museum in Geneva But only ICRC can search the index

The ICRC got the only Nobel Peace Prize of the war years in 1917 for its outstanding wartime work 

In 1923 the Committee changed its membership rules Until then only citizens of the city of Geneva could serve in the Committee This was changed to include all citizens of Switzerland by birth This is still the rule today and is designed to show that the ICRC is neutral and that committee members and workers have never been citizens of a country that might be involved in a war Only in 1993 were non Swiss born people allowed to work for the committee

In 1934 the ICRC tried to get extra protection for civilians during war Unfortunately most governments were not interested in adopting the extra rules before the start of World War II

The Geneva Conventions as amended in 1929 governed what the ICRC did revision The activities of the Committee were similar to those during World War I 

By the end of the war 179 delegates had conducted 12750 visits to POW camps in 41 countries The Central Information Agency on Prisoners of War had a staff of 3000 the card index tracking prisoners contained 45 million cards and 120 million messages were exchanged by the Agency 

The German Red Cross was controlled by the Nazis and would not uphold the Geneva conventions which may have helped stop the deportation of Jews from Germany and the mass murders conducted in the concentration camps run by the German government 

Two other main countries in the war the Soviet Union and Japan were not party to the 1929 Geneva Conventions and were not legally required to follow the rules of the conventions Thus other countries were not bound to follow the Conventions regarding their prisoners in return

The ICRC had to stop complaining about the treatment of detainees in concentration camps in case the ICRC was stopped from working for POWs 

After November 1943 the ICRC could send parcels to concentration camp detainees with known names and locations Because the notices of receipt for these parcels were often signed by other inmates the ICRC managed to register the identities of about 105000 detainees in the concentration camps and delivered about 11 million parcels mostly to the camps Dachau Buchenwald Ravensbrck and Sachsenhausen



On 12 March 1945 ICRC president Jacob Burckhardt was told by SS General Ernst Kaltenbrunner that the ICRCs delegates could visit the concentration camps but the delegates would have to stay in the camps until the end of the war Ten delegates among them Louis Haefliger Paul Dunant and Victor Maurer visited the camps

Louis Haefliger told American troops about the forceful eviction or blasting of Mauthausen Gusen and saved the lives of about 60000 inmates His actions were condemned by the ICRC because they were deemed as acting unduly on his own authority and risking the ICRCs neutrality Only in 1990 his reputation was finally rehabilitated by ICRC president Cornelio Sommaruga 

Another example of great humanitarian spirit was Friedrich Born an ICRC delegate in Budapest who saved the lives of about 11000 to 15000 Jewish people in Hungary Marcel Junod a doctor from Geneva was another famous delegate during the Second World War He was one of the first foreigners to visit Hiroshima after the atomic bomb was dropped and wrote his thoughts in his book Warrior without Weapons

In 1944 the ICRC got its third Nobel Peace Prize 

On 12 August 1949 the existing two Geneva Conventions were changed and the Hague Convention about casualties at sea was brought into the Geneva Convention family It was renamed the Second Geneva Covention and so the second convention of 1929 is now called the third convention The Fourth Geneva Convention about the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War was established On 8 June 1977 extra article protocols were added to make the conventions apply to internal conflicts such as civil wars 

In 1963 the ICRC shared its third Nobel Peace Prize with the League of Red Cross Societies

Since 1993 non Swiss citizens have been allowed to serve as Committee delegates abroad a task which was previously restricted to Swiss citizens Now about one third of staff are not Swiss citizens

On 16 October 1990 the UN General Assembly gave the ICRC observer status for its assembly sessions and sub committee meetings the first observer status given to a private organization The resolution was jointly proposed by 138 member states and introduced by the Italian ambassador Vieri Traxler in memory of the organizations origins in the Battle of Solferino 

An agreement with the Swiss government signed on 19 March 1993 affirmed the already long standing policy of full independence of the Committee from any interference by Switzerland The agreement protects the full sanctity of all ICRC property in Switzerland including its headquarters and archive grants members and staff legal immunity exempts the ICRC from all taxes and fees guarantees the protected and duty free transfer of goods services and money provides the ICRC with secure communication privileges at the same level as foreign embassies and simplifies Committee travel in and out of Switzerland

The ICRC continued its activities throughout the 1990s It broke its usual silence when it denounced the Rwandan Genocide in 1994 and again in 1995 about the crimes that happened in and around Srebrenica when it said We must acknowledge that despite our efforts to help thousands of civilians forcibly expelled from the town and despite the dedication of our colleagues on the spot the ICRCs impact on the unfolding of the tragedy was extremely limited It went public once again in 2007 to decry major human rights abuses by Burmas military government including forced labor starvation and murder of men women and children 

At the end of the Cold War the ICRCs work actually became more dangerous In the 1990s more delegates lost their lives than at any point in its history especially when working in local and internal armed conflicts These incidents often demonstrated a lack of respect for the rules of the Geneva Conventions and their protection symbols Among the slain delegates were

The original motto of the International Committee of the Red Cross was Inter Arma Caritas It has preserved this motto while other Red Cross organizations have adopted others Because Geneva is in the French speaking part of Switzerland the ICRC is also known under its French name Comit international de la Croix Rouge However the ICRC has six official languages including Arabic The official symbol of the ICRC is the Red Cross on white backgroundwith the words COMITE INTERNATIONAL GENEVE circling the cross

The ICRC drew up seven fundamental principles in 1965 that were adopted by the entire Red Cross Movement They are 

The 2005 budget of the ICRC was about 970 million Swiss francs All payments to the ICRC are voluntary and are received as donations based on two types of appeals issued by the Committee an annual Headquarters Appeal to cover its internal costs and Emergency Appeals for its individual missions 

Most of the ICRCs funding comes from Switzerland and the United States with the other European states and the EU close behind Together with Australia Canada Japan and New Zealand they contribute about 80 85 of the ICRCs budget About 3 comes from private gifts and the rest comes from national Red Cross societies

The ICRC is responsible for legally recognizing a relief society as an official national Red Cross or Red Crescent society and thus accepting it into the Movement The exact rules are in the statutes of the Movement After recognition by the ICRC a national society is admitted as a member to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent societies The ICRC and the Federation cooperate with the individual national societies in their international missions especially with human material and financial resources and organizing on site logistics According to the 1997 Seville Agreement the ICRC is the lead Red Cross agency in conflicts while other organizations within the Movement take the lead in non war situations National societies will be given the lead especially when a conflict is happening within their own country

The ICRC headquarters are in Geneva Switzerland It has other offices called Delegations in about 80 countries Each delegation is under the responsibility of a Head of delegation who is the official representative of the ICRC in the country Of its 2000 professional employees roughly 800 work in its Geneva headquarters and 1200 expatriates work in the field About half of the field workers serve as delegates managing ICRC operations in the different countries while the other half are specialists like doctors agronomists engineers or interpreters The international staff are assisted by some 13000 national employees so about 15000 people work for the ICRC 

The Directorate is the executive body of the CommitteeIt carries out the policies set by the assembly

The Directorate consists of a Director General and five directors in the areas of Operations Human Resources Resources and Operational Support Communication and International Law and Cooperation within the Movement The members of the Directorate are appointed by the Assembly to serve for four years The Director General has assumed more personal responsibility in recent years much like a CEO where he was formerly more of a first among equals at the Directorate

The Assembly convenes on a regular basis and is responsible for defining aims guidelines and strategies and for supervising the financial matters of the Committee The Assembly has a membership of a maximum of 25 Swiss citizens Members must speak the house language of French but many also speak English and German as well These Assembly members are co opted for a period of four years and there is no limit to the number of terms an individual member can serve A three quarters majority vote from all members is required for re election after the third term which acts as a motivation for members to remain active and productive

In the early years every Committee member was Genevan Protestant white and male The first woman Rene Marguerite Cramer was co opted in 1918 Since then several women have attained the Vice Presidency and the female proportion after the Cold War has been about 15 The first non Genevans were admitted in 1923 and one Jew has served in the Assembly

While the rest of the Red Cross Movement many be multi national the Committee believes that its mono national nature is an asset because the nationality in question is Swiss Thanks to permanent Swiss neutrality conflicting parties can be sure that no one from the enemy will be setting policy in Geneva The Franco Prussian War of 1870 71 showed that even National Red Cross Societies can be biased and not maintain neutral humanitarianism

Furthermore the Assembly elects a five member Assembly Council that constitutes an especially active core of the Assembly The Council meets at least ten times per year and has the authority to decide on behalf of the full Assembly in some matters The Council is also responsible for organizing the Assembly meetings and for helping communication between the Assembly and the Directorate The Assembly Council normally includes the president two vice presidents and two elected members While one of the vice presidents is elected for a four year term the other is appointed permanently with his tenure ending by retirement from the vice presidency or from the Committee Currently Jacques Forster and Olivier Vodoz are vice presidents In April 2007 Christine Beerli was appointed to succeed Jacques Forster from the beginning of 2008

The Assembly also selects for a term of four years one individual to act as President of the ICRC The president is both a member of the Assembly and leader of the ICRC and he has always been included on the Council since its formation The President automatically becomes a member of the assembly and the ICRC once he is appointed but he does not necessarily come from within the ICRC organization There is a strong faction within the Assembly that wants to reach outside the organization to select a president from the Swiss government or professional circles like the banking or medical fields In fact the last three presidents were previously officials in the Swiss government The presidents influence and role is not well defined and changes depending upon the times and each presidents personal style Since 2000 the president of the ICRC has been Jakob Kellenberger Kellenberger does not make many public appearances or statements but is good at personal negotiation promoting the ICRC privately In February 2007 he was appointed by the Assembly to another four year term which will run until the end of 2011

The presidents of the ICRC have been

The Hydrometeorological Prediction Center is one of nine Service Centers that are part of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction which is part of the National Weather Service which in turn is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the US government

The HPC serves as a center of excellence in Quantitative Precipitation Forecasting Medium Range Forecasting and the interpretation of numerical weather prediction models

The HPC issues storm summaries on storm systems bringing significant rainfall and snowfall to portions of the United States Advisories are also issued for tropical cyclones which have moved inland and are no longer the responsibility of the National Hurricane Center The HPC also acts as the backup office to the National Hurricane Center in the event of a complete communications failure

The HPC was created in October 1995 when the former National Meteorological Center was reorganised into the NCEP It is based at the World Weather Building in Camp Springs Maryland along with a few of the other National Centers such as the Climate Prediction Center the Ocean Prediction Center and the Environmental Modeling Center

Circadian rhythm sleep disorders occur when the circadian rhythm is disrupted or is not functioning properly They usually affect other bodily functions as well and not just sleep

Cause The delayed sleep phase type of circadian rhythm sleep disorder is marked by a delay of the sleep wake cycle as it relates to the demands of society It is often due to a psychosocial stressor especially for adolescents The delayed sleep wake cycle leads to chronic sleep deprivation and habitually late sleeping hours Individuals with this type often have difficulty changing their sleeping patterns to an earlier and more socially acceptable time Their actual sleep once it begins is normal It is the timing of their sleeping and waking that is persistently delayed 

Extrinsic means something which comes from outside rather than from within a system or an organism There are two circadian rhythm sleep disorders of the extrinsic type

Jet Lag often affects people who have travelled several hours east or west through several time zones It may take many days for the body to adjust to the new environment The name comes from travelling by jet aircraft

Many people have problems with their sleep appetite alertness etc when they work a shift during the times when their circadian rhythms indicate that they should be asleep

Intrinsic refers to something which happens or is caused within a system or an organism There are four circadian rhythm sleep disorders of the intrinsic type Unless they are caused by a head injury or by a disease they are usually genetic that is people are born with them They are generally chronic they do not go away but they may to some degree be treated

Advanced sleep phase syndrome is very rare People with this syndrome are sleepy very early in the evening and they sleep from about 1900 2000 in the evening to about 0300 0400 in the early morning Their sleep is usually normal There are often several people in the same family who have ASPS

Delayed sleep phase syndrome is the opposite of ASPS and it is more common affecting about 015 of adults It usually starts in early childhood or at puberty Some cases which start at puberty go away when the person is about 20 years old Otherwise the syndrome does not go away that is it is chronic

People with DSPS cannot go to sleep before 0300 0600 in the morning or even later They sleep normally for 8 9 hours but they cannot wake up in time for school or a job which starts in the morning They can go to sleep at the same time every night and get up at the same time each day This means that they are entrained to the daily lightdark cycle Even when they try to sleep at acceptable times they are most alert in the late evening and the nighttime hours

Non 24 hour sleep wake syndrome is quite rare Some people who can see have it but it is more common among the blind People with Non 24 sleep well for 8 9 hours but they do not adjust to the daily lightdark cycle at all Therefore they go to sleep 1 2 hours later each day and wake up 1 2 hours later than the day before This is called freerunning sleep Their times of best alertness appetite body temperature rhythm and hormone cycles all move continuously around the clock coming back to the same time after a few weeks

Irregular sleep wake disorder is quite rare and it is often possible to find out what causes it for example a head injury a mental handicap dementia or some other sicknesses People with this disorder sleep and wake several times a day but not at the same times every day Altogether they sleep the same number of hours as other people of the same age

Treatment for these disorders is similar and it often does not work very well In addition it can be difficult to find a doctor who knows much about circadian rhythms as the field of study is quite new

Treatment with bright light is also called phototherapy or light therapy People with ASPS need a lot of light in the evening and they should avoid bright light in the morning People with DSPS need bright light as soon as they wake up and should try to avoid bright light in the evening

Melatonin is a hormone produced in the pineal gland in the brain It is normally only produced in the evening and at night People with ASPS can take melatonin by mouth in the morning People with DSPS can take melatonin in the afternoon or evening and this treatment works also for some people with Non 24 

One can buy melatonin in the shops in the USA and Canada In most other countries one must get it from a doctor or it might not be legal at all 

Similar treatments can be tried for the other disorders

Proteus was found from the images taken by Voyager 2 probe during the Neptune flyby in 1989 It got the designation S1989 N 1 Stephen P Synnott and Bradford A Smith said its discovery on July 7 1989 speaking only of 17 frames taken over 21 days which gives a discovery date of sometime before June 16 The name was given on 16 September 1991

Proteus is more than 400 kilometres in diameter bigger than Nereid another moon of Neptune However it was not found by Earth based telescopes because it is so close to the planet that it is lost in the glare of reflected sunlight

Proteus is one of the darkest objects in the solar system Like Saturns moon Phoebe it reflects only 6 percent of the sunlight that hits it Proteus is very cratered showing no sign of any geological changes It is also not a sphere scientists believe Proteus is about as big as a body of its density can be without being pulled into a spherical shape by its own gravity Saturns moon Mimas has much more spherical shape despite being less massive than Proteus

Nereid was found on 1 May 1949 by Gerard P Kuiper who suggested the name in the report of his discovery It is named after the Nereids sea nymphs of Greek mythology 

It was the farthest of Neptunes known moons for a long time and is the third biggest with a diameter of 340 km Its orbit averages 5513400 km in radius but is very eccentric and varies from 1353600 to 9623700 kilometres For a long time this was the most highly eccentric orbit of any known moon in the solar system but it has found that Bestla a recently discovered moon of Saturn has a more eccentric orbit The unusual orbit suggests that it may be a captured asteroid or Kuiper belt object or possibly that it was perturbed during the capture of Neptunes largest moon Triton Very little else is known of Nereid

Nereid was too far to be properly imaged by the Voyager 2 probe when it visited the Neptune system in 1989 Photos sent back show only its very non spherical shape and no surface features could be seen at the resolution available

The Dresden University of Technology is a university in Dresden in Germany It is the largest university in the state of Saxony and one of the ten largest universities in Germany with around 35000 students 

Dresden University is one of the oldest colleges of technology in Germany In 1828 the Saxon Technical School was founded to teach workers in technological subjects such as mechanics and ship construction In 1871 the institute was renamed the Royal Saxon Polytechnic and other subjects such as history and languages were introduced By the end of the 19th century the institute had grown into a university covering all subjects It was given its current name in 1961

The Dresden University of Technology is organised into 14 departments Almost all departments are on the main campus south of the city centre except for the Faculty of Medicine which has its own campus near the Elbe River east of the city centre and the Department of Forestry in a town nearby called Tharandt

The universitys annual budget is around 400 million

The TU Dresden offers a wide range of courses and research It has a high reputation in technical fields such as electrical engineering or computer science 

The university also has a strong research tradition in microelectronics and transport sciences in the Dresden area and now is becoming more important in new fields of research such as biotechnology

TU Dresden is a campus university meaning most of its buildings are in one area rather than being spread out across the city Some of its buildings are more than a hundred years old In recent years these historic building have been complemented by modern buildings  

About 60 of the students come from Saxony 19 from other eastern German states 12 from the western German states and 10 from other countries

In 20052006 there were 3442 international students enrolled at TU Dresden Most of the foreign students come from Europe followed by Asia and America Ranked by countries the largest group of students comes from China followed by Poland Vietnam Bulgaria and Russia The university is also quite popular among Central and East European countries such as the neighbouring Czech Republic which is only convert40kmmi1abbronlkon away or Ukraine 

Because of the Erasmus programme and partnerships with universities in the United States there are many English French and Spanish speaking students But the language spoken during lessons is nearly always German To prepare for the university many international students attend German language courses at the university 

Sports are very popular among the TUD students There are eight big students clubs and the summer campus party is among the biggest in Germany There are cafeterias as at most universities and the largest refectory can compete with some restaurants even as far as menu size

Tropical Storm Jerry was the tenth named storm of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season It was a very short lived storm over the north central Atlantic Ocean The storm lasted less than 48 hours half of that time as a subtropical cyclone It was never a threat to land

The system that would later become Tropical Storm Jerry started as a non tropical low pressure area over the central Atlantic Ocean on September 21 The system moved in a shaky path over the north central Atlantic over the next two days It slowly developed deeper convection and became more organized On September 22 the system had become organized enough that the National Hurricane Center mentioned a possible tropical or subtropical development in the area Late that evening it had been determined that a subtropical depression had formed as a warm core had developed but the system was still involved with an upper level low and had its strongest winds well removed from the center Early on September 23 both satellite estimates and QuikScat data determined that the depression had strengthened into Subtropical Storm Jerry despite the lack of a well defined inner core The storm slowly acquired tropical characteristics including a better defined warm core and became fully tropical that evening as a weak and sheared tropical storm with 40 mph winds over a small radius

Jerry began to weaken once again early on September 24 as it accelerated northeastward over cooler waters with sea surface temperatures below 24C It remained a tropical storm until later that morningThen it weakened to a tropical depression ahead of a powerful cold front with little deep convection remaining in the system Jerry remained a tropical depression as the cold front approached and began to absorb the system that afternoon as it continued to accelerate northeastward That evening a QuikScat pass determined that Jerry had opened up into a trough which was being absorbed into the larger frontal system It completely dissipated by early on September 25

Jerry never came near land during its lifespan and no damage or deaths were reported No ships were impacted by Jerry

Tropical Storm Ingrid was a weak tropical storm that existed from September 12 September 17 2007 It was the ninth named storm of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season The storm developed as Tropical Depression Eight Tropical Depression Nine appeared at the same time as Eight but was much quicker to develop Tropical Depression Nine strengthened into Humbertothe next name on the listbefore Eight became a named storm Tropical Storm Ingrid was a weak storm It only lasted for a short amount of time The storm got weaker in the Atlantic because of high wind shear Ingrid died out before reaching land areas There was rain in Saint Martin and Antigua because of the storm

The system formed from a big tropical wave that moved off the coast of west Africa on September 6 Because of strong wind shear it did not get stronger over the next three days On September 9 it developed an area of low pressure in the central Atlantic between the coast of Africa and the Lesser Antilles Slowly the wind shear began to go away Dvorak classifications were started on the weather system on September 11 By the morning of September 12 it had developed into Tropical Depression Eight This took place about convert1125mikm0lkonabbron east of the Lesser Antilles The same tropical wave eventually created another area of weather activity that became Tropical Depression Ten with the help of other weather systems

The system moved towards the west northwest for almost all of its life It stayed on the southern edge of a meteorological ridge Wind shear slowed down development greatly The system stayed a tropical depression for 24 hours before convection increased The storm became a weak tropical storm early on September 13 The storm kept getting stronger that afternoon It reached its highest strength of 45 mph that evening

The storm did not get stronger because of a very strong wind shear from a strong tropical upper tropospheric trough Despite the high shear Ingrid remained a weak tropical storm until the afternoon of September 15 It then weakened to a tropical depression while east of the Leeward Islands Ingrid kept getting weaker as it passed to the northeast of the islands The system stayed a tropical depression because it continued to create strong thunderstorms Ingrid became more organized for a short time on September 16 This event was short lived The storm became very disorganized once again that afternoon It kept getting weaker The final National Hurricane Center advisory was given out early on September 17 as the system weakened into a tropical wave while remaining north of the Leeward Islands The remnant low turned to the northwest within the low level steering flow It died out on September 18 without any reforming

Ingrid stayed just to the east and northeast of the Lesser Antilles It weakened without impacting any land Its remnants produced rain and thunder to Antigua On Saint Martin the system produced convert15inmm1lkonabbron of rain in about an hour This caused some roads to become flooded No damage or deaths were caused by the storm No ships reported tropical storm force winds

Because there was no damage from Tropical Storm Ingrid the name Ingrid was not removed from the tropical cyclone names list and will be used again during for the 2013 Atlantic hurricane season This was the first time that the name Ingrid was used for a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic Ocean However the name has been used in other parts of the world

A Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough is a trough in upper level tropics Its formation is usually caused by the expansion of the Trough of Westerlies Wind to the tropics It can also develop from the inverted trough adjacent to a upper level anticyclone TUTTs are different from mid latitude troughs in the sense that they are maintained by subsidence warming near the tropopause which balances radiation cooling

TUTTs sometimes brings a large amount of vertical wind shear over tropical disturbances and cyclones and thus hinder their development On the contrary there are cases that TUTTs assist the genesis and intensification of tropical cyclones by providing additional forced ascent near the storm center and an efficient outflow channel in the upper troposphere Moreover under specific circumstances TUTTs can grow into upper cold lows and may enhance the development of low level disturbances

Tropical Storm Melissa was the thirteenth named storm of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season It was a short lived storm that formed southwest of the Cape Verde islands remaining weak because of high wind shear It dissipated without affecting any land areas It was only notable for being the eighth named storm of September 2007 which tied the record for the month of September

The system began as a tropical wave that moved off the west coast of Africa on September 26 An area of low pressure formed on September 27 near Cape Verde in association with the wave and convection slowly increased as a result of the low Early on September 28 a rapid increase in convection and a well organized outflow pattern allowed the low to develop into Tropical Depression Fourteen while about 115 miles west southwest of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands Since the depression was far removed from the subtropical ridge and an upper level low pressure area was sitting to the north steering currents were weak at first and the depression moved very slowly on a general west northwest track Vertical wind shear from the west also slowed down development Small amounts of strengthening took place early on September 29 as convection increased in the system and the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Melissa

Like previous storms Ingrid and Karen high wind shear in the deep tropics delayed Melissas development Operationally Melissa was briefly upgraded to 45 mph late on September 29 as some satellite estimates showed a slightly stronger storm with deeper convection but Melissa was found to have been weaker in the post storm analysis remaining at 40 mph By early on September 30 wind shear began to severely increase and a weakening trend began That morning the increased shear combined with cooler sea surface temperatures weakened Melissa to a tropical depression with a poorly defined surface center as it continued to move west northwest at a somewhat faster speed The system lost its deep convection and by the afternoon of September 30 Melissa degenerated into a remnant low as thunderstorm activity decreased After the circulation dissipated the remnant low continued its general west northwest track south of a rebuilding subtropical ridge in the central Atlantic The low produced discontinuous amounts convection until it was absorbed by a frontal zone late on October 5 northeast of the Leeward Islands

Melissa remained away from land during its lifespan never threatening any land areas There were no ship reports of tropical storm force winds as a result of Melissa No damage or deaths were reported

When Tropical Depression Fourteen was upgraded to Tropical Storm Melissa on September 29 it was the eighth named storm to form in the month of September That tied a record for the month of September which was first set in the 2002 season

ImageNWSweatherfrontssvgthumbright300pxA guide to the symbols for weather fronts that may be found on a weather map

 A weather front is a boundary in between two masses of air of different densities and is the main cause of significant weather In surface weather analyses fronts are depicted using various colored lines and symbols The air masses separated by a front usually differ in temperature and humidity

Cold fronts may feature narrow bands of thunderstorms and severe weather and may on occasion be preceded by squall lines or dry lines Warm fronts are usually preceded by stratiform precipitation and fog The weather usually quickly clears after a front passes Some fronts produce no precipitation and little cloudiness although there is usually a wind shift

The subtropical ridge is a large belt of high pressure around 30N in the Northern Hemisphere and 30S in the Southern Hemisphere It is characterized by mostly calm winds Air flows out from its center toward the upper and lower latitudes of each hemisphere creating both the trade winds and the westerlies

Metis was found in 1979 by Stephen P Synnott in images taken by the Voyager 1 probe Its designation was S1979 J 3 In 1983 it was named after the mythological Metis a Titaness who was the first wife of Zeus

Metis not a sphere and measures 604034 km across The composition and mass of Metis are not known but assuming that its mean density is like that of Amalthea its mass can be estimated as 71016 kg Amaltheas density implies that moon is composed of water ice with a porosity of 10 15 and Adrastea may be similar

The surface of Metis is very cratered It is dark and appears to be reddish in color

Metis is the closest moon to Jupiter It orbits Jupiter at a distance of 1269000 km Its orbit has very small eccentricity and inclination relative to the equator of Jupiter

The images taken by Voyager 1 showed Metis only as a dot and very little was known about Metis until the arrival of the Galileo spacecraft Galileo took pictures of almost all of the surface of Metis and put constraints on its composition

In 1983 the US Postal Service began using an expanded ZIP code system called ZIP 4 often called plus four codes or add on codes 

A ZIP 4 code uses the basic five digit code plus an additional four digits to identify a geographic area inside the five digit delivery area such as a group of apartments or a location which gets a large amount of mail

In dermatology an abrasion is a damage to the skin that affects only the surface generally not deeper than the epidermis But it can give mild bleeding Mild abrasions also known as grazes do not scar but deep abrasions may lead to the development of scarring tissue

Abrasion injuries occur rather often when exposed skin comes into moving contact with a rough surface causing trauma to the upper layers of the epidermis

Such injuries where caused by abrasive contact with textiles or carpet are sometimes referred to as rug burn or carpet burn 

Abrasion may mean

In materials science wear is the erosion of material from a solid surface by the action of another solid The study of the processes of wear is part of the discipline of tribology There are four principal wear processes

The definition of wear does not include loss of dimension from plastic deformation although wear can happen without loss of material Also this definition does not include impact wear where there is no sliding motion or cavitation where counterbody is a fluid 

Wear along with other aging processes such as fatigue creep and fracture toughness causes progressive degradation of materials with time leading to failure of material at an advanced age Under normal circumstances the property changes during usage normally occur in three different stages as follows Primary or early stage or run in period where rate of changes can be high Secondary or mid age process where a steady rate of aging process is                           maintained The useful or working life is at this stage Tertiary or old age stage where rapid rate of aging leads to early failure

With increasing severity of environmental conditions such as higher temperatures strain rates stress and sliding velocities the secondary stage is shortened and the primary stage tends to merge with the tertiary stage thus drastically reducing the working life Surface engineering processes are used to minimize wear and extend working life of material

Adhesive wear is also known as scoring galling or seizing It happens when two solid surfaces slide over one another under pressure 

This happens when material is removed by contact with hard particles The particles either may be present at the surface of a second material or may exist as loose particles between two surfaces Abrasive wear can be measured as loss of mass by the Taber Abrasion Test according to ISO 9352 or ASTM D 1044

Often referred to simply as corrosion corrosive wear is deterioration of useful properties in a material due to reactions with its environment

Surface fatigue is a process by which the surface of a material is weakened by cyclic loading which is one type of general material fatigue

Compacted oxide layer glaze describes the often shiny wear protective layer of oxide formed when two metals are slid against each other at high temperature in an oxygen containing atmosphere The layer forms on either or both the surfaces in contact and can protect against wear

A not often used definition of glaze is the highly sintered compacted oxide layer formed due to the sliding of either two metallic surfaces at very high temperatures in oxidizing conditions  

Wear can mean

A Child of the Streets Children who have no home but the streets and no family support They move from place to place living in shelters and abandoned buildings

A Child on the street Children who visit their families regularly and might even return every night to sleep at home but spends most days and some nights on the street because of poverty overcrowding child sexual abuse or physical abuse at home

Part of a Street Family These children live on sidewalks or city squares with the rest of their families They may be displaced due to poverty wars or natural disasters The families often live a nomadic life carrying their possessions with them Children in this case often work on the streets with other members of their families

In Institutionalized Care Children in this situation come from a situation of homelessness and are at risk of returning to a life on the street or facing at the child labour or child prostitution

The city is first written about in 1246 It grew up around the Frauenfeld castle on the land of the Reichenau convent

In 1264 it became the property of the Habsburgs In 1374 the Habsburgs bestowed the right of judgment for all of Thurgau on the Duke of Frauenfeld

Twice in the 1700s Frauenfeld was partly destroyed by fire in 1771 and in 1788

Benito Jernimo Feijoo y Montenegro was a Galician neoclassical monk and scholar noted for encouraging scientific thought in Galicia and Spain

He was born in Casdemiro and joined the Benedictines at the age of 12 and had taken classes in Galicia Len and Salamanca He later taught theology and philosophy at the university of Oviedo and died at Oviedo Padre Feijoo studied in Salamanca Spain at the University of Oviedo earning a professorship in theology Feijoo was a prominent essayist for the Spanish and his critiques letters and plays helped change the steadfast beliefs of many during the 18th century

His two famous multi volume collection of essays Teatro critico universal and Cartas eruditas y curiosas cover a range of subjects from education law and medicine to superstitions and popular beliefs He is also of interest as a writer in the Galician language

Father Feijoo was a debunker of myths He had great interest in natural science and many of his essays touch on topics related to this subject and to the many myths about creatures and lands that abounded at that time One example of how far his naturalistic bent went can be found in a story told by Julio A Feijoo one of his descendents born in Cuba in 1910 Father Feijoo believed that demonic possession was a psychological phenomenon Once he was called upon to perform an exorcism and in order to demonstrate that this phenomenon was more due to suggestibility than anything else in performing a spurious exorcism on the possessed subject he read from Bocaccios famous bawdy work the Decameron Upon hearing the Latin lines the possessed individual settled down and declared himself to be free of demonic influencefactdateFebruary 2007

It is the second largest city of the canton after Frauenfeld with a population of over 18000

In 1874 the municipality of Egelshofen was renamed Kreuzlingen It reached the present size with the adding of Kurzrickenbach in 1927 and Emmishofen in 1928

It is located on Lake Constance

It is halfway between Schaffhausen and Rorschach

The name of the municipality stems from the Augustinian monastery Crucelin which was later renamed Kreuzlingen Abbey It was built in 1125 by the Bishop of Constance Ulrich I In the Swabian War and the 30 Years War after the siege of Constance by Swedish troops Kreuzlingen Abbey was burned down by the people of Constance The crime was blamed on the monks for having supported the enemy In 1650 the monastery was rebuilt in its present location Because of secularization in 1848 the buildings became a school The chapel became a Catholic church

People already lived in the Kreuzlingen area during the Bronze Age Celtic and Roman coins and artifacts show that people continued to be settled in the area pre writing Kurzrickenbach is first mentioned as Rihinbah in 830 Egelshofen is mentioned as Eigolteshoven in 1125 and Emmishofen is mentioned as Eminshoven in 1159 The territory of the municipality except for the Augustinian monastery belonged to the Bishop of Constance 

Until the beginning of the 19th century the current centre of Kreuzlingen was still largely agricultural The first steamboats began to operate on Lake Constance in 1824 The first train line to Romanshorn was finished in 1871 and the second to Etzwilen in 1875 This brought commerce and industry to the area In 1874 Kreuzlingen became the capital of the district instead of the previous capital Gottlieben However until World War I Kreuzlingen was a kind of suburb of Constance Most of its profits went to German firms The war made Kreuzlingen more independent

wThe Sanatorium of Bellevue which occupied part of the old monastery played an important role in the history of Kreuzlingen In 1842 a man called Ignaz Vanotti from Constance bought a large area of land and constructed a building to house the emigrant press of Bellevue in 1843 which had been located in Rmerburg before In 1857 Ludwig Binswanger a psychiatrist from Mnsterlingen bought the property and opened a private sanatorium The clinic was very modern and stayed in the control of the Binswanger family for nearly 120 years Important psychiatric discoveries particularly under the founders grandsons control especially in the development of existential psychotherapy were made at the sanatorium However few of its buildings remain

Earlier most of the people in Kreuzlingen made a living in the wine industry However because of diseases and bad harvests the last wine grapes were raised in Kreuzlingen in 1938

Today the local economy is mostly shopping and handcraft with the largest employer being a clothing maker

In December 2004 it had about 9500 inhabitants Since it lies in the middle of the canton part of the cantonal government is located in the town as is the Thurgau cantonal bank The grand council of the canton meets in Weinfelden during the winter 

Already in the year 124 AD there was a Roman bridge over the Thur at Weinfelden The name Weinfelden is first documented in 838

Weinfelden was by far the biggest town in the canton of Thurgau In 1798 Paul Reinhart and his committee led the area to freedom from the domination of the Eidgenossen In 1803 Thurgau became an independent canton through the mediation of Napoleon with Frauenfeld as capital

In 1830 Thomas Bornhauser spoke to a large crowd in Weinfelden demanding a liberal constitution for the canton It is one of the first such document

Portraits of both Paul Reinhart and Thomas Bornhauser hang in the Rathaus

A bruise also called a contusion or an ecchymosis is a visible bluish or purplish mark or patch appearing beneath the surface of your skin resulting because blood leaked out of the deeper layers of the tissues Bruises are usually caused by a blow or pressure but in aged people bruises may occur without a special reason

Bruises often cause pain but are not normally dangerous Sometimes bruises can be serious and lead to other more life threatening forms of hematoma or can be associated with serious injuries as fractures and internal bleeding Minor bruises may be easily recognized in people with light skin color by their characteristic blue or purple appearance in the days following the injury

Bruises change color over time That is because the body is fixing the bruise by breaking down and reabsorbing the blood which makes the bruise to go through many colors before it later disappears You can easily find out the age of a bruise just by looking at its color

After that in about 2 weeks the bruise will fade away Some people bruise easily whereas others may not This is because they may have more tough skin tissue certain diseases or conditions or may be taking a certain medication

Also blood vessels tend to become fragile as people get older which is why elderly people may receive a bruise much more easily

Applying cold when you first get a bruise helps make it more small because it stops the blood thats flowing to the area It also keeps the swelling down It is best to apply cold to the bruise for half an hour to an hour at a time for a day or two after you get a bruise However it is not good to place ice right on the skin Put some icecubes in a plastic bag and wrap a towel around it or else the bruise may get worse

Another way to help heal your bruise is to put the bruised area above the level of your heart This helps to slow the flow of the blood because more of the blood in your bruise will flow back toward the rest of your body instead of leaking out into the tissues If you keep standing more blood will flow to your bruise and the bruise will grow faster

Leopoldo Alas y Urea also known as Clarn was a Spanish realist writer born in Zamora He died in Oviedo

Clarin spent his childhood living in Len and Guadalajara until he moved to Oviedo in 1865 There he studied Bachillerato and he started his law career He lived in Madrid from 1871 to 1878 where he started his career as a journalist and he graduated with the thesis El Derecho y la Moralidad He taught in Zaragoza from 1882 to 1883 In 1883 he returned to Oviedo to take up a position as teacher of Roman law 

He wrote books including La Regenta It is a long work similar to Flauberts Madame Bovary one of the books that helped to inspire it Other influences included Naturalism and Kraussism a philosophical trend which made cultural and moral change in Spain He also wrote Nuevo viaje al Parnaso and La Literatura en 1881 working with Armando Palacio Valdes

La Regenta is special for its great number of characters and other stories around the main story of the novel The main character is shown in a way that is not very clear On the other hand the downfall of the provincial lady has place amidst two very different men who want to marry her the most handsome man in the city who is the winner in the end and the cathedrals priest The way the priest is shown is a very important part of the book

For the description of the provincial setting and the citys collective life Clarn used styles such as the internal monologue or the free indirect style which makes the story be told by the characters not the narrator

In 1890 he published a new novel Su nico hijo Most critics do not think it is as good as La Regenta Su nico hijo was originally meant to be the first of a series of three books but these were not written The only parts of them that exist are an outline and a few fragments of two of the novels Su nico hijo was Clarns last long book

Clarn also wrote some stories and some journalistic articles

Clarin remains a rather unknown figure in the Spanish literary world He searched for God and was Humanist at the same time This strange mix has led to there being different views on the meaning of his writings La Regenta in particular has many different views on what it could mean

Anthe is a very small moon of Saturn between the orbits of Mimas and Enceladus It is also known as Saturn XLIX and its designation was S2007 S 4 It is named after one of the Alkyonides the name means flowery

It was found by the Cassini Imaging Team in images taken on May 30 2007 Once the find was made a search of older Cassini images showed this small moon in observations from as far back as June 2004 It was first announced on July 18 2007

Kiviuq is a non spherical moon of Saturn It was found by Brett J Gladman in 2000 and given the designation S2000 S 5

It was named in 2003 after a giant of Inuit mythology Kiviuq is a legendary and heroic Inuk a sort of Inuit Odysseus He has lived very long has wandered and journeyed living all sorts of adventures whose details depend on the story tellers local tradition

Kiviuq is about 16 kilometres in diameter and orbits Saturn at an average distance of 111 million kilometers in 450 days It is a member of the Inuit group of non spherical moons

Kiviuq displays light red colours and the infrared spectrum very similar to Siarnaq and Paaliaq further supporting the thesis of a possible common origin of the Inuit group in the break up of a bigger body

Manchukuo was a Japanese puppet state in Manchuria and eastern Inner Mongolia ruled by the former Emperor of China Henry Pu yi It was created by Japan in 1932 because Japan wanted to occupy Manchurias rich natural resources but did not wish to declare war on China yet Most nations in the world did not recognize Manchukuo as a country Manchukuo made its own money and it was called the Manchukuo yuan

Ijiraq is a non spherical moon of Saturn It was found by the team of Brett Gladman John J Kavelaars et al in 2000 and given the designation S2000 S 6

While Ijiraq is a member of the Inuit group non spherical moons recent observations revealed that Ijiraq is redder than Paaliaq Siarnaq and Kiviuq

Kavelaars an astronomer at McMaster University suggested this name to help astronomical nomenclature to get out of its Greco Romano Renaissance rut He spent several months trying to find names that were both multi cultural and Canadian consulting Amerindian scholars without finding a name that seemed good In March 2001 he was reading an Inuit story to his children and had a revelation The ijiraq plays at hide and seek which is what these small moons of Saturn do they are hard to find and cold like the Canadian Arctic Kavelaars contacted the author of the tale Michael Kusugak to get his assent and the latter also suggested the names for Kiviuq and 90377 Sedna

Denial of the Armenian Genocide is the assertion that the events within the Ottoman Empire following April 24 1915 and the Tehcir Law of May 1915 were not part of a state organized genocide directed against the empires Armenian inhabitants and that the Armenian Genocide did not occur For example the Republic of Turkey does not accept that the Ottoman authorities attempted to eliminate the Armenian people

In 1990 psychologist Robert Jay Lifton received a letter from the Turkish Ambassador to the United States questioning his inclusion of references to the Armenian Genocide in one of his books The ambassador inadvertently included a draft of the letter presented by scholar Heath Lowry advising the ambassador on how to prevent mention of the Armenian Genocide in scholarly works Lowry was later named to a chair at Princeton University which had been endowed with a 750000 grant from the Republic of Turkey The incident was the subject of numerous reports as to ethics in scholarship

Open University of Israel scholar Yair Auron has addressed the various means employed by the Turkish government to obscure the reality of the Armenian Genocide

University of California Los Angeles scholar Leo Kuper in a review on Ervin Staubs The Roots of Evil The Origins of Genocide and Other Group Violence research writes

Some countries including Argentinacitation needed Switzerland and Uruguaycitation needed have adopted laws that punish genocide denial In October 2006 France passed a bill which if approved by the Senate and president will make Armenian Genocide denial a crime

The first person convicted by a court of law for denying the Armenian genocide is Turkish politician Dou Perinek found guilty by a Swiss district court in Lausanne in March 2007 Perinek appealed the verdict Ferai Tin a foreign affairs columnist with Turkeys Hurriyet newspaper added we find these type of penal articles against freedom of opinion dangerous because we are struggling in our country to achieve freedom of thought After the courts decision Perinek said I defend my right to freedom of expression

The Ankara Chamber of Commerce included DVDs accusing the Armenian people of slaughtering Turks with their paid tourism advertisements in the June 6 2005 edition of the magazine TIME Europe Time Europe later apologized for allowing the inclusion of the DVDs and published a critical letter signed by five French organizations The February 12 2007 edition of Time Europe included an acknowledgment of the truth of the Armenian Genocide and a DVD of a documentary by French director Laurence Jourdan about the genocide 

Paaliaq is a non spherical moon of Saturn It was found by Brett J Gladman John J Kavelaars Jean Marc Petit Hans Scholl Matthew J Holman Brian G Marsden Philip D Nicholson and Joseph A Burns in early October 2000 and given the designation S2000 S 2 It was named in August 2003 after a fictional shaman in the book The Curse of the Shaman written by Michael Kusugak who supplied Kavelaars with the names of giants from Inuit mythology that were used for other Saturnian moons 

Paaliaq is thought to be about 22 kilometres in diameter and orbits Saturn at an average distance of 15200000 km in 687 days It is a member of the Inuit group of non spherical moons

Tropical Depression Ten was the tenth tropical cyclone of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season The depression formed on August 13 from a tropical wave that entered the Atlantic Ocean on August 8 Because of strong wind shear the depression stayed weak and did not strengthen much The cyclone itself had no effect on land and did not cause any damage It mostly died out on August 14 but its remains later helped to form another storm Hurricane Katrina Katrina became one of the worst hurricanes in the history of the United States

The tropical depression began as a tropical wave that entered the Atlantic Ocean on August 8 2005 The wave moved west It began to show signs of becoming stronger on August 11 The system formed into Tropical Depression Ten at 1200 UTC on August 13 At the time it was about convert1600mi to the east of Barbados When the storm was first called a tropical depression it had a large area of thunderstorms with curved rainbands

The depression slowly moved west and wind shear stopped the storm from becoming much stronger Late on August 13 a weather forecaster said that it was beginning to look like Irene junior They said this because it was mid level shear happening in the storm towards the southwest beneath the otherwise favorable upper level outflow pattern This means that the storm looked similar to Hurricane Irene

Early on August 14 the wind shear tore apart the storm The center of the storm separated from the thunderstorm areas Later that day the cyclone became even weaker The National Hurricane Center gave their final warning on Tropical Depression Ten and the storm mostly disappeared However its remains produced a few bursts of thunderstorm activity for several days before completely stopping on August 18

Energy left over from Tropical Depression Ten helped to form Tropical Depression Twelve over the southeastern Bahamas on August 23 Normally if a depression disappears and forms again it keeps the same number However the formation of Tropical Depression Twelve involved other weather systems including another tropical wave Tropical Depression Twelve later became Hurricane Katrina

Tropical Depression Ten did not hit land Because of this no tropical cyclone watches and warnings were given out It did not damage anything or cause any peoples deaths and no ships reported strong winds Also the depression never became a tropical storm so it was not given a name by the National Hurricane Center 

After the depression mostly died part of its remains contributed to the formation of Tropical Depression Twelve which later intensified into Hurricane Katrina Katrina later became a Category 5 hurricane and made landfall in Louisiana where it caused catastrophic damage It was one of the worst hurricanes in the history of the United States

Utahraptor was a large mid Cretaceous dromaeosaurid predator with 9 15 inch middle toe claws 

It was a fast moving agile bipedal bird like dinosaur It had a curved flexible neck and a big head Sharp serrated teeth were set into very powerful jaws Each of its three fingers on each arm had large sharp curved claw

It had four toed feet the second toe had a 9 15 inch sickle like claw and the other toes had smaller claws Its long tail had bony rods running along the spine giving it rigidity the tail was used for balance and fast turning ability 

It had a relatively large brain and large keen eyes Utahraptor was 16 23 feet long and may have weighed about 1 ton

Albertosaurus was a relative of Tyrannosaurus Albertosaurus was smaller than T rex and lived a few million years earlier Albertosaurus walked on two legs and had a large head with sharp saw toothed teeth It had two fingered hands on short arms Its long tail provided balance and quick turning It had powerful back legs with clawed three toed feet

It was about 30 feet long about 11 feet tall at the hips and up to 3 tons in weight The lower jaw of Albertosaurus had from 14 and 16 teeth the upper jaw had 17 19 teeth It had one row of teeth in each jaw but had at least one replacement tooth growing up from under each tooth

Albertosaurus was more lightly built than Tyrannosaurus and therefore probably a faster mover in open spaces

West Berlin was the name of the western part of Berlin between 1949 and 1990 It was the American British and French occupied sectors that were created in 1945

In many ways it was integrated with West Germany but it was not a part of West Germany or East Germany The Soviet sector became East Berlin which East Germany claimed as its capital The Western Allies never recognised this claim They said that the whole city was still under four power occupation The building of the Berlin Wall in 1961 sealed the border between East Berlin and West Berlin

West Berlin was called Berlin by the West Germany government and usually Westberlin by the East German government The east German spelling suggested that West Berlin was not really part of Berlin as a whole but a separate place East Berlin was officially called Berlin Hauptstadt der DDR or simply Berlin by East Germany

The Potsdam Agreement of the four wartime allies decided on dividing up Germany At first it was only a temporary measure until a permanent way to reunite a peaceful Germany and Berlin could be worked out

When the cold war began the joint administration of Germany and Berlin broke down Soon Soviet occupied Berlin and western occupied Berlin different separate governments

In 1948 the Soviets tried to force the western allies out Berlin by a blockade of the western sectors The Soviets blocked roads railways and canals but the Potsdam Agreement guaranteed air corridors to Berlin Because the western allies flew in all the supplies that normally came by land the Berlin Blockade is also known as the Berlin Airlift The Blockade ended in May 1949 By the end of 1949 two new states had been created out of occupied Germany  the Federal Republic of Germany in the West and the German Democratic Republic in the East  with West Berlin an enclave that was not part of either

According to the western allies the occupation of most of Germany ended in 1949 when the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic were set up But the occupation of Berlin could only be ended by a quadripartite agreement so Berlin remained an occupied territory under the formal control of all the allies This is why the Grundgesetz never applied in West Berlin

The Soviets declared the occupation of East Berlin ended when East Germany was set up This move was not recognised by the western allies who continued to view all of Berlin as a jointly occupied territory belonging to neither of the two states

However in many ways West Berlin functioned as the de facto 11th state of West Germany

But the western allies remained the ultimate political authorities there The allies could appoint the Mayor and city government at Rathaus Schneberg but they never chose anyone except the elected mayor

There were differences beteween West Germany and West Berlin

While West Berlin was a separate from East Berlin after 1949 but until 1961 people could easily move between the two parts In many ways Berlin worked as a single city The U Bahn and S Bahn public transit networks rebuilt after the war spanned all occupation sectors Many people lived in one half of the city and had family members friends and jobs in the other

As the Cold War continued many East Germans began leaving East Germany for the West East Germany closed the borders between East and West Germany in 1952 but did not seal off West Berlin because there was freedom of movement between West Berlin and West Germany Easterners could use the city as a crossing point to the West To stop this drain that the East German government built the Berlin Wall thus physically closing off West Berlin from East Germany on 13 August 1961 It was still possible to travel from West Berlin to West Germany by air and by specific rail and autobahn transit routes set aside for that purpose but inhabitants of the two Berlins were now physically and legally separated from each other

The Four Power Agreement on Berlin and the Transit Agreement helped to ease the tensions over West Berlin and made it a little easier for West Berliners to travel to East Germany and for Germans travelling along the road routes into the city instead of flying

On 9 November 1989 the wall was opened and the two cities were once again physically  but not legally  united The so called Two Plus Four Treaty signed by the two German states and the four wartime allies paved the way for German reunification and an end to the western occupation of West Berlin On 3 October 1990 West Berlin and East Berlin were united as the city of Berlin which then joined the Federal Republic as a state along with the rest of East Germany West Berlin and East Berlin thus both formally ceased to exist

West Berlin comprised the following boroughs

In the American Sector

In the British Sector

In the French Sector

The fossil was found in the Ischigualasto Formation in the Argentine This contains some of the oldest known dinosaur remains which are in top quality number and importance It is the only place in the world where nearly all of the Triassic is represented in an undisturbed sequence of rock strata What is now badlands was then a volcanically active floodplain dominated by rivers with a strongly seasonal rainfall 

Rhynchosaurs and cynodonts are by far the most common among the tetrapod fossils in the park Dinosaurs comprise only 6 of the findings but these include early samples of the two major lineages of dinosaurs The carnivorous archosaur Herrerasaurus is the most numerous of these dinosaur fossils 

Expressionism is an art and cultural movement of the 20th century Expressionist artists try to express a feeling with what they create Colours and shapes are not used in a way people see them but as the artist feels them 

Expressionism emerged as an avant garde movement in poetry and painting before the First World War In the Weimar years it was appreciated by a mass audience reaching its popularity peak in Berlin during the 1920s

Expressionism presents the world as utterly subjective how the artist feels it not how it is scientifically The art looks to get an emotional effect and transmits personal moods and ideas Expressionist artists sought to express the meaning of being alive and emotional experience rather than physical reality

Expressionism is exhibited in many art forms including painting literature theatre dance film architecture and music The term often implies emotional angst In a general sense painters such El Greco can be called expressionist though in practice the term is applied mainly to 20th century works

Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism which is sometimes just called by its initials CR is a religion People who belong to the religion call themselves Celtic Reconstructionists or Celtic Reconstructionist Pagans Sometimes they just call themseleves CRs

The Celts were the people who lived long ago in many parts of Europe but mainly in the countries of Ireland Scotland Wales and Gaul The Modern Celts are the people who live in those countries now or whose ancestors lived there 

Like the ancient Celts did before them CRs believe in many gods and goddesses This is called polytheism They believe in spirits and ancestors too and they often honour them with rituals and offerings Offerings to the spirits might be food or songs or poetry CRs often learn the languages spoken by the Celts if they do not speak them already These languages include the Irish language Scottish Gaelic the Welsh language and others

Celtic Reconstructionists are a type of Pagan Reconstructionist Reconstructionists believe in practicing a religion that is from one culture They are different from eclectic Pagans who mix parts of different cultures together 

Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism started in the 1980s when people interested in the Celts and in Paganism were looking for an authentic religion By the 1990s there were lots of CRs Some of them met each other at Pagan gatherings and later more people met each other on the Internet 

The first person to write about being a Celtic Reconstructionist Pagan was Kym Lambert n Dhoireann She wrote this in the Spring 1992 issue of Harvest Magazine She says she got the idea for the name from Kathryn Price NicDhna who had also written about it Margot Adlers 1979 book Drawing Down the Moon has a chapter on Pagan Reconstructionists and Kathryn NicDhna says this is probably where she got the idea even though the book does not mention Celtic Reconstructionists just other kinds  

Celtic Reconstructionists base their religion on what we know of the Ancient Celtic peoples religion and also on Celtic folklore They focus on a particular Celtic culture such as the Gaelic Welsh or Gaulish Many CRs are scholars or mystics though many believe its important to be both CRs read lots of books and do things like meditation prayer and rituals CRs believe that honesty and honorable behaviour is important  

Many CRs view each act of daily life as a form of ritual and they accompany daily activities with traditional prayers chants and songs from sources such as the Scottish Gaelic Carmina Gadelica or manuscript collections of ancient Irish or Welsh poetry

Community rituals are usually based on traditional community celebrations found in folkloric collections by authors such as Marian McNeill Kevin Danaher or John Gregorson Campbell These celebrations often involve bonfires dances songs divination and childrens games More formal or mystical CR rituals are often based on traditional techniques of interacting with the Otherworld such as the act of making offerings of food drink and art to the spirits of the land ancestral spirits and the Celtic deities CR ritual structures are based on the ancient Celtic idea of the Three Realms  Land Sea and Sky  with the fire of inspiration seen as a central uniting force Many CRs have altars and shrines to the spirits and deities they believe in They may place these altars at outdoor natural locations such as wells streams and special trees Some CRs practice divination such as the taking of omens from the shapes of clouds or the behaviour of birds and animals

While Celtic Reconstructionism was the earliest name in use and is still used the most often other names for a Celtic Reconstructionist approach have also come into use with varying degrees of success 

Pganachd Pgnacht Some CR groups have looked to Celtic languages for a more culturally specific name for the tradition or for their branch of the tradition There are groups who now described their traditions as Pganachd or the Irish version Pgnacht Some Gaelic oriented groups use the two terms somewhat interchangeably or further modify these terms to describe the CR sub tradition practiced by their particular group such as Pganachd Allaidh  or Pganachd Bhandia both used by Gaelic Reconstructionist groups on the East Coast of the US

In the late 1990s members of Imbas a Celtic Reconstructionist group in Seattle began promoting the name Senistrognata which they say means the ancestral customs of the Celtic peoples in reconstructed Old Celtic

Celtic Reconstructionists rely on primary mythological texts as well as surviving folklore for the basis of their religious practices No list can completely cover all the recommended works but this is a small sample of sources used 

Hurricane Humberto formed and strengthened faster than any other tropical cyclone on record within 18 hours of landfall developing on September 12 2007 in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico the cyclone quickly strengthened and struck High Island Texas with winds of about 90 mph early on September 13 It steadily weakened after moving ashore and on September 14 it began dissipating over northwestern Georgia as it interacted with an approaching cold front Humberto was the eighth named storm and third hurricane of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season and became the first hurricane to strike the United States since Hurricane Wilma of 2005 Damage was fairly light estimated at about 50 million

High Island is an unincorporated area in Galveston County Texas The city is in the extreme eastern part of the county on Bolivar Peninsula less than one mile from Chambers county and less than two miles from Jefferson county As of 1990 500 people resided in High Island

In 2007 Hurricane Humberto made landfall near High Island

This article covers the details of the preparations for Hurricane Katrina a major category 5 hurricane that destroyed parts of Louisiana Mississippi and Alabama

Many people living in the area were caught off guard when Katrina strengthened from a tropical storm to a Category 1 hurricane in one day and struck southern Florida on August 25 National Hurricane Center forecasts had correctly predicted the strengthening however and hurricane watches and warnings were properly given out nearly 36 and 24 hours before hurricane conditions were felt in the area

On August 27 after Katrina crossed southern Florida and strengthened to a Category 3 storm President George W Bush declared a state of emergency in Louisiana Alabama and Mississippi two days before the hurricane made landfall

On August 28 the National Weather Service in Slidell Louisiana issued a bulletin predicting devastating damage rivaling the intensity of Hurricane Camille Necessary evacuations were issued for large areas of southeast Louisiana as well as coastal Mississippi and Alabama

On Sunday August 28 Canadian National Railway stopped all rail traffic on its lines south of McComb Mississippi expectating damage from the hurricane To help continue services after the storm passes CN also issued an embargo with the Association of American Railroads against all deliveries to points south of Osyka Mississippi CSX Transportation also suspended service south of Montgomery Alabama until further notice

Amtrak Americas rail passenger carrier announced that the southbound City of New Orleans passenger trains from Chicago Illinois from August 29 through September 3 would stop at Memphis Tennessee rather than their usual destination of New Orleans The trains traveling northbound would also start at Memphis The southbound Crescent from New York City for the same period stopped in Atlanta Georgia with the northbound trains starting in Atlanta as well Amtraks westbound Sunset Limited started in San Antonio Texas rather than its usual starting point of Orlando Florida Amtrak announced that no alternate transportation options would be made available into or out of the affected area

The Waterford nuclear power plant was also shut down on Sunday August 28 before Katrinas arrival

By August 26 the possibility of never before happened destruction and damage was already being considered Some computer models were putting the city of New Orleans right in the center of their track probabilities and the chances of a direct hit were forecast at 17 This scenario was considered a potential disaster because 80 of the New Orleans metropolitan area is below sea level along Lake Pontchartrain Since the storm surge produced by the hurricanes right front quadrant was more than 20 ft near Biloxi emergency management officials in New Orleans feared that the storm surge could go over the tops of levees protecting the city causing major flooding This risk of devastation had been known for some time previous studies by FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers had warned that a direct hurricane strike on New Orleans could lead to massive flooding which would lead to thousands of drowning deaths as well as many more suffering from disease and dehydration as the flood waters slowly retreated from the city

At a news conference 1000 AM on August 28 shortly after Katrina was upgraded to a Category 5 storm New Orleans mayor Ray Nagin ordered the first ever mandatory evacuation of the city calling Katrina a storm that most of us have long feared To speed up the evacuations authorities used contraflow lane reversal on Interstate 10 leading west of New Orleans as well as on Interstate 55 and Interstate 59 leading north from the city The city government also established several refuges of last resort for citizens who could not leave the city including the massive Louisiana Superdome which housed approximately 26000 people with food and water for several days as the storm came ashore The Louisiana National Guard delivered three truckloads of water and seven truckloads of MREs to the Superdome enough to supply 15000 people for three days

Louisianas hurricane evacuation plan calls for local governments in areas along and near the coast to call for evacuations in three phases starting with the immediate coast 50 hours before the start of tropical storm force winds Persons in areas designated Phase II begin evacuating 40 hours before the onset of tropical storm winds and those in Phase III areas evacuate 30 hours before the start of such winds

However many parishes were not able to provide sufficient transportation for citizens who did not have private means of evacuation and many private care taking facilities who relied on the same bus companies and ambulance services for evacuation were unable to evacuate their charges Fuel and rental cars were in short supply and many forms of public transportation had been shut down well before the storm arrived The end result was that hundreds of thousands of residents and tourists were unable to evacuate and remained in the city Nonetheless some estimates claimed that 90 92 of the 13 million residents of the New Orleans metropolitan region evacuated including 80 of Orleans parish

The Waterford Steam Electric Station Unit 3 also known as Waterford 3 is a nuclear power station located on a 3000 acre up river from Hahnville Louisiana in St Charles Parish

A passenger car is a type of train that is designed to carry people to and from places

Checkpoint Charlie was one of three places where people could travel from the Western occupied sectors of Germany and Berlin to the Soviet occupied sectors

These places were called checkpoints because they were places where passports and identities were checked

As it was the only crossing point there were sometimes queues of people waiting to cross But military traffic was never stopped because Berlin was supposed to be under the control of all four wartime allies

After the end of the Cold War and the reunification of Germany the checkpoints were no longer needed The big concrete buildings of Checkpoint Bravo are now used by the German Customs Service Checkpoint Charlie was only a wooden hut in the street It was moved to what is now the Allied Museum at 110 Clayallee and a small replica put up in Kochstrae The fake checkpoint is very popular with tourists who have their photographs taken in front of it

Most countries have a Customs Service The customs service works mostly and ports airports and the countries borders to make sure that people do not bring things into the country which are banned or that the right amount of tax has been paid on goods that can be imported

Some customs officers work at a post office They do not meet the public they examine letters and parcels which have been sent from outside the country to make sure nothing illegal is being brought into the country

In the United Kingdom the customs service was called Customs and Excise This is because it was once two separate bodies The Customs service collected tax on goods being brought into the country for example brandy from France or tea from India The Excise service collected tax on goods made in the country for example Scotch whisky or Irish whiskey Today all cars and lorries must pay a tax to be allowed to drive on the road Although most people call this road tax or car tax it is officially called vehicle excise duty

Whisky or whiskey is an alcoholic drink distilled from grain and aged in wooden broken wikt linkcaskcasks

The name comes from a gaelic word In Scotland and the rest of Great Britain it is known as Scotch whisky or just Scotch In Ireland which has a different gaelic language it is called whiskey with an added letter e Whiskey made in the United States uses the Irish spelling

There are many kinds of whisky of which most important are

Other well known single malts are Laphroaig Lagavulin Bowmore Ardbeg and Talisker Most single malts come from Scotland either Lowlands Highlands or Scottish Isles Nikka Yoichi comes from Japan

Most whiskys contain around 40 alcohol

Scotch whisky is legally defined by Scotch Whisky Order of 1990 and the Scotch Whisky Act of 1988 

These say that Scotch whisky must

Alcohol is a favorite way to collect tax in the United Kingdom When Gordon Brown a Scot became Chancellor of the Exchequer he concentrated on taxing beers and wines and did not increased the duty on whisky This he said was to help the Scotch whisky industry to recover and make more money and increase exports

Chapter could also mean

A chapter is one of the main divisions of a piece of writing of some length such as a book Chapters can be numbered in the case of such writings as law code or they can be titled For example the first chapters of some well known novels are titled

Many novels of great length do not have chapters Non fiction books especially those used for reference almost always have chapters for ease of navigation In these works chapters are often subdivided into sections The chapters of reference works are almost always listed in a table of contents Novels sometimes use a table of contents but not always

In ancient civilizations books were often in the form of papyrus scrolls which contained about the same amount of text as a typical chapter in a modern book This is the reason chapters in recent reproductions and translations of works of these periods are often presented as Book 1 Book 2 etc

The shores of Lake Constance near Arbon have been inhabited since the Stone Age Archaeological digs in 1885 and 1944 have uncovered stilt houses from the Stone and Bronze Ages At first it was assumed that these were built over water since they were raised on stilts However it is now known that they were on the shore and were built in this fashion because the ground was swampy

During Roman times Bergli was probably a Roman fort The raised situation and view over the lake were strategically important Since 1957 regular excavations have shown the remains of late Roman fortifications The Latin name of Arbon Arbor Felix first appears in the Itinerarium Antonini in 300

According to the chronicles of Ammianus Marcellinus Emperor Gratian went to Arbon in 378 and stayed there until 401 

In the 8th century the area became part of the territory of the Franks

In 610 Irish monks who were followers of Columban of Luxeuil settled in Arbon They found a small Christian settlement called Castrum there One of these monks was St Gallus the founder of the monastery of St Gallen He died in 627 in Arbon In 720 a fortification on the site of the present castle was built by a Frankish troop The foundations of this early fortress remain

Ecclesiastically Arbon belonged to the territory of the Bishop of Constance In 1255 Bishop Eberhard von Waldburg gave Arbon a dispensation for market rights in the area and built the city wall That century saw an influx of inhabitants from the surrounding farms From 1262 to 1264 and again in 1266 the young Duke of Swabia Conradin of Hohenstaufen resided in Arbon because the Bishop of Constance was his guardian The surrounding towns of Steinach Mrschwil Horn Goldach Egnach Roggwil and Steinebrunn all belonged to the parish of Arbon

The 14th century saw further growth Linen production and other crafts developed Between 1322 and 1334 Bishop Rudolf von Montfort rebuilt the crumbling fortress A fire of unknown cause in 1390 destroyed much of the Altstadt A second fire in 1494 was set by the sons of a hanged thief

When Thurgau was conquered by the Swiss Eidgenossen in 1460 the Bishops of Constance retained Arbon However in the Swabian War of 1499 they lost civil rights over the territory retaining only ecclesiastical supremacy Arbon then became part of the Old Swiss Confederacy

The castle of Arbon in its present form was built in 1515 by Bishop Hugo von Hohenlandenberg The tower is older and dates to 993

In 1525 the first stirrings of the Reformation reached Arbon In 1537 the reformed congregation was forced to return the church of St Martin to the Catholic Church and meet in the chapel in Erdhausen although only a small minority of the population remained Catholic Religious conflict continued until the 18th century In 1712 Thurgau declared equality for the various faiths

In the 18th century the linen and embroidery industry was established in Arbon The industrialists built attractive villas in the area such as the Rotes Haus built in 1750

In 1798 Thurgau was occupied by French troops along with much of the rest of Switzerland The adoption of the Swiss constitution ended Arbons dependence on the Bishops of Constance The Bishops representative Franz Xaver Wirz von Rudenz was forced to leave the city In 1803 Arbon became part of the new canton of Thurgau From 1803 to 1815 Arbon and Horn were united in one municipality

In the 19th century Arbon developed into an economic and manufacturing center This occurred primarily because of the pioneering efforts of industrialist Franz Saurer who move his foundry from St Gallen to Arbon in 1863 Starting in 1888 his factory built all kinds of machinery and motors Until 1983 the factory produced trucks and buses and until 1986 military vehicles Today the factory produces only textile machinery At its high point the factory employed 5000 workers The population grew from 660 in 1844 to over 10000 at the turn of the century

Since the beginning of the 20th century Arbon has had a large non Swiss minority Tensions between ethnic groups led to riots with several fatalities in 1902

In 1911 Arbon was the site of the International Socialist Congress From the 1920s to the 1950s the Social Democratic majority held power in the city and it was known as red Arbon

The population of the city of Arbon is about 13000 people

Aadorf is a municipality of the district of Frauenfeld in the canton of Thurgau in Switzerland

A genius is a person who is exceptionally intelligent People may have different ideas of how clever one has to be in order to be called a genius A genius may be extremely clever at maths or science or games such as chess or they may be creative geniuses who are brilliant writers musicians or artists 

Albert Einstein is perhaps the worlds most famous genius He was extraordinarily good at math but in other areas such as languages he was not particularly good Leonardo da Vinci and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe were geniuses who can also be described as polymaths because they were brilliant in lots of different subjects Geniuses are usually child prodigies ie they already show they are a genius when they are young children

Genius is not quite the same as talent Talent means the ability to learn a particular skill very quickly A genius on the other hand is also very creative and able to do things that no one else has thought of

Some geniuses such as Goethe are very sensible reliable people who are good at organizing their lives However there are many geniuses who have unusual personalities They may be very absent minded they may not have much common sense or they may suffer at times from depression and changes of mood

Glarus could mean different places

Glarus is a canton in east Switzerland The capital is Glarus There are 25 municipalities in the canton The population is German speaking and either Protestant or Catholic

The canton of Glarus is dominated by the deep valley of the Linth River Most of the area is mountainous The total area of the canton of Glarus is 685 km

The history of this canton is dominated by religion The inhabitants of the Linth Valley were converted to Christianity in the 6th century by the Irish monk Saint Fridolin who still features in the coat of arms of the canton today He founded Sckingen Abbey near Basel From the 9th century the area around Glarus was owned by the abbey By 1288 the Habsburgs bit by bit claimed all the abbeys rights This resulted in the people of Glarus joining the Swiss Confederation in 1352

Between 1506 and 1516 the reformer Huldrych Zwingli was priest in Glarus but by 1564 all of Zwinglis followers were eliminated This however did not end the struggles between the Protestants and the Catholics in the area To secure peace it was decided that each party should have its own assembly in 1623 and at a later stage in 1683 each side was granted the right to have its own tribunals

Between 1798 and 1803 Glarus was part of the Canton of Linth as established by Napoleon In 1836 the constitution was adapted to unite the assemblies and establish only one Landsgemeinde

About two thirds of Glarus were destroyed after a big fire in 1861 After this incident Glarus was rebuilt in block fashion according to construction plans by Bernhard Simon and Johann Caspar Wolff

On May 6 2007 Glarus became the first Swiss canton to lower the voting age to 16 

The land of the canton helped to make slate works in the 1600s

The 25 municipalities are

Andr Marie Ampre was a French physicist and mathematician who helped discover electromagnetism An electrical unit called the ampere is named after him

Ampere was born in Lyon France in 1775 During his childhood Amperes father taught him Latin until he found out that his son was talented in mathematical studies However young Ampere continued his study on Latin so that he could understand and master the works of Euler and Bernoulli In his later life Ampere began to distinguish himself in mathematical field not only was he specialized in mathematical field but also he studied history travels poetry phiolosophy and the natural sciences During the years of French Revolution a great sorrow came to Amperes life he lost his father who was executed by revolutionaries The death of his father brought a huge impact to Ampere In 1796 he met the daughter of a blacksmith living near Lyon named Julie Carron and married her in 1799 Afterward Ampere worked as a professor in Lyon giving lessons in mathematics chemistry languages and physics He continued working as a professor even after the death of her wife in 1803 However her death bothered Ampere for the rest of his life Ampere passed away at Marseille and buried in the Cimetiere de Montmartre Paris In his work Journal et correspondence we can see his amiability and childlike simplicity of his character

Ampere is most known for establishing the relationship between electricity and magnetism and combining them into a new field called electromagnetism or electrodynamics On September 11 1820 Ampere heard from the discovery of HCOrsted that a magnetic needle can be activated by a voltaic current Only a week later he came up with a much more advanced version of that kindred phenomena It was such a amazing development On the same day he also discovered that parallel wires carrying currents attract or repel each other This has later become fundamentals of a field called electrodynamics

A dive bomber is a bomber aircraft that dives towards the ground so it can get very close to its targets This means it is more likely to hit them This can also limit the chance of anti aircraft fire

Diving nearly vertically at the target in the same direction the bombs will take the aircraft will release the bombs very close to the target at high speed This allows a dive bomber to accurately place bombs on a relatively small target or a moving target quite easily Additionally no complicated precision equipment is needed Dive bombers were widely used to attack high value targets such as ships and bridges This also had the advantage of attacking ships at a weak spot armour was the heaviest near the waterline and thin or non existent on the deck Also dive bombing allowed relatively small aeroplanes carrying a limited bomb load to produce more damage than usual

Naters is a municipality of the district of Brig in the canton of Valais in Switzerland

Fiberglass is material made from extremely fine fibers of glass 

It is used as a reinforcing material for many polymer products The composite material that is produced by this method is called fiberglass in popular usage The proper names are fiber reinforced polymer or glass reinforced plastic

Glassmakers throughout history have experimented with glass fibers but mass manufacture of fiberglass was only made possible when finer tools for machines were produced 

Glass fiber is formed when thin broken wikt linkstrandstrands of silica based or other formulation glass is extruded into many fibers with small diameters that are suitable for textile processing Glass is unlike other polymers because even as a fiber it has little crystalline structure The properties of the structure of glass in its soft stage are very much like its properties when spun into fiber 

Bare fiberglass can cause skin irritation and cuts when handled without gloves There have been concerns that fiberglass can be accidentally inhaled into the lungs where it can cause cancer and other lung problems similar to asbestos Substitutes for fiberglass building insulation such as cellulose and aerogel have started to appear

Composite materials are engineered materials made from more than one material with very different physical or chemical properties and which remain separate and able to be told apart on a macroscopic level inside the composite

The most primitive composite materials were straw and mud in the form of bricks for building construction The Biblical book of Exodus tells of the Israelites that were oppressed by Pharaoh and forced to make bricks without straw Today we use shower stalls and bath tubs made of fiberglass a type of composite 

A fibre or fiber is a piece of material that is long and thin like a length of thread They are very important in the biology of both plants and animals because they hold tissues together There are a lot of human uses for fibres They can be spun into filaments thread string or rope They can be used as a component of composite materials They can also be matted into sheets to make products such as paper or felt Fibres are often used in making other materials

A fibre reinforced polymer is a composite material that consists of a polymer matrix that is reinforced with fibres The fibres are usually fibreglass carbon or aramid the polymer is usually an epoxy vinylester or polyester thermosetting plastic FRPs are commonly used in the aerospace automobile marine and construction industries

Glass reinforced plastic is a composite material or fiber reinforced polymer made of a plastic reinforced by fine fibers made of glass Like carbon fiber reinforced plastic the composite material is commonly referred to by the name of its reinforcing fibers 

Carbon fiber reinforced plastic is a very strong light and expensive composite material or fiber reinforced plastic Similar to glass reinforced plastic one uses commonly the name of its reinforcing fibers for the composite material The plastic is most often epoxy but other plastics such as polyester vinyl ester or nylon are also sometimes used Some composites contain both carbon fiber and other fibres such as kevlar aluminium and fiberglass reinforcement Less commonly the terms graphite reinforced plastic or graphite fiber reinforced plastic are also used

It has many applications in aerospace and automotive fields as well as in sailboats and notably in modern bicycles and motorcycles where these qualities are of importance It is becoming increasingly common in small consumer goods as well such as laptop computers tripods fishing rods paintball equipment racquet sports frames stringed instrument bodies classical guitar strings and drum shells

Carbon fiber or Carbon fibre is also sometimes called graphite fiber It has the highest compressive strength of all the reinforcing materials and it has a high strength to weight ratio and low coefficient of thermal expansion The density of carbon fiber is also much lower than the density of steel Carbon fiber is in the form of several thousand long thin strands of material that is composed of mostly carbon atoms

In mathematics a coefficient is a constant multiplicative factor of a certain object For example the coefficient in 9x2 is 9 

Coefficient could have one of the following meanings

Enrico Fermi was an Italian physicist who worked on the first nuclear reactor and helped make quantum theory He also was important to particle physics and statistical mechanics Fermi won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1938 for his work on induced radioactivity He built the worlds first nuclear reactor Fermi was one of the greatest scientists of the 20th century

Fermi was born in Rome and went to a local grammar school He was very good at maths and science and won a prize from Scuola Normale  Superiore of Pisa He went to the University of Pisa where he studied physics In 1923 he was given a scholarship from the Italian government and went to Gttingen for more study He was given a Rockefeller scholarship in 1924 and studied in Leyden He came back to Italy at the end of 1924 and became Lecturer in Mathematical Physics and Mechanics at the University of Florence

In 1926 Fermi discovered the statistical laws now called Fermi statistics These laws explain the actions of the particles which are subject to the Pauli exclusion principle which are now called fermions These are different to the particles called bosons which are explained by Bose Einstein statistics In 1927 he became Professor of Theoretical Physics at  the University of Rome He spent time studying electrodynamics and began to closely look at the atomic nucleus In 1934 using discoveries made by Wolfgang Pauli Frdric Joliot Irne Joliot Curie he was able to show changes in almost every element bombarded with neutrons This lead to the discovery of slow neutrons nuclear fission and making elements that were not in the Periodic Table 

A physical coefficient is an important number that characterizes some physical property of a technical or scientific object 

Solids mostly expand in response to heating and contract on cooling This response to temperature change is expressed as its coefficient of thermal expansion

The coefficient of thermal expansion is used

These characteristics are closely related The volumetric thermal expansion coefficient can be measured for all substances of condensed matter The linear thermal expansion can only be measured in the solid state and is common in engineering applications

The expansion and contraction of material must be considered when designing large structures when using tape or chain to measure distances for land surveys when designing molds for casting hot material and in other engineering applications when large changes in dimension due to temperature are expected The range for is from 10 7 for hard solids to 10 3 for organic liquids varies with the temperature and some materials have a very high variation Some values for common materials given in parts per million per Celsius degree

For applications using the thermal expansion property see bi metal and mercury thermometer

Thermal expansion is also used in mechanical applications to fit parts over one another eg a bushing can be fitted over a shaft by making its inner diameter slightly smaller than the diameter of the shaft then heating it until it fits over the shaft and allowing it to cool after it has been pushed over the shaft thus achieving a shrink fit

There exist some alloys with a very small CTE used in applications that demand very small changes in physical dimension over a range of temperatures One of these is Invar 36 with a coefficient in the 06x10 6 range These alloys are useful in aerospace applications where wide temperature swings may occur

Surveying is the technique and science of accurately finding out the position of points and the distances and angles between them These points are usually but not always associated with positions on the surface of the Earth They are often used to make land maps and boundaries for ownership of land A person who does the surveying is called a surveyor In order to find the information they need surveyors use geometry engineering trigonometry mathematics physics and law

Surveying has been very important in the development of the human environment since the beginning of recorded history and it is a requirement planning of nearly every form of construction Its most common uses are in the fields of transport building and construction communications mapping and the making of legal boundaries for land ownership

Surveying has existed throughout much of our history In ancient Egypt when the Nile River overflowed its banks and washed out farm boundaries the boundaries were recreated by surveyors using simple geometry The construction of many of the pyramids including the Great Pyramids of Giza built c 2700 BC show us that the Egyptians have always used surveying very efficiently

Oskar Lafontaine is a left wing German politician and a founder member of the new political party Die Linke

Lafontaine studied physics at the Bonn University and the Saarland University from 1962 to 1969

He is Roman Catholic and is married to Christa Mller who leads a campaign against genital mutilation in Africa They have a son Carl Maurice born 1997

Lafontaines political career began locally as mayor of Saarbrcken He became widely known as a critic of chancellor Helmut Schmidts support for the NATO plan to put Pershing II missiles in Germany From 1985 to 1998 he was Minister President of the Saarland As minister president Lafontaine tried to keep the traditional industries of steel production and coal mining in the state with subsidies He was also President of the Bundesrat in 199293

In the German federal election of 1990 Lafonntaine was the SPDs Chancellor candidate The party lost because of support for the CDU who were the government during reunification During the campaign he was attacked with a knife by a mentally deranged woman after a speech in Cologne His carotid artery was slashed and he remained in a critical condition for several days

At the Mannheim convention in 1995 Lafontaine was elected chairman of the SPD replacing Rudolf Scharping He was mainly responsible for bringing the whole of the SPD against Helmut Kohl and his CDU party instead of cooperating with the CDU Lafontaine said that any help given to Kohl would only help to keep the CDU in government

This idea put the SPD ahead in the opinion polls in September 1998 He was appointed Federal Minister of Finance in the first government of Gerhard Schrder

During his short time as Minister of Finance Lafontaine was a figure of attack by UK Eurosceptics This was especially because he wanted to make taxes the same in the European Union This would have meant some UK taxes would increase

On 11 March 1999 he resigned from all his official and party offices saying that not getting any help from other members of the cabinet Later he become known for his attacks against Angela Merkels government in the tabloid Bild Zeitung which is generally considered conservative

On 24 May 2005 Lafontaine left the SPD On 10 June he said he would run as the lead candidate for the The Left PartyPDS a coalition of the Electoral Alternative for Labour and Social Justice which is based in western Germany and the Party of Democratic Socialism which was the successor to the East German communist party

He joined the WASG on 18 June 2005 and was selected to head their list for the 2005 Federal Election in North Rhine Westphalia on the same day He also stood in the Saarbrcken constituency but lost Nevertheless the result of the Linkspartei in the Saarland was the best in any of the federal states in the West of Germany

An article by Lafontaine on Erich Honecker state and party leader of the GDR and a Saarlnder like him in the magazine Der Spiegel was criticized by many people who said it concentrated on a few good things Honecker did and ignored the bad things In the late 80s and early 90s he lost some support from left wing people because he seemed to want pro business policies and he called for a reduction of the influx of Germans from Eastern Europe and asylum seekers

A group in the Periodic Table is any column of elements with common properties denoted by the electrons in the outermost layer There are eight groups of elements in total 

In mathematics differential coefficient is a term out of use now The former differential coefficient of a function f is now called its derivative dfdx It is the multiplicative factor or coefficient of the differential dx in the differential df 

The differential coefficient of f is a constant function only if f is a linear function

Early editions of Silvanus P Thompsons Calculus Made Easy use the older term In his 1998 update of this text Martin Gardner puts derivative instead of differential coefficient He speaks of it only in context with Thompsons criticism of the term

A period in the Periodic Table is any horizontal row of elements The elements in a certain period all increase one by one in atomic numbers The elements in the same period are very metallic on the right and nonmetallic on the left As you go across a period towards the right the size of the atom gets larger because protons and electrons are increasing

Atomic orbitals are the places surrounding the nucleus of an atom where the electrons are most likely to be at any given time It used to be believed that electrons behaved similarly to the solar system where the sun is the nucleus and the planets are like the electrons However electrons do not go in circles they move broken wikt linkerraticallyerratically The number of atomic orbitals in an element is defined by the period the element is in Electrons move between orbitals depending on how fast they are moving and how many other electrons there are

The moon appears grey similar to C type asteroids

The Great Dark Spot is a dark spot on Neptune similar in appearance to Jupiters Great Red Spot It was discovered in 1989 by NASAs Voyager 2 probe Although it appears similar to Jupiters spot which is an anticyclonic storm it is believed that the Great Dark Spot is an atmospheric hole similar to the hole in Earths ozone layer

However the insides of Great Dark Spots are mostly cloud free and unlike Jupiters spot which has lasted for hundreds of years their lifetimes appear to be much shorter forming and disappearing once every few years or so Based on pictures taken by Voyager and since then with the Hubble Space Telescope Neptune appears to spend a little bit more than half its time with a Great Dark Spot 

The dark elliptically shaped spot was about the same size as Earth and was similar looking to Jupiters Great Red Spot Around the Great Dark Spot winds were measured blowing up to 2400 kilometers an hour the fastest in the Solar System The Great Dark Spot is thought to be a hole in the methane cloud deck of Neptune The spot was seen at different times with different sizes and shapes 

The Great Dark Spot generated large white clouds at or just below the tropopause layer similar to high altitude cirrus clouds found on Earth Unlike the clouds on Earth however which are made of mostly crystals of ice Neptunes clouds are made up of crystals of frozen methane And while Neptunes clouds usually form and then disappear within a period of a few hours the clouds in the Great Dark Spot were still present after 36 hours or two rotations of the planet

Neptunes dark spots are thought to happen in the troposphere at lower heights than the brighter upper cloud deck features As they are stable features that can last for several months they are thought to be vortex structures

When pictures were going to be taken of the Great Dark Spot again in November 1994 by the Hubble Space Telescope it had gone away completely leaving astronomers to believe that it had either been covered up or that it had just disappeared The persistence of companion clouds shows that some former dark spots may continue to exist as cyclones even though they are no longer able to be seen as a dark feature Dark spots may disappear when they move too close to the equator or possibly through some other unknown way

However a new spot that looked very much like the old spot appeared in Neptunes northern hemisphere This new spot called the Northern Great Dark Spot has remained able to be seen for several years

The term supersonic is used to describe a speed that is over the speed of sound At a normal temperature like 70 degrees Fahrenheit the speed needed for something to be traveling at a faster than sound speed is about 344 ms 1129 fts 770 mph or 1238 kmh Speeds faster than 5 times the speed of sound are sometimes called hypersonic Speeds where only some parts of the air around an object reach supersonic speeds are called transonic

It can be very hard to reach supersonic speeds because drag increases a lot near these speeds This slows a plane down Dick Whitcomb invented a lot of ways to overcome drag and break the sound barrier

The Small Dark Spot sometimes also called Dark Spot 2 or The Wizards Eye was a southern cyclonic storm on the planet Neptune It was the second strongest storm on the planet in 1989 when Voyager 2 flew by the planet When first discovered it was a dark cyclonic storm As Voyager 2 approached the planet a bright core of cloud activity developed It disappeared in 1994

It was named in August 2003 after Aitna or Aitne the divine personification of Mount Etna whose sons by Zeus are the Palici the twin sicilian gods of geysers

Aitne belongs to the Carme group made up of non spherical irregular retrograde moons orbiting Jupiter at a distance ranging between 23000000 and 24000000 km and at an inclination of about 165

William Lassell was a British astronomer born in Bolton Lancashire England

The Roche limit sometimes referred to as the Roche radius is the distance within which a celestial body held together only by its own gravity will disintegrate due to a second celestial bodys tidal forces exceeding the first bodys gravitational self attraction Inside the Roche limit orbiting material will tend to disperse and form rings while outside the limit material will tend to coalesce The term is named after douard Roche the French astronomer who first calculated this theoretical limit in 1848

A synchronous orbit is an orbit in which an orbiting body has a period equal to the average rotational period of the body being orbited Or in smaller words the orbit above and the spinning planet below go around once in the same amount of time It orbits in the same direction of rotation as that body So if you were on the orbiting body you would always see the same side of the body being orbited Or if you were on the body being orbited the orbiting body would stay in the same part of the sky

The Voyager program is a space exploration program of the United States NASA agency It consists of a pair of unmanned scientific probes Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 They were launched in 1977 to take advantage of a favorable planetary alignment of the late 1970s Although they were officially used to study just Jupiter and Saturn the two probes were able to continue their mission into the outer solar system They have since continued out and exited the solar system These probes were built at JPL and were funded by NASA

Both missions have gathered large amounts of data about the gas giants of the solar system of which little was known before In addition the spacecraft paths have been used to place limits on the existence of Planet X a planet believed by some people to be located past Pluto

A Neptune Trojan is an asteroid which is in the same orbit as the planet Neptune 

Their name comes from the Trojan asteroids which have the same orbital period as a planet As of March 2007 there are six known Neptune Trojans They lie in the elongated curved region around the L4 Lagrangian point 60 ahead of Neptune The six Neptune Trojans are mpl2001 QR322 mpl2004 UP10 mpl2005 TN53 mpl2005 TO74 mpl2006 RJ103 and mpl2007 RW10

The discovery of mpl2005 TN53 in a high inclination orbit is significant because it suggests a thick cloud of Trojans It is believed that large Neptune Trojans could greatly outnumber the Jupiter Trojans 

If any other L5 Neptune Trojans are discovered in the near future it may be possible for the New Horizons spacecraft to investigate them as it passes through the region in 2014 while on its way to Pluto

Edward Guinan is currently a professor in Villanova Universitys Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics He and two colleagues discovered Neptunes ring system

An occultation is an event that occurs when one object is hidden by another object that passes between it and the observer The word is often used in astronomy It can also be used in a non astronomical sense to describe when an object in the foreground occults objects in the background

The flattening ellipticity or oblateness of an oblate spheroid is the squashing of the spheroids pole down towards its equator

Adaptive optics is a technology to improve the performance of optical systems by reducing the effects of rapidly changing optical distortion It is commonly used on astronomical telescopes to remove the effects of atmospheric distortion or astronomical seeing Adaptive optics works by measuring the distortion and rapidly compensating for it either using deformable mirrors or material with variable refractive properties While the technique was theoretically understood for some time it was only advances in computer technology during the 1990s that finally made the technique practical 

Adaptive optics should not be confused with active optics which works on a longer timescale to correct the primary mirror geometry itself The simplest form of adaptive optics is tip tilt correction which corresponds to correction of the tilts of the wavefront in two dimensions This is performed using a rapidly moving tip tilt mirror which makes small rotations around two of its axes A significant fraction of the aberration introduced by the atmosphere can be removed in this way Tip tilt mirrors are widely used in night time and solar telescopes to correct the aberration introduced by Earths atmosphere on the light path and improve image quality over what would be possible according to the atmospheric seeing Tip tilt mirrors are effectively segmented adaptive optics mirrors having only one segment which can tip and tilt rather than having an array of multiple segments which can tip and tilt independently

Optical depth is a measure of transparency It is defined as the fraction of radiation that is scattered or absorbed on a path One way of visualizing optical depth is to think of a fog The fog between a person and an object that is immediately in front of them has an optical depth of zero As the object moves away the optical depth increases until it reaches a large value and the object is no longer visible

Opacity or opaque means something that is difficult to see through or perceive It can also mean

The English free settlers were the people that chose to go to Australia They were not forced to go there like the convicts were The English free settlers went to Australia between the late 17th century and the early 18th century This was after the convicts were sent to Australia When the English free settlers got to Australia they landed in the southern part of the continent That was the only colony created by the free settlers

The English free settlers went to Australia to be free They wanted to make money as well They also wanted to explore Australia Most of them were families who wanted a better life with their children Some people called the English Free settlers Pilgrims

In poetry meter means the rhythmic patterns in a verse 

The units of poetic meter like rhyme vary from language to language and between poetic traditions They can involve arrangements of syllables into repeated patterns called feet within a line English meter is founded on the patterns of stressed and unstressed syllables In Latin and Greek verse on the other hand while the metrical units are similar not syllable stresses but syllable lengths are the component parts of meter 

In poetry a verse is used for a single line in a metrical composition eg poetry 

In common use it also means a unit of a song that consists of several lines if there are several similar units in a song In poems of Ancient Greece these units are called strophe

Line or lines could mean

Charlotte Karin Lindstrm is a former waitress promotion model and former prisoner  She was arrested on May 26 2007 and had to spend three years in jail in Sydney Australia When she was arrested people suspected she was trying to hire a hitman to kill two men who were about to testify against her boyfriend Steven Spaliviero in court

Lindstrm arrived in Sydney in 2003 working as a part time model as well as a waitress in the exclusive nightclub Hemmesphere in Sydney 

In Sydney Lindstrm met Steven Spaliviero and they soon started a relationship living in a apartment in Darling Harbour Lindstrm later told the court that she soon realised that he was both a wealthy businessman and a drug dealer In early 2007 investigators started to look into Spalivieros business and soon found two witnesses who said they had information about the mans drug dealing business At that time Spaliviero was already on bail from Melbourne in relation to another drug case Spaliviero was arrested refused bail and sent to Metropolitan Remand and Reception Center in Silverwater New South Wales

In MRRC Spaliviero allegedly met another inmate who offered him to get witnesses in Spalivieros case killed In relation to this Spaliviero phoned Lindstrm from MRRC telling her to meet a solicitor and give him money Lindstrm started acting upon instructions from Spaliviero When Lindstrm finally met who she thought was a hitman but who in reality was an undercover policeman she was arrested The policeman on the case stated that Lindstrm wanted to have two men to the cemetery which meant she wanted them dead The price was agreed as AUD 100000 for each contract 

Upon her arrest on May 26 Lindstrm was remanded in custody Later an application for bail was made where Steven Spalivieros mother Dolores Spaliviero offered to put up AUD 2000000 surety to get Lindstrm out from custody In addition Lindstrms friend and employer Justin Hemmes promising that if Lindstrm was set free on bail he would let her continue her work at the Hemmesphere nightclub until trial The application for bail was denied due to flight risk and Lindstrm was remanded in custody

On September 18 having had a deal made with the prosecutors Lindstrm pled guilty to the charges On December 21 she pled guilty yet in another court in Sydney Lindstrm appeared in a bullet proof vest at her court hearings because of the alleged death threats against her life

Lindstrm was initially sentenced to four years in jail being eligible for early parole on May 25 2009 Even though Lindstrm was given a hefty discount from her sentence because she had agreed to testify against Steven Spaliviero and two other men the Crown appealed against the sentence as manifestly inadequate The criminal court of appeals heard the appeal on July 4 2008

On 23 July 2008 her maximum sentence was increased from three years and 10 months to four years and nine months making her eligible for parole in May 2010 

On August 11 2008 Lindstrm started testifying against Spaliviero in his court case among others reading a love letter to the court which she had written to him in February 2007 some months before her own arrest

Despite Lindstrms extensive testimonies Spaliviero and two other defendants were found not guilty for the murder plot

Lindstrm was released on parole from Long Bay jail in New South Wales on 25 May 2010 and deported the next day from Australia

Since her release from prison Lindstrm has returned to her native home Sweden and is understood to have had ongoing threats against her life

According to the Australian media on 15 August 2010 Charlotte Lindstrm agreed to return to Australia to testify in the trial of her former boyfriends associate Due to an unspecified severe illness she has not been allowed to travel to Australia The upcoming trial has been postponed

On 14 November 2010 Australian Channel 9 aired an exclusive interview of Charlotte Lindstrm named Charlottes web in which she appeared with her face despite allegations that she is living under death threats

As of 5 June 2011 all videos of Charlottes interviews and her arrest are deleted from YouTube for no apparent reason

Channel 9 in Australia will air a documentary on 6 September 2011 concentrating on Charlotte Lindstrms murder plot According to the the article in Sydney Morning Herald Charlotte Lindstrm no longer has feelings for Steven Spaliviero

An accretion disc is an astronomical term It describes a disc of material being drawn in by gravity to a centre of mass such as a star or black hole As the material comes in it spins round the central body and radiates energy

The central body is typically either a young star a protostar a white dwarf a neutron star or a black hole As the material moves in gravitational energy released in that process is transformed into heat and rotational movement 

The energy emitted at the disk surface is in form of electromagnetic radiation The frequency range of that radiation depends on the central object Accretion discs of young stars and protostars radiate in the infrared those around neutron stars and black holes in the X ray part of the spectrum

This moon has gone missing Some scientists think that it may have crashed into Himalia creating a thin ring around Jupiter

Hello to all wikipedians I just wanted to remind the community that we have three articles up for voting at WikipediaProposed very good articles But unfortunately no one has been paying attention to the project Currently the 3 articles were supposed to have their votes in by Halloween but I decided to extend the voting phase by an extra 3 days I hope you can help by either supporting or opposing the nominated VGA articles by November 3 2007 Thank you  Snake311 0208 1 November 2007

Hello Community At the moment there are between 30 and 40 different editors that contribute steadily They contribute many articles and help improve many The problem with this is that most of these editors come from a European background They are either from Europe or their set of values are very influenced by those of Europeans So that this project can grow it needs more of these editors 

In a short talk with Werdan7 we found out there is a way in Wikipedia to send a short message to all users coming from a certain region of the world So far this has been used to advertise local Wikipedia meetings The idea would be to have a short ad run for a short period of time This would be done in a specific Region only However we felt that such a decision would be too big to take for just two people Therefore please express your opinions about the idea Thanks  Eptalon 2043 1 November 2007

I suggest that when creating a new article on the Simple English wikipedia copy and paste the normal English wikipedia article and then simplify the words and sentences I see that a lot of the articles on the Simple English wiki turn complex ideas into simple ideas Much of the more detailed information is destroyed Simple English wikipedias are usually a lot more vague than the normal English wikipedia

So if we just copy the normal English wikipedia and then simplify the words grammar and sentences it will still explain a complex idea just using simple Englishunsigned1651552001441618 16 November 2007

Hello all I have recently worked on articles relating to Witches and Witchcraft To be able to label those that were ether accused of being a witch or executed because they were one I have created CategoryWitches Once there are more articles about such people though I think we should make the distinction between

Again this only becomes an option if we have at least 3 people for each of the categories At the moment I am therefore looking for people to fit Executed as a witch but later found not guilty and for Accused of being a witch except Maria Holl I am also not quite sure what to do with Christine Teipel a 9 year old executed for being witch That case reads to me more like the church trying to protect sexual abuse of a child than anything But those were the Middle Ages oh well  Eptalon 1608 17 November 2007

Simple english wikipedia now has over 20k articles and has been featured as on the bottom of en wikis home page as a wiki with over 20k articles As of now we have already launched a very good article process has we have 26 VGA articles But as this wiki continues to grow has we have been getting more users joining from time to time our articles should be classified on an assessment scale as en wiki does to their articles Ive proposed my version of the assessment scale which is based from the en wiki counterpart 

If other editors agree with this proposal of the assessment scale Ill be willing to create WikipediaAssessment scale  Snake311 2219 23 November 2007

I think that classifying articles into different categories based on how complete or well written the article is is a good idea There are however some problems that I can see with it

SO in short yes it is a good idea but dont do it now Our project is not big enough for it yet  Eptalon 1305 25 November 2007

Ive noticed a problem with all the Harry Potter articles and I dont know what to do Ive tried reverting it but I cant get it back far enough and all the other articles have the same problem There are too many that are linked to it and have been changed Earlier in the summer I found that these articles were nicely written and had plenty of information I copied all of ones possible into a word document I noticed a change after the new book came out though people edited more and more Normally it was small things I didnt return until recently I see that people have gone so far as to put their art onto it instead of actual canon photos That was bad enough but now Ive found someone has taken all the information off and replaced it with some very rude sayings like HP is bitchen or even as far as Dumbldores Gay As I mentioned before I reverted it but there are so many other related links that have been changed to this that even an A seventh grader cant change them all In any case I would like to get back to what I was starting at the removal of information you know is true These pages are now much shorter When I was looking for the right page to revert to I found one with a comment at the bottom saying that it had no information that it could be short and sweet but needs to tell you something I found this very true what I have read on these pages is very little information because someone wiped it clean but what is left is very choppy writing and seems to be written by a two year old I would just like help in repairing wikipedia which I used to find very informative until what I assume is the same person is changing so many articles and making Wikipedia a very unpleasant website All I ask is for Help because Im just a seventh grader I dont know what to do I can repair the Harry Potter articles but I cant do them all please help me in reverting all the pages that have been turned into very un humorous jokes

Every article with tlstub tag on it is categorized to CategoryStubs Apparently we have no plan in using this category Also as long as there is only one stub template articles marked by it can be just as easily found using SpecialWhatlinkshereTemplateStubs as they can be found using such a category

On the other hand there is a disadvantage of tlstub being a categorizing template Many new articles are marked as stub before being added to any subjective category This causes them not to appear in the list of uncategorized pages Although there are ways to find them I think this is pointless

So I propose changing tlstub tempalte so it would no longer add articles to any category Later when we really had plans about managing stubs we can readd the category code again

What do you think  Huji reply 1912 28 November 2007

I think in a way tlstub should behave like tluncat giving category needed but only if no other category is present Leaving out the category stubs is probably the fastest thing to do The other approach would be to try to broadly classify stubs but again that would need some planning  Eptalon 0958 29 November 2007

Hello  Im interested in contributing to a concise wikipedia project here in simple english I think a possible way to do it is by writing a javascript skin stripping all templates and sections save crossreferences This would make it possible to offer short simple useful articles on mobile devices which usually charge by kb or in plain browsers if somebody wants a short desk reference instead of a full size encyclopedia  If someone else is interested andor knows how to program in js please leave a message in my talk page  Regards Lwyx 1955 1 December 2007

As pointed out above it may be time perhaps for a new category I think for getting criteria we can look at our current proposed very good article process and the articles there In that way a good article is on its way of becoming a VGA I would propose to create them based on the guide for VGAs A good article must meet the following criteria from the guidleine

In that way all Very good articles and their proposals are good articles too Same delays and voting rules as for VGAs should apply We can re use that infrastructure if we decide we need a vote And of course we need to discuss how to name them and to create the appropriate templates once we decided What do you think do we have the manpowerwillingness for that  Eptalon 1830 9 December 2007

Sinope is a non spherical moon of Jupiter It was found by Seth Barnes Nicholson at Lick Observatory in 1914 and is named after Sinope of Greek mythology

Sinope did not get its present name until 1975 before then it was simply known as Jupiter IX It was sometimes called Hades between 1955 and 1975

Sinope was the farthest known moon of Jupiter until the discovery of Megaclite in 2000 The farthest moon of Jupiter now known is S2003 J 2

Sinope orbits Jupiter on a high eccentricity and high inclination retrograde orbit The orbital elements are as of January 2000 They are changing a lot due to Solar and planetary perturbations It is often believed to belong to the Pasipha group However given its mean inclination and different colour Sinope could be also an independent object captured independently unrelated to the collision and break up at the origin of the group The diagram illustrates Sinopes orbital elements in relation to other moons of the group

Sinope has an estimated diameter of 38 km The moon is red unlike Pasiphae which is grey

Its infrared spectrum is similar to D type asteroids also different from Pasiphae These dissimilarities of the physical parameters suggest a different origin from the core members of the group

A French press is a special machine used to make coffee It is easy to operate The coffee it can make is stronger than that produced by other means

A French press has a round jug This jug can be glass or clear plastic The jug has a lid and a plunger The plunger fits in the jug very well It usually has some kind of steel or plastic wire that acts as a filter Coffee is brewed by placing the coffee and water together leaving to brew for a few minutes then pushing the plunger down This puts the coffee at the bottom of the jug

The French press has different names around the world In Australia South Africa and Ireland it is known as a coffee plunger and coffee brewed in it is known as plunger coffee Its French name is cafetire piston Sometimes it is also called a melior or a Bodum In the UK the device is known as a cafetire

Because the coffee grounds are in direct contact with the brewing water coffee brewed with the French press gets more of the coffees flavour and essential oils These usually are trapped in a traditional drip brew machines paper filters French pressed coffee is often stronger and thicker than drip brewed one It also has more sediment Because the grounds remain in the drink after brewing French pressed coffee should be served quickly Over time the drink will develop a bitter taste This is because the grounds still act on the water

Coffee for use in a French press should be ground coarsely The use of a burr mill grinder gives a better grind than the whirling blade variety The ground coffee should be more coarse than that used for a drip brew coffee filter and far coarser than that used for espresso Anything other than a coarse grind will go through the press filter and into the coffee A French press can also be used instead of a tea infuser to brew loose tea

The French press is also more portable than other coffee makers Special versions for travellers also exist They are made of tough plastic instead of glass They also have a sealed lid with a closable drinking hole Some versions are marketed to hikers and backpackers These people often do not want to carry a heavy metal percolator or a filter using drip brew

Despite the name the French press is not noticeably more popular in France than in other countries In most French households coffee is prepared by drip brewing with an electric coffeemaker and paper filters In bars and restaurants an espresso machine is used 

Some studies have found that drinking large amounts of coffee made by the French press method increases LDL cholesterol levels while drinking filtered or drip coffee does not  The French press method allows certain Diterpenes such as Cafestol and Kahweol to remain in the coffee while other brewing methods either remove or limit these chemicals 

 ImageCafetiere press uppngFrench Press in the starting position The press contains water and ground coffee The ground coffee has been left in the press for a certain amount of time usually a few minutes ImageCafetiere press downpngPushing the handle down will separate the ground coffee from the water ImageCafetiere pour outpngOnce the water is separated the freshly made coffee can be poured into cups 

Ananke is a retrograde non spherical moon of Jupiter It was found by Seth Barnes Nicholson at Mount Wilson Observatory in 1951 and is named after the mythological Ananke the mother of Adrastea by Jupiter The adjectival form of the name is Anankean

Ananke did not get its present name until 1975 before then it was simply known as Jupiter XII It was sometimes called Adrastea between 1955 and 1975 Note that Adrastea is now the name of another moon of Jupiter

Ananke gives its name to the Ananke group retrograde non spherical moons which orbit Jupiter between 19300000 and 22700000 km at inclinations of about 150

Ananke orbits Jupiter on a high eccentricity and high inclination retrograde orbit Eight non spherical moons found since 2000 follow similar orbitsThe orbital elements are as of January 2000 They are changing a lot due to Solar and planetary perturbations The diagram illustrates Anankes orbit in relation to other retrograde non spherical moons of Jupiter The eccentricity of selected orbits is represented by the yellow segments The farthest spherical moon Callisto is located for reference

Given these orbital elements and the physical characteristics known so far Ananke is thought to be the biggest remnant of an original break up forming the Ananke group

In the visible spectrum Ananke appears grey to light red 

The infrared spectrum is similar to P type asteroids but with a possible indication of water

A grind of a blade is the cross section of the blade It also means to finely grate something like coffee beans The word also applies to skateboarding a grind is a trick on a skateboardThis can also refer to grinding your teeth together or grinding your nuts to a piece of sandpaper

Camptosaurus was a plant eater from the Upper Jurassic that looked a lot like Iguanodon

Carme is a retrograde non spherical moon of Jupiter It was found by Seth Barnes Nicholson at Mount Wilson Observatory in California in July 1938 It is named after the mythological Carme mother by Zeus of Britomartis a Cretan goddess

Carme did not get its present name until 1975 before then it was simply known as Jupiter XI It was sometimes called Pan between 1955 and 1975 Note that Pan is now the name of a moon of Saturn

It gives its name to the Carme group made up of non spherical retrograde moons orbiting Jupiter at a distance ranging between 23000000 and 24000000 km and at an inclination of about 165 Its orbital elements are as of January 2000 They are changing a lot due to Solar and planetary perturbations

Leda or Jupiter XIII is a prograde non spherical moon of Jupiter It was found by Charles T Kowal at the Mount Palomar Observatory on September 14 1974 after three nights worth of photographic plates had been taken It was named after Leda who was a lover of Zeus the Greek equivalent of Jupiter Kowal suggested the name and the IAU supported it in 1975

Leda belongs to the Himalia group five moons orbiting between 11000000 and 13000000 km from Jupiter at an inclination of about 275 The orbital elements given here are as of January 2000 but they are changing a lot due to Solar and planetary perturbations

Lysithea is a prograde non spherical moon of Jupiter It was found by Seth Barnes Nicholson in 1938 at Mount Wilson Observatory and is named after the mythological Lysithea daughter of Oceanus and one of Zeus lovers

Lysithea did not get its present name until 1975 before then it was simply known as Jupiter X It was sometimes called Demeter from 1955 to 1975

It belongs to the Himalia group five moons orbiting between 11000000 and 13000000 km from Jupiter at an inclination of about 283 Its orbital elements are as of January 2000 They are changing a lot due to Solar and planetary perturbations

A terabyte is a unit of measurement in computers and similar electronic devices Terabytes hold 1000 gigabytes or a trillion bytes and 1000 terabytes make one petabyte 

Large organisations use terabytes of storage to hold massive amounts of data People at home probably do not use terabytes they would use gigabytes megabytes and occasionally kilobytes However in the future terabytes of storage will probably be more common in home usage In fact according to this page on the Apple website 2008 Apple iMac computers can be ordered with 1 TB hard drives An external hard drive can be several terabytes Usually one terabyte of space costs between 100 and 150

One thousand terabytes make one petabyte

Piltdown Man was once thought to be a missing link between man and ape The first Piltdown fragments were discovered in 1912 Thereafter over 500 scientific essays were written on the Piltdown Man in a 40 year period The discovery was proven to be a deliberate hoax in 1953

Piltdown Man consisted of two human skulls an orangutan jaw an elephant molar a hippopotamus tooth and a canine tooth from a chimpanzee Sir Kenneth Oakley has determined the human skulls to be approximately 620 years old They may have belonged to Ona Indians from Patagonia as the skulls were unusually thick Thick skulls are a common trait among Ona Indians The orangutan jaw is around 500 years old perhaps from Sarawak The elephant molar is thought to be from Tunisia The hippopotamus tooth is thought to have come from Malta or perhaps Sicily The canine tooth belonged to a Pleistocene Chimpanzee The Piltdown remains were purposefully scattered around a quarry in Piltdown England so that they could be discovered later as evidence for evolution and the development of man from ape The skulls had been treated with acid All of the fossil remains were stained with an iron sulfate solution The canine tooth was painted brown and patched with bubble gum The molars were filed down The portion of the orangutan jaw that connected the jaw to its skull was carefully broken so as not to show evidence that this jaw did not belong to a human skull

The Piltdown Man hoax is thought to have been perpetrated by Charles Dawson an archaeologist geologist and fossil collector for the British Museum However no one is quite certain who was involved There are a number of other suspects including Sir Arthur Smith Woodward Keeper of the British Museums Natural History department and Pierre Teilhard de Chardin a paleontologist and Jesuit theologian

Violet Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire were enjoying a day at Briny Beach Mr Poe a banker and friend of the family went to the beach to them that their parents had died in a fire which also destroyed their home Mr Poe is the executor of the Baudelaire fortune It is his responsibility to put the children with a guardian and take care of their money until Violet turns eighteen

The Baudelaire children were taken to their new guardian Count Olaf Olaf is a distant relative of the children He works as an actor On their way they met Justice Strauss Strauss is a kind and friendly judge who lives in the house next to them She tells the children that they are welcome in her home anytime which has a library in it Count Olaf is a very cruel filthy man He has one long eyebrow and a strange tattoo of an eye on his left ankle Olaf lives in a dirty broken wikt linkmustymusty house Most importantly he only adopted the children to get their money He constantly made them do chores and other things while only giving them with one bed to sleep in Count Olaf also refers them as orphans instead of children

Olafs theatre troupe was coming to his house that night to practice Olaf told the children that they had to make dinner for everyone There was no food in the house so the children went to the marketplace with Justice Strauss to buy the ingredients for Pasta Puttanesca Count Olaf complained that he wanted roast beef but he had never told them this He became very mad and hit Klaus across the face The children went to Mr Poe at his bank in order to get help Mr Poe told them that Olaf may raise them however he wants He then called Olaf to tell him of the Baudelaires visit When they got back to their home Olaf told the children that he was sorry He also told them that they would be in an upcoming play called The Marvelous Marriage written by Al Funcoot Olaf would play the groom Violet would be the bride and Klaus and Sunny would be people in the audience

The children spent the day at Justice Strausss home While Violet and Sunny were helping in the garden Klaus was reading law books in the library He took a book on nuptial law out of the library with him when they return home Klaus spent the entire night reading about how they could stop Count Olafs plan to get their money He learned that two people can be married if they sign a document and say their wedding vows in the presence of a legal judge Olaf planned to marry Violet during the play to get control of the money When Klaus talked to Count Olaf about this he only smiled and laughed Klaus ran to wake up his sisters but Sunny was not there Violet and Klaus followed Olaf outside They learned that Sunny was being held inside a birdcage at the top of the tower

Count Olaf told them that one of his henchmen had kidnapped Sunny while they were sleeping He warned them that if they did not do what he told them to do during the play the cage will be released and Sunny would fall to her death That night Violet made a grappling hook to reach the top of the tower but she was kept captive with Klaus until the play began

The play was performed Olaf stopped it after the wedding scene to say that he and Violet were now married Justice Strauss said that Violet could not marry because she was not old enough Olaf said that she could be married if her parent or guardian allowed it As her guardian he allowed to get married Sunny was returned to them Violet said that she was right handed but signed the document with her left hand Judge Strauss said that this made the marriage not legal Olaf escaped when one of his henchmen turned off the theaters lights Just as Violet was about to turn the lights back on Olaf quietly said that he would always be after them and that when he got their fortune he would kill them with his own hands Justice Strauss was willing to adopt the Baudelaires but Mr Poe told her that their parents will said a relative must care for them They got into Mr Poes car and it drove away as Justice Strauss waved goodbye

Count Olaf is the principal villain from Lemony Snickets A Series of Unfortunate Events His main goal throughout the series is to inherit or steal the Baudelaire fortune He attempts numerous acts to try to get that fortune such as trying to marry Violet kidnap Sunny and trip Klaus to have him fall and break his glasses etc He has a tattoo of an eye on his ankle

Warhammer 40000 also called 40K is a table top game in which model armies fight against each other on miniature terrain It is played using dice to decide what happens and a ruler to tell how far a unit moves

Each army has many types of weaponry Each type has different strengths and armor piercing value There are also different types of units in each army All units have different statistics which the players use to their advantage when playing

Two or more players are needed for a game Each player takes it in turns to move shoot then assault Each unit has a rating for ballistic skill weapon skill strength toughness wounds initiative leadership and armor save skill

The armies include Necrons Tyranids Space Marines Chaos Space Marines Eldar Dark Eldar Tau Orks Witchunters Daemonhunters and Imperial Guard

The Necrons are the greatest race in the galaxy Nothing will destroy them and in the end they shall win over everything Necrons are mysterious silent and skeleton like warriors who are enslaved to the ancient star gods called the Ctan

60 Million years ago they were a living race called the Necrontyr who were cursed with a cancer which made all of their lives really short They got jealous of a race called the Old Ones who could live for a very long time but the Necrontyr had better technology Then they discovered the Star Gods The first one they managed to contact is called The Nightbringer The Nightbringer Started eating all of the Necrontyrs souls The Necrontyr grew fearful but managed to make The Nightbringer believe that other races existed They offered to give The Nightbringer a physical Living Metal body Then they managed to find other Ctan who were less hungry After a while a Ctan called The Deceiver convinced the Necrontyr to make themselves bodies made out of living metal Most of them accepted But what they did not know is that they were tricked most of them lost their souls and memories and become slaves to the Ctan The Ctan used them to Harvest all the other races that existed around that time to feed the Ctan Then the Deceiver convinced the other Ctan that they tasted really good and all of the Ctan started eating each other After a while only 4 Remained The Nightbringer The Deceiver The Outsider and The Void Dragon Eventually they realized they were losing the war with the Old Ones and all the other Races and escaped to Tombs Worlds places where no life exists they then went to sleep60 Million years later they have begun to awaken

Necrons have powerful technology and armour their armour and weaponry is made from something called Living Metal which can change and shape its form allowing it to fix itself The Necrons are one of most ancient races in the Warhammer 40000 universe They can be compared to traditional Undead such as vampires skeletons and zombies They are most likely based on the robots in the Terminator movies

In the storyline the Tyranids are merciless predators from another galaxy They completely eat whole planets before moving on Tyranids can be compared to the Alien in Ridley Scotts Alien movies

The Space Marines are an army of super humans They were genetically changed to defend humanity in the Warhammer 40000 universe There are lots of different groups of Space Marines These groups are called chapters All of the chapters are separate from each other Each chapter has 1000 soldiers in it and its own uniform history and equipment Some chapters have special rules in the game and types of soldier that only they can use Chapters get and train their own recruits separately The Space Marine in charge of each chapter is called the Chapter Master

A lot of Space Marine equipment is very old and very holy Mostly No one knows in the Imperium apart from parts of the Cult of the Machine God how to make any more of some things they use like the powerful Dreadnought armour which is why the space marines send off mechanicly gifed Space marines to the Adputus Mechanicus to train in order to become an elite of the machine god and in battle they repair and recover such things as their Rhino Troop Carriers or their other tanks Space Marines wear special suits of armour often holy called power armour to help them fight better All Space Marines are genetically engineered to be very strong and tough much more than most people They can live for a very long time and have an extra heart and an extra set of lungs They are also trained to be very brave and religious as well as being trained to be good at shooting and fighting Some Space Marines have psychic powers  these are called Librarians in most chapters they can have powers such as in the case of one from the Dark Angles Chapter shoot what appears to be flamethrower blasts from his eyes and mouth There are also Space Marines who act like priests called Chaplains who forward the worship of the God Emperor of Man

A Space Marine army generally includes

Chaos Space Marines are one of the coolest races They must kill everything and let the galaxies burn They are Space Marines who went evil 10000 years ago Their leader the warmaster Horus decided that he was stronger and more just than the Emperor and they had a great war the Horus Heresy that destroyed many planets Horus nearly won but the Emperor was stronger In the end Horus was killed by the Emperors sacrifice and the Space Marines that had followed him went to the Eye of Terror where they still live Chaos Marines look extremely different to regular Space Marines and often have spiky protrusions skulls and mutations They also have special units that are dedicated to their gods and are useful in different roles Daemons are evil spirits of Chaos that have come into our universe to destroy stuff Depending on which God they serve they can look and play very different  Khorne the blood God has vicious and fighters Who Prefer to Hack Stuff up with large Swords and Axes while Tzeentch the Magic God has Demons looking like some sort of constantly changing mess of body parts that can shoot magical fire Nurgle the Plague God has really tough demons which mostly look like one horned zombies and Slannesh the God of Sin drugs and plesure has really fast demons which look like barely dressed women theye also have rending claws that are great for piarsing armoure

Mitte was the most central locality of Berlin It was set up in 1920 when Gro Berlin was set up and in 2001 it was joined with Wedding and Tiergarten to make a new borough called Bezirk Mitte

Mitte was in East Berlin and had a lot of Berlins historic sites The Pergamon Museum Unter den Linden and the Brandenburg Gate were in Mitte

In 2001 Mitte was joined with two boroughs from West Berlin This helped to break down the idea of a divided city and put the important tourist centre of Berlin under one local government

Gro Berlin or Greater Berlin was created by an act of the Prussian parliament made on 27 April 1920 The act was called the Greater Berlin Act for short Its full name was the Law Regarding the Reconstruction of the New Local Authority of Berlin

The act said that on 1 October 1920 Greater Berlin should be taken away from the Province of Brandenburg and become a new district

The new district was made up of

The new Berlin was 13 times bigger than the old Its area went from convert66km2sqmi1abbronlkon to convert883km2sqmi1abbronlkon and the population doubled from approximately 19 million to near 4 million with almost 12 million of these new inhabitants coming from the 7 surrounding towns alone

Gro Berlin was divided into 20 boroughs

Apart from minor changes the city boundary defined in the law is the same as today except for some changes made during the time of the Berlin Wall During the 1970s and 1980s three new boroughs were made in East Berlin when other boroughs were split up

A Pardon is what a President or other important political person gives to someone who has been put in jail or taken to court Whoever gets this pardon is free and not guilty anymore 

Usually Presidents give these right when they are about to leave and cannot be elected again because sometimes people get very angry at the President for pardoning criminals

Elara is a non spherical moon of Jupiter It was found by Charles Dillon Perrine at Lick Observatory in 1905 and is named after the mother by Zeus of the giant Tityus

Elara did not get its present name until 1975 before then it was simply known as Jupiter VII It was sometimes called Hera between 1955 and 1975

Elara belongs to the Himalia group five moons orbiting between 11000000 and 13000000 km from Jupiter at an inclination of about 275 Its orbital elements are as of January 2000 They are changing a lot due to Solar and planetary perturbations

In February and March 2007 the New Horizons spacecraft to Pluto made a number of pictures of Elara culminating in photos from a distance of five million miles

Pterodaustro was a pterosaur It is found in the Lower Cretaceous of South America Pterodaustro most likely fed on tiny invertebrates zooplankton and krill 

Pterodaustro was medium sized having a wing span about two meters in length and having only been found in Brazil

Pterodaustro probably waded in shallow water like flamingos straining food with its tooth comb a method called filter feeding Once it caught its food Pterodaustro probably mashed it with the small globular teeth present in its upper jaw

At least two specimens have been found with gizzard stones in the stomach cavity the first ever reported for any pterosaur These clusters of small stones with angled edges support the idea that Pterodaustro ate mainly small hard shelled aquatic crustaceans using filter feeding Such invertebrates are abundant in the sediment of the fossil site

In 2004 a Pterodaustro embryo in an egg was reported The egg was elongated six centimetres long and 22 millimetres across and its mainly flexible shell was covered with a thin layer 03 mm thick of calcite

Comparisons between the scleral rings of Pterodaustro and modern birds and reptiles suggest that it may have been nocturnal and may have had similar activity patterns to modern ducks feed at night

Dsungaripterus was a pterosaur with a wingspan of 10 feet It had an unusual bony crest running along its snout and long narrow curved jaws with a pointed tip The crest may have acted as a rudder when flying or may have been a sexual characteristic 

Dsungaripteruss head and neck were together almost a metre long Its most notable feature are its long narrow upcurved jaws with a pointed tip making the animal look like a pair of flying tweezers It had no teeth in the front part of its jaws which were probably used to remove shellfish and worms from cracks in rocks or from sandy muddy beaches It had knobbly flat teeth more to the back of the jaw that were well suited for crushing shellfish

Himalia is the biggest non spherical moon of Jupiter It was found by Charles Dillon Perrine at the Lick Observatory on December 3 1904 and is named after the nymph Himalia who bore three sons of Zeus

Himalia did not get its present name until 1975 before then it was simply known as Jupiter VI or Jupiter Satellite VI although calls for a full name appeared shortly after its and Elaras discovery ACD Crommelin wrote in 1905 Unfortunately the numeration of Jupiters satellites is now in precisely the same confusion as that of Saturns system was before the numbers were abandoned and names substituted A similar course would seem to be advisable here the designation V for the inner satellite was tolerated for a time as it was considered to be in a class by itself but it has now got companions so that this subterfuge disappears The substitution of names for numerals is certainly more poetic

The moon was sometimes called Hestia after the Greek goddess from 1955 to 1975

It is the biggest member of the group that bears its name the moons orbiting between 114 and 13 million kilometers from Jupiter at an inclination of about 275 The orbital elements are as of January 2000 They are changing a lot due to Solar and planetary perturbations

Himalia appears grey like the other members of its group similar to a C type asteroid Measurements by Cassini confirm a featureless spectrum with a slight absorption at 3 m which could indicate the presence of water

In November 2000 the Cassini spacecraft going to Saturn made a number of pictures of Himalia including photos from a distance as close as 44 million km The moon covers only a few pixels but seems to be a stretched object with axes 150 20 and 120 20 km close to the Earth based estimations

In February and March 2007 the New Horizons spacecraft to Pluto made a series of pictures of Himalia culminating in photos from a distance of eight million km Again Himalia appears only a few pixels across

Brachychiton is a genus of 31 species of trees and large shrubs They grow naturally in Australia and New Guinea Fossils from New South Wales and New Zealand are believed to be 50 million years old The name Brachychiton is comes from the Greek brachys meaning short and chiton meaning tunic This refers to its loose seed coverings

They grow to 430m tall All species have separate male and female flowers on the same plant The female flowers have five separate carpels that can each form a woody fruit that has several seeds

Thebe or Jupiter XIV is the fourth of Jupiters known moons It was found by Stephen P Synnott in images from the Voyager 1 space probe taken on March 5 1979 and was given the designation S1979 J 2 Later it was found on images dating back to February 27 1979 In 1983 it was officially named after the mythological nymph Thebe who was the daughter of the river god Asopus and a lover of Zeus

Thebe is the farthest of the inner Jovian moons It orbits Jupiter at a distance of 222000 km The orbit of Thebe has an eccentricity of 0018 and an inclination of 108 relative to the equator of Jupiter These values are unusually high for a closer moon and can be explained by the past influence of the closest Galilean satellite Io in the past several mean motion resonances with Io would have passed through Thebes orbit as Io gradually moved away from Jupiter and these excited Thebes orbit

Thebe is not a sphere with the closest ellipsoidal approximation being 116x98x84 km Its bulk density and mass are not known but assuming that it mean density is like that of Amalthea its mass can be estimated at 431017 kg

The surface of Thebe is dark and appears to be reddish in color

Thebe was found in Voyager 1 images by Steve Synnott a member of the Voyager navigation team However before the Galileo spacecraft arrived at Jupiter little was known about it Galileo imaged almost all of the surface of Thebe and put constraints on its composition

An antagonist is the character in a story whom has evil intent The antagonist is the opposing character to a protagonist which are the characters that have good intent Antagonists normally have reasoning for committing acts of evil Though it is rare it is possible for an antagonist to be an evil doer committing acts of which a protagonist might through acts which may seem evil which throw off most readers and characters of a story

Some examples of main antagonists are

A secondary antagonist is an evil doer who serves to a main antagonist

It should be noted that it is possible for a protagonist to become an antagonist A prominent example of this was when Anakin Skywalker had turned from a Jedi to a Sith namely becoming Darth Vader

Joe Grant was a famous American animator writer and illustrator He worked for Walt Disney the first time between 1933 and 1949 and the second time from 1989 until his death just a few days before his 97th birthday

Joe Grant was born at 1908 in New York City After school he began his career as a caricaturist In 1933 he was hired by Disney for the Mickey Mouse short movie Mickeys Gala Premiere In the next years he was together with Albert Hurter Dick Huemer and Fred Moore the studios most important character animator He created the which in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and with Dick Huemer the book for Fantasia and Dumbo Later he was the head of the Character Animation Department at Disney This department was closed in 1949 and Grant left Disney

40 years later in 1989 Joe Grant was back For Disneys Beauty and the Beast he created again characters and sketches The movie was the first animation film which was nominated for the Academy Awards Best Picture In 1992 Joe Grants wife Jenny died To be in action after the death of his wife he did not left Disney In 1999 he was the only person who worked on Fantasia and Fantasia 2000

In 2005 his animation short movie Lorenzo was nominated for an Academy Award Just a few weeks later Joe Grant died while working with his drawing board at the age of 96 in Glendale California

Galileo Galilei discovered this moon in 1610 Simon Marius suggested the name Ganymede soon after In Greek mythology Ganymede was Zeus cup bearer This name and the names of the other Galilean satellites was not favoured for a long time and were not put into common use until the mid 20th century Instead it is simply referred to by its Roman numeral designation as Jupiter III or as the third satellite of Jupiter Ganymede is the only Galilean moon of Jupiter named after a male figure

Callisto is a moon of the planet Jupiter discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei It is the second largest moon orbiting Jupiter after Ganymede and the third largest moon in the Solar System Callisto is almost the same size as the planet Mercury being 99 the diameter of the planet but is much less massive Of the four Galilean moons of Jupiter Callisto is the farthest with an orbital radius of about 1880000 kilometres It does not form part of the orbital resonance that affects three inner Galilean satellites Io Europa and Ganymede Like the Earths Moon Callisto rotates synchronously with its orbital period This means that one side is always turned toward Jupiter while the other side never sees the face of the planet Callistos surface is less affected by Jupiters magnetosphere than the other inner satellites because it orbits farther away

Callisto is composed of approximately equal amounts of rock and ices with an average density of about 183 gcm Compounds on the surface include water ice carbon dioxide silicates and organics The Galileo spacecraft made investigations of the moon and revealed that Callisto may have a small silicate core and possibly a subsurface ocean of liquid water more than 100 kilometers deep

The surface of Callisto is heavily cratered and extremely old The surface does not show any sign of processes occurring below the surface such as plate tectonics earthquakes or volcanoes and is thought to have evolved mainly under the influence of meteorite impacts Notable surface features include multi ring structures impact craters in different shapes and chains of craters and associated scarps ridges and deposits On a smaller scale the surface is diverse and is made up of small bright frost deposits at around hill tops surrounded by a smooth blanket of dark material in valleys This is thought to result from the degradation of small landforms caused through sublimation which is supported by the general lack of small impact craters and the presence of numerous small knobs considered to be their remains The absolute ages of the landforms are not known 

Callisto is surrounded by an extremely thin atmosphere made out of carbon dioxide and probably molecular oxygen as well as by a rather intense ionosphere An ocean is thought to exist within Callisto This may mean that life might exist However this is less likely than on nearby Europa Various space probes from Pioneers 1011 to Galileo and Cassini have studied the moon Callisto has long been considered the most suitable place for humans to settle for future exploration of the Jovian system

The Margraviate of Baden was made in 1112 From 1190 to 1771 Baden was broken up into different smaller states When the Holy Roman Empire ended in 1806 the Margraviate of Baden became the larger and more powerful Grand Duchy of Baden After World War I ended in 1918 the monarchy in Baden ended so Baden became a republic 

After World War II ended in 1945 Baden was cut in half the north half became part of Wrttemberg Baden and the south half became South Baden South Baden changed its name to Baden in 1947 Baden was one of the original states of the Federal Republic of Germany In 1952 it joined with Wrttemberg Baden and Wrttemberg Hohenzollern to make the state of Baden Wrttemberg

Color or colour is a property of light as seen by people This word is written as color in American English and colour in British English Each colour has a different wavelength Some colords can be observed in 3d cartesian space operating the differential function

The most common colour names are 

Primary colours can be mixed to make the other colours Red yellow and blue are the three traditional primary colours The primary colours for television screens and computer monitors are red green and blue Printers use magenta yellow and cyan as their primary colours they also use black

People who can not see colours or have a distorted sense of colour are called colour blind Most colour blind people are male 

Colours are sometimes added to food Food colouring is used to colour food but some foods have natural colourings like beta carotene

When something has no colour it is transparent An example is air 

A translucent material is not the same as a colourless material because it can still have a colour like stained glass

Gopher is a protocol It is used to index and search for documents on the Internet It was designed to be used as a form of anonymous FTP It is what came before the World Wide Web

The gopher protocol has some things HTTP based clients do not have It is based on menus An item selected from a menu will either open another menu or a document 

Because of licensing fees and because the World Wide Web was easier to use the protocol did not fly There are less than 100 gopher servers left Most of them are run by universities Most of them are rarely updated except for the ones run by enthusiasts of the protocol A handful of new servers are set up every year by hobbyists  25 have been set up and added to Floodgaps list since 1999 and possibly some more that have not been added Today Gopher exists as an almost forgotten corner of the internet  one can publish email addresses in plaintext without having to worry about spam and publish large amounts of data without the risk of the servers bandwidth becoming saturated while at the same time people do still browse the gopher servers regularly

Some have suggested that the simple interface of Gopher would be a good match for mobile phones and Personal digital assistants but so far the Web fixated market prefers Wireless Markup LanguageWireless Application Protocol DoCoMo i mode XHTML Basic or other adaptations of HTML and XML The PyGopherd server however provides a built in WML front end to Gopher sites served with it

The inner moons of Jupiter are four small moons that orbit close to Jupiter These moons are closely interconnected with Jupiters rings and serve as both sources and sinks of the rings material Their semi major axes range between 128000 and 222000 km

The members of the group are

Metis and Adrastea each orbit Jupiter in less than one Jovian day Phobos a moon of Mars is the only other moon known to orbit its planet in less than the length of that planets day

The Galilean moons are the four satellites of Jupiter found by Galileo Galilei They are by far the biggest of the many moons of Jupiter

Galileo Galilei found what came to be known as the Galilean moons around December 1609 or January 1610 As a result of improvements he made to the telescope Galileo was able to see celestial bodies better than ever before in human history Using his improved telescope Galileo was the first to see four moons of Jupiter 

On January 7 1610 Galileo wrote a letter containing the first mention of Jupiters moons At the time he only saw three of them and he believed them to be fixed stars near Jupiter He continued to look at them from January 8 through March 2 In these observations he found a fourth body and also observed that the four were not fixed stars but rather were orbiting Jupiter

Galileos discovery proved the importance of the telescope as a tool for astronomers It showed there were objects in space to be found which were not seen by the naked eye More importantly the discovery of celestial bodies orbiting something other than the Earth dealt a blow to the then accepted Ptolemaic world system This held that the Earth was at the center of the universe and all other celestial bodies revolved around it That Jupiter has four moons while Earth has only one further undercut the near universal belief that the Earth was the center of the universe both in position and in importance Galileos Sidereus Nuncius which announced celestial observations through his telescope does not mention Copernican heliocentrism a theory that placed the Sun at the center of the universe Nevertheless Galileo believed in the Copernican theory

Galileo also developed a method of determining longitude based on the timing of the orbits of the Galilean moons

A Chinese historian of astronomy claims that Chinese astronomer Gan De observed one of Jupiters moons in 362 BC but without a telescope it is difficult to see how this was done

Galileo called his discovery the Cosmica Sidera in honour of Cosimo II de Medici grand duke of Tuscany whose patronage he wanted At the grand dukes suggestion Galileo changed the name to Medicea Sidera honouring all four Medici brothers The discovery was announced in the Sidereus Nuncius published in Venice in March 1610 less than two months after the first observations

Other names put forward but the names which eventually prevailed were chosen by Simon Marius Marius claimed to have found the moons at the same time as Galileo he named them after lovers of the god Zeus Io Europa Ganymede and Callisto in his Mundus Jovialis published in 1614

Galileo refused to use Mariuss names and invented the numbering scheme that is still used nowadays in parallel with proper moon names The numbers run from Jupiter outward thus I II III and IV for Io Europa Ganymede and Callisto respectively Galileo used this system in his notebooks but never actually published it

The Galilean moons are in order from closest to Jupiter to farthest away

All four Galilean moons are bright enough that they could if they were farther away from Jupiter be seen without a telescope They have apparent magnitudes between 46 and 56 when Jupiter is in opposition with the Sun and about one unit of magnitude dimmer when Jupiter is in conjunction The main thing that is hard in observing them is due to the fact that they are very close to Jupiter and are masked by its brightness Their maximum angular separations from Jupiter are between 2 and 8 minutes of arc close to the limit of human visual acuity Ganymede and Callisto at their maximum separation are the likeliest targets for possible naked eye observation The easiest way to observe them is to cover Jupiter with an object eg a tree limb or a power line that is perpendicular to the plane of moons orbits

A Passion cantata is a cantata The cantata takes its theme from the Passion of Jesus Christ in other words his suffering until his death at the cross Larger cantatas with this theme are known as oratorios

Today most of them are performed in the week before Easter

In the English repertoire the two classics are The Crucifixion by Sir John Stainer and Olivet to Calvary by John Henry Maunder Other works include Sir Arthur Somervells The Passion of Christ Charles Woods St Mark Passion and Eric Thimans The Last Supper

The most famous Passion cantatas are probably the two composed by Johann Sebastian Bach the St John Passion and the St Matthew Passion A t first it was believed St Luke Passion was also written by him Now it is thought that he simply rearranged an earlier work

One notable work in Latin is Arvo Prts Passio Domini Nostri Jesu Christi secundum Joannem of 1982

The Himalia group is a group of prograde non spherical moons of Jupiter that follow similar orbits to Himalia and are thought to have a common origin

The known members of the group are

The objects in the Himalia group have semi major axes in the range of 11150000 and 11750000 km inclinations between 266 and 283 and eccentricities of between 011 and 025 All moons in the group are grey similar to C type asteroids It has been suggested that the group could be a remnant of the break up of an asteroid from the main asteroid belt The radius of the parent asteroid was probably about 89 km only a bit bigger than that of Himalia which retains approximately 87 of the mass of the original body This indicates the asteroid was not heavily disturbed

SOS is a Morse code It is used as distress code to signal danger It was introduced by the German government in radio regulations on April 1 1905 It became the worldwide standard when it was included in the second International Radiotelegraphic Convention which was signed on November 3 1906 The convention became effective on July 1 1908

From the beginning the SOS distress signal has actually been a continuous sequence of three ditsthree dahsthree dits all run together without letter spacing In International Morse Code three dits form the letter S and three dahs make the letter O so SOS became an easy way to remember the correct order of the dits and dahs In modern terminology SOS is a procedural signal or prosign and the formal way to write it is with a bar above the letters It should be written SOS

In popular usage SOS became associated with phrases such as Save Our Souls Save our Ship Save Our Shelby Shoot Our Ship Sinking Our Ship Survivors On Shore and others It is mostly known by Save Our Ship However these phrases were a later development most likely used to help remember the correct letterssomething known as a backronym

Many songs have been made of the distress signal SOS such as Message in a Bottle by The Police SOS by ABBA SOS by Rihanna SOS by The Jonas Brothers Stranger by Gamma and SOS by Ola Svensson

Before radio communication was developed in the early 1890s seagoing ships had already adopted many different visual and audio distress signals They used such things as semaphore flags signal flares bells and foghorns In the beginning radio was called wireless telegraphy It used Morse code the dit and dah system originally developed for landline telegraphyWhen radio communication was made available to ships there was a need for standardized communication Cooperation was somewhat limited by national differences and rivalries between different radio companies

The first International Radiotelegraphic Conference was held in Berlin Germany in 1903 At the time Captain Quintino Bonomo an Italian representative discussed the need for common operating procedures He also had the suggestion that ships in distress should send the signal SSS DDD at intervals of a few minutes according to The Wireless Telegraph Conference in the November 27 1903 issue of The Electrician Question on how to do things were beyond the scope of the 1903 Conference Although Article IV of the Conferences Final Protocol signed August 13 1903 said that Wireless telegraph stations should unless practically impossible give priority to calls for help received from ships at sea no standard signal was adopted at the time

Because there were no international regulations each ship was left to develop its own practices For example in 1905 the crew of a sinking lightship off Nantucket transmitted the word HELP to call for rescue Perhaps the first international radio distress call adopted was CQD This was announced on January 7 1904 by Circular 57 of the Marconi International Marine Communication Company It became effective for Marconi installations on February 1 1904 Another suggestion appeared in the 1906 edition of S S Robisons Manual of Wireless Telegraphy for the Use of Naval Electricians published for use by the United States Navy This stated that the standard visual flag signals known as the International Code of Signals would likely also be adopted for radio use Therefore the flag signal NC which stood for In distress want immediate assistance would also likely become the radio distress call

A third standard resulted in the creation of the SOS distress signal The German government issued a set of national radio regulations These were used from April 1 1905 They introduced three new Morse code sequences including the SOS distress signal

SOS was developed from the general German radio call SOE with the 3 dits of a S easier to hear in static than the one dit of an E The string has no other meaning It was also selected because it is easy to recognize and can be sent rapidly Comparing SOS with the older CQD it is obvious how much simpler the new code is It would not be mistaken for CQeither CQ is the radio code for calling anyone used in casual circumstances

In 1906 the second International Radiotelegraphic Convention was held in Berlin This convention developed many Service Regulations to be added to the main agreement which was signed on November 3 1906 and became effective on July 1 1908 Article XVI of the regulations adopted Germanys Notzeichen distress signal as the international standard reading Ships in distress shall use the following signal      repeated at brief intervals The first ship to transmit an SOS distress call appears to have been the Cunard liner Slavonia on June 10 1909 according to Notable Achievements of Wireless in the September 1910 Modern Electrics However there was some resistance among the Marconi operators about adopting the new signal and as late as the April 1912 sinking of the RMS Titanic the ships Marconi operators intermixed CQD and SOS distress calls But with the need for consistency for public safety the use of CQD appears to have generally disappeared after this point

In both the April 1 1905 German law and the 1906 International regulations the distress signal was specified as a continuous Morse code sequence of three ditsthree dahsthree dits with no mention of any alphabetic equivalents However in International Morse three dits make the letter S and three dahs the letter O and it soon became common to refer to the distress signal as SOS An early report on The International Radio Telegraphic Convention in the January 12 1907 Electrical World said that Vessels in distress use the special signal SOS repeated at short intervals

In contrast to CQD which was sent as three separate letters with spaces between each letter the SOS distress call has always been transmitted as a continuous sequence of dits and dahs and not as individual letters There was no problem as long as operators were aware that SOS was technically just a convenient way for remembering the proper sequence of the distress signals total of nine dits and dahs In later years the number of special Morse symbols increased In order to designate the proper sequence of dits and dahs for a long special symbol the standard practice is to list alphabetic characters which contain the same dits and dahs in the same order with a bar atop the character sequence to indicate that there should not be any internal spaces in the transmission Thus under the modern notation the distress signal becomes SOS

SOS has also sometimes been used as a visual distress signal consisting of three shortthree longthree short light flashes or with SOS spelled out in individual letters for example stamped in a snowbank or formed out of logs on a beach The fact that SOS can be read right side up as well as upside down became important for visual recognition if viewed from above

Additional warning and distress signals were introduced after SOS On January 20 1914 the London International Convention on Safety of Life at Sea adopted the Morse code signal TTT three letter Ts spaced correctly as three letters so as not to be confused with the letter O as the Safety Signal used for messages to ships involving safety of navigation and being of an urgent character When radio transmitters that could send audio were developed there was a need for a spoken distress phrase and Mayday was adopted by the 1927 International Radio Convention as the equivalent of SOS For TTT the equivalent audio signals are Pan pan for urgency and Securite for navigational safety

During the Second World War additional codes were used to include immediate details about attacks by enemy vessels especially in the Battle of the Atlantic The signal SSS signalled attacked by submarines whilst RRR warned of an attack by a surface raider QQQ warned of an unknown raider and AAA indicated an attack by aircraft They were usually sent in conjunction with the SOS distress code All of these codes later switched from three repeats of the letter to four repeats

Naturalization is when a person changes his or her nationality Most people have the nationality of the country where they are born and grow up If they move to another country they will still keep their own nationality at first but if they stay there for many years and want to stay there for the rest of their lives they may want to change their nationality Different countries have different laws about nationalization Usually the person will have to make a promise in a court of law He will have to promise to be a good citizen and obey the countrys laws

Sometimes it is still possible for someone to keep their first nationality as well as getting a new one This is called dual nationality Sometimes children whose parents have different nationalities are allowed to have dual nationality

Someone who has been naturalized will normally have all the rights that any other person belonging to that country has

A Semaphore is an installation used to send optical signals It is also known as Optical telegraph Common system include signal towers with special installations on them or hand held flags The meaning of the signal is determined by the position of the elements for example the flags The signal can be read when it is in a stable position In modern usage it refers to signalling with a set of flags 

Signal towers came before the electric telegraph They were faster than sending out post riders with the information  ImageOptischerTelegrafjpgOptical telegraph of Claude Chappe on the Litermont near Nalbach Germany ImageSemaphorePapasvgDiagram of person holding 2 semaphore flags as letter P ImageTour du telegraphe Chappe Saverne 02JPGA Chappe semaphore tower near Saverne France ImageChappe telegrafjpgA Chappe semaphore telegraph at Louvre France

The Ananke group is a group of retrograde non spherical moons of Jupiter that follow similar orbits to Ananke and are thought to have a common origin

Their semi major axes range between 19300000 and 22700000 km their inclinations between 1457 and 1548 and their orbital eccentricities between 002 and 028

The core members include

The International Astronomical Union reserves names ending in e for all retrograde moons including this groups members

The Ananke group is believed to have been formed when an asteroid was captured by Jupiter and broken apart by a collision

Based on the sizes of the moons the original asteroid may have been about 28 km in diameter Since this value is near the approximate diameter of Ananke itself it is likely the parent body was not heavily disrupted

Three of the moons of the family display similar grey colours while Ananke itself is on the boundary between grey and light red

The Carme group is a group of retrograde non spherical moons of Jupiter that follow similar orbits to Carme and are thought to have a common origin

Their semi major axes range between 22900000 and 24100000 km their inclinations between 1649 and 1655 and their orbital eccentricities between 023 and 027

The core members include

The International Astronomical Union reserves names in e for all retrograde moons including this groups members

The Carme group may once have been a single body that was broken apart by an impact Further support to the single body origin comes from the known colours all the moons appear light red and infrared spectra similar to D type asteroids

Sir George Biddell Airy was an English mathematician and astronomer Astronomer Royal from 1835 to 1881 His many achievements include work on planetary orbits measuring the mean density of the Earth a method of solution of two dimensional problems in solid mechanics and in his role as Astronomer Royal establishing Greenwich at the location of the prime meridian His reputation has been tarnished by allegations that through his inaction Britain lost the opportunity of priority in the discovery of Neptune

The Pasipha group is a group of retrograde non spherical moons of Jupiter that follow similar orbits to Pasipha and are thought of have a common origin

Their semi major axes range between 22800000 and 24100000 km their inclinations between 1445 and 1583 and their eccentricities between 025 and 043

Core members of the group include

The International Astronomical Union reserves names ending in e for all retrograde moons including this groups members

The Pasipha group is believed to have been formed when Jupiter captured an asteroid which broke up after a collision The original asteroid was not disturbed heavily the original body is calculated to have been 60 km in diameter about the same size as Pasipha Pasipha has 99 of the original bodys mass However if Sinope belongs to the group the amount is much smaller 87

The differences of colour between the objects also suggest that the group could have a more complex origin than a single collision

The Berlin Observatory has its origins in 1700 when Gottfried Leibniz initiated the Societt der Wissenschaften which would later become the Preuischen Akademie der Wissenschaften The Society had no observatory but nevertheless had an astronomer Gottfried Kirch who observed from a private observatory in Berlin A first small observatory was furnished in 1711 financing itself through calendrical computations

Astronomer Royal is a senior post in the Royal Household of the Sovereign of the United Kingdom There are two officers the senior being the Astronomer Royal dating from June 22 1675 and the second the Astronomer Royal for Scotland which dates from 1834

King Charles II who founded the Royal Observatory Greenwich in 1675 instructed the first Astronomer Royal John Flamsteed to apply himself with the most exact care and diligence to the rectifying of the tables of the motions of the heavens and the places of the fixed stars so as to find out the so much desired longitude of places for the perfecting of the art of navigation

From that time until 1972 the Astronomer Royal was Director of the Royal Observatory Greenwich As Astronomer Royal he receives a stipend of 100 a year and is a member of the Royal Household under the general authority of the Lord Chamberlain After the separation of the two offices the position of Astronomer Royal has been largely honorary though he remains available to advise the Sovereign on astronomical and related scientific matters and the office is of great prestige

The Royal Observatory Greenwich was commissioned in 1675 by King Charles II

At this time the king also created the position of Astronomer Royal for John Flamsteed to serve as the director of the observatory

He was to apply himself with the most exact care and diligence to the rectifying of the tables of the motions of the heavens and the places of the fixed stars so as to find out the so much desired longitude of places for the perfecting of the art of navigation 

The Observatory is situated on a hill in Greenwich Park in Greenwich London overlooking the River Thames

The Greenwich Meridian runs through the site of the Observatory It is the line at which the longitude is defined as 0

Squash is a sport in which two players hit a ball with a racket The aim of the game is to beat the other player by hitting the front wall and making the ball bounce twice on the floor before they can hit their turn or for them to hit the ball out of play

The ball is made of rubber It is hollow When it is warm it bounces more Balls are marked with different coloured dots They are made to bounce at different speeds depending on the colour of the dots Balls with yellow dots are slow Balls with green or white dots are average Balls with red dots are fast

The racket is similar to a tennis racket but its lighter and smaller

Squash was played by Jahangir Khan who had dominated it for 25 years He had beat Rodney Martin from Australia 15 5 15 8 and 15 10 in the final round He can be considered the 1 squash player

Plattdtsch is a Germanic language It is known in as Low Saxon or Low German or as Plattdeutsch

Plattdtsch is spoken by about 3000000 people across northern Germany It extended from East Prussia and northern Poland across northern Germany the Netherlands Belgium and to Dunkirk in France Especially since World War II the name Low Saxon has been used in the Netherlands instead of Low German and use of the language has shrunk so that it is now only protected in Germany and the Netherlands

The European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages gives some official recognition and protection to Plattdtsch as a Regional language in Germany and the Netherlands In Germany it has the protection of the rules in part III of the Charter in the states of Bremen Hamburg Mecklenburg Western Pomerania Lower Saxony and Schleswig Holstein and the protection of part III of the charter in Brandenburg North Rhine Westphalia and Saxony Anhalt It has part II protection in the Netherlands

Some people say that Plattdtsch is not really a language at all But the European Charter does not apply to dialects only to languages and so the German government must think that the language is not just a dialect of German

Several groups of people outside Europe speak Low German

Mennonite communities use their Plautdietsch everywhere they live especially in Russia Ukraine Central Asia Germany South Africa Malaysia Indonesia Australia and the Americas There are communities in the Midwest of the United States some of them with their own dialects that developed from dialects imported from Schleswig Holstein and Lower Saxony in the 19th century Nobody knows how many people speak Low German in the United States and the language may have died out in the mid 20th century as the many German American communities were further assimilated into the English speaking United States and lost many of their traditions including using Low German and other German dialectslanguages

Alban Bergs Violin Concerto was written in 1935 It is one of the most famous concertos for the violin written in the 20th century It is also probably Bergs best known and most often performed piece

Berg was asked to write a violin concerto for the violinist Louis Krasner At the time he was working hard on his opera Lulu which took him several years to write He stopped working on the opera for four months in the summer of 1935 so that he could write the violin concerto He had probably already started the concerto when he heard the sad news of the death of a girl called Manon Gropius the daughter of Alma Mahler and Walter Gropius Berg decided to dedicate the concerto to Manon He wrote at the top of the work To the memory of an angel

When Berg died on 24 December 1935 he had not finished Lulu It is possible he might have finished it if he had not spent time writing the violin concerto The work was first performed after the composers death with Krasner playing the solo part on 19 April 1936 in Barcelona

The instruments in the orchestra for the Violin Concerto are 2 flutes 2 oboes alto saxophone 2 clarinets bass clarinet 2 bassoons contrabassoon 4 horns 2 trumpets 2 trombones tuba timpani percussion harp piano and strings

The concerto has two movements Each movement is also divided into two sections The first movement begins with an Andante in classical sonata form followed by the Allegretto a dance like section The second movement starts with an Allegro which uses a small rhythmic idea The solo part is very difficult to play here The orchestra plays very loudly and comes to a big climax The work ends quietly The first two sections are meant to be about life the last two sections are about death

Berg composed music using the twelve tone technique that he had learned from his teacher Arnold Schoenberg but his music also sounds at times as if it is an ordinary major or minor key A piece of music using twelve tone technique starts with twelve notes in which each of the 12 pitches is used before it can be repeated

Here is Bergs tone row in the Violin Concerto

This tone row does not sound as random as many tone rows are because parts of it sound quite tonal This is because the first three notes are a G minor triad notes three to five are a D major triad notes five to seven are an A minor triad notes seven to nine are an E major triad and the last four notes together make up part of a whole tone scale The first notes of each group of triads together form G D A and E which are the open strings of the violin The opening of the concerto makes this very obvious

The last four notes of the row rising whole tones are also the first four notes of the chorale melody Es ist genug Berg quotes this chorale in the last movement of the piece using the harmony composed by Johann Sebastian Bach

There is also another quotation in the piece a Carinthian folk song It is unusual to have a simple folk song in the middle of a concerto Berg wanted it to describe Manon Gropius a simple young girl

Many people find twelve tone music hard to listen to but this concerto is easier than most serial works to understand This is partly because some of the music is tonal but also because of the programme the idea behind the music

Portia is a closer moon to Uranus It was found from the images taken by Voyager 2 on 1986 01 03 and was given the designation S1986 U 1 The moon is named after Portia the heroine of William Shakespeares play The Merchant of Venice It is also designated Uranus XII

Portia is the second biggest closer moon of Uranus after Puck The Portian orbit which lies inside Uranus synchronous orbital radius is slowly shrinking due to tidal deceleration The moon will one day either break up into a planetary ring or hit Uranus

It heads a group of moons called Portia Group which includes Bianca Cressida Desdemona Juliet Rosalind Cupid Belinda and Perdita These moons have similar orbits and photometric properties

Little is known about Portia beyond its size of about 140 km orbit and geometric albedo of about 008

In the Voyager 2 images Portia appears as a stretched object whose major axis points towards Uranus The ratio of axises of the Portias prolate spheroid is 08 01 Its surface is grey in color Observations with Hubble Space Telescope and large terrestrial telescopes found water ice absorption features in the spectrum of Portia

Ragp Zarakolu is a Turkish publisher who has long faced legal problems for publishing books on controversial things in Turkey especially on minority and human rights in Turkey

Ragp Zarakolu was born in 1948 on the island of Bykada close to Istanbul His father Remzi Zarakolu was the district governor on that island Ragp Zarakolu grew up with members of the Greek and Armenian minority in Turkey and began writing for Ant and Yeni Ufuklar magazines in 1968

In 1971 the Turkish government was overthrown Ragp Zarakolu was tried on charges of secret relations to Amnesty International He spent five months in prison before being declared innocent In 1972 Ragp Zarakolu was sentenced to 2 years in prison for his paragraph in the journal Ant on Ho Chi Minh and the Vietnam War He stayed in Selimiye Prison and was set free in 1974 after a general amnesty On his release Zarakolu refused to abandon his work for freedom of thought because he wanted different thoughts and cultures to be available in Turkey

The Belge Publishing House established in Istanbul in 1977 by Zarakolu and his wife Ayenur has been a focus for Turkish censorship laws ever since The couple was imprisoned and the books confiscated and destroyed

In 1979 Ragp Zarakolu was one of the founders of the daily newspaper Demokrat and took responsibility for the news desk on foreign affairs The paper was banned and Ragp Zarakolu was shortly imprisoned in 1982 because of his link to Demokrat He was banned from leaving the country between 1971 and 1991 In 1986 he became one of 98 starters of the Human Rights Association in Turkey For some time Ragp Zarakolu chaired the Writers in Prison Committee of International PEN in Turkey Currently he chairs the Committee for Freedom of Publication in the Union of Publishers 

Until the military coup of 12 September 1980 Belge Publishing House mostly published academic and theoretical books Afterwords Belge started to publish books written by political prisoners The series of 35 books consisted of poems shorts stories novels The list of publications include more than 10 books of Greek literature 10 books on the Armenian Question and five books related to the Jews in Turkey There are also a number of books dealing with the Kurds in Turkey

Ceratosauria are dinosaurs first seen in the fossil record in the late Triassic period some 225 million years ago Ceratosaurians also had strongly curved S shaped necks like birds do this is a trait inherited from a distant archosaurian ancestor One diagnostic characteristic of most of the Ceratosauria is the loose attachment between the premaxilla and the maxilla A large tooth from the lower jaw normally fits into the notch formed by this loose attachment You can see this character clearly on Coelophysis and Dilophosaurus

Rosalind is a closer moon to Uranus It was found from the images taken by Voyager 2 on 1986 01 13 and was given the designation S1986 U 4 It was named after the daughter of the banished Duke in William Shakespeares play As You Like It It is also designated Uranus XIII

Rosalind belongs to Portia Group of moons which also includes Bianca Cressida Desdemona Portia Juliet Cupid Belinda and Perdita These moons have similar orbits and photometric properties Unfortunately other than its orbit radius of 36 km and geometric albedo of 008 almost nothing is known about it

At the Voyager 2 images Rosalind appears as an almost spherical object The ratio of axises of the Rosalinds prolate spheroid is 10 08 Its surface is grey in color

It is the smallest of the closer Uranian moons estimated to be only about 18 km in diameter This and the dark surface made it too dim to be detected by the Voyager 2 cameras during its Uranus flyby in 1986

The orbit of Cupid is only 863 km from the orbit of the bigger moon Belinda Amazingly compared to Mab and Perdita the recently found Uranian moons it does not seem to be perturbed

Following its discovery Cupid was given the designation S2003 U 2 It is also designated Uranus XXVII

It should not be confused with the asteroid 763 Cupido

Tropical Storm Olga was the fifteenth named storm of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season In the second week of December after the official end of the hurricane season a low formed east of the northernmost Lesser Antilles It slowly gained tropical characteristics and late on December 10 the NHC declared it Subtropical Storm Olga while just north of Puerto Rico It is the first post season storm since Tropical Storm Zeta in the 2005 season making this season one of the few with activity both before and after the official bounds of the hurricane season The storm made landfall on December 11 on the eastern tip of the Dominican Republic Later that evening Olga transitioned into a tropical storm just after making landfall Olga tracked over Hispaniola and emerged in the Caribbean Sea Strong wind shear and dry air caused Olga to weaken into a remnant low early on December 13

The storm impacted many areas affected by Tropical Storm Noel a month earlier In Puerto Rico moderate rainfall caused one death 37 fatalities were confirmed in the Dominican Republic including twenty deaths due to the release of floodgates at a dam in Santiago Province Two deaths were also reported in Haiti

In the first week of December a westward moving upper level low led to the formation of a broad surface trough well to the east of the northern Lesser Antilles With a strong ridge to its northeast the trough tracked slowly westward creating scattered convection and some cyclonic turning On December 8 convection began to persist in association with the trough and an upper level low Early on December 9 officials at the Tropical Prediction Center began classifying the system using the Hebert Poteat technique and several tropical cyclone forecast models expected its development of tropical characteristics The system which included of a sharp trough with an area of gale force winds to its north continued westward through an area of moderately warm sea surface temperatures On December 10 a low level circulation developed within the system though its convection had become disorganized and well removed from the center Southerly wind shear left the structure asymmetric and convection steadily increased closer to the center With an upper level low situated just south of the center the National Hurricane Center classified it as Subtropical Storm Olga at 0300 UTC on December 11 while located about 55 miles east of San Juan Puerto Rico

After being classified as a subtropical cyclone Olga kept an organized outflow and located to the southeast of a strong ridge over the western Atlantic Ocean the cyclone moved west southwestward The storm strengthened a little bit while moving right along the north coast of Puerto Rico and after an increase in convection near the center Olga made landfall near Punta Cana Dominican Republic at 1800 UTC on December 11 A Hurricane Hunters flight into the storm reported a tighter wind gradient and peak winds of 60 mph and at 0000 UTC on December 12 the National Hurricane Center reclassified Olga as a tropical cyclone while it was still inland Convection quickly weakened as the storm crossed central Hispaniola and after reaching the Caribbean Sea the system lacked the convection required for the classification of a tropical cyclone rainbands well to its northeast had stronger winds though the center became very disorganized with dry air and strong wind shear Late on December 12 convection increased a little bit over the center though by that time the cyclone weakened to tropical depression status As a certain amount of convection failed to exist the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories on Olga earlier on December 13 while located about 80 miles northwest of Kingston Jamaica Its remnants continued west northwestward with a clear low level circulation creating scattered thunderstorms over Cuba and the Cayman Islands with its moisture extending northward into southern Florida

On December 10 the Tropical Prediction Center gave out a gale warning for waters north of the Lesser Antilles Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic in association with the disturbance that would later become Olga Right after it being classified as a subtropical cyclone the government of the Dominican Republic gave out a tropical storm warning from Cabo Engao along the north coast to its border with Haiti a tropical storm watch was also issued along the southern coastline to near Santo Domingo Because winds were well to the north of its center a tropical storm warning was not issued for Puerto Rico Just before the storm moved ashore the government of Haiti issued a tropical storm warning for its northern coastline and later a tropical storm warning was issued for the Turks and Caicos Islands as well as the southeastern Bahamas

The San Juan National Weather Service office issued a flood watch for all of Puerto Rico including the islands of Culebra and Vieques Continued periods of heavy rainfall also resulted in flash flood warnings for areas across the island Ferry service between Fajardo and the islands of Culebra and Vieques was temporarily stopped during the passage of the storm In the Dominican Republic officials opened shelters in 15 provinces with citizens in low lying areas recommended to stay elsewhere during the passage of the storm citizens in 22 communities were evacuated

The cyclone dropped light to moderate precipitation across Puerto Rico with the maximum rainfall amount at 954 inches in Villalba The rainfall increased levels along several rivers across the island including the Arecibo Big River which was reported at several feet above flood stage Its passage left about 79000 people without power and 144000 without water In the northern portion of the island the rainfall caused a mudslide that buried an automobile which killed its driver

Heavy rainfall fell across the Dominican Republic with isolated totals of 10 inches expected The rainfall caused flooding along the River Yaque del Norte and at first there appeared to be a threat that the Tavera Dam along the river would fail potentially killing thousands in Santiago Province Officials instead chose to open all six floodgates at 0400 UTC on December 12 which released about 16 million gallons of water into the river every second It formed a 66 foot wave of water is a result that caught many off guard due to the time of night and only about 15 minutes to prepare according to eyewitnesses who criticized the decision the flooding killed at least 20 people and left homes seven towns flooded Two other deaths were reported elsewhere in the country and more than 34000 people fled their homes due to the storm more than 7500 houses were damaged In neighboring Haiti two deaths were reported in the northern portion of the country

On December 11 a station in the Turks and Caicos Islands recorded sustained winds of 36 mph

Santiago is a Dominican province in the north central part of the country Its capital city is Santiago de los Caballeros the second largest city in the country and the province takes its name from that city

The province occupies the eastern part of the Yaque del Norte Valley and the River Yaque del Norte runs through the province The Yaque del Norte Valley also named Lnea Noroeste is the western section of the Cibao Valley

Santiago is bordered to the northwest by the province of Valverde to the north by Puerto Plata to the east by the Espaillat and La Vega provinces to the south by San Juan and to the west by Santiago Rodrguez

The province has been an important administrative territory since colonial times Because it was an important centre its capital city was occupied by French and Haitian armies that came from the northwest border

It was one of the original five provinces created by the first Dominican Constitution in 1844 its territory was the northwest of the country and part of the north coast from Monte Cristi and Dajabn to the west to Moca to the east Moca was made part of the La Vega province in 1854

Several provinces were created with part of its original territory Puerto Plata in 1865 Monte Cristi in 1879 Dajabn in 1938 Santiago Rodrguez in 1950 and last Valverde in 1959

Santiago has a total area of 283651 km It has 58 of the area of the Dominican Republic and it is ranked as the 3rd largest province

There are 9 municipalities and 16 municipal districts in the province

The municipalities are

In 2002 there were 908250 people living in the Santiago province and 602721 living in towns and cities The population density was 320 personskm

The province of Santiago is divided in three regions the Cordillera Septentrional in the north the Yaque del Norte Valley in the centre and the Cordillera Central in the south

The Cordillera Septentrional mountain range runs across the north of the province the highest mountain of this range Pico Diego de Ocampo is in this province on the border with the Puerto Plata province The range is covered with rainforests because it rains a lot there the trade winds bring a lot of water that falls on the mountains

South of the Cordillera Septentrional is the Yaque del Norte Valley from the city of Santiago de los Caballeros to the west this is a very dry valley because the trade winds cannot go over the Cordillera Central and so it does not rain enough over the valley But people here uses the water of the Yaque del Norte river to grow plants

The Cordillera Central is in the southern half of the province The highest mountains of the country the island and the Caribbean are here on the border with the San Juan province Pico Duarte 3098 m and others above 3000 m This mountain range is covered with pine forests except close to rivers where there are rainforests

The most important river is Yaque del Norte which crosses the province from south to north first and then it turns to the northwest All the other rivers in the province are tributaries of the Yaque del Norte except the Licey river that comes from the Cordillera Septentrional and flows to the east Licey is a tributary of the River Yuna

The economy of the province is based on farming and industry because there is not a coast tourism is not so important as in other parts of the country

It is the second economic centre of the country after the Greater Santo Domingo It has significant commerce and many industries especially textiles food and cement Most of these industries are in Santiago de los Caballeros and Tamboril the tobacco industry is also important in Villa Bison

Farming is very important in the province Poultry and pigs are raised in Licey al Medio Cattle are raised in the south central and western parts of the province

Coffee is grown in the mountains plantain and cassava in Licey al Medio and rice fruits and vegetables in the western part of the province Tobacco is grown in all the lowlands of the province but the best types are grown around the cities of Villa Bison and Villa Gonzlez

Outflow is a term for the air that flows away from a thunderstorm Lots of outflow show that a storm is healthy

The edge of the outflow boundary can often be detected by weather radar Convergence occurs along the leading edge of the downdraft Convergence of dust aerosols and bugs at the leading edge will lead to a higher clear air signature The signature of the leading edge is also influenced by the density change between the cold air from the downdraft and the warm environmental air This density boundary will increase the number of echo returns from the leading edge Clouds hydrometeors and new thunderstorms can also develop along the outflows leading edge This makes it possible to locate the outflow boundary when using precipitation mode The image to the right depicts a particularly strong ouflow boundary ahead of a line of storms Often the outflow boundary will bow in the direction it is moving the quickest

The Mellotron is a musical instrument which appeared in the 1960s It was the worlds second sampled keyboard after the Chamberlin Mellotrons contained broken wikt linkmagnetic tapetape loops made from the sounds of other musical instruments Instead of sounding exactly like the original instruments the Mellotron had a unique sound

Mellotrons did not travel well and had to be carefully set up every time they were moved They became popular in recording studios and with musicians who could leave them in one location

The Beatles liked the sound of the Mellotron and used it in many of their songs like Strawberry Fields Forever John Lennon a member of the Beatles owned a Mellotron that he kept in his home studio Paul McCartney and George Harrison also members of the band owned Mellotrons and used them in their solo recordings Harry Nilsson also used a Mellotron on some of his recordings

Mellotrons are largely obsolete but are still being made in small quantities Today digital instruments have mostly taken their place Digital keyboards are portable and can be used to make similar sounds anywhere While digital keyboards have been used since the 1980s to replicate the sounds of many other instruments they cannot accurately replicate the nuances and idiosyncrasies of the Mellotron because of complex physics involved in the tape playback system This acknowledged drawback has led to the production of new Mellotrons since 1999 

Punta Cana named after a local cape is a region in the easternmost tip of the Dominican Republic Covering about 4200000 m2 the region is home to a coastline of sandy white beaches and to a town of the same name A region once named Punta de Borrachn was merged with Punta Cana by the founding investors in 1969

Gavialidae is a family of reptiles within the order Crocodilia There are only two surviving species the Gharial and the False Gharial which are each the sole living representatives of the two Gavialidae genera

The gharial sometimes called the Indian gharial or gavial is one of two surviving members of the family Gavialidae Gavialidae is a group of crocodile like reptiles with long narrow jaws The gharial is the second longest of all living crocodilians a large male can approach six meters in length Only Saltwater crocodiles and Nile Crocodiles can grow larger

The fossil history of the Gavialoidea is quite well known The earliest examples split from the other crocodilians in the late Cretaceous The feature of the group that is easiest to recognise is the very long narrow snout This is an adaptation to a diet of small fish Gharials have sacrificed the great mechanical strength of the robust skull and jaw that most crocodiles and alligators have For this reason and they cannot prey on large creatures But they also have reduced weight and water resistance of their lighter skull and very narrow jaw This gives gharials the ability to catch rapidly moving fish They catch them with a side to side snapping motion

The earliest Gavialoidea may or may not have been related to the modern types some died out at the same time as the dinosaurs others survived until the early Eocene The modern forms appeared at much the same time They evolved in the estuaries and coastal waters of Africa They crossed the Atlantic to reach South America as well At their peak the Gavialoidea were numerous and diverse they occupied much of Asia and America up until the Pliocene One species Rhamphosuchus crassidens of India is believed to have grown to an enormous 15 metres or more

Northern Indian subcontinent Bhutan Bangladesh India Myanmar Nepal Pakistan Usually found in the river systems of Indus and the Brahmaputra the Ganges and the Mahanadi with small numbers in Kaladan and the Ayeyarwady River in Myanmar It is sympatric in respective areas with the Mugger Crocodile and the Saltwater Crocodile

Gharials live in rivers They are best adapted to the calmer areas in deep fast moving rivers Their physical attributes do not make the animals very suited to walk on land In fact the only reasons the gharial leaves the water is to either bask in the sun or to nest on the sandbanks of the rivers

The Gharial has a long narrow snout This is the feature that is most different from most other Crocodilia The only other species who has such a snout is the False gharial which is closely related The shape of this snout changes when the animal grows older The snout becomes progressively thinner the older the gharial gets There is a bulbous growth on the tip of the males snout This is called a ghara It is only present in mature animals It is used for different activities such as making a resonant hum during vocalization It is also used for attracting females The mating ritual includes a section where the male uses this ghara to make bubbles

The long jaws are lined with many interlocking razor sharp teeth This is an adaptation to the diet This species is one of the largest of all crocodilian species approaching the saltwater crocodile and the Nile crocodile in maximum size  males reach at least 5 metres in length and often approach 6 metres Reports of 7 metre animals exist but are unconfirmed The leg musculature of the gharial is not suited to enable the animal to raise the body off the ground in order to achieve the high walk gait  being able only to push its body forward across the ground although it can do this with some speed when required However when in water the gharial is the most nimble and quick of all the crocodiles in the world The tail seems overdeveloped and is flattened on the side more so than other crocodiles This enables it to achieve the excellent swimming abilities

The gharial has 27 to 29 upper and 25 or 26 lower teeth on each side These teeth are not received into interdental pits the first second and third mandibular teeth fit into notches in the upper jaw The front teeth are the largest The gharials snout is narrow and long with a dilation at the end and its nasal bones are comparatively short and are widely separated from the pre maxillaries The nasal opening of a gharial is smaller than the supra temporal fossae The gharials lower anterior margin of orbit is raised and its mandibular symphysis is extremely long extending to the 23rd or 24th tooth A dorsal shield is formed from four longitudinal series of juxtaposed keeled and bony scutes

The length of the snout is 35 to 55 times the breadth of the snouts base Nuchal and dorsal scutes form a single continuous shield composed of 21 or 22 transverse series Gharials have an outer row of soft smooth or feebly keeled scutes in addition to the bony dorsal scutes They also have two small post occipital scutes

The outer toes of a gharial are two thirds webbed while the middle toe is one third webbed Gharials have a strong crest on the outer edge of the forearm leg and foot Typically adult gharials are of a dark olive hue while young ones are pale olive with dark brown spots or cross bands

Young gharials eat insects larvae and small frogs Adults feed almost only on fish although some individuals have been known to eat dead animals Their snout morphology is ideally suited for piscivory their long narrow snouts afford very little resistance to water in swiping motions to snap up fish in the water Their numerous needle like teeth are perfect for holding on to struggling slippery fish 

The Gharial is not a man eater Despite its immense size its thin fragile jaws make it physically incapable of devouring any large animal including a human being The myth that gharials eat humans may come partly from their similar appearance to Crocodiles and because jewelry has been found in their stomachs However the gharial may have swallowed this jewelry while scavenging corpses or because used to aid digestion or buoyancy management

The mating season is during November through December and well into January The nesting and laying of eggs takes place in the dry season of March April and May This is because during the dry season the rivers shrink a bit and the sandy river banks are available for nesting Between 30 and 50 eggs are deposited into the hole that the female digs up before it is covered over carefully After about 90 days the juveniles emerge although there is no record of the female assisting the juveniles into the water after they hatch However the mother does protect the young in the water for a few days till they learn to fend for themselves

In the 1970s the gharial came to the brink of extinction and even now remains on the critically endangered list The conservation efforts of the environmentalists in cooperation with several governments has led to some reduction in the threat of extinction Some hope lies with the conservation and management programs in place as of 2004 Full protection was granted in the 1970s in the hope of reducing poaching losses although these measures were slow to be implemented at first Now there are 9 protected areas for this species in India which are linked to both captive breeding and ranching operations where eggs collected from the wild are raised in captivity and then released back into the wild More than 3000 animals have been released through these programs and the wild population in India is estimated at around 1500 animals  with perhaps between one and two hundred animals in the remainder of its range

Recently this species has moved from Endangered to Critically Endangered on the 2007 Red List of endangered species of animals and plants issued by the World Conservation Union and qualifies for protection under the CITES Appendix II

The gharial and its extinct relatives are grouped together by taxonomists in several different ways

Janke et al using molecular genetic evidence found the gharial and the false gharial to be close relatives and placed them together in the same family

Common names include Indian gharial Indian gavial Fish eating crocodile Gavial del Ganges Gavial du Gange Long nosed crocodile Bahsoolia Nakar Chimpta Lamthora Mecho Kumhir Naka Nakar Shormon Thantia Thondre Garial



The false gharial or Malayan gharial is a fresh water reptile It looks like a crocodile with a very thin and long snout This snout resembles that of the gharial That is where the name of the species is from

From a morphological standpoint it has long been classed in the family Crocodylidae but recent immunological studies have shown that it is more closely related to the gharial than was originally thought It is now classed in the family Gavialidae

The false gharial is native to six river systems in Sumatra and Malaysia It can also be found in Borneo Java Vietnam Thailand and possibly Sulawesi Fossils finds in Southern China indicate that at some point this species occurred there in the past 

The False gharial like all other crocodilian species lays eggs It is not known when the species breeds in the wild or when its nesting season is It is a mound nester Females usually mature at 2 3 m Mated females will lay a clutch of 30 60 eggs in a mound of dry leaves or peat Once the eggs are laid and construction of the mound is completed she abandons her nest Unlike most other crocodilian species the young receive no parental care and are at risk of being eaten by predators like wild boar mongooses big cats such as tigers and leopards civets and wild dogs The young hatch after 90 days and are left to fight for themselves

The False gharial is threatened with extinction throughout most of its range due to the drainage of its freshwater swamplands and clearance of surrounding rainforests The species is also hunted frequently for its skin and meat and the eggs are often harvested for human consumption However positive steps have been taken by the Malaysian and Indonesian governments to prevent its extinction in the wild

A Prime lens is a lens which has a fixed zoom or focal length It is easier to make fixed focal lenses than to include them in a variable focus lens Therefore fixed focal lenses usually have a larger opening known as an aperture than comparable variable focus lenses They are usually also of a higher optical quality

In Optics an Aperture is a hole where light can pass through 

ImageAperture diagramsvgleftthumb350pxDiagram of decreasing aperture sizes increasing 

The aperture of a photographic lens is a hole that can be adjusted to different sizes This lets the photographer control the amount of light reaching the film or image sensor The aperture is changed along with the shutter speed to control the amount of light that enters the camera This amount of light is called the exposure Typically a fast shutter speed will not let much light in so the photographer will use a larger aperture to correct for this A slow shutter speed will need a smaller aperture to stop the picture coming out too bright

The size of the aperture is described as an f stop This is a number that describes the size of the hole in relation to the focal length of the lens A low number means the aperture is wide open and lets in a lot of light A high number means that the aperture is small and does not let in as much light

A variable focus lens is a camera lens that can vary its focal length 

In general such lenses have a lower aperture than comparable fixfocus lenses Depending on the manufacturer common zoom lenses usually have a varying aperture from 4 to 56 perhaps 33 to 56 There are also some zoom lenses with a fixed maximal aperture In contrast fix focus lenses in that range have maximum apertures of 14 to 2 

Digital cameras sometimes have a function called digital zoom This is a mathematical method which simply enlarges a part of the picture The result is not as sharp as that of the optical zoom When an optical zoom changes its focal length this will also change the angle of view Digital zooms simply make a small part of an image bigger without changing the angle of view 

Belinda is a closer moon to Uranus a planet in the solar system Belinda was found from the images taken by Voyager 2 on 1986 and it was given the designation S1986 U 5 It is named after the heroine of Alexander Popes The Rape of the Lock It is also designated Uranus XIV

Belinda belongs to Portia Group of moons which also includes Bianca Cressida Desdemona Portia Juliet Cupid Rosalind and Perdita These moons have similar orbits and photometric properties Other than its orbit radius of 45 km and geometric albedo of 008 almost nothing is known about it

At the Voyager 2 images Belinda appears as a stretched object the major axis pointing towards Uranus The moon is very stretched with its short axis 05 01 times the long axis Its surface is grey in color

In photography the word normal lens is used for camera lenses that have a focal length which is roughly the diagonal of the image projected inside the camera Camera lenses with a shorter focal length are called wide angle lenses those with a longer one telephoto lenses

Vyankatesh Madgulkar was one of the most popular and well known Marathi writers of his time He became well known mainly for his realistic writings about village life in a part of southern Maharashtra called Maandesh These writings about Maandesh are set in a period of 15 to 20 years before and after Indias Independence

Vyankatesh Madgulkar was a man of many interests He also read a lot of books on different subjects He was lovingly called Tatya by his admirers friends and family members

Vyankatesh Madgulkar was born in Madgul a village in Sangli district of Maharashtra The Madgulkar family had probably come from the neighbouring state of Karnataka a few centuries back They were one of the eight Brahmin families Madgul which had a population of over a thousand

The family owned some land Vyankatesh Madgulkars grandfather and the earlier generations had lived off the land However in Vyankatesh Madgulkars fathers time the land could not feed the family The family was large Apart from Vyankatesh Madgulkar there were seven children one of whom died early

Vyankatesh Madgulkars father took a job in the government of the Aundh princely state which ruled over Madgul and the region around it known as Maandesh The job took him to various villages and small towns of Maandesh For some time the family moved with him In this way Vyankatesh Madgulkar got to see life in many parts of Maandesh

Although his mother was an old fashioned woman who believed Brahmins should not mix with people of lower castes Vyankatesh Madgulkar freely mixed with children of other castes and communities From them he learnt how to climb trees how to identify birds how to trap fish how to hunt

Madgul had no electricity bus service or shop But it had a primary school Vyankatesh Madgulkar studied there and later in a secondary school in a small town nearby But he was not a good student Some of his teachers told him he had no future

When he was a teenager he left home and joined a group of people fighting for Indias freedom For two years he was considered a criminal by the British government

After India got Independence Vyankatesh Madgulkar returned home His elder brother Gajanan had already left home and become a writer for Marathi filmsGaDiMa as he was called went on to become a famous poet song and screenplay writer and a well known name in Maharashtra

GaDiMas success might have helped Vyankatesh Madgulkar to also think of becoming an artist However he had his own personality different from that of his brother

As he said often he had always had the feeling he was different He first wanted to be a poet He also loved sketching and painting And though he did not complete school education he developed an enormous love for reading He learnt and read English books the hard way with the help of a dictionary He read books by the American novelist John Steinbeck the famous British writer George Orwell and the Irish writer Liam O Flaherty and several other Western writers

Vyankatesh Madgulkar first tried to become a painter He went to the city of Kolhapur in western Maharashtra to learn painting However he lost interest in becoming a painter and turned to writing He wrote his first short story when he was 19 years old It won a literary prize This encouraged him to become a writer

In 1948 when he was 21 he took up a job as a journalist Two years later he moved to the capital of Maharashtra Mumbai to write scripts for Marathi films

In 1955 he took up a job in Pune in the rural programming department of the governments All India Radio station He worked here till he retired in 1985 All this time he continued to write

He visited Australia and the island of Tasmania while he was in the service of All India Radio and wrote stories based upon his experiences there

Vyankatesh Madgulkar passed away in August 2001 at the age of 73 He died of complications from diabetes

Vyankatesh Madgulkar wrote in many different ways He wrote nearly 40 screenplays for films He wrote several folk plays He attempted a Marathi version of Fiddler on the RoofHe translated books especially wild life books from English to Marathi He wrote essays on his travels nature and interesting people he had read about like Richard Burton the British traveler

However he is most fondly remembered for his short stories and novellas He wrote 8 novellas and over 200 short stories

His first book Maandeshi Manse was published when he was only 22 years old Maandeshi Manse is about different kinds of people Vyankatesh Madgulkar had met during his childhood in Maandesh The descriptions of these people are realistic However Vyankatesh Madgulkar explained later that the descriptions were are not fully true The people in Maandeshi Manse are creations of the author based on real people he knew

Vyankatesh Madgulkar mixed the real world with his own imagination in the same way in all his Maandeshi stories He also did not change his style of writing

That style is generally of a person telling a story to people sitting in front of him

Many of the stories told in this way are about poor people Some stories are about things that had happened during Vyankatesh Madgulkars childhood Some stories are about family members Only a few stories have a plot Most stories have one central character But a few stories are about happenings rather than on people

The most famous of Vyankatesh Madgulkars writing is his novella called Bangarwadi It is about the experiences of a young schoolteacher in a village of shepherds in Maandesh The story begins with the schoolteacher walking alone towards the village called Bangarwadi in the night across a landscape with few trees When the teacher reaches Bangarwadi he finds that the school is not working Over the next months the schoolteacher successfully runs the school However at the end of the story lack of rainfall forces all the people of Bangarwadi to leave the village The school again has no students

Within this story Vyankatesh Madgulkar gives us an unforgettable and detailed picture of a way of living One reviewer Taya Zinkin reviewing the English translation of the book in The Economic Weekly in 1958 said is perhaps the most important book written by an Indian about India to appear in English since Jawaharlal Nehrus Discovery of India

Bangarwardi was translated in several languages The great German scholar on India Gunther Sontheimer translated it in German Bookstores in Pune and other Maharashtra cities still sell the original book in Marathi It has been reprinted over 15 times

Bangarwardi was also make into a film by Amol Palekar

Vyankatesh Madgulkar wrote stories about Maandesh for around 20 years from the mid 1940s to the mid 1960s Later he wrote about his family and then about nature His last novella Sattantar about a community of monkeys won him the central governments Sahitya Parishad award for best Marathi book published in that year

Vyankatesh Madgulkar has been translated in several languages Brief details of translation in English with year of publication are as below

The following are brief details of translation of his work in languages other than English with year of publication

The Ren and Stimpy Show was an American cartoon created by John Kricfalusi which aired from 1991 to 1995 The main characters are Ren Hek a dog and Stimpson J Cat

The show premiered on Nickelodeon on Sunday August 11 1991 and aired new episodes on the channel from 1991 to 1996

It is shown around the world on MTV and was originally shown on Nickelodeon in countries such as America Canada Australia New Zealand and in most of Europe

People who make cartoons think that Ren and Stimpy is famous because John Kricfalusi got fired after only one year of working on his show He did not do his work on time and often fought with his friends at Nickelodeon So they fired him He made other shows but none were as popular as Ren and Stimpy 

You can still watch Ren and Stimpy on the Nicktoons Network

Perdita is a closer moon to Uranus Perditas discovery was not simple The first pictures of Perdita were taken by the Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1986 but it was not recognized from the photographs for more than a decade In 1999 the moon was noticed by Erich Karkoschka and reported But because no further pictures could be taken to confirm its existence it was thought to be non existent in 2001 However in 2003 pictures taken by the Hubble Space Telescope managed to pick up an object where Perdita was supposed to be finally confirming its existence

Following its discovery in 1999 Perdita was given the designation of S1986 U 10 It was named after the daughter of Leontes and Hermione in William Shakespeares play The Winters Tale The moon is also designated Uranus XXV

Perdita belongs to Portia Group of moons which also includes Bianca Cressida Desdemona Portia Juliet Cupid Rosalind and Belinda These moons have similar orbits and photometric properties Unfortunately other than its orbit radius of 15 km and geometric albedo of 008 almost nothing is known about it

135 film is the official name of the photographic film that is most used today It is specified by ISO Standard 1007 It was introduced by Kodak in 1934 It was made for making pictures rather than films It is 35mm wide that is why it is often also called 35mm film 

It quickly grew in popularity It became more popular than 120 film by the late 1960s Since then it has been the most popular photographic film format Despite competition from formats such as 828 126 110 and APS it remains so today

Individual rolls of 135 film are enclosed in single spool light tight metal cassettes This allows cameras to be loaded in daylight The film is clipped or taped to a spool and exits via a velvet covered slot The end of the film is cut on one side to form a leader which is to be inserted into a corresponding slot in the camera take up spool It has the same dimensions and perforation pitch as 35 mm movie print film

The European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages is a European treaty that was adopted in 1992

It was designed by the Council of Europe to protect and promote historical regional and minority languages in Europe It only applies to languages traditionally used by the nationals of the State Parties which have a lot of differences from the majority or official language This means that the treaty does not protect languages used by recent immigrants from other countries Also the treaty does not protect local dialects of the official or majority language

To be protected a language should be spoken either by

National official languages are not covered by the treaty but regional official languages can be For example Catalan is only official within a region of Spain so could benefit from the treaty but Irish cannot because it is an official language in Republic of Ireland even though it is a minority language However Irish is protected in Northern Ireland because it is not an official or national language of the United Kingdom

France has signed the treaty but the French constitution does not allow the government to support languages apart from French

There are two levels of protection Every country which has signed the treaty must give all qualifying languages the lower level of protection Countries can also decide to give some languages the higher level of protection The higher level is a list of things countries should do A country giving higher protection must do at least 35 of these things

Nefertiti was the Great Royal Wife of the Egyptian Pharaoh Akhenaten She was the mother in law and may have been stepmother of the Pharaoh Tutankhamun Nefertiti may have also ruled as pharaoh under the name Neferneferuaten for a short time after her husbands death and before the accession of Tutankhamun although this identification is doubted by the latest researchFactdateDecember 2007 Her name in English means the beautiful woman has come Nefertiti was one of the most powerful queens in Ancient Egypt

A wide angle lens is a lens that has a focal length that is shorter than that of the normal lens Normal lenses have an angle of view of between 40 and 50 Wide angle lenses have an angle of view that is bigger 

For the 135 film format normal lenses are 50mm focal length 35mm and 28mm are slight wide angle lenses 

24mm 20mm 17mm and 14mm offer more extreme views 

This is different for digital photography Many cameras use smaller sensors This means that the focal lengths have an angle of view that is different That way an 18mm lens mounted on a digital camera of this type gives an angle of view of the 28mm wide angle lens namely 75 degrees for a multiplier of 15

A special kind of wide angle lens is called fish eye lens

The Grand Duchy of Hesse was a former state that existed in modern day Germany It was formed in 1806 after the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire as a result of the actions of Napoleon who then elevated the former Landgraviate of Hesse Darmstadt to the level of grand duchy For this reason this state was occasionally known simply as Hesse Darmstadt

Because Hesse Darmstadt was a member of Napoleons Confederation of the Rhine it was forced to give up a considerable amount of territory at the 1815 Congress of Vienna The territory of the Duchy of Westphalia which Hesse Darmstadt received from the 1803 Reichsdeputationshauptschluss was given to the Kingdom of Prussia However it received some territory on the western bank of the Rhine including the important federal fortress at Mainz 

The Grand Duchy changed its name to the Grand Duchy of Hesse and by Rhine in 1816 

The Grand Duchy of Hesse was divided into three provinces

Puck is a closer moon to Uranus Puck was found from the images taken by Voyager 2 on 1985 12 30 and was given the designation S1985 U 1

In Celtic mythology and English folklore a Puck is a mischievous sprite imagined as an evil demon by Christians the moon is named after the Puck who appears in Shakespeares A Midsummer Nights Dream in which he travels around the globe at night with the fairies It is also designated Uranus XV

Puck is the biggest of the small closer moons to Uranus It is in the middle in size between Portia and Miranda the smallest of the five bigger moons Pucks orbit is also located between these two moons Little is known about it aside from its orbit its radius about 81 km and its geometric albedo approximately 011 

Of the moons found by the Voyager 2 imaging team only Puck was found early enough that the probe could be programmed to take pictures of it in some detail Images showed that Puck has a shape of a slightly prolate spheroid Its surface is heavily cratered and is grey in color There are three named craters on the surface of Puck Observations with Hubble Space Telescope and large terrestrial telescopes found water ice absorption features in the spectrum of Puck

Schinus a large genus of Anacardiaceae many tree It prefers tropic subhumid zones Californian pepper tree Sareira native from Mexico to South America Various species grown as ornamental eg Sareira and Brazilian pepper Sterebinthifolius

Mab is a closer moon to Uranus It was found by Mark R Showalter and Jack J Lissauer in 2003 using the Hubble Space Telescope It was named after Queen Mab a fairy queen from English folklore who is mentioned in William Shakespeares play Romeo and Juliet

Because the moon is small and dark it was not seen in the images taken by Voyager 2 during its Uranus flyby in 1986 However it is brighter than another moon Perdita which was discovered from Voyagers photos in 1997 This led scientists to look at the old photos again and the moon was finally found in the images

If it is as dark as Puck it is about 24 km in diameter On the other hand if it is brightly coloured like the neighbouring moon Miranda it would be even smaller than Cupid and comparable to the smallest farther moons

Mab is heavily perturbed The actual source for perturbation is still unclear but is probably one or more of the nearby orbiting moons

Following its discovery Mab was given the designation S2003 U 1 The moon is also designated Uranus XXVI

In photography a telephoto lens is a lens There are two different uses of the word The less specific use is to mean a lens that has a longer focal length than a normal lens Their angle of view is smaller than that of a normal lens With telephoto lenses things look closer than they really are

The other meaning of telephoto lens applies to lenses that are constructed in a special way so they can be shorter than their focal length

For 35mm film 50mm is a normal focal length Typical telephoto lenses are 85mm and 100m They are used for portraits mostly Other telephoto lenses that are used often are 135mm 180mm and 200mm

Longer focal lengths are used in sports photography

The name Umbriel and the names of all four moons of Uranus then known were suggested by John Herschel in 1852 at the request of Lassell Lassell had earlier supported Herschels 1847 naming scheme for the seven then known moons of Saturn and had named his newly found eighth moon Hyperion in accordance with Herschels naming scheme in 1848 Umbriel is the dusky melancholy sprite in Alexander Popes The Rape of the Lock and the name suggests the Latin umbra shadow The adjectival form of the name is Umbrielian

It is also designated Uranus II

So far the only close up images of Umbriel are from the Voyager 2 probe which made observations of the moon during its Uranus flyby in January 1986 During the flyby the southern hemisphere of the moon was pointed towards the Sun so only it was studied

Umbriels surface is the darkest of the Uranian moons and reflects only about half as much light as Ariel Uranus brightest moon It has far more and bigger craters than do Ariel and Titania and is also the least geologically active It is mostly made of water ice with the balance made up of silicate rock and other ices such as methane Methane can break down and form reddish black organic compounds such as tholins when bombarded by high energy particles Near IR spectra of Ariel and Umbriel clearly show that water ice dominates the spectra of these objects

Titania was found on January 11 1787 by William Herschel He reported it and Oberon the same year He later reported four more moons which turned out to be spurious

The names of Titania and the other four moons of Uranus then known were suggested by Herschels son John Herschel in 1852 at the request of William Lassell who had found Ariel and Umbriel the year before Lassell had earlier supported Herschels 1847 naming scheme for the seven then known moons of Saturn and had named his newly found eighth moon Hyperion in accordance with Herschels naming scheme in 1848

All of the moons of Uranus are named for characters from Shakespeare or Alexander Pope Titania was named after Titania the Queen of the Faeries in A Midsummer Nights Dream

Shakespeares characters name is pronounced ttnj but the moon is often pronounced tateni by analogy with the familiar chemical element titanium 

It is also designated Uranus III

So far the only close up images of Titania are from the Voyager 2 probe which photographed the moon during its Uranus flyby in January 1986 At the time of the flyby the southern hemisphere of the moon was pointed towards the Sun so only it was studied

Although what its interior is made up of is uncertain one model suggests that Titania is made of about 50 water ice 30 silicate rock and 20 methane related organic compounds A major surface feature is a huge canyon that dwarfs the scale of the Grand Canyon on Earth and is in the same class as the Valles Marineris on Mars or Ithaca Chasma on Saturns moon Tethys

On September 8 2001 Titania occulted a faint star this was a chance to both refine its diameter and ephemeris and to detect any extant atmosphere The data revealed no atmosphere to a surface pressure of 003 microbars if it exists it would have to be far thinner than that of Triton or Pluto

The 20 Hunchakian gallows is the common name for the group of Hunchakian activists who were hanged in the Sultan Bayazid square of Constantinople in June 15 1915

The 7th General Convention of the Social Democrat Hunchakian Party which was held in Constana Romania in 1913 had a unique and great importance not only for the Hunchaks but in the history of the Armenian people as a whole During the Convention members stressed their concern of the Ittihad governments blatant disregard of the Armenian lives who resided in Historic Armenia The Hunchaks feared that this disregard would only escalate as time past The Hunchaks also stressed the importance of a United Independent Armenia which would be impossible under the racist and dictatorial Young Turk governments rule of the Ottoman Empire

Thus the convention adjourned with two main objectives

I  As stated in its original program the party was to move from licit to illicit activities thus becoming once again a covert organization

II  To plan and assassinate the leaders of the Ittihad party the same leaders that carried out the Adana massacres of 1909 and thus the same leaders who at that moment were planning the annihilation of the Armenian people 

Unfortunately these secret objectives were passed on to the Turks by an Armenian agent for the government consequently as soon as the delegates arrived in Constantinople they were arrested By the end of the year a total of one hundred and forty Hunchak leaders were arrested

After spending two years in terrible conditions in Turkish prisons and undergoing lengthy mock trials twenty prominent figures  Paramaz Dr Benne Aram Achekbashian Vanig and others were sentenced to death by hanging A few weeks after the beginning of the Armenian Genocide on June 15 1915 all twenty men were hanged in the central square of Constantinople known as Sultan Bayazid Square Paramazs last words before his hanging were You can only hang our bodies but not our ideology You will see tomorrow on the Eastern horizon a Socialist Armenia 

Since their execution the Twenty Martyrs have been a source of inspiration for thousands of young Armenians through out the world

In 2001 the monument of Paramaz and his 19 Hunchakian comrades was opened in Meghri town Armenia

Two other prominent Hunchakian activists Stepan Sabah Goulian and Varaztahd were condemned to death in absentia

The Social Democrat Hunchakian Party also known as Hentchak is one of the oldest political parties in Armenia and the first Socialist party in the Ottoman Empire and in Persia in the 1880s It was founded in 1887 by Avetis Nazarbekian Mariam Vardanian Ruben Khan Azat and others who studied in Geneva Switzerland with the goal to gain Armenias independence from the Ottoman Empire which is part of Armenian national liberation movement Its name taken from its newspaper Hunchak means Bell in English and is taken by party members to represent awakening enlightenment and freedom

All of the 7 founders of Hunchakian party were Russian Armenian Marxist students who had left Russia to continue their higher education in universities of Western Europe They were young persons in their twenties and were from welltodo bourgeois families who were financially supporting them For the purpose of furthering revolutionary activity in Turkish Armenia they formed the Hunchakian Revolutionary Party in August 1887

Hunchak party fought many battles against the Ottoman Empire to free the Armenian people from Turkish rule One of Armenias famous national heroes Andranik Ozanian at first joined the Hunchak party but disagreement with party policies led Andranik to leave the Hunchak ranks and join the Dashnak party

The party also played role in establishment of Democratic Republic of Armenia as party members took part in the Battle of Sardarapat during the World War I at Caucasus Campaign which defended the Armenian capital of Yerevan from Army of Islam of Ottoman Empire

In the 1950s it clashed sometimes violently with the Dashnak Party due to tensions that escalated when the ARF elected Bishop Zareh as Catholicos of Cilicia a move that was rejected by the Hunchaks In the midst of increasing sectarian strife in the late 1960s and early 1970s however Lebanons Armenian community began to close ranks and in 1972 the Hunchakian Party ran a joint ticket with the Dashnaks In 2000 the Hunchakian Party joined forces with Rafik Hariris Dignity party which swept the city of Beirut

In the early 1990s the party took part in the Nagorno Karabakh conflict The party today forms part of the opposition Justice bloc

This party is also active in Lebanon where it competes for the six National Assembly seats reserved for ethnic Armenians The party subscribes to a socialist ideology and advocates a planned economy for Lebanon

The Hunchakian party has established affiliate organizations such as the AEBU which is an organization that helps with educational health and social care the Armenian Dkhrouhi Youth Association and HMM which is a sporting organization

Warnings and watches are two levels of alert issued by national weather forecasting bodies to coastal areas threatened by the imminent approach of a tropical cyclone of tropical storm or hurricane strength They are notices to the local population and civil authorities to make appropriate preparation for the cyclone including evacuation of vulnerable areas where necessary It is important that interests throughout the area of an alert make preparations to protect life and property and do not disregard it on the strength of the detailed forecast track Tropical cyclones are not points and forecasting their track remains an uncertain science

Caliban was found on 1997 09 06 by Brett J Gladman Philip D Nicholson Joseph A Burns and John J Kavelaars using the 200 inch Hale telescope together with Sycorax and given the designation S1997 U 1

Designated Uranus XVI it was named after the monster character in William Shakespeares play The Tempest

The orbital parameters suggest that it may belong together with Stephano to the same dynamic cluster suggesting common origin

The diameter is estimated at 72 km making it the second biggest non spherical moon of Uranus half the size of Sycorax the biggest non spherical moon of Uranus

The light curve suggests Calibans rotation period is 27 hours

A tropical cyclone forecast model is a computer program that uses meteorological data to forecast the motion and intensity of tropical cyclones Such models utilize powerful supercomputers with complex mathematical modeling software and meteorological data to calculate paths and intensities There are two general types statistical and dynamical and two primary types of forecasts track and intensity

Punta Cana International Airport one of the busiest airport of the country is to the south of the cape

Sycorax is the biggest retrograde non spherical moon of Uranus Sycorax was found on 1997 09 06 by Brett J Gladman Philip D Nicholson Joseph A Burns and John J Kavelaars using the 200 inch Hale telescope together with Caliban and given the designation S1997 U 2

Officially confirmed as Uranus XVII it was named after Sycorax Calibans mother in William Shakespeares play The Tempest

Sycorax follows a far orbit more than 20 times farther from Uranus than the farthest regular moon Oberon Its orbit is retrograde moderately inclined and eccentric

The orbital parameters suggest that it may belong together with Setebos and Prospero to the same dynamic cluster suggesting common origin

The diagram illustrates the orbital parameters of the retrograde non spherical moons of Uranus with the eccentricity of the orbits represented by the segments extending from the pericentre to the apocentre 

The diameter of Sycorax is estimated at 150 km making it the biggest non spherical moon of Uranus comparable in size with Himalia the biggest non spherical moon of Jupiter

The rotation period could not be estimated well

Wozzeck is an opera by the Austrian composer Alban Berg It was composed between 1914 and 1922 and first performed in 1925

Berg wrote this opera before the period when he used serialism in his works His teacher Schoenberg had not yet developed the twelve tone system The music of Wozzeck has tonal music in the tradition of Mahler but also some atonal music as well as melodies which are based on the whole tone scale The music sounded very modern at the time it was written Berg also writes for the voices in unusual ways sometimes they have to half speak half sing

The opera is based on a play called Woyzeck by the German playwright Georg Bchner Woyzeck was an unusual drama because instead of being a story about someone important such as a king or a god it was about a poor man who is not very smart and is bullied and misused by other people When Berg wrote the opera nearly a century later it was still an unusual story for an opera The heroes in operas were usually important people while working people often had comic parts they were often servants But Wozzeck is a simple man who cannot help what is happening to him In drama this is sometimes called an anti hero

Scene 1 Wozzeck is working as a barber While he is shaving the Captain the Captain tells Wozzeck that he thinks Wozzeck leads a bad life because he has had a child with a woman without being married to her Wozzeck says that it is hard for him to be good because he is poor He reminds the Captain that Jesus said Let the little children come to me The Captain is confused by this remark

Scene 2 Wozzeck and his friend Andres are cutting sticks as the sun is setting Wozzeck has scary visions he sees the sinking sun covering the world in flames

Scene 3 Soldiers march by outside Maries room Her neighbour Margret tells Marie she is bad because she is broken wikt linkflirtflirting with the soldiers Then Wozzeck comes and tells Marie of the terrible visions he has had

Scene 4 The Doctor tells Wozzeck that he should not cough in the street He says he is doing a medical experiment Wozzeck is so simple that he believes him The doctor is glad to hear about Wozzecks terrible visions

Scene 5 Marie admires the Drum major outside her room He wants to love her At first she turns away from him but then she gives in and they rush out together

Scene 1 Marie is telling her child to go to sleep while admiring earrings which the Drum major gave her Wozzeck arrives He asks her where she got the earrings She says she found them Wozzeck does not know whether to believe her but gives her some money and leaves Marie knows her behaviour is wrong

Scene 2 The Doctor rushes by the Captain in the street who tells him to slow down The Doctor makes the Captain frightened by thinking of nasty illnesses that he might get When Wozzeck comes they tease him by saying that Marie loves someone else

Scene 3 Wozzeck talks about it to Marie She admits that she has a boyfriend Wozzeck is furious He is about to hit her when she stops him saying even her father never dared to hit her She says better a knife in my belly than your hands on me This gives Wozzeck an idea for revenge

Scene 4 Wozzeck sees Marie dancing with the Drum major in a crowd Andres asks Wozzeck why he is sitting by himself A drunkard gives a sermon then an idiot goes up to Wozzeck and says he can smell blood

Scene 5 In the barracks at night Wozzeck cannot sleep He is keeping Andres awake The Drum major comes in He is drunk He gets Wozzeck out of bed to fight with him

Scene 1 In her room at night Marie reads to herself from the Bible She wants to be forgiven

Scene 2 Wozzeck and Marie are walking in the woods by a pond Marie wants to leave but Wozzeck stops her The moon is shining bright red Wozzeck becomes determined that if he can not have Marie no one else can and he stabs her

Scene 3 People are dancing in a pub Wozzeck enters and when he sees Margret he dances with her and pulls her onto his lap He insults her and then asks her to sing him a song She sings but then notices blood on his hand and elbow everyone begins to shout at him and Wozzeck rushes out

Scene 4 Wozzeck goes back to the place where he killed Marie Wozzeck thinks that the knife he killed Marie with will prove that he is the murderer He throws the knife into the pond When the blood red moon appears again he walks into the pond to try to wash the blood of his body but he drowns The Captain and the Doctor passing by hear Wozzeck moaning and rush off in fright

Intermezzo This interlude leads to the finale

Scene 5 The next morning a group of children are playing in the sunshine People are telling one another that Maries body has been found The children all run off to see Marie and Wozzecks little boy has been playing on a toy horse He stops and runs after the other children to the pond

Berg saw Bchners play Woyzeck in 1914 It was the first time it had been performed in Vienna The play had been advertised as Wozzeck because people could not read Bchners handwriting This is why Berg uses this spelling for his opera

Berg knew at once that he wanted to make the play into an opera Bchner who had died in 1837 at the age of 23 had left the play unfinished Berg took fifteen scenes from the play and made them into an opera with three acts He composed music with a particular form for each scene so that the music develops in a very organised way He made changes to the libretto himself

Though Berg began work on the opera in 1914 he was serving in the army during World War I so he did not have time to continue working on it until 1917 He finished the opera in April 1922 Erich Kleiber conducted the first performance at the Berlin State Opera on 14 December 14 1925 It quickly became famous and was performed in all of the big opera houses in Europe It was so successful that Berg was able to live off of the money he earned from it

Wozzeck was the first major opera written in a modern 20th century style A lot of the music is atonal so Berg was able to use this to express the madness of Wozzeck Sometimes the music becomes more tonal especially when the story is telling about love and humanity He also bases some of the music about the soldiers on folksong which he treats in his own special way

Another musical technique he uses is the leitmotif in which particular characters or things are linked to particular themes or musical ideas This technique can be very useful to suggest certain things For example there is a leitmotif for the earrings which the Drum major has given to Marie When the major makes love to Marie we hear this leitmotif The music makes us realize that he is not forcing her to love him but that she is willing In another place the military music tells us that Marie is thinking of the Drum major 

Another leitmotif is the chord we hear when Wozzeck near the beginning of the opera talks about poor folk like us The chord we hear is used in other parts of the opera when characters are not strong enough to change their situation in life

In Norse mythology Gram is the name of the sword of Sigurd He used it to kill the dragon Fafnir It was forged by Weyland the Smith and originally belonged to his father Sigmund who received it in the hall of the Volsung after pulling it out of a log into which Odin had stuck itnobody else could pull it out The sword was destroyed and reforged at least once After it was reforged it clove an anvil in half See Sigurd for more details on the story of Siegfried and Fafnir

In the Nibelungenlied Siegfrieds sword is called Balmung in Richard Wagners Ring Cycle it is called Nothung

Peripheral equipment is any equipment used to give a computer system more features Input is anything that goes in and output is any thing that goes out Any device for the computer that the computer can work without is peripheral equipment This equipment is always separated from the central processing unit by a device controller

Peripheral equipment is necessary for people to interact with a computer system Some peripheral equipment displays information

Peripheral equipment is often labelled IO device IO devices are connected to a device controller which is connected to the electronics in the computer system An example of an output device is computer speakers Computer speakers are plugged in to a device controller called an audio device The device is connected to the rest of the system inside An example of an input device is a computer mouse and it is connected in a same way as an output device

One peripheral device can be connected to many systems 

Sometimes extra memory devices such as a second hard disk can be called peripheral equipment People who make computer programs call everything except the processor and main memory an IO device To an engineer working on the design of a processor everything except the processor is called an IO device 

An input device is anything that puts information inside a computer It is a hardware device that sends information into the CPU Without any input devices a computer would simply be a display device and not allow users to interact with it similar to a TV Below is a listing of different types of computer input devices

An output device is anything used for displaying information from the computer or making sound from the computer

The Federal Ministry of Marshall Plan Affairs was one of the first ministries of the Federal Republic of Germany Its job was to oversee the rebuilding of the new republic using money and aid given by the United States as part of the European Recovery Programme which was usually called the Marshall Plan

The only Minister for Marshall Plan Affairs was also the first Federal Vice Chancellor Franz Blcher

In 1953 the Ministry was renamed the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation

The Marshall Plan was a plan of the United States for rebuilding the allied countries of Europe after World War II Another reason was to stop communism

The plan was named after Secretary of State George Marshall but the plan was worked out by other people in the State Department

The plan ran for four years beginning in July 1947 During that period US 13 billion in economic and technical help were given to help the recovery of the European countries that had joined in the Organization for European Economic Co operation

By the time the plan ended the economy of every member state had grown well past pre war levels

In recent years some historians have said that another reason for the plan was to make the United States stronger and to make the countries of western Europe need the United States They also say that the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration which helped millions of refugees from 1944 to 1947 also helped the European postwar recovery

US Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr said that if Europe needed money to rebuild what had been destroyed by the war they should take it from Germany This money was called war reparations Morgenthau said it would also stop Germany from ever being rebuilt and threatening to start another war Taking money from Germany was done after World War I It did not work Instead of helping other countries it hurt them This is because companies could not sell the coal and steel that they made because it was coming in free from Germany

Jean Monnet of France said that France should control the German coal areas of the Ruhr and Saar and use it to rebuild French industry In 1946 the occupying powers agreed to put strict limits on how quickly Germany could reindustrialize Limits were placed on how much coal and steel could be produced

This was the first German industrial plan It was signed in early 1946 and said that German heavy industry was to be cut down to half of its 1938 levels by the destroying 1500 manufacturing plants

By the end of 1946 governments could see the problems of the plan and the agreement was changed several times the last time in 1949 But dismantling factories went on into 1950 Germany had been very important to the economy of Europe for a long time This meant that a poor Germany was holding back European recovery because other countries could not sell so many things to Germany A poor Germany was also expensive for the occupying powers They had to give Germany food and other things which it needed and could not grow or make for itself anymore

Because of this the Morgenthau and Monnet plans were rejected

The Marshall Plan ended in 1952 Ideas to extend it were stopped because of the cost of the Korean War and rearmament US Republicans hostile to the plan had also gained seats in the 1950 Congressional elections

The Marshall Plan has been described as the most unselfish act in history However this may not be the case The United States benefited from the plan because part of the agreement for giving the aid was that country would have to open up their economies to US companies

Historical revisionist hisistorians such as Walter LaFeber during the 1960s and 1970s said that the plan was American economic imperialism That means that it was an attempt to gain control over Western Europe just as the Soviets controlled Eastern Europe

Tyler Cowen economist has said that nations receiving the most aid from the Marshall Plan saw the least returns and grew the least between 1947 and 1955 Those nations who received little grew the most

When he looked at West Germanys economy from 1945 to 1951 German analyst Werner Abelshauser decided that foreign aid was not needed to start the recovery or to keep it going Cowen found that the economic recoveries of France Italy and Belgium started before the Marshall Plan Belgium relied heavily on free market economic policies after its liberation in 1944 and had the fastest recovery It also did not have the severe housing and food shortages seen in the rest of continental Europe 

nopeavi The Ninety Five Theses on the Power of Indulgences commonly known as The Ninety Five Theses was written by Martin Luther 

Luther argued that the Church should not sell indulgences Because many people agreed Luther became very popular paving the way for the Protestant Reformation 

On October 31 1517 Luther approached the church authorities with his pressing call for reform On this day he presented them with his theses When the bishops did not respond Luther circulated his theses privately The theses spread quickly and were printed in Nuremberg Leipzig and Basel

Most recently in February 2007 the media reported that a handwritten note by Luthers secretary Georg Rrer found in the university library at Jena appeared to confirm the traditional account of Luthers nailing the theses to the door As of February 2007 this new find has yet to be assessed by scholars
