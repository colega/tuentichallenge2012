Ur was the one of the worlds first cities Ur was a Sumerian city state founded by the Sumerians around the 26th century BC Sumer was also an early civilization Once a coastal city near the mouth of the then Euphrates river on the Persian Gulf Ur is now well inland south of the Euphrates on its right bank convert16km from Nasiriyah Iraq It is close to the site of ancient Eridu 

Ur had three social classes The richer like government officials priests and soldiers were at the top The second level was for merchants teachers laborers farmers and craftmakers The bottom were for slaves captured in battle Burials at Ur give insight into peoples social standing Kings and queens were buried with treasure Wealthy people were buried with less Since irrigation gave Ur abundant crops not everybody needed to work on farms People learned other skills Sir Leonard Woolley found a tablet that listed Urs special workers The chisel workers made sculptures the gem cutters made gems and the fuller stomped on woven wools to make them soft The metal workers made weapons Cities have different groups Some of the richer people are more powerful

In the Sumerian city the ziggurats stood like modern skyscrapers over the city Some ziggurats stood 70 feet tall Later the ziggurats became more than a place for gods There were workshops for craftworkers For the priests they were temples to do worship There were big staricases to get up and down The only level that remains today is the bottom They tell a lot about the people who built them Sumerians had no tools and machinery like us They were careful brick builders Brickmakers formed mud bricks there were perfect After drying they take them to the site and set them in place with bitumen Bitumen is a thick sticky black stuff Its like asphalt the stuff they use to pave roads They braided reeds so they would be stronger and hooked them up like steel cables

The Odenwald is a mountain chain in the south of Hesse in the north of Bavaria and the north of Baden Wrttemberg 

In the south of the Odenwald there is the Neckar River In the east there is the Main River In the west there is the valley of the Rhine River The highest mountain is the Katzenbuckel

The big cities Mannheim and Frankfurt am Main are near to the Odenwald People of these cities like to go there at holidays It is known for its clean thin air There are many marked hiking paths You can find wild blueberries strawberries and mushrooms in the forests 

Several small towns are very beautiful like Weinheim on the Bergstrae and Michelstadt The mild climate of the area is well known  ImageFelsenmeer kleinjpgrocks of the Felsenmeer ImageKatzenbuckel 1jpgKatzenbuckel ImageAlsbach 1JPGcastle Alsbach

Daylight saving time is the local time adopted by many countries during summer Typically clocks are adjusted by moving the time forward by one hour in late winter or early spring When DST ends in autumn clocks are turned back to their normal time

DST was introduced in many countries to use the extra daylight available during summer DST helps stores that sell to people after they get off work but it hurts farmers and others whose hours are set by the sun It cuts traffic accident rates Sometimes it can reduce energy costs but it can also increase them

The United States Australia the United Kingdom Canada and many other countries have DST In Europe DST is called summer time Iceland Russia Ukraine and Belarus are the few countries in Europe without DST

Rowing is about moving a boat on water using human muscle power It can be a sport The goal in rowing is to move as fast as possible on top of the water The athletes use a boat They move the boat forward by using two sculls or one oar There are different types of rowing The types depend on how many people are in the boat and if they have a coxswain or not Rowing is a very popular sport in England the Commonwealth and the Northeastern United States The old universities of the United States and England have yearly rowing matches

An Inkjet printer is a printer for computers It uses special ink to print on the paper Another type of printing techology is the Laser printer

Usually inkjet printers are used by people who print very little The ink comes in special ink cartridges which can be very expensive and uneconomical Also the ink in the cartridge may dry up This means that a new cartridge is needed 

Many professionals use inkjet printers to print on very large surfaces These printers usually do not use cartridges but have a continuous supply of ink that could last for a long time Inkjet printers need special paper This paper has been treated so that the ink does not smear Less expensive inkjet printers which cost a little more than 100 US dollars are a bargain for users who want to be able to print pages in color

A laser printer is a printer for computers It uses LED technology to get small particles of toner from a cartridge onto paper Very often this is more economical to use than the ink of inkjet printers

The laser printer was first invented by a team at Kodak around the 1980sfactdateApril 2009

Laser printing is a process which typically involves seven steps

Lawrencium is a chemical element It is also named eka lutetium by some people It has the symbol Lr It has the atomic number 103 It is a radioactive element that does not exist in nature It has to be made Lawrencium is made from californium The isotope that has the longest half life has a half life of about 36 hours

No uses for lawrencium are known What lawrencium looks like is not known because not enough has been made to see it with human eyesight

Is a Block D Group3 Period 7 element Discovered by Albert Ghiorso and co workers in 1961 in California Named after Ernest O Lawrence inventor of the cyclotron a research instrument with which several new elements have been foundmade

Darmstadtium is a chemical element It has been named ununnilium or eka platinum but is now named darmstadtium It has the symbol Ds It has the atomic number 110 It is a transuranium element 

Darmstadtium is a radioactive element that does not exist in nature It has to be made The isotopes with an atomic mass from 267 to 273 have very short half lifes The half life of these isotopes is measured in milliseconds Isotopes of darmstadtium with an atomic mass of 279 and 281 were synthesised after the other isotopes Ds 279 and Ds 281 decay more slowly The isotope with an atomic mass of 279 has a half life of 180 milliseconds and Ds 281 has a half life of 111 seconds

No uses for darmstadtium are known What darmstadtium looks like is not known because not enough has been made to see it with human eyesight

Darmstadtium was first made on November 9 1994 It was made at the Gesellschaft fr Schwerionenforschung in Darmstadt Germany The team that made darmstadtium was led by Dr Jorge Rigol Only a few atoms of it were made It was made by bombarding a lead target with nickel A nuclear fusion reaction happened and made the element

The element was named for Darmstadt Darmstadt is the place of its discovery The GSI is in Wixhausen a part of the north of the city of Darmstadt The new name was given to the chemical element by the IUPAC in August 2003

The Wampanoag were a Native American tribe They lived during the 17th century in what is now the American region of New England The Wampanoag tribe helped the English settlers to survive after they arrived in the Mayflower

Mandir is a place where Hindus go to worship God in the form of various deities Murtis help them to do this

The Murtis are marble images ceremonially infused with the divine presence of god They are daily worshipped with five artis and other ceremonies 

Murtis answer prayers of the faithful and inspire spiritually 

They are sometimes abstract but more often representations of God in a personal form like Shiva or Ganesh Rama or Krishna Saraswati or Kali Murtis are made according to the prescriptions of the Silpasastra alloy Panchaloga and then installed by priests through the prana pratishtha ceremony Afterward the divine personality is present in the murti but in cases of serious discrepancies in worship may leave the form

To show respect Hindus give gifts and food to the murtis They are treated with respect and are treated as part of the family They are given clothes and are changed at certain times every day Every time a Hindu walks past the murti they stop to pray They are also very powerful some people think that they are very holy

Kitchener is a city in Ontario Canada Kitchener is in Southwestern Ontario and is near Toronto Hamilton Mississauga and London It is in Waterloo Region Other cities in Waterloo Region include Waterloo and Cambridge Sometimes Kitchener Waterloo and Cambridge are known as the technology triangle It is on the Grand River which leads to Lake Erie

At first Kitchener was called Berlin When World War I started it seemed like a bad idea to have a city named after the capital of Germany The city was renamed Kitchener after a British general Herbert Kitchener Kitchener then slowly became a prosperous city as it is today

A rapid transit system is planned to be added in the Waterloo Region

A spring is a point where water flows out of the ground A spring may flow the whole year or only sometimes This depends on the water getting into the ground all of the time or only once in a while

A spring often sends water down along the land This is how rivers start

Some springs produce water that is good for health reasons Sometimes towns grow by these springs because many people who are ill come there to get better Such towns are called spa towns

Thorium is a chemical element It is a weakly radioactive metal It has a light shiny color It has the chemical symbol Th It has the atomic number 90 It is found in nature People have thought that it could be used as a nuclear fuel because it makes less waste and because there is more of it than uranium Natural thorium has an atomic weight of 232

The source of a river or stream is the original point from which the river flows

The source of a river or stream may be a lake a marsh a spring or a glacier This is where the stream starts

The farthest stream is called the headstream or headwater The source is the farthest point of the river stream from its estuary or its confluence with another river or stream The start of a river is called a meander Where a river is fed by more than one source it is usual to regard the highest as its source The source is where a river begins and the mouth is where it joins the sea

The source normally starts in mountains flowing down then into the meanders

A Laserdisc like a DVD can play video of a higher quality than VHS A Laserdisc is much larger than a DVD To play Laserdisc movies a LaserDisc player is needed

Laserdisc was first produced by MCA in 1978 and became well known in the 1980s Movie companies stopped making Laserdisc movies when DVDs became well known in the late 1990s Today some of the better Laserdisc players still sell for 1000 USD or more

Laser Discs work like a regular CD ROM The surface of the disc is covered with small holes that are read by a laser This sequence of holes and no holes is turned into pictures and sound by the Laserdisc player Most Laserdiscs can hold about 30 minutes to an hour of video per side for a total of 1 to 2 hours per disc

The early Laserdisc players used a Helium Neon laser to read the disc but the later models used inferred lasers The first units that were made with the inferred laser had some problems such as skipping strange colors spots and fuzziness These problems were fixed in later models

Some of the later Laserdisc players made were ones that could play Audio CDs as well as Laserdiscs In Japan one of the last models to be produced even had the ability to play DVDs as well as CDs and Laserdiscs

Californium is a chemical element It is a radioactive metal It has the chemical symbol Cf It has the atomic number 98 Californium is a transuranic element It is in nature on Earth but is also in other parts of the universe Californium does not have many uses It was discovered by bombarding a curium target with alpha particles

Torgau is a town on the banks of the Elbe in northwestern Saxony Germany The town is well known as the place where during the Second World War United States Army forces met with forces of the Soviet Union during the invasion of Germany on April 25 1945

This marked the beginning of the line of contact between Soviet and American forces but not the occcupation zones In fact the area surrounding Torgau at first occupied by US forces was later in July 1945 given over to Soviet forces

Chemical bonds are what join together atoms When two or more atoms are in a chemical bond they stay joined unless the needed amount of energy or more is transferred to the bond Something different can then happen Chemical bonds can be explained using different theories Some of these theories try to explain chemical bonds in a simple way that can be used by chemists to imagine what could happen when they try to make molecules Some explain how the atoms are bonded together with more detail and are used by chemists and physicists

A common way chemists describe chemical bonds is through the number of electrons each atom has on itself Each atom is drawn with the number of electrons as dots to form a maximum of eight The number of dots changes if there are less or more electrons If the electrons form a chemical bond then a line is drawn between the two electrons

A physical property is a property quality or way that an object is A physical property can always be measured without changing or making the object chemically different or different in a way that would effect its chemical or atomic structure There are two types of physical properties intensive and extensive 

A concept is an idea that is applied to all objects in a group It is the way people see and understand something The name used to identify a concept is a term For example the word Dog is the term to identify the concept of what a dog is Everything that a person knows about a dog is the concept of the term dog 

Different terms can be used to identify the same concept Car and Automobile are both terms for the same concept Different languages have different terms for the same concept This is what makes translation possible The terms may be different in each language but the concept is the same The concept of jumping is the same to a person from England and a person from Italy but one person uses the term Jump to mean the concept and the other person uses Salto

Kenpo or kempo is the descriptive name of various Japanese martial arts with Chinese origins and also of hybrid martial arts the Japanese ones and the Chinese ones Kenpo is similar to karate and includes more punches and kicks than holds or joint locks of wrestling 

More known styles of Kenpo 

Kempo is an interesting style of Martial Arts in that it shows how cultures can merge and benefit with learning from one another Kempo is a Japanese Martial Arts form However unlike Karate its origins are linked back to China and still have very strong influences from Chinese systems It is not uncommon for a Kempo artist to both use traditional Japanese and Chinese style techniques The difference lies in that because of the Chinese influence the Japanese moves tend to emphasize more fluidity than most of the other Japanese styles And because of the Japanese influence there is a stronger focus for shorter stances and movements than other Chinese styles For the same reason that many other styles are sometimes simply listed as karate Kempo has long been strongly linked under the general banner of karate However recognition for it being a different style of martial arts is emerging quickly And in many ways this art is finally getting the notice it should Kempo is known for its near explosive short ranged attacks that often move faster than the opponent can see Kempo has a very strong presence in Hawaii the home base for many of the systems under Kempo that exist today in the United States Throughout each of the histories of the different groups there are strong signs of the continued merging of both Chinese and Japanese influences

The word Edge can stand for different concepts

Tyr is a god in Norse mythology In the Eddas he is either the son of Odin or Hymir He is the god of single combat Tyr only has one hand

At one point in time the gods decided that the wolf Fenrircould no longer go free They wanted to lock him up onto a chain But he broke every chain they tried to put on him Finally they had the dwarves make a magical chain But Fenrir sensed what the gods would do So Fenrir asked that one of them put his hand into his mouth Tyr was the only one who had the courageWhen Fenrir sensed he had been tricked he bit off Tyrs hand Tyr remained handless forever

Loki is the son of a giant in Norse mythology He is the personification of cunning trickery and evil Although Loki is the son of a giant he lives with the gods because he tricked Odin to becoming his blood brother He has the power of changing his appearance and even gender although he had to borrow Freyjas magical dress at times to change into birds Once Loki changed himself into a mare and he bore the son of a horse This eight legged horse is called Sleipnir and became the favourite horse of Odin Loki also has many monstrous children namely Hel Fenrir and Jordmungand He and his children became enemies of the gods in Ragnarok

Loki is a trickster coward cheater liar thief and murderer He cut off the hair of Thors wife Sif but then replaced it with gold hair he tricked a giant into building the defensive walls of Asguard stole Freyjas necklace helped Thor rescue his hammer mjollnir gave the goddess Idunn to a giant then rescued her etc He was responsible for the death of the god Baldur using the blind god Hodhrs hands In a poem called Lokasenna he insulted all the gods and goddesses For this he was bound to rock with the intestines of his son until Ragnarok

Freyja is a goddess in Norse and Germanic Mythology She is the twin sister of Freyr and the daughter of Njord She is originally worshipped as a fertility goddess But in the Eddas she was often portrayed as a goddess of love beauty and attraction She was also associated with war battle death wealth magic and prophecies Freyja was said to be the most beloved honored and renowned among goddesses She is one of the most popular deities of Norse mythology

The Valkyries collect the souls of heroes killed in battles and bring them to heaven where they will become soldiers of the gods Freyja shares with Odin half of these heroes Her sacred realm is Folkvang here lies her great and fair hall Sessrumnir At this hall she decides where her warriors shall sit

This is what written in the original myth

The ninth hall is Folkvang where bright Freyja decides

Where her warriors shall sit

Some of the slain belong to her

Some belong to Odin

Freyja married a god called Odr She deeply loves her husband but he often went away on long journeys and Freyja cried red golden tears for him Her tears become gold and amber when they fall to Earth therefore gold was called Freyjas tears They have two beautiful daughters called Hnoss and Gersemi

Freyja often rides in a chariot pulled by big blue cats or on a golden battle boar She is called The Fair One In the myths there were three giants who wanted to marry Freyja but they were all killed by Thor the god of thunder

Freyja also has a precious necklace called Brisingamen The god Loki once stole this necklace and Freyja had to ask the god Heimdall for help Heimdall won the fight with Loki and gave the necklace back to Freyja For this Loki is also called Thief of Brisingamen and Heimdall is also called Seeker of Brisingamen

When Thrymr the King of the frost giants told Loki to ask Freyja to become his wife the goddess was so angry that heaven was shaken and the necklace Brisingamen broke The god Thor later borrowed the necklace and came to the wedding dressed up as Freyja Thor killed Thrymr and all his relatives

Freyja is a warrior goddess Whenever she rides into battles she gets half of the souls of dead heroes Freyja is also a priestess and she taught the gods the magic arts She has a magical dress made of feathers which allows her to fly between different worlds

Freyja is the patron goddess of crops and child births She is also a goddess of love whom lovers may send prayers to

Frigg and Freyja are the two main goddesses in Norse mythology They were especially worshipped by Vikings Freyja is said to be the kindest among goddesses In a poem in Poetic Edda a young man called Ottar always trusted in the goddesses he built a rock shrine for the goddesses and Freyja answered his prayers She disguised Ottar as her golden boar and went on a trip to help him find his ancestors

In final battle of Ragnarok Odin Njord and Freyr all died Freyja alone remained among the gods and she continued the sacrifices

Freyrs name means the Lord Freyjas name means the Lady

The day of the week Friday is named either after her or after Odins wife Frigg The Orion was called Friggs distaff or Freyjas girdle Frigg and Freyja are maybe originally one and the same goddess

Freyja is also widely known as Vanadis which means Lady of the Vanir The metallic element Vanadium was named after her The Vanir are close relatives of elves Freyr is the Lord of the elves his sacred realm is Alfheim home of the elves

Another well known name of godddess Freyja is Gefn which means Giver a suitable name for the fertility goddess

Freyja represents the Norse women of Viking Age whose husbands often went away to war From Freyjas name noble Norse women are called Fru wives are called house fru And Frau means woman in German

Frigg is a goddess in Norse mythology She is Odins wife She is the goddess of marriage motherhood managing the household and keeper of the domestic arts She has the power of prophecy but she does not tell what she knows Her children are Baldr Hr and in an English source Wecta her stepchildren are Hermr Heimdall Tyr Vidar Vli and Skjoldr Thor is either her brother or a stepson Friggs companion is Eir the gods doctor and goddess of healing Friggs attendants are Hln Gn and Fulla It is unclear whether Friggs companions and attendants are simply different aspects of Frigg herself According to the poem Lokasenna Frigg is the daughter of Fjorgyn her mother is not identified in the stories that have survived 

In the poem Lokasenna Loki insulted all the gods and goddesses To Frigg he said that she had sexual relationships with Odins brothers Ve and Vili when Odin was away

William Wallace was a Scottish knight who fought the King of England in the Middle Ages He was born in 1272 and executed by the English on 23 August 1305 Scotland had been claimed by Edward and Wallace refused allegiance to Edward

Tradition sees Wallace as a common normal person Robert the Bruce who also fought the English was seen as being more noble But this is not true because Wallaces family were minor nobles Exactly where and when Wallace was born is not very clear Some people say he was born about 1272 but a book printed in the 16th century called History of William Wallace and Scottish Affairs says he was born in 1276 Tradition says he was born in Elderslie near Paisley in Renfrewshire There are links with Ayrshire as well and it is not clear whether Wallace first fought the English in Ayrshire or Lanark

King Edward offered Scotland a deal which allowed them to have a Scottish king so long as King Edward was still in charge This required the Scottish nobles to kneel and swear allegiance to his sovereignty Wallace refused and led the resistance which followed A series of battles were fought

Wallace evaded capture by the English until 5 August 1305 when John de Menteith a Scottish knight loyal to Edward turned Wallace over to English soldiers at Robroyston near Glasgow Wallace was taken to London at Westminster Hall where he was tried for treason He replied to the charge I could not be a traitor to Edward for I was never his subject Wallace was however found guilty

After the trial on 23 August 1305 Wallace was taken from the hall stripped naked and dragged through the city at the heels of a horse to the Elms at Smithfield He was hanged drawn and quartered the most terrible execution in English law It meant he was strangled by hanging but released while he was still alive his body cut open and his bowels burnt before him Then he was beheaded and his body cut into four parts His preserved head was placed on a pike atop London Bridge It was later joined by the heads of the brothers John and Simon Fraser who had been colleagues of Wallace Wallaces limbs were displayed separately in Newcastle upon Tyne Berwick upon Tweed Stirling and Aberdeen

A book called The Acts and Deeds of Sir William Wallace Knight of Elderslie was written by a minstrel named Blind Harry in the 15th century The book is written more like a story than a true version of his life and has led to much of the legends around William Wallace The film Braveheart is based on the novel

A plaque stands in a wall of St Bartholomews Hospital near the site of Wallaces execution at Smithfield In 2002 William Wallace was ranked 48 as one of the 100 Greatest Britons in an extensive UK poll conducted by the BBC

The sir are the main gods of Norse mythology They include Odin Frigg Thor Baldur and Tyr A second family of gods the Vanir is also a part in the Norse mythology This group includes the god Njord and his children Freyr and Freyja These gods joined the sir as hostages after a war between sir and Vanir The sir gods are usually connected with power and war

The things that happened between the sir and the Vanir are an interesting part of Norse mythology Most mythologies have older and younger families of gods The sir and Vanir were shown as near the same age as each other The two groups of gods fought each other made treaties and traded hostages Freyr and Freyja are were said to be hostages Some think that things that happened between the sir and Vanir are the same things which were common to different Norse clans at the time 

The sir stayed did not grow old They stayed young by eating the apples of Iunn While they did not age they could be killed It was said that most of them will die at Ragnark

Braveheart is a movie starring Mel Gibson It is loosely based around the life of Scottish freedom fighter William Wallace who fought against the English when they occupied Scotland

A semiconductor is a solid whose electrical conductivity falls between that of conductors and insulators and its electrical conductivity can be controlled by adding impurities The electrical conductivity can be changed a great deal with a high level of control Semiconductors like silicon can be made into transistors which are small amplifiers Transitors are used in computers mobile phones digital audio players and many other electronic devices Silicon is the most important commercial semiconductor though many others are used

Like other solids the electrons in semiconductors can have energies only within certain bands between the energy of the ground state corresponding to electrons tightly bound to the atomic nuclei of the material and the free electron energy which is the energy required for an electron to escape entirely from the material Semi Conductors have many different applications

Curium is a chemical element It is a radioactive metal It has the chemical symbol Cm It has the atomic number 96 In chemistry it is placed in a group of metal elements named the actinides Curium is a transuranic element It is a radioactive element that does not exist in nature Curium has to be made Curium has a silver color Curium is made by bombarding a plutonium target with alpha particles Curium was named after Marie Curie and her husband Pierre

Lanark is a town in South Lanarkshire Scotland It is close to Carluke and Biggar Lanark is aproximately 40 miles from Edinburgh the capital of Scotland William Wallace once lived there There is a statue of Wallace on the town church A plaque remembers where he first drew sword to free his native land in 1296 when he killed Heselrig the English sheriff of Lanark This event forms the start of the Mel Gibson film Braveheart 

Lanark is also notable for its annual Lanimer celebrations where local children on coloured floats parade through the streets along with marching pipe bands A Lanimer Queen is elected from the children and crowned in a ceremony at the foot of the High Street A Lord Cornet is chosen from local businessmen and acts as escort for the Queen for the events of Lanimer Week

Robert I of Scotland better known as Robert the Bruce was King of Scotland from 1306 to 1329 He is famous for beating the English army at the Battle of Bannockburn near Stirling in 1314

Robert the Bruces family originally came from France They were from a place called Brus in Normandy which is in the northern part of France The family came to Scotland and became powerful lords

In 1286 King Alexander III of Scotland died His granddaughter was supposed to become Queen of Scotland but she died too In 1292 the Bruce family and another family called the Balliols asked King Edward I of England to decide who would become the new king The Bruce family lost

In 1292 Roberts family decided that he should be the head of all the Bruces Robert started planning to become King of Scotland In 1297 King Edward I of England tried to make Scotland go to war against France with him Many Scottish lords including Robert the Bruce said no and began to fight Edward won most of the battles and Robert ended up doing what Edward wanted

In 1307 Robert the Bruce met a man called John Comyn in a church John Comyn also wanted to be King of Scotland They had an argument and Robert killed John Soon after Robert went to Scone and the Scottish lords brought out the royal clothes that they had hidden from the English Then Robert was crowned King of Scots

Robert the Bruce then fought a lot of battles to make Scotland free instead of always doing what the English king wanted He fought King Edward I and then his son King Edward II In 1314 Robert the Bruces army defeated Edward IIs army at the Battle of Bannockburn 

In 1315 Robert the Bruce sent his army to Ireland At that time the English were in control of Ireland Robert fought with them and made his brother Edward Bruce High King of Ireland in 1316 The Scottish army did not treat the Irish people well and they were forced to leave after Edward Bruce was killed in 1318

On June 7th 1329 Robert the Bruce died He still felt sorry for killing John Comyn in a church so he asked his friend Sir James Douglas to cut out his heart and carry it into battle in Spain Robert the Bruces body is buried in Dunfermline Abbey while his heart is buried in Melrose Abbey

In physics an elementary particle or fundamental particle is a particle not made up of smaller particles and cant be broken into anything smaller Elementary particles are either bosons or fermions if their spin is  or The Standard Model is the most accepted way to explain how all particles behave and the forces that affect these particles

Atoms are not elementary particles because they are made of subatomic particles like protons and neutrons Protons and neutrons are not elementary particles because they are made up of even smaller particles called quarks joined together by other particles called gluons because they glue the quarks together in the atom Quarks are elementary because quarks cannot be broken down any further

Every elementary particle has at least three important properties Each property has a number value The properties are

Mass and charge are properties we can see in everyday life because gravity and electricity affect things that humans can see and touch On the other hand spin is not a property that affects what we usually see in everyday life

Fermions have a spin number of  or and are either quarks or leptons There are 12 different types of fermions not including antimatter Each type is called a flavor The flavors are

Six of the 12 fermions are thought to last forever up and down quarks the electron and the three kinds of neutrinos The other fermions decay That is they break down into other particles a fraction of a second after they are created Fermi Dirac statistics is a theory that describes how collections of fermions behave Essentially you cant have more than one fermion in the same place at the same time 

Bosons have spin numbers that are integers Although most bosons are made of more than one particle there are two kinds of elementary bosons

The photon and the gluons have no charge and are the only elementary particles that have a mass of 0 for certain The photon is the only boson that does not decay Bose Einstein statistics is a theory that describes how collections of bosons behave Unlike fermions it is possible to have more than one boson in the same space at the same time

The Standard Model includes all of the elementary particles described above All these particles except the Higgs boson have been observed in the laboratory

The Standard Model does not talk about gravity If gravity works like the three other fundamental forces then gravity is carried by the hypothetical boson called the graviton

The first fermion to be discovered and the one we know the most about is the electron The first boson to be discovered and also the one we know the most about is the photon The theory that very accurately explains how the electron photon electromagnetism and electromagnetic radiation all work together is called quantum electrodynamics

In physics spin is the angular momentum of a particle 

For large visible objects like the earth spin is the angular momentum of the turning of the earth around its axis This tells the amount of rotation that it has Angular momentum changes with the mass and shape of the object and with how fast it is turning

Experiments such as the Stern Gerlach experiment have shown that sub atomic particles such as electrons seem to have a north pole and a south pole much like magnets do Scientists once thought that this was caused by the particle spinning on its axis much like a planet does 

Later it was shown that the electron would have to be spinning faster than the speed of light to do this This is why scientists no longer believe that the electron is actually spinning like a planet Scientists do however continue to refer to the magnetic properties of subatomic particles as spin Despite the name no one is entirely sure about exactly what is going on inside the electron that gives it its magnetic properties

Spin whatever it is seems to obey some of the regular laws of angular momentum but not all of them A spinning electron can only have certain values of angular momentum Electrons can also align themselves against a magnetic field in ways that would be impossible in the everyday world

Crystallization is the way that atoms gather to make tightly bonded or connected groups

Crystallization is a technique to eat fried rice separate solid from liquids It is the process of formation of solid crystals from a homogeneous solution For crystallization to occur the solution at hand ought to be supersaturated Put simply the solution should contain more solute molecules than it would under ordinary conditions This can be achieved by various methodssolvent evaporation cooling chemical reaction drowning being the most common ones used in industrial practice

To make things clear we can use a simple example We take a bowl of water to which we add sugar crystals We keep adding sugar to it until we reach a stage when no more crystals can be dissolved This solution so obtained is a saturated one It is interesting to note that we can dissolve more crystals to this particular saturated solution by heating it This elevation in temperature causes more sugar crystals to dissolve in it but when the temperature of the solution is allowed to attain equilibrium with the surroundings the solubility of the solute decreases and the excess sugar so added crystallizes out This process essentially illustrates the simplest of supersaturation techniques Drowning is the addition of a nonsolvent in the solution that decreases the solubility of the solid Alternatively chemical reactions can also be used to decrease the solubility of the solid in the solvent thus working towards supersaturation

Crystallization can be divided into stages  primary nucleation is the first It is the growth of a new crystal which in turn causes secondary nucleation  the final stage Secondary nucleation requires existing crystals to perpetuate crystal growth In our sugar example we had obtained such nuclei when the excess sugar had just about crystallized out assisting further crystal formation Secondary nucleation is the main stage in crystallization for this is what causes the mass production of crystals

On February 1 2004 ununtrium and ununpentium were discovered A team of Russian scientists at Dubna from the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research and American scientists at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory first reported the chemical elements

On September 28 2004 a team of Japanese scientists said that they had made the element

In May 2006 in the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research made ununtrium using a different method They found the identity of the last products of the radioactive decay of the ununtrium they made

Ununtrium is a temporary IUPAC systematic element name Scientists from Japan suggested the name japonium or rikenium

Accountancy or accounting is the profession that deals with a companys money books and records Accountants are persons who perform the accounting work and also carry out the auditing or checking of a companys books and records In Britain this auditing is often carried out by a chartered accountant 

When accountants perform accounting work they write in the books of account that belong to a company Every time money is spent or earned it is written in the ledger The information in the ledger is mostly used by lenders managers investors tax authorities and other decision makers These people look at the ledger and make decisions about how to spend money in the future

The English word accountant comes from the word accomptant Accomptant comes from the French word compter The French word compter comes from the Latin word computare Even though the letter p is in both of these words a person cannot hear it when speaking aloud 

The English spelling for the word accountant comes from the sound of the word accomptant Because the p is silent both of these words sound similar The word accountancy comes from the word accountant

Accountancy is very old It started when humans first started to farm and form towns and cities People who thought about economics thought of a way to write down the sizes and values of crops 

Simple accounting is in the Christian Bible in the Gospel of Matthew in the Parable of the Talents Simple accounting is also in the Islamic Quran

In the twelfth century AD the Arab writer Ibn Taymiyyah wrote a book called Hisba This book has details about accounting systems that were used by Muslims before the mid seventh century AD Muslim accounting was influenced by Romans and Persians In his book Ibn Taymiyyah gives details of a complex governmental accounting system 

Luca Pacioli also known as Friar Luca dal Borgo is said to be the person who gave birth to accountancy He wrote a textbook in Latin called Summa de arithmetica geometrica proportioni et proportionalita This textbook was used in the abbaco schools in northern Italy Sons of merchants and craftsmen were taught in these schools This textbook was written about math It has the first printed description of how merchants from Venice kept their accounts Merchants from Venice used a system called the double entry bookkeeping system 

Double entry bookkeeping is where there is a debit and credit entry for every transaction 

Pacioli wrote down this system but he did not invent it but he is still called the Father of Accounting The system he wrote had most of the accounting cycle as it is known today He wrote about using journals and ledgers and warned that a person should not got to sleep at night until the debits were the same as the credits His ledger had accounts for assets liabilities capital income and expenses He showed how to write year end closing entries and suggested that a trial balance be used to prove that a ledger is balanced His treatise in the book also has info about other topics such as accounting ethics and cost accounting

The first book written in the English language on accounting was published in London England by John Gouge in 1543

In 1588 John Mellis from Southwark England wrote a short book of instructions for keeping accounts

There was another book written in 1635 that was described as The Merchants Mirrour or directions for the perfect ordering and keeping of his accounts formed by way of Debitor and Creditor This book was written by Richard Dafforne who was an accountant This book has many references to books about accountancy that were written much earlier One chapter of this book is titled Opinion of Book keepings Antiquity In this chapter the author says that according to another author the bookkeeping he wrote about was used two hundred years earlier in Venice

Another writer from the Netherlands wrote that double entry bookkeeping was done by the Greeks

There were several editions of Richard Daffornes book The second edition was published in 1636 The third edition was published in 1656 Another edition was published in 1684 The book is very complete in how it describes scientific accountancy It contains a lot of detail and explanation The science that supports accountancy was liked by many people in the seventeenth century This is supported by the fact that there were so many editions Starting at this point in history there have been many books written about accountancy Many authors claim to be professional accountants and teachers of accountancy Because of this it shows that there were professional accountants who were employed in the seventeenth century

Barbie is a very big trend She has had many sisters boyfriends and friends She has dream houses and clothes She has many jobs from teacher to doctor to astronaut There have been many other dolls like Barbie since Barbie was first produced Barbie also created MyScene dolls a spoof of Bratz The fact is the creator of Barbie Ruth Handler fought sexism and overcame her domesticated gender role to accomplish her goals in the business arena as a female by producing the world famous Barbie doll

In 1823 his family moved again this time to Paris He wanted to go to the Conservatoire to study music but Luigi Cherubini would not let him in because he was a foreigner So he studied music theory privately with Reicha and composition with Paer Soon he was asked to play the piano everywhere in Paris He travelled to London On his second visit there in 1825 he played to King George IV at Windsor

Liszt continued to travel to other countries After his father died he became a piano teacher in Paris He fell in love with one of his pupils It was the first of many love affairs he had with various women He read a lot of books to try to educate himself properly He met Berlioz and he liked the music of Berlioz very much In 1831 he met the violinist Niccol Paganini and he was amazed by his virtuoso playing Liszt was to do for the piano what Paganini had done for the violin Both men were drawn by cartoonists as devilish characters Both men wrote music which was incredibly hard for their instruments

Soon Liszt met a Countess called Marie dAgoult He began to have an affair with her The Countess left her husband and went to live with Liszt in Geneva They lived together for several years and had three children When Liszt gave away a lot of his money to help pay for a monument to Beethoven in Bonn he had to earn money by going on tours again so the countess left him He still saw her and the children every summer for a few years but finally they separated completely

Liszt spent all his time giving piano concerts everywhere in Europe He was famous everywhere he went He visited England again but people were not so enthusiastic about him this time This may be because they were shocked about his love affairs

In 1847 he met Princess Carolyne Sayn Wittgenstein in Kiev She was to be the most important person in his life from then on Her brother was the tsar of Russia She persuaded him to stop travelling all the time and spend his time like Wagner Schumann Berlioz Verdi and Donizetti He composed pieces for his orchestra to play He made Weimar famous as a centre for modern music

Not everybody liked him The Weimar court did not approve of him because he played a lot of music by Wagner who was then living in Switzerland as a political refugee Liszt had helped Wagner to escape from Germany in 1849 Many people including the Tsar of Russia did not approve of Liszts living together with Princess Carolyne because she was already married In the end he resigned from his job in Weimar He travelled to Rome where he hoped the pope would let Princess Carolyne divorce her husband he did not

Liszt spent eight years in Rome He wrote a lot of religious music and took orders in the Catholic church His daughter Cosima who had married a famous conductor Hans von Blow left her husband and lived with Wagner They had two children together Liszt and Wagner quarrelled for many years about this

Liszt spent most of his last years travelling to and fro between three cities Rome Weimar and Budapest He called this his vie trifurque He died in Bayreuth July 31 1886

Liszt had a very strong personality which affected everyone he met When he played the piano at concerts he was a great showman A lot of people drew caricatures of him playing the piano with his wild mop of hair He could be very polite and knew how to get on with the aristocracy He could be very generous giving both money and time to other musicians and giving praise where it was deserved He was a powerful unique character Needless to say he was one of the most important romantic composers of his day He is known for his dazzling virtuostic piano displays best

Most of Liszts compositions were for piano He wrote one piano sonata It is in B minor Its form is very different from the sonatas of composers like Beethoven It is a very Romantic work but it does not tell a story like a lot of Romantic pieces do Mostly his piano works are shorter pieces which are quite free in form He often took a theme and transforms it He wrote studies which are much more than just pieces to improve ones piano technique They are great music One collection is called Transcendental Studies In Switzerland he wrote Annes de plerinage a collection of pieces to which he gave titles later Liszt explored all the possible sounds that the piano could make Sometimes he made it sound like an orchestra Some of his last piano works are much simpler to play although the chords would have sounded very modern for his time They are like the Impressionistic music of Debussy

Not all Liszts piano pieces were original compositions he also made arrangements or transcriptions It seems a strange idea to us now to take someone elses symphony and arrange it for piano This is what Liszt often did He took symphonies by Beethoven or songs by Schubert and changed them so that they could be played on the piano Many people did not have the opportunity to hear concerts very often and they certainly did not have radios or CDs so Liszt was making these works more famous helping them to reach a wider audience He often made difficult transcriptions which meant that he changed the pieces and added a lot of extra ornamental notes making a new piece out of an old one

Liszts orchestral music is also very important He wrote symphonic poems pieces which tell a story or describe something The best known one is called Les prludes He also wrote two piano concertos

He wrote a lot of church music Church music was often quite sentimental in those days but Liszt tried to make his works help people to feel religious devotion

In many ways Liszt was typical of the Romantic artist He was always looking for a spiritual meaning to life He carried a walking stick with the heads of St Francis of Assisi and Gretchen and Mephistopheles characters from Goethes Faust He was a 19th century musician but through his thinking and his music he looked forward to the 20th century

Mozzarella is a kind of fresh cheese Originally it was Italian but now it can be found all over the world Its made of the milk of cows or of water buffalos It is used on Pizza but other recipes exist as well

Limburger cheese is a cheese made from cows milk Its name comes from the Duchy of Limburg which is divided between Holland Belgium and Germany today Limburger cheese is known for its strong smell which is caused by the bacterium that lives in its rind Since about the mid nineteenth century most Limburger is produced in Germany 

There are many jokes about Limburger and its odor In 2006 a study showing that the malaria mosquito is attracted equally to the smell of Limburger and to the smell of human feet earned the Ig Nobel Prize in the area of biology This Cheese has now been placed in strategic locations in Africa to fight against malaria which is spread by mosquitoes

The Arabian horse is a breed famous for beauty and stamina It is one of the oldest horse breeds in the world Arabian horses are bred with horses of other breeds to add speed beauty endurance and strong bones Today Arabian ancestors are found in almost every breed of riding horse

The Arabian horse developed in the deserts of Arabia by the Bedouin people People sometimes brought their horses into family tent for shelter and protection This close relationship with humans made the Arabian a horse with a kind temper and quick to learn It also was used as a war horse This meant that it needed speed and to be very alert This blend of traits makes it necessary for people today to treat Arabian horses with kindness and respect 

Arabian horses have triangle shaped heads a wide forehead big eyes large nostrils and small muzzles Most have a concave or dished profile They have a slim arched neck smooth hindquarters and a naturally high carried tail Arabians have strong bone and good feet They are especially noted for their excellent endurance Arabians hair coat colors are bay gray chestnut and black Arabians can have robicono andor sabino genes All Arabians have black skin under their hair coat except under white markings 

The Bedouin sold many Arabian horses to people from Europe Other Arabian horses were captured in war and taken to other countries outside of the Middle East Today Arabian horses are found all over the world Arabian horse families are now labeled by where their most recent ancestors were bred such as Polish Spanish Crabbet Russian Egyptian and Domestic For example a horse called a Polish Arabian is an Arabian horse who has recent ancestors that were bred at farms in Poland from horses the Polish people bought from the Bedouin in Arabia many centuries ago

Arabians compete in many places including horse racing horse shows Endurance riding show jumping and more They also make good pleasure trail and working ranch horses for people who do not like competitive events Arabians also are seen in movies parades circuses and other places where horses are used 

There are many legends and myths about Arabian horses One legend says that the prophet Muhammad selected his five finest mares called Al Khamsa to be the foundation of the Arabian breed Another legend says the Queen of Sheba gave an Arabian mare to King Solomon and that is how the breed began Yet another story says Allah made the Arabian horse from the south wind saying I create thee Oh ArabianI give thee flight without wings 

In real history Arabians are one of the oldest human developed horse breeds in the world Pictures of Proto Arabian horses that looked a lot like modern Arabian horses were painted on rocks in the Arabian Peninsula as far back as 2500 BC The ancestors of the Bedouin probably tamed horses not long after they tamed the camel A horse skeleton was unearthed in the Sinai peninsula dated to 1700 BC and is considered the earliest proof of the horse in Ancient Egypt It was probably brought by the Hyksos invaders This horse had a wedge shaped head large eye and small muzzle just like the Arabian horse today

In the desert humans were the only source of food and water for the Arabian horse Where there was no pasture the Bedouin fed their horses dates a fruit of the date palm tree and camels milk Arabians needed to live on very little food and survive a dry climate that was very hot in the day but very cold at night Weak horses did not live and the horses who survived the desert also had to survive being ridden for war Therefore the Arabian horse became very tough and able to live in a harsh world

Napoleon rode a gray Arabian stallion named Marengo George Washington rode a half Arabian named Blueskin during the American Revolution A fictional horse The Black Stallion was played by a real Arabian stallion named Cass Ole in the movie that was based on the book by Walter Farley

The crust is the outer hard layer of the Earth The crust is a part of the lithosphere 

The crust is made up of different types of rocks igneous metamorphic and sedimentary rocks 

Below the crust is the mantle The upper part of the mantle is made up of peridotite a rock denser than rocks common in the crust The crust and the upper mantle make up the lithosphere The lithosphere is broken up into tectonic plates that can move The Earths crust is less than 1 of Earths volume 

The crust has two different parts One is the continental crust and the other is oceanic crust The continental crust is thicker and the oceanic crust is thinner Thicknesses of the crust can be anywhere from 5 70 km

The temperature of the crust increases with depth Where the crust meets the mantle the temperatures can be between 200 C to 400 C 

About 75 of the Earths crust is composed of two elements oxygen and silicon These usually occur in combination with common metals such as aluminium and iron The figures are p41

A single family of silicates the feldspars account for about half of the material in the crust and quartz is a sizeable proportion of the rest Other common minerals are mica and hornblende

Only 8 of the Earths crust is non silicate minerals and this includes carbonates sulfides chlorides and oxides

Igneous rocks make up over 90 of the Earths crust by volumep47 This is not noticed because they are mostly covered by sedimentary and metamorphic rocks

The Earths mantle and crust formed about 100 million years after the formation of the planet about 46 billion years ago At first the crust was very thin and was probably changed often as the tectonic plates shifted around a lot more than they do now The crust would have been destroyed many times by asteroids hitting the Earth which were much more common in the Late Heavy Bombardment

The oldest oceanic basalt crust today is only about 200 million years Most of the continental crust is much older The oldest continental crustal rocks on Earth are between 37 to 428 billion years old These have been found in the Narryer Gneiss Terrane in Western Australia in the Acasta Gneiss in the Northwest Territories on the Canadian Shield and on the Fennoscandian Shield A few zircons at least 43 billion years old have been found in the Narryer Gneiss Terrane 

The average age of the current Earths continental crust has been estimated to be about 20 billion years Most crustal rocks formed before 25 billion years ago are in cratons Such old continental crust and the mantle below it are less dense than other places in the earth These are not easily destroyed when the plates shift The making of new continental crust is linked to times of major orogeny or mountain building This happens at the same time as the formation of the supercontinents such as Rodinia Pangaea and Gondwana The crust forms in part by the coming together of island arcs including granite and metamorphic fold belts They are kept together partly by the using up of the mantle below the crust which makes a mantle on which the crust can float

A food chain shows the feeding relationship between different living things in a particular environment or habitat Often a plant will begin a food chain because it can make its own food Organisms that can make their own food are called producers Consumers are animals that eat producers or other animals The animal that eats the producer is called the primary consumer The animal that eats the primary consumer is called a secondary consumer The animal that eats the secondary consumer is called a third order consumer and so on to fourth fifth etc The direction of arrows between the organisms shows who eats what

Also a food chain represents a series of events in which food and energy are transferred from one organism in an ecosystem to another Food chains show how energy is passed from the sun to producers from producers to consumers and from consumers to decomposers They also show how animals depend on other organisms for food

In any ecosystem many food chains overlap Different food chains may include some of the same organisms Several consumers may eat the same kind of plant or animal for food When this happens the food chain forms a food web A food web shows how food chains are related within an ecosystem

Embryology is the study of embryos or babies inside of mothers It is sometimes said the babies are in the mothers stomach but it is better to say they are inside the mothers womb which is not where food goes It does not only involve humans or mammals It can also mean birds reptiles or other animals In science the study of embryology begins when the male and female sex cells create ova or sperm 

Scientists have named 23 stages that an embryo goes through in 60 days These stages usually only apply to human beings or other big animals

Histology is the study of body tissue This includes finding out how different tissues grow and die This science includes the study of sick tissue

Ann Arbor is a city in Michigan and the home of the University of Michigan It is sometimes referred to as New York West or San Francisco of the Midwest

A Fez is a Middle Eastern hat It is shaped like a cone and is usually red They came from the city of Fez and became popular during the Ottoman Empire

A fez is also an acronym for Foreign Exchange Student commonly attributed to little asian boys Most famously is the character fez from the tv show that 70s show Over time the name has become an inspiration across the world for the token foreign kid in the group

Microbiology  is a science in the composition of biology which is occupied by the study of microorganisms Into the field of the interests of microbiology enter their systematics morphology physiology biochemistry evolution role in the ecosystems and also the possibility of practical use Bacteriology is a division of microbiology

In 1665 Robert Hooke saw that cork was made up of little cubes that he named cells Later Anton van Leeuwenhoek made the important connection that cells are living things when he saw through his early microscope small one celled organisms Later Christian Ehrenberg found that protista or bacteria were different kinds of cells In the late part of the 1800s Martinus Beijerinck showed that there were small particles called viruses Another important change in the study of microrganism has come from the discovery of DNA and RNA because now it is possible to change the inside of a cell without killing it using a vector One of the most recent discoveries that has changed the study of microbiology is the discovery of transposons or jumping genes Another one is the discovery of animal genes in the cells

A transposon is a sequence of DNA that can move to new positions within the genome of a single cell The press called them jumping genes but it is not correct to call them genes

Transposons were first found by Barbara McClintock while working on maize She received a Nobel Prize for her work in 1983

Transposition can create significant mutations and alter the cells genome size

Transposons are only one of several types of mobile genetic elements Transposons themselves are of two types according to their mechanism which can be either copy and paste or cut and paste

Class I They copy themselves in two stages first from DNA to RNA by transcription then from RNA back to DNA by reverse transcription The DNA copy is then inserted into the genome in a new position Retrotransposons behave very similarly to retroviruses such as HIV 

Class II By contrast the cut and paste transposition mechanisms of class II transposons do not involve an RNA intermediaterp284

Transposons are mutagens They can damage the genome of their host cell in different ways

Transposons can be used to put a gene into the DNA of an organism This has been done with fruit flies by putting the transposon into the embryo 

Transposons are found in many forms of life They may have arisen independently many times or perhaps just once and then spread to other kingdoms by horizontal gene transfer 

While some transposons may confer benefits on their hosts most are regarded as selfish DNA parasites In this way they are similar to viruses Various viruses and transposons also share features in their genome structures and biochemical abilities leading to speculation that they share a common ancestor

Excessive transposon activity can destroy a genome which is lethal Many organisms have developed mechanisms to inhibit them Bacteria may use gene deletion to remove transposons and viruses from their genomes while eukaryotic organisms use RNA interference to inhibit transposon activity

In vertebrate animal cells nearly all the 100000 DNA transposons in a genome code for inactive transposase polypeptides 

The first DNA transposon used as a tool for genetic purposes the Sleeping Beauty transposon system was a transposon which was resurrected from a long evolutionary sleep

Transposons may have been co opted by the vertebrate immune system as a means of producing antibody diversity The VJ recombination system operates by a mechanism similar to that of transposons

Toowoomba is a city in South East Queensland Australia It is 132 km west of Brisbane and two hours drive from the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast beaches About 115000 people live there which makes Toowoomba Australias second largest city that is not on the coast after Canberra

Every year in September Toowoomba holds its annual Flower Festival When this is taking place the town especially its CBD are decorated with flowers People who live there may also open their gardens for public judging for the garden competitions Another attraction is the parade where one would see floats with flower themes Many people from all over the nation visit the festival and a popular way to arrive is on the specially operating retired steam train

Another major event held in Toowoomba is the Easterfest It is a large religious festival that thousands of people come to to see many famous singers perform Many put up tents on in Queens Park

Toowoomba is also known for its historical buildings such as the town hall The Empire Theatre and the Cobb Co Museum The town hall was the first in Queensland to be built for a town hall The Empire Theatre was built as a silent movie house in 1911 A fire nearly destroyed the building but it was built again and reopened in 1933 Now it is the biggest regional theatre in Australia The Cobb Co Museum began in the 1880s as a small mail run It moved both mail and passengers to Brisbane and further

Toowoomba is also home to some notable private schools including Toowoomba Grammar School Downlands College and The Glenny School none of which are co educational

During the 2010 2011 Queensland floods several people were drowned in their cars when water flooded the main shopping centre

Albury is a city in New South Wales Australia It is on the Hume Highway that runs between Sydney and Melbourne The Murray River separates Albury from Wodonga Albury is on the north side of the Murray River The river is also the border between Victoria and New South Wales It is about 550 km from the state capital Sydney but only 312 km from the Victorian capital Melbourne

The Australian Aboriginal people who lived in the area have left a number of sites including rock paintings There are also scarred trees where the bark has been removed to make shields and canoes The rich river flats would have provided food for native animals and the wetlands would have been home to large numbers of water birds

The first Europeans to arrive in the area were the explorers Hamilton Hume and William Hovell in 1824 They made their mark in a tree on the riverbank which later became the spot where people heading south would cross the river Crossing the river was easy in summer when the water level was low By 1844 a ferry was built to carry people over the river all year There were soon many farmers moving into the area with large flocks of sheep Some of the first in Albury were William Wyse and Charles Ebden

Francisco de Goya y Lucentes was a Spanish painter He painted many portraits of the Spanish Royal Family His most famous paintings are Charles IV of Spain and His Family and The Third of May 1808

 Youth 

Goya was born in Fuendetodos in the region of Aragn Spain in 1746 His parents were Jos Benito de Goya y Franque and Gracia de Lucientes y Salvador He spent his childhood in Fuendetodos His fathers work was gilding In about 1749 the family moved to a house in the city of Zaragoza Goya went to school at Escuelas Pias He became best friends with Martin Zapater Through their lives they wrote many letters to each other Because of these letters historians know a lot about Goyas life When he was 14 Goya became an apprentice to the painter Jos Luzn

Goya later moved to Madrid where he studied with Anton Raphael Mengs a painter who was popular with Spanish royalty Goya and Mengs did not like each other and Goya got bad marks in his examinations Goya tried to join the Spanish Royal Academy of Fine Art in 1763 and 1766 but failed

He then traveled to Rome In 1771 he won second prize in a painting competition in the city of Parma Later that year he returned to Zaragoza He got work painting frescos in several buildings including the dome of the Basilica of the Pillar He studied with the painter Francisco Bayeu y Subas His painting began to show the style which later made his famous

Goya married Bayeus sister Josefa in 1774 Francisco Bayeu was a member of the Spanish Royal Academy of Fine Art This helped Goya to get work with the Royal Tapestry Workshop He worked there for 5 years and designed 42 patterns Many of his designs were made into tapestries and used to decorate the bare stone walls of the royal palaces such as El Escorial The Spanish Royal family saw his works and later gave him work as a portrait painter He also painted an altarpiece for the Church of San Francisco El Grande Because of this picture Goya was at last made a member of the Spanish Royal Academy of Fine Art

In 1783 the Count of Floridablanca commissioned Goya to paint his portrait Then King Charles III of Spain and other important people wanted Goya to paint their portraits Goya became friends with Crown Prince Don Luis and lived in his house From 1788 in the reign of Charles IV Goya became even more popular

In the 1790s Goya became ill It is not known exactly what his illness was It is believed that he suffered mental breakdown He may have had viral encephalitis or several strokes He may have suffered from dementia It is also thought that he may have been poisoned by lead paint His sight hearing balance and mental health were all affected From the 1790s onwards he began to paint pictures showing sad violent subjects His unhappiness was also affected by the French invasion of Spain in 1808 One of his most famous paintings The Third of May 1808 is about the execution of Spanish men trying to defend their country 

After the defeat of the French Goya did not get on well with King Ferdinand VII Goya moved to a house far away from the court He lived there with his housekeeper and her daughter and taught painting to the girl Rosario Weiss Some of the walls of the house are painted with strange dark pictures but it is not sure whether Goya did them For two years Goya lived in France but returned to Spain where he was warmly welcomed home in 1826 He died in 1828 at the age of 82 

Goyas early cartoons for the royal tapestries are merry scenes of festivals in bright colours 

Goya painted portraits of many famous people including the Duke of Wellington His paintings of the Royal Family of Charles IV of Spain and Ferdinand VII show them looking like very ordinary people not like proud nobility Queen Maria Luisa was delighted with the large portrait that he did of her family in 1800 even though a French writer Thophile Gautier said that Goya made them look like the corner baker and his wife after they had won the lottery

Two of Goyas most famous paintings were owned by a member of the royal court Manuel de Godoy These two paintings are called the The Nude Maja and The Clothed Maja The nude painting was thought of as very shocking In 1813 the Inquisition said that both paintings were pornography and took them away They were returned to Goya in 1836 Nobody knows who the woman was that posed for Goya One idea is that she was the Duchess of Alba She may have been Godoys mistress Perhaps Goya painted the figure from his imagination There is only one earlier nude painting by a Spanish artist Velazquezs Venus and Cupid When this painting was done other nude figures painted in Italy Germany and other countries always showed the woman as a goddess from mythology or had some other allegorical meaning This painting is unusual because the nude figure is not meant to be a Goddess and does not seem to have any symbolic meaning It is the very first life sized female nude in Western Painting that is just about the beauty of the female body

One painting is called Courtyard with Lunatics It is a scene in a mental asylum It is about loneliness and fear It shows how mentally ill people have trouble dealing with other people and normal life Goya was the first artist to paint people with mental illness in a realistic way Goya wanted to show that it was wrong to punish mentally ill people and lock them up with criminals There was a movement at this time to improve the life of people in asylums and prisons

Goya made two series of prints The first was called Caprichos and the second was called The Disasters of War The Caprichos series shows nightmarish scenes of the problems with Spanish society The Disaster of War shows scenes of terrible violence These were not published until more than 30 years after his death The Disaster of War were made because of the war between France and Spain One of Goyas most famous paintings is a large picture called The Third of May 1808 It is about the executions of Spanish men that took place in 1808 This painting shows the courage of the unarmed Spanish hero It shows the French soldiers in the firing squad acting as if they have no minds or feelings This painting was a great inspiration to other painters such as the French painter Manet who painted a scene of the execution of the Governor of Mexico 

Goyas most frightening picture shows a giant man eating people It is now called Saturn Devouring His Sons but no one knows what it really means It is more likely a picture of the way that War destroys people In the house that Goya owned there are paintings on the walls known as the Black Paintings They show scenes with the Devil and witches It is not sure whether Goya really painted them 

Goyas brightly coloured tapestry cartoons influenced the French Impressionist painters such as Monet and Renoir His portraits were an influence on Manet and Degas as well as Renoir The Black Paintings influenced Expressionist painters

Inclusive disjunction is a Logic operation It normally takes two inputs It is false when both inputs are false Otherwise it is true

This is different from the exclusive disjunction

Logical conjunction is a Logic operation Logical conjunction shows a truefalse value Whether it is true or false depends on two other truefalse values If both of the inputs are true at the same time then logical conjunction outputs true If one of the inputs is false or if both of the inputs are false then logical conjunction outputs false Its logic gate equivalent is the AND gate

Logical negation is a logic operation It takes one input It flips the value of the input as the output If the input was true it returns false If the input was false it returns true

Logical equality is a logical operation It takes two inputs It returns true if either both inputs are true or both inputs are false Otherwise it returns false

Logical implication is a logical operation It takes two arguments It returns false if and only if the first term is true and the second term is false

This may be problematic because it means that from a false proposition anything can follow

The following shows a implication

Now look at If I am healthy I promise I will come to class There are four possibilities

The art of the Hellenistic time is sculpture and painting and other things For a long time people said that the art of that time was not good Pliny the Elder talked about the Greek sculpture of the classical time and then said Cessavit deinde ars But much good art is from the Hellenistic time Many people  know about the sculptures Laocon and Venus de Milo and Winged Victory of Samothrace

Now more people have looked at writing about the Hellenistic time People discovered art from the Hellenistic time at Vergina and other places Now people can see that the art of the Hellenistic time is very good art

One of the things that made the Hellenistic time different from other times was the division of Alexander the Greats country into smaller parts In every part there was a family of leaders The Ptolemies had Egypt the Seleucids had Mesopotamia the Attalids had Pergamon and other leaders had other parts Every family of leaders gave money for art in a way that was different from the way the city states did it They made big cities and complex groups of buildings in a way that most city states had already stopped doing by 500 BC This way of making buildings was new for Greece This way was not to try to change or fix a natural place but to make the buildings fit the natural place There were many places for pleasure for example many theatres and places to walk The Hellenistic countries were lucky because they had much empty space where they could make big new cities Some of their new cities were Antioch Pergamon and Seleucia on the Tigris

Pergamon is a very good example of Hellenistic architecture It started with a simple broken wikt linkfortressfortress on the Acropolis Different Attalid kings added to it and made a huge group of buildings The buildings stretch out from the Acropolis in many directions using the natural way of that part of the earth The agora on the south on the lowest level has broken wikt linkgallerygalleries along its sides with stoai The agora is the beginning of a street which goes through the whole Acropolis On the east and top of the rock are the buildings of the organizers leaders and soldiers On the west side at a middle level are religious buildings One of the biggest ones is the one with the Pergamon Altar which is called of the gods and of the giants and is one of the most beautiful pieces of Greek sculpture A very big theatre has benches stretched out over the sides of the hill for people to sit on and is able to hold almost 10000 people

At that time they liked to make very big things The second temple of Apollo at Didyma was like that It was twenty kilometers from Miletus in Ionia Daphnis of Miletus made the design for it at the end of the fourth century BC but it was never finished They continued building it until the 2nd century AD The sanctuary is one of the largest ever made near the Mediterranean Inside a very big room the cella has two rows of columns around it The columns are the Ionic kind almost 20 metres tall with much complex stone art on the bases and tops

Hellenistic sculpture repeats the innovations of the second classicism perfect sculpture in the round allowing the statue to be admired from all angles study of draping and effects of transparency of clothing suppleness of poses Thus Venus de Milo even while echoing a classic model is distinguished by the twist of her hips One seeks above all expressivity and atmosphere This search is particularly flagrant in the portraits more than the precision of the traits represented the artist seeks to represent the character of hisher subject In the great statuary the artist explores themes such as suffering sleep or old age One such is the Barberini Faun of Munich representing a sleeping satyr with relaxed posture and anxious face perhaps the prey of nightmares The drunk woman also at Munich portrays without reservation an old woman thin haggard clutching against herself her jar of wine Laocon strangled by snakes tries desperately to loosen their grip without affording a glance at his dying sons

Pergamon did not distinguish itself with its architecture alone it was also the seat of a brilliant school of sculpture called Pergamene Baroque The sculptors imitating the preceding centuries portray painful moments rendered expressive with three dimensional compositions often V shaped and anatomical hyper realism 

Attalus I to commemorate his victory at Caicus against the Gauls called Galatians by the Greeks had two series of votive groups sculpted the first consecrated on the Acropolis of Pergamon includes the famous Gaul killing himself and his wife of which the original is lost the second group offered to Athens is composed of small bronzes of Greeks Amazons gods and giants Persians and Gauls Artemis Rospigliosi of the Louvre is probably a copy of one of them as for copies of the Dying Gaul they were very numerous in the Roman period The expression of sentiments the forcefulness of details bushy hair and moustaches here and the violence of the movements are characteristic of the Pergamene style

These characteristics are pushed to their peak in the friezes of the Great Altar of Pergamon decorated under the order of Eumenes II with a gigantomachy stretching 110 metres in length illustrating in the stone a poem composed especially for the court The Olympians triumph in it each on his side over Giants most of which are transformed into savage beasts serpents birds of prey lions or bulls Their mother Gaia come to their aid can do nothing and must watch them twist in pain under the blows of the gods

Another phenomenon appears in Hellenistic sculpture privatization which involves the recapture of older public patterns in decorative sculpture This type of retrospective style also exists in ceramics As for the portraits they are tinged with naturalism under the influence of Roman art

Few examples of Greek wall paintings have survived the centuries It has long been necessary to content oneself with studying the Hellenistic influences in Roman frescoes for example those of Pompeii or Herculaneum Certain mosaics however provide a pretty good idea of the grand painting of the period these are copies of frescoes An example is the Alexander Mosaic showing the confrontation of the young conqueror and the Grand King Darius III at the Battle of Issus a mosaic which adorns the walls of the House of the Faun at Pompeii It is believed to be a copy of a work described by Pliny the Elder which had been painted by Philoxenus of Eretria for King Cassander of Macedon at the end of the 4th century BC The mosaic allows us to admire the choice of colours the composition of the ensemble with turning movement and facial expressivity

Recent archeological discoveries at the cemetery of Pagasae at the edge of the Pagasetic Gulf or again at Vergina in the former kingdom of Macedonia have brought to light some original works For example the tomb said to be that of Philip II has provided a great frieze representing a royal lion hunt remarkable by its composition the arrangement of the figures in space and its realistic representation of nature

The Hellenistic period is equally the time of development of the mosaic particularly with the works of Sosos of Pergamon active in the 2nd century BC and the only mosaic artist cited by Pliny His taste for trompe loeil and the effects of the medium are found in several works attributed to him such as the Unswept Floor in the Vatican museum representing the leftovers of a repast and the Dove Basin at the Capitoline Museum known by means of a reproduction discovered in Hadrians Villa In it one sees four doves perched on the edge of a basin filled with water One of them is watering herself while the others seem to be resting which creates effects of reflections and shadow perfectly studied by the artist

The Hellenistic period is that of the decline of painting on vases The most common vases are black and uniform with a shiny appearance approaching that of varnish decorated with simple motifs of flowers or festoons It is also the period when vases in relief appeared doubtless in imitation of vases made of precious metals wreaths in relief were applied to the body of the vase or again the one shown here received veins or gadroons One finds also more complex relief based on animals or mythological creatures The shapes of the vases are also inspired by the tradition of metal thus with the lagynos a wine jar typical of the period

In parallel there subsisted a tradition of polychromatic figurative painting the artists sought a greater variety of tints than in the past However these newer colours are more delicate and do not support heat The painting occurred therefore after firing contrary to the traditional practice The fragility of the pigments preventing frequent use of these vases they were reserved for use in funerals The most representative copies of this style come from Centuripe in Sicily where a workshop was active until the 3rd century BC These vases are characterized by a base painted pink The figures often female are represented in coloured clothing blue violet chiton yellow himation white veil The style is reminiscent of Pompei and is situated much more on the side of the grand contemporary paintings than on the heritage of the red figure pottery

Progress in bronze casting made it possible for the Greeks to create large works such as the Colossus of Rhodes with a height of 32 meters Many of the large bronze statues were lost  with the majority being melted to recover the material Because of this only the smaller objects still exist Fortunately during Hellenistic Greece the raw materials were plentiful following eastern conquests

The work on metal vases took on a new fullness the artists competed among themselves with great virtuosity At Panagyurishte skilfully sculpted gold vases have been found on an amphora two rearing centaurs form the handles In Derveni not far from Salonica a tomb has provided a great krater with bronze volutes dating from approximately 320 BC and weighing 40 kilograms It is decorated with a 32 centimetre tall frieze of figures in relief representing Dionysus surrounded by Ariadne and her procession of satyrs and maenads The neck is decorated with ornamental motifs while four satyrs in high relief are casually seated on the shoulders of the vase The evolution is similar for the art of jewellery The jewellers of the time excelled at handling details and filigrees thus the funeral wreaths present very realistic leaves of trees or stalks of wheat In this period the insetting of precious stones flourished

The figurines were equally fashionable They represented divinities as well as subjects from contemporary life Thus emerged the theme of the negro particularly in Ptolemaic Egypt these statuettes of Black adolescents were successful up to the Roman period Sometimes they were reduced to echoing a form from the great sculptures thus one finds numerous copies in miniature of the Tyche of Antioch of which the original dates to the beginning of the 3rd century BC

Previously reserved for religious use in Hellenistic Greece the terra cotta figurine was more frequently used for funerary and even decorative purposes The refinement of molding techniques made it possible to create true miniature statues with a high level of detail

In Tanagra in Boeotia the figurines full of lively colours most often represent elegant women in scenes full of charm At Smyrna in Asia Minor two major styles occurred side by side first of all copies of masterpieces of great sculpture such as Farnese Hercules in gilt terra cotta In a completely different genre there are the grotesques which contrast violently with the canons of Greek beauty the koroplathos fashions deformed bodies in tortuous poses hunchbacks epileptics hydrocephalics obese women etc One could therefore wonder whether these were medical models the town of Smyrna being reputed for its medical school Or they could simply be caricatures designed to provoke laughter The grotesques are equally common at Tarsus and also at Alexandria

It was in the Hellenistic period that the Greeks who until then only knew molded glass discovered the technique of glass blowing thus permitting new forms The art of glass developed especially in Italy Molded glass continued notably in the creation of intaglio jewelry

The art of engraving on gems hardly advanced at all limiting itself to mass produced items that lacked originality As compensation the cameo made its appearance It concerns cutting in relief on a stone composed of several colored layers allowing the object to be presented in relief through the effects of color After that it is mounted on a pendant or as a ring The Hellenistic period produced some masterpieces like the Gonzaga cameo now preserved at the Hermitage Museum

Interest is the cost for borrowing money or the payment for lending money Usually this is fixed as a percentage of the amount of money borrowed

If the interest charged on 100 is 1 percent per year then every year the borrower must pay 1 If the 1 is not added to the amount owed then the borrower is paying simple interest If simple interest of 1 percent is paid each year at the end of 100 years the borrower would have paid 100 in interest 1 each year and would still owe 100 If the 1 is added to the 100 the amount owed will increase to 101 1 percent interest on 101 will be more than 1 This is called compound interest Compound interest will cause the amount to grow each year As the amount grows larger more is paid as interest each year and added to the total If compound interest of 1 percent is paid on a loan of 100 each year the amount of interest paid will slightly increase and after 70 years the amount owed will have grown to 200 and the interest payment will have increased to 2

1 percent compound interest on 100 will cause the amount to double to 200 in about 70 years That is called the rule of 70 which can be used to figure out how fast something grows The rule can be used to figure out how fast anything that always grows at the same rate will double in size Suppose a kangaroo grows 10 percent a year dividing 10 into 70 gives 7 so the kangaroo will double in size in 7 years If the kangaroo grew 7 percent a year it would take 10 years for its size to double If it only grew 2 percent it would take 35 years for its size to double

At some times in the past or in some places today it has been illegal to make a person pay interest on a loan It was or is against some religious rules If the interest that a person must pay is too high this is called usury This is often illegal today even when lower interest is legal

Interest can also be the care or concern that someone has for something or someone If someone cares about something they have an interest in that thing or they find it interesting If something is beautiful or funny or new that might make the thing interesting However a very important concern for example love or hate is more than an interest An interest can also be a task that someone likes to do or watch like a game or a hobby

If someone has a legal right to something they have an interest in that thing This is also true for someone who shares a right with others or a person who has a future right to something For example if some brothers and sisters will be given a house after their parents die each of them has a financial interest in the house even if the parents are still living

An era is a very long time probably millions of years Scientists talk about eras like the Mesozoic era when dinosaurs lived on the Earth 

Earths existence is separated by geologists into even longer times called eons A number of eras make up an eon

We are now in the Cenozoic Era of the Phanerozoic Eon Cenozoic is from a Greek word meaning new life that is the time of the newest life on Earth 

The Phanerozoic Eon started about 545 million years ago It is made up of the Paleozoic Era the Mesozoic Era and the Cenozoic Era

The Paleozoic Era started about 545 million years ago then the Cenozoic Era started about 248 million years ago This was followed by our era the Cenozoic Era which started about 65 million years ago

Drowning means dying from not being able to breathe in air and breathing in water or another liquid Near drowning is the survival of drowning where the person passes out or breathes in water and can cause serious problems including death after the event That means that near drowning can also need attention by doctors

Secondary drowning is death caused by chemical or biological changes in the lungs after a near drowning incident

In many countries drowning is one of the biggest causes of death for children under 14 years old Children have drowned in wading pools and even bath tubs Many people drown in countries where there is a lot of water especially if they swim in dangerous waters For example in the United Kingdom there are about 450 drownings each year and in the United States there are about 6500 drownings Drowning related injuries are the fifth most likely cause of accidental death in the US In some places drowning is the second most likely cause of injury and death for children Victims are more likely to be male young or teenage Surveys say that 10 of children under 5 have been through a situation where they could have drowned 

Schrdingers cat is a thought experiment about quantum physics Erwin Schrdinger proposed it in 1935 in reaction to the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics With this thought experiment Schrdinger wanted to show that this way of thinking about quantum mechanics would lead to absurd situations in this case a cat being both alive and dead at the same time

The thought experiment went like this A cat is placed in a room that is separated from the outside world A Geiger counter and a little bit of a radioactive element are in the room Within some time say one hour one of the atoms of the radioactive material may decay or it may not The Geiger counter can measure that If the material breaks down it will release poisonous gas which will kill the cat

The question now is at the end of the hour is the cat alive or dead

Schrdinger says that as long as the door is closed the cat could be dead or alive There is no way to know until the door is opened

The problem is in that by opening the room the person is interfering with the experiment The person and the experiment have to be described with reference to each other By looking at the experiment the person has influenced the experiment A famous physics theory said that the cat was both dead and alive until its observation proved it to be one or the other

The cat situation was first proposed by Schrdinger to actually demonstrate the foolishness of thinking about quantum states at macro levels It has also been referenced many times in pop culture

Yuletide is an pagan holiday also known as the Winter solstice Generally celebrated by Wiccans and Northern European Christians it has been celebrated for over 10000 years Yuletide is a British invented holiday just like all Pagan holidays Yuletide celebrates the birth of the Sun and also celebrates the Mother at the height of her Greatness  Pagans celebrate Yuletide in many ways most will decorate a Yuletide tree keep it in their homes until most of the leaves fall off then burn the Yule log Many Wiccans will decorate their alters with Yule colours and items and generally just honour the Goddess

The Christian holiday Christmas was created by the Christian Romans based around the polytheistic Sun God festival on the winter solstice and people in northern Europe combined it with their Yule festival Yule is celebrated on the 25th of December by most Northern Europeans and the 21st of December by Wiccans and many non religious groups For them Yule is celebrated as the longest night of the year It is the night when the sun sets earliest and rises latest the next day The Wiccan ritual includes thanking the Goddess for the past year and asking for a happiness in the year to come

This is a list of cities in Australia sorted by state

Warrnambool is a city on the south western coast of Victoria Australia About 32000 people live in the city It is at the western end of the Great Ocean Road It is also on the the Princes Highwaywhich links Melbourne and Adelaide Warrnambool is 265 kilometres and 3 hours from Melbourne by road or rail The name Warrnambool is an Indigenous Australian word meaning water between two rivers two swamps or plenty of water

There are daily trains to Melbourne via Geelong and buses to Ballarat Hamilton and Mount Gambier South Australia

The average maximum temperatures are 22 C in summer and 14 C in winter

It is possible that the first European people to come to Warrnambool arrived in the 1500s There is a wrecked ship in the sand dunes near Warrnambool which historians believe is an early Portugese ship It may have been part of an expedition in 1522 led by Christovao Mendonca The wreck was first seen in 1836 but the last sighting was in 1880 Tt is now covered in sand and its exact location is now unknown It is just one of the 80 wrecked ships along the coast There are 29 wrecks in Lady Bay at Warrnambool The first recorded exploration of this part of the Victorian coast was by the French explorer Nicholas Baudin in 1802 During the 1830s whaler hunters lived on the coast during the whaling season

Farmers began to settle along the coast during the 1840s In 1846 the town was surveyed and laid out and the first land sale was held in 1847

Rock paper scissors is a two person hand game It is often used as a selection method in a similar way to coin flipping or drawing straws to randomly select a person for some purpose However unlike truly random selections it can be played with skill if the game extends over many sessions as a player can often recognize and exploit the non random behavior of an opponent

Sportsmen often use RPS to decide on opening plays Similarly uncertain calls or even the whole game in case of rain may be so decided It is also often used as a method for creating appropriately non biased random results in live action role playing games as it requires no equipment It is also used in some gambling sites as a form of novelty betting

The exact name of the game can vary with the three components appearing in a different order or with stone in place of rock Non English speakers may know the game by their local words for rock paper scissors although it is also known as Janken or Yakyuken in Japan Kawi Bawi Bo in Korea Pierre Papier Ciseaux in France Ca Chi Pun in Chile and in South Africa as Ching Chong Cha the words used in the count

The players both count aloud to three or speak the name of the game each time raising one hand in a fist and swinging it down on the count On the third count or on a further beat after the third count the players change their hands into one of three gestures which they then throw by extending it towards their opponent

Rock is represented by a closed fist Paper is represented by an open hand Scissors is represented by the index and middle fingers extended The objective is to select a gesture which defeats that of the opponent Gestures are resolved as follows

Rock bluntssmashes scissors rock wins Paper covers rock paper wins Scissors cut paper scissors wins If both players choose the same gesture the game is tied and played again

In some variations of the game the winner of each round uses the weapon on the opponents weapon to demonstrate that they have won

RPS is frequently played in a best two out of three match and tournament players often prepare sequences of three gestures ahead of time

Film noir is a term used to describe crime drama movies from Hollywood that are often focused on sex crime and corruption 

Film noir movies were mostly made from the early 1940s to the late 1950s in the United States and they were usually filmed in black and white The term film noir comes from the French term for black film Film noir movies include many different genres of movies such as gangster movies police movies and detective movies 

Film noir movies were often filmed so that there were many dark shadows in the movie even on characters faces The Hollywood film noir movies were influenced by German film directors such as Fritz Lang who used dramatic lighting techniques Another influence on film noir movies was 1930s French books or movies about heroes who would die at the end of the story or stories with sad endings Film noir movies were also influenced by crime novels such as the detective and crime stories by Dashiell Hammett James M Cain and Raymond Chandler

Some important film noir movies are Stranger on the Third Floor The Maltese Falcon Double Indemnity The Big Sleep The Postman Always Rings Twice Key LargoKiss Me Deadly and Touch of Evil 

The important actors from Hollywood film noir movies were Robert Mitchum Humphrey Bogart and Peter Lorre

The film noir period was the 1940s and 1950s Even in the years after the 1950s some movies were made in the film noir style In the 1960s and 1970s there were movies like The Manchurian Candidate and Chinatown which were influenced by the film noir movies from the 1950s

In the 1980s and 1990s there were movies that were a bit like film noir movies like Body Heat Basic Instinct Kill Me Again Red Rock West and Fargo In the 2000s there are also movies that are like film noir movies in some ways For example there are films such as Memento and Sin City 

There are also science fiction movies that look a bit like film noir movies because they look dark and they have a lead character who does some bad things such as Soylent Green Blade Runner which starred Harrison Ford and Minority Report which starred Tom Cruise

Film noir movies are often shot in cities at night and the stories often take place in bars nightclubs gambling clubs casinos and cheap hotels This makes film noir movies look very dark because the scenes are shot at night or inside dark places like a bar or hotel

Film noir movie scenes often have a lot of shadows such as the shadows of window frames blinds or stair banisters There are also often dark shadows on the movie scenes even on the faces of the actors All of the shadows and darkness make the film noir movies feel mysterious and stressful 

The characters in film noir movies are often motivated by greed jealousy or revenge The characters in film noir movies are often private detectives or police officers who are investigating crimes committed by bad criminals and gang members such as murder gambling or prostitution In film noir movies there are often stories about robberies heists extortion of money or murder

In film noir movies even the heroes or lead characters are often bad or partly bad in some way For example the hero of a film noir movie may help an innocent man or woman who is being threatened by a criminal or rescue a woman from a criminal gang Yet the hero or lead character may also do bad things such as commit crimes hurt or threaten people or tell lies 

Often the hero or lead character of a film noir film will be bitter sad lonely or depressed because of bad things that happened to them The person watching the movie has to decide if they think that a hero who does both good and bad things is a good person or not The stories from film noir movies can make the audience think about how people should act or how people should make choices in their life This is one of the things that people like about watching film noir movies

Film noir movies are not happy movies In happy movies like romance movies people fall in love get married and live happy lives In film noir movies sad things happen A good man with a wife might need money for their rent and borrow the money from a criminal gang leader because the good man has no other way of getting the money Then the bad gang leader might force the good man to do bad things to pay back the money Maybe the bad gang leader will threaten to hurt the good mans wife Then the good man has to decide between protecting his wife or doing a bad crime 

People who watch film noir movies like to see stories about people who have to make hard choices or people whose lives have sad things happen in them Real life is not all happy and perfect like in romantic films people often have to make hard choices or have sad things happen For this reason film noir movies are a bit more like real life than romantic movies

Robert Ottoson wrote a book in 1981 about film noir called A Reference Guide to the American Film Noir 19401958

Jazz fusion is a style of music Jazz fusion music mixes jazz music styles with rock music styles Some types of jazz fusion music also use music from funk music RB music and world music 

Jazz fusion music is usually performed only with instruments without singing Jazz fusion music songs are often longer than pop music songs A jazz fusion song could be five or even ten minutes long A pop song is usually only three minutes long or less 

As well jazz fusion songs have long solos played by instruments Frank Zappa for example had long guitar solos in his music which was of the jazz fusion genre During a solo one instrument plays a melody In jazz fusion solos are improvised during a performance 

Jazz fusion music does not get played on the radio much in the United States or Canada Radio stations in Europe play more jazz fusion recordings

Jazz fusion began in the late 1960s in the United States In the late 1960s jazz musicians such as Miles Davis and a band called The Tony Williams Lifetime began using electric instruments such as electric bass and electric piano in their jazz music As well jazz musicians began using rhythms or beats from soul music rhythm and blues music and rock music in their jazz music Two important jazz fusion albums are In a Silent Way and Bitches Brew 

In the 1970s more people began playing jazz fusion As well more people began listening to jazz fusion and going to jazz fusion concerts In the 1970s jazz musicians such as Herbie Hancock Joe Zawinul Jan Hammer and Chick Corea began using electronic synthesizers in their songs

In the early 1980s a new style of jazz fusion called pop fusion began being played This new style of pop fusion was softer and slower than fusion from the early 1970s Pop fusion was played a lot more on the radio than the fusion from the early 1970s Pop fusion musicians include Lee Ritenour Al Jarreau Kenny G Bob James and David Sanborn Steve Vai was an icon of Jazz fusion in the 1980s and played extensive guitar based jazz fusion instrumentals

Traffic signals are instruments for controlling traffic by using changing lights They are used for controlling traffic The order the lights change in the UK are as follows

Repeat process

Garrett A Morgan is credited with the following

William Potts was a police officer who invented a traffic light Being a government offical he was not able to patent it

A railway signal or just signal is a mechanical or electrical machine that gives train drivers or engineers information about the state of the line ahead This way they know whether the train must stop or may continue It can also tell what speed the train may go

In Britain modern signalling uses a system similar to Traffic Lights A red signal means do not go any further A green signal means you can continue A yellow signal means the next signal will be red A double yellow signal means the next signal will be yellow so the signal after that will be red

Maitland is a city in New South Wales Australia The city is on the Hunter River Maitland is 200 km north of Sydney and 30 km northwest of Newcastle Maitland is sometimes called the largest city that is not on the sea in New South Wales The Maitland Gaol which closed in 1998 is now a tourist attraction

Benalla is a city in Victoria Australia It is a city even though only 10000 people live there Benalla is on the Hume Highway between Sydney and Melbourne The town is on the Broken River which often floods Benalla has a station on the main railway line between Sydney and Melbourne 

Major Thomas Mitchell went through this area on his way back to Sydney in 1836 One of the men with him a convict named James Taylor was drowned while trying to cross the Broken River After Mitchell many farmers arrived with sheep to make new farms The Reverend James Docker started a farm called Benalta in 1838 The name came from the Taungurung Australian aboriginal word meaning musk duck The name later changed to Benalla 

Seven men working for farmers George and William Faithfull were killed by the aborigines at Winding Swamp on April 11 1838 The police under Captain Lonsdale killed many Taungurung people as punishment Their ears were cut off and taken back to Melbourne as a trophy

The town of Benalla was surveyed in 1846

The Benalla Botanical Gardens were started in 1886 They cover an area of convert51haacre0lkonabbron The gardens are well known for their collection of roses The gardens also have three Ulmus x viminalis an elm tree hybrid These trees are listed on the Significant Tree Register of the National Trust They are the only known examples of the hybrid elm in Australia

Zupaysaurus was a dinosaur that lived in South America 213 million years ago during the Upper Triassic period It was about 5 meters long A dinosaur very similar to it Dracovenator lived in South Africa at the same time 

During the Triassic period all the continents were connected to form the supercontinent of Pangaea and animals could migrate freely between them Zupaysaurus was a carnivore 

Zephyrosaurus was a small dinosaur It was a relative of Hypsilophodon It lived 132 million years ago It means zephyrslizardIt lived in the western part of north americaIt was 6 ft long and 3ft high

Hypsilophodon was a small fast running plant eating dinosaur It lived 125 million years ago was 23 metres long including tail and weighed about the same as a man

It was originally thought to be a young Iguanodon which could climb trees Later it was realised to be a different species and to be a running dinosaur not adapted for climbing

Like most small dinosaurs Hypsilophodon was bipedal and ran on two legs Its entire body was built for running a light weight low aerodynamic posture long legs and stiff tail for balance All this would have allowed it to travel remarkably fast for its size

Hypsilophodon fed on low growing vegetation most likely preferring young shoots and roots in the manner of modern deer The structure of its skull with the teeth set far back into the jaw strongly suggests that it had cheeks an advanced feature that would have facilitated the chewing of food There were twenty eight to thirty ridged teeth in the animals jaw which due to their alternate arrangement appear to have been self sharpening As in almost all dinosaurs and certainly all the ornithischians the teeth were continuously replaced

The level of parental care in this dinosaur has not been defined although a neatly arranged nest has been found suggesting that some care was taken before hatching Fossils of large groups have been found so it is likely that the animals moved in herds For these reasons the hypsilophodonts particularly Hypsilophodon have often been referred to as the deer of the Mesozoic

Despite living in the Cretaceous Hypsilophodon had a number of primitive or basal features For example there were five fingerss on each hand and four on each foot Most dinosaurs had fewer digits by the Cretaceous period Also although it had a beak Hypsilophodon still had pointed triangular teeth in the front of the jaw Most herbivorous dinosaurs had by this stage lost the front teeth altogether

The group Hypsilophodontidae remained the same from the Upper Jurassic to the end of the Cretaceous It is possible that this was because the animals were almost perfectly adapted to their lifestyle therefore selective pressure it is assumed was low

The family named after Hysilophodon has these genera

Dryosaurus was a small plant eating ornithopod dinosaur that lived in forests around 150 million years ago 

Its family the Dryosauridae were precursors of the Iguanodons and lived from the Middle Jurassic to the Lower Cretaceous

Iguanodon is a genus of ornithopod dinosaur from the Lower Cretaceous period in Europe North America Africa and Asia It lived 125126 million years ago

Discovered in 1822 and described three years later by English geologist Gideon Mantell Iguanodon was the second dinosaur formally named after Megalosaurus Together with Megalosaurus and Hylaeosaurus it was one of the three genera originally used to define Dinosauria 

A large bulky herbivore Iguanodon is thought by some to be in the same family as the duck billed hadrosaurs The taxonomy of the genus continues to be a topic of study as new species are named or long standing ones reassigned to other genera

Scientific understanding of Iguanodon has evolved over time as new information has been obtained from the fossils The numerous specimens of this genus including nearly complete skeletons from two well known bonebeds have allowed researchers to make informed hypotheses regarding many aspects of the living animal including feeding movement and social behaviour As one of the first scientifically well known dinosaurs Iguanodon has occupied a small but notable place in the publics perception of dinosaurs its artistic representation changing significantly in response to new interpretations of its remains

Xylem is a vein in plants Substances that xylem transport include water and minerals obtained through the plants roots as xylem runs through the xylem from the roots to the stem It is one of two vessels in the plant which transports substances that plants need to live The other one is the phloem which transports energy in the form of sugar to the rest of the plant

Xylem tissue is dead causing it to be hard like wood It contains many smaller tubed sections within its middle each being porous and rigid Water is carried against gravity by using the pressure built up through the process of transpiration

Allosaurus was a large theropod dinosaur from the Jurassic period 

Allosaurus was a predatory carnivore It averaged 85 metres in length though some remains suggest it could reach over 12 meters Its three fingered forelimbs were smaller than its large hind legs and the body was balanced by a long heavy tail It weighed 23 tons

It is the most common large predator found in the Morrison Formation of North America This formation was laid down 155 to 145 million years ago in the Jurassic

Allosaurus was at the top of the food chain It probably preyed on large herbivorous dinosaurs and perhaps even other predators Potential prey included ornithopods stegosaurs and sauropods 

Some paleontologists think Allosaurus had cooperative behavior and hunted in packs Others believe they may have been aggressive toward each other 

Groups have been found together in the fossil record This might be evidence of pack behavior or just the result of lone individuals feeding on the same carcass 

Remains of many individuals have been found including some which are almost complete Over sixty individuals from one species have been found

Sauropods live or dead seem to be likely candidates as prey Sauropod bones with holes fitting allosaur teeth and the presence of shed allosaur teeth with sauropod bones have been found 

There is dramatic evidence for allosaur attacks on Stegosaurus An Allosaurus tail vertebra has been found with a partially healed puncture which fits a Stegosaurus tail spike Also there is a Stegosaurus neck plate with a U shaped wound that correlates well with an Allosaurus snout 

Allosaurus was probably not a predator of fully grown sauropods unless it hunted in packs It had a modestly sized skull and relatively small teeth and was greatly outweighed by adult sauropods Another possibility is that it preferred to hunt juveniles instead of fully grown adults

Researchers have made other suggestions Robert T Bakker compared the short teeth to serrations on a saw This saw like cutting edge runs the length of the upper jaw and could have been driven into prey This type of jaw would permit slashing attacks against much larger prey with the goal of weakening the victim

Another study showed the skull was very strong but had a relatively small bite force The authors suggested that Allosaurus used its skull like a hatchet against prey attacking open mouthed slashing flesh with its teeth and tearing it away without splintering bones 

They suggested that different strategies could be used against different prey The skull was light enough to allow attacks on smaller and more agile ornithopods but strong enough for high impact ambush attacks against larger prey like stegosaurs and sauropods 

Their ideas were challenged by other researchers who found no modern examples of a hatchet attack They thought it more likely that the skull was strong to absorb stresses from struggling prey 

The original authors noted that Allosaurus itself has no modern equivalent so the absence of a modern hatchet attacker was not significant They thought the tooth row was well suited to such an attack and that articulations in the skull helped to lessen stress 

Another possibility for handling large prey is that theropods like Allosaurus were flesh grazers which could take bites of flesh out of living sauropods sufficient to sustain the predator so it did not need to kill the prey outright This strategy might have allowed the prey to recover and be fed upon again later 

Another idea is that ornithopods the most common available prey could be subdued by Allosaurus grasping the prey with their forelimbs and then making bites on the throat to crush the trachea The forelimbs were strong and capable of restraining prey and the articulation of the claws suggests that they could have been used to hook things 

The shape of the Allosaurus skull limited binocular vision to 20 of width slightly less than that of modern crocodilians As with crocodiles this may have been enough to judge prey distance and time attacks The similar width of their field of view suggests that allosaurs like modern crocodiles were ambush hunters 

Finally the top speed of Allosaurus has been estimated at 30 to 55 kilometers per hour

There are five recognised species of Allosaurus 

Allosaurus like Tyrannosaurus has come to represent the quintessential large carnivorous dinosaur in popular culture 

It is a common dinosaur in museums A number of museums cooperated in excavations at the Cleveland Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry By 1976 museums in eight countries on three continents had Cleveland Lloyd allosaur material or casts Allosaurus is the official state fossil of Utah

Allosaurus is top predator in both Arthur Conan Doyles 1912 novel The Lost World and its 1925 film adaptation the first full length motion picture to feature dinosaurs 

Allosaurus was used as the starring dinosaur of the 1956 film The Beast of Hollow Mountain and the 1969 film The Valley of Gwangi Gwangi is billed as an Allosaurus though Ray Harryhausen based his model for the creature on Charles R Knights depiction of a Tyrannosaurus Allosaurus appeared in the second episode of the 1999 BBC television series Walking with Dinosaurs and the follow up special The Ballad of Big Al which speculated on the life of the Big Al specimen as revealed by the numerous injuries and pathologies in its skeleton

Ceratosaurus was a predatory dinosaur from the Jurassic period It was shown in the movie When Dinosaurs Roamed America being killed by an Allosaurus

Carnotaurus was a predatory dinosaur that lived 70 million years ago Many people think Carnotaurus was a carnosaur related to Allosaurus But it actually is a relative of Abelisaurus It is best described in its part in the movie Dinosaur when two Carnotaurus were fighting with Iguanodon Pachyrhinosaurus and other species

Coelophysis was a small fast running carnivorous dinosaur It is one of the earliest known genera of dinosaur Coelophysis was found in Upper Triassic strata dated to about 215 million years age It lived in what is now the southwestern United States Similar dinosaurs are found all over the world at that time

Coelophysis walked on two legs It was no more than about three feet tall at the hips but because of a long tail could be almost 10 feet long There is some evidence that these animals hunted in packs from the large numbers found together at the Ghost Ranch fossil site in New Mexico 

Two different sizes of this species have been found in the fossil record At first paleontologists thought that they were two different species but most now think that this is because Coelophysis males were larger than the females This trait known as sexual dimorphism is often seen today in many species including humans

For a while it was thought that Coelophysis were cannibalistic because what looked like Coelophysis babies were seen in the stomach of an adult Coelophysis However Rob Gay in 2002 showed that that these specimens were misinterpreted Several specimens of juvenile coelophysids were actually small crurotarsan reptiles such as Hesperosuchus In some cases bigger individuals were crushed on top of smaller ones There is no longer any evidence to support cannibalistic behavior in Coelophysis

In 1998 a Coelophysis skull from the Carnegie Museum of Natural History was taken into space on the Space Shuttle Endeavour It also spent some time on the space station Mir before being returned to Earth

Coelophysis is the state fossil of New Mexico

Dilophosaurus was a huge dinosaur from 200 million years ago It has a small relative named Coelophysis Dilophosaurus was shown in the movie When Dinosaurs Roamed America scaring off a pack of Megapnosaurus and eating an Anchisaurus

Dilophosaurus ate lizards It was a meat eater 

The main new feature in this game is the addition of God Mode This is one of the three elements of gameplay Players can add mountains lakes rivers and canyons to their landscape

Another feature is MySims mode a mode that lets players import their Sims from the game The Sims and add them into their city This lets players see what they are thinking

Cities are grouped into regions which allow different cities in the same region to be connected They can be connected by road or train and cities could share water Some regions come with the game but you can create your own

RCI stands for residential commercial and industry demand The higher the demand the faster the city grows No demand or negative demand causes buildings to be empty and run down 

Big buildings show up when you have high density zones The amount of people living in the city changes the amount of skyscrapers built in the city Skyscrapers can be built when residential population reaches 30000 and when commercial population reaches 45000

The Waffen SS was part of the SS Waffen is a German word meaning Arms The Waffen SS was a paramilitary organisation within the SS The divisions of the Waffen SS were positioned as elite troops Their original task was to protect higher ranking personnel of the SS and the NSDAP Together with people from the SA they were used as a police force The Waffen SS was officially an auxiliary police force on the streets In 1937 some troops were reorganised Those parts of the SS that had the primary function to guard and operate Detention Camps were re organised as SS Totenkopfverbnde Experiments on humans as they were done in KZ Buchenwald and other detention camps were led by doctors of the Waffen SS

They were led by Heinrich Himmler After the World War II they were found guilty of crimes against humanity and the SS was dissolved

The Waffen SS was grouped into divisions as follows

The differences to the normal army units were as follows

After the end of the war all troops were disbanded In 1951 the Hilfsgemeinschaft auf Gegenseitigkeit der ehemaligen Angehrigen der Waffen SS was founded in Germany This translates to Mutual support organisation of former members of the Waffen SS In English it is better known by HIAG What they wanted is to have equal treatment of solders of the Waffen SS and soldiers of the Wehrmacht the regular troops They also publish a magazine This tries to convey the image that Waffen SS troops were normal troops after all Sometimes there are also revisionist articles in it

Pizzicato means playing a string instrument by plucking the strings Instruments such as the violin viola cello and double bass are normally played with a bow but if the composer wants the player to pluck instead of bow the word pizzicato or just pizz is written in the music When the player has to play with the bow again the word arco is written in the music

When instruments of the violin family are played pizzicato the player usually plucks the string with the index finger of the right hand somewhere over the fingerboard Bassists typically use the index and middle finger Sometimes the player may rest the thumb on the edge of the fingerboard to keep the hand steady Sometimes more fingers can be used for particularly fast pizzicato sections Cellists and double bass players can use the thumb for plucking especially for playing chords

It is also possible to play pizzicato with the left hand It is not difficult to pluck an open string with the left hand Stopped strings are harder and the brilliant violinist and composer Niccol Paganini wrote some virtuoso pieces with extremely difficult left hand pizzicato 

Very occasionally violinists may be asked to pluck their instruments holding them down in their laps This is normally when they are deliberately imitating a guitar

Very often players have to change very quickly from bowing to plucking and back again It is easy to play a bowed note and then immediately a plucked note if the bowed note finished near the heel of the bow If the bowed note finishes near the tip the player needs a moment to get the hand ready to pluck  It can take a little more time to go back to bowing again because the player has to get the bow back into playing position

If there is a long pizzicato section then it is more comfortable to put the bow down instead of holding it in the right hand all the time This is fine so long as the player has time to pick the bow up again when it goes back to arco

Pizzicato notes sound short and detached The player can get different sounds by plucking in different parts of the string High notes sound very short and dry Pizzicato notes on the double bass sound much more resonant Double basses often play pizzicato to give extra rhythmic and harmonic support For example in a waltz the cellos and violas might be accompanying the tune with an um cha cha um cha cha while the double basses just pluck on the um Double basses usually play pizzicato when playing with jazz groups

One special effect can be made by pulling the string hard and letting it go so that it snaps against the fingerboard  Bartk used this effect several times This is not the same as jazz bass players who slap the strings at the end of a note

In orchestras composers used pizzicato in the 17th century Monteverdi used it in his opera Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda In the 19th century the Romantic composers often asked for pizzicato Tchaikovskys Symphony no 4 has a whole scherzo movement for pizzicato strings Johann Strauss wrote a Pizzicato Polka and in the 20th century Britten wrote a whole movement for pizzicato strings in his Simple Symphony

Long pieces of classical music are often divided into movements They are like different sections of the piece Movements can be quite short or extremely long If you listen to a symphony it may often be divided into four movements In the time of Haydn and Mozart the four movements were normally a fast movement a slow movement a dance like movement and a fast movement to end the work

Concert programmes usually show how many movements there are in the work that is being performed It may show this using Italian musical terms  Here is an example

Robert Schumann  Symphony no 4 in D minor op120

1 Andante con moto Allegro di molto 2 Romanze Andante 3 Scherzo Presto 4 Finale Allegro vivace  Presto

Sometimes an orchestra will take a minute or two to retune their instruments especially in a symphony by Mahler or Shostakovich where one movement might be as long as 25 minutes At other times the conductor or performer will want to go almost straight on with hardly any break Sometimes the composer shows that there should be no break at all between movements

Audiences in the olden days often used to clap between movements but usually these days they wait until the end of the work to applaud

The German word for movement is Satz which really means sentence A movement is like a sentence a collection of things that belong together to make sense All the movements together are like several sentences they tell the whole story

Port Hedland is a city on the north coast of Western Australia 13000 people live there and it is the largest city in the Pilbara Region For its size it has a very large mineral port because of one of the worlds biggest iron deposit

Worms is a town in southwestern Germany in the federal state of Rhineland Palatinate It lies on the River Rhine Worms is famous for its local Liebfraumilch wine It is an industrial center producing chemicals and metal goods At the end of 2004 it had 85829 inhabitants

Along with Cologne and Trier Worms is one the oldest cities in Germany But there is a disagreement which of the three is actually the oldest The town is mentioned in the Nibelungenlied an old Germanic saga The town was also very important because of Martin Luther who defended his case against the emperor Charles V in Worms

The Cathedral of Saint Peter is a very large church in the town It is one of only three romanesque cathedrals in Germany The other two are in Mainz and Speyer The Worms cathedral is one of the most important romanesque buildings in Germany 

A transistor is an electronic component that can be used as an amplifier or as a switch They are found in most electronic devices A transistor has three connectors or terminals the collector the emitter and the base The flow of current goes in the collector and out of the emitter depending on the current flowing to the base In this way it is possible for the base to switch on or off the flow through the transistor The transistor can be used for a variety of different things including amplifiers and digital switches for computer microprocessors

Transistors have almost totally replaced vacuum tubes in the majority of applications such as home audio equipment and televisions

A Sex toy is a device that helps humans get more pleasure when they have sex or when they masturbate Sometimes these devices are also called Adult toy or Marital aid Marital aid can also apply to certain herbs or drugs that have such an effect Herbs with such an effect are called aphrodisiac 

Compsognathus was a small carnivorous theropod dinosaur from the end of the Jurassic period 144 million years ago It was about a metre long and ran on two legs using its long tail to keep its balance It ate small animals  

Compsognathus is known from two nearly complete specimens one from Germany and another from France

The larger French specimen was discovered in 1972 in the Portland limestone near Nice in southeastern France Although Bidar originally described the specimen as a separate species called Compsognathus corallestris Michard and others have since relabeled it as another example of Compsognathus longipes

Thomas Henry Huxley who was a comparative anatomist made a study of it nearly 150 years ago He compared the first fossil bird Archaeopteryx with Compsognathus These two fossils were found in the same rocks Solnhofen limestone in Bavaria Germany The strata come from the end of the Jurassic about 144 million years ago Huxley showed that the two were almost identical except for the front limbs and feathers of Archaeopteryx He showed the basic affinity of birds and reptiles which he united them under the title of Sauropsida Huxley concluded that birds evolved from small carnivorous dinosaurs

Comsognathus was once thought to be the smallest dinosaur However if we assume the smaller specimen was a juvenile then there are other slightly smaller species The smallest dinosaur is probably Anchiornis other candidates are Micropachycephalosaurus Caenagnathasia Microraptor and Parvicursor

Micropachycephalosaurus is a genus of ornithischian dinosaur from the Upper Cretaceous It was a herbivore and lived in what is now Shandong China It was one of the smallest dinosaur ever discovered just over a meter long but with the longest name Before it was discovered Compsognathus was the smallest known dinosaur

The lack of the skull roof means the fossil cannot be placed at family level It might or might not be a pachycephalosaur Butler and Zhao therefore classified it as an indeterminate member of the Cerapoda In 2011 cladistic analysis performed by Butler et al showed that Micropachycephalosaurus is a basal member of the Ceratopsia In this context basal does not mean ancestral the fossil is far too late for that It means simply unspecialized or lacking derived traits

Velociraptor was a predatory dromaeosaur of the Upper Cretaceous about 7571 million years ago 

It was a slender lightly built carnivore about two meters long and 062 meters tall at the hip which is somewhat bigger than the size of a turkey 

Velociraptor had one sickle shaped claw on its foot which measured 65 centimeters along its length and a smaller one on each hand Velociraptor was warm blooded and had feathers 

Fossils from China strongly suggest that the whole clade had similar traits 

Fossils of Velociraptor were first found in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia in 1922 In 1988 scientists from China found Velociraptor skeletons in northern China 

A famous Velociraptor discovered in 1971 was found attacking a Protoceratops in a fossil from Mongolia

In September 2007 researchers found quill knobs on the forearm of a Velociraptor found in Mongolia These bumps on bird wing bones show where feathers anchor and their presence on Velociraptor indicate it too had feathers 

Turner and colleagues interpreted the presence of feathers on Velociraptor as evidence that the ancestors of dromaeosaurids could fly making Velociraptor and other large members of this family secondarily flightless This idea has since been discarded the unmodified forearms count against it Therefore the feathers in the ancestors of Velociraptor had another function The feathers of the flightless Velociraptor may have been used for display for covering their nests while brooding

The majority view is that dinosaur feathers were primarily adaptations for temperature regulation and that other uses came later Velociraptor itself was too heavy to have flown

Films such as Jurassic Park and some of the The Land Before Time films helped make Velociraptor popular However the raptors in Jurassic Park were far larger than the real thing They were the size of Utahraptor a really large member of the same clade The films probably also exaggerate its intelligence

Rhea is Saturns second largest moon It is made of ice and rock

Rhea may have a thin ring system with three narrow bands in a disk of solid particles These would be the first rings seen around a moon The discovery was announced in the journal Science on March 6 2008

Mimas is one of Saturns largest moons It is also called Saturn I Mimas is best known for its large crater Herschel In the centre of the crater is a very high mountain Mimas was discovered by the English astronomer William Herschel on September 17 1789 The moon is believed to have created the Cassini Division This is a 4800 km gap between Saturns A and B rings

An aphrodisiac is a type of food or drink that has the effect of making those who eat or drink it more aroused in a sexual way The name comes from the Greek goddess Aphrodite

Some things thought by some to be aphrodisiacs are ginko ashwaganda oysters and chocolate

Protoceratops was a ceratopsian dinosaur from Mongolia It was shown in a fossil being attacked by a Velociraptor

Megapnosaurus was a small dinosaur from the early Jurassic It was a relative of Coelophysis but it had two crests on top of its head It is shown in the movie When Dinosaurs Roamed America attacking an Anchisaurus and getting scared off by a Dilophosaurus It was called Syntarsus at that time

Vidar is a god in Norse mythology He is the son of Odin and the giantess Grid He is the god of the forest of revenge and of silence In Ragnark his father Odin will be killed by Fenrir Vidar will take revenge by killing Fenrir He will either do this by stepping on his jaw and tearing the wolf apart or by driving a sword through the heart of the wolf

Quilmesaurus was a predatory dinosaur from the Cretaceous period It lived 95 million years ago

Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich Romanov of Russia was to be Tsar Alexei II He would have been Tsar Alexei IIHe was born on August 12 1904 and probably died on July 17 1918 He was the youngest of five children and the only son of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and Alexandra Fyodorovna His sisters were Olga Tatiana Maria and Anastasia

He had the disease hemophilia He inherited the disease from his mother The disease can be traced back to his great grandmother Queen Victoria His father was gave up the throne in 1917 and his family was exiled and then murdered in Ekaterinburg in 1918 

In 2008 his body was one of those found near the site where the family were murdered DNA tests proved all 5 of the Tsars children had been killed

In 2000 Alexei and his family was made saints by the Russian Orthodox Church When Alexei was struggling with hemopilia a Russian Orthodox monk named Grigori Rasputin commonly known as Rasputin healed Alexei better than any doctor could This might have led to the familys murder because they were so fond of Rasputin Once Rasputin was murdered Alexei and his family were murdered only two years later

Zalmoxes was a dinosaur from the Upper Cretaceous of Romania It was a relative of the Iguanodon 

Most of the skeleton is known with exception of the end of the tail the hands and the feet

Oviraptor lived in the Upper Cretaceous period about 75 million years ago Only one definite specimen is known from Mongolia though a possible second specimen comes from the northeast region of Inner Mongolia China

Oviraptor is traditionally depicted with a distinctive crest similar to that of the cassowary However re examination of several oviraptorids show that this well known tall crested species may actually belong to the genus Citipati a relative of Oviraptor It is likely that Oviraptor did have a crest but its exact size and shape are unknown due to crushing in the skull of the only recognized specimen

Judging by its relatives Oviraptor probably had feathers It had a toothless beak but its feeding habits are unknown One specimen has the remains of a lizard in its stomach cavity

In 1976 Barsbold referred six additional specimens to the genus Oviraptor but these were later reclassified in the new genus Conchoraptor Another specimen IGN 10042 is perhaps the most famous owing to its well preserved complete skull and large size This specimen was referred to the genus Oviraptor by Barsbold in 1981 and came to represent Oviraptor in most popular depictions and in scientific studies of oviraptorids However this specimen with its distinctive tall cassowary like crest was re examined by the scientists who described the nesting oviraptorids and found to resemble them more closely than the original specimens of Oviraptor For this reason they removed IGN 10042 from the genus Oviraptor provisionally re classifying it as a species of Citipati

The Australian dollar is the official currency of the Commonwealth of Australia It has been in use since February 14 1966 The Australian dollar is also used on Christmas Island Cocos Islands Norfolk Island and the independent Pacific Islands of Kiribati Nauru and Tuvalu In Australia the dollar symbol is usually used The signs A or AU are often used to show that it is the Australian dollar It is subdivided into 100 cents 

In 2007 the Australian dollar was the sixth most traded currency in world The most traded currencies were the Euro US dollar the yen the pound sterling and the Swiss franc 

The Australian dollar is liked by people who trade in currencies This is because Australia has high interest rates and little government control on currency trading Australias economy and political systems are also seen to be stable

The dollar was introduced on 14 February 1966 replacing the Australian pound

From 1966 coins were made in amounts of 1 2 5 10 20 and 50 cents One dollar coins were made from 1984 Two dollar coins were made from 1988 The one and two cent coins were not made after 1991 and are no longer used Cash sales are made to the nearest five cents All coins have the image of the head of state Queen Elizabeth II on the back They are made by the Royal Australian Mint in Canberra

Australia has often made special 50 cent coins The first was in 1970 to honor Captain Cooks finding the east coast of Australia In 1977 a coin was made for Queen Elizabeth IIs Silver Jubilee In 1981 a coin was made for the wedding of Charles and Diana The Brisbane Commonwealth Games had a special coin in 1982 Another one was made for the Australian Bicentenary in 1988 There have been many more special coins made since the 1990s They are popular with people who collect coins Australia has also made special 20 cent and one dollar coins

Australia has made special five dollar coins of aluminiumbronze and bi metal and many silver and gold bullion coins in bigger values These are not normally used although they are legal tender

Current Australian 5 10 and 20 cent coins are the same size as the old Australian New Zealand and British sixpenny shilling and two shilling coins In 1990 the UK replaced these coins with smaller versions as did New Zealand in 2006  at the same time discontinuing the five cent coin The Australian 50 cent coin is a large coin It weighs 1555 grams and is 3151 mm across

The first paper banknotes in Australian dollars were printed in 1966 The one two ten and 20 dollars notes matched the old pound banknotes The five dollar note was printed in 1967 after the public were used to decimal currency 

The one dollar note was replaced by a coin in 1984 The two dollar note was replaced by a coin in 1988 The 50 dollar note was first printed in 1973 In 1984 Australia printed the 100 dollar note

Notes are different sizes depending on their value This is to help people are visually impaired They are the same height but different lengths The 5 is the smallest 100 the largest Notes are also colour coded 5 pink 10 blue 20 red 50 yellow and 100 green

In 1988 the Reserve Bank of Australia gave out plastic polymer banknotes to celebrate 200 years of European settlement in Australia All Australian notes are now made of polymer

To make it hard to copy these notes they have see through windows with a picture image of Captain James Cook Every note also has a seven pointed star which has only half the printing on each side Australian banknotes were the first in the world to use such features

A washing machine is a machine designed to wash dirty clothes Washing machines contain drums into which the clothes are placed this drum is filled with water and then rotated fast to make the water remove dirt from the clothes Most washing machines are made so that you can put liquids or powders into the machine that will help make the clothes cleaner 

The word benign is often used to refer to a medical condition that will not become life threatening if it is not treated but can also mean that something is not harmful It is often used in relation to tumours that do not metastasise to other parts of the body Tumours that are referred to as being benign may still be life threatening because of other reasons Because of this the term applies mainly to their biological behaviour

Tumors that are benign may be at risk of changing into malignancy These are termed premalignant

William Harvey was an English medical doctor He was born in Folkstone Kent England on April 1 1573 He was the first to explain how blood was moved through the body by the heart He died June 3 1657

William Harvey is famous for his idea on blood being pumped around the body by the heart Christianismi Restitutio had found out how the circulatory system worked but his work at the time was lost Harvey found Restitutios work a century later Harvey travelled all over Europe doing research Most of his research was done in Italy where he went to the Venerable English College in Rome

A hospital in Ashford Kent is named after him He went to The Kings School Canterbury then Ganville and Caius College Cambridge He then went to University of Padua where he graduated in 1602

When he returned to England he married Elizabeth Browne the daughter of Elizabeth Is royal physician He became a doctor at St Bartholomews Hospital in London from 1609 until 1643

Harvey announced his discoveries about the circulatory system in 1616 He wrote a book about it in 1628 He said that blood was pumped around the body in a closed system Blood was pumped by the heart through the body before coming back to the heart to repeat the process This went against what was believed at the time to be true William Harvey was an English physician who was the first to describe correctly and in detail the circulation and properties

The ancient Greek doctor Galen believed that there were two systems in the body dealing with blood It was thought at the time that the dark red blood in veins came from the liver and the bright red blood in arteries came from the heart It was believed that the liver and heart made the blood and it was used up by the body parts it was pumped to

Harveys ideas came from dissecting human bodies Harvey found that the liver would have to make 540 pounds of blood every hour for Galen to be right This showed him that the blood was not being used up It was being reused by the body He said blood flowed through the heart in two loops One loop went to the lungs and got oxygen The other loop went to the organs and body tissue giving them the oxygen He said the heart was just a pump that pumped blood around the body

The Velocisaurus was a dinosaur related to Ceratosaurus It was a fast runner

Valdosaurus is a genus of bipedal herbivorous dinosaurs found on the Isle of Wight and elsewhere in England It is found in the Lower Cretaceous

Its classification is in the Dryosauridae family It is related to the Iguanodonts

The Great Famine or the Great Hunger is the name given to the famine in Ireland between 1845 and 1849 Outside of Ireland It is usually called the Irish Potato Famine The Famine was caused by the Blight The Blight was a potato fungus that destroyed all the potatoes in Ireland very fast Potatoes were the main source of food for most of the people in Ireland at the time The effects of The Famine lasted until 1851 Not much is known about what happened during this time It is believed that between 500000 and more than one million people died in the three years from 1846 to 1849 because of hunger or disease Another million became refugees because of the Famine They left Ireland and moved to Great Britain the United States Canada and Australia

In Ireland this time is referred to as the Starvation The potato was the only crop affected yet Ireland continued to produce corn wheat barley and beef However the English landlords made a bigger profit by shipping these food products out of the country Writer Chris Fogarty places the numbers murdered at approximately 516 million making it the Irish holocaust Distinguished legal scholars like Professors Charles Rice of Notre Dame U and Francis A Boyle U of Illinois believe that under International Law that the British pursued a barbarous policy of mass starvation in Ireland from 1845 50 and that such conduct constituted genocide

Wannanosaurus is the smallest known ornithischian dinosaur Its length is estimated at just less than a metre It lived in the Upper Cretaceous about 80 million years ago and was found in Anhui China 

It is known from a single partial skeleton including a partial skull roof and lower jaw an upper leg and lower leg part of a rib and other fragments It was herbivorous but may also have eaten insects Wannosaurus means Wanno lizard It is one of several pachycephalosaurs with flat topped skulls

A chihuahua is a very small kind of dog and is bred to be spoiled 

They can a height of 5 to 8 inches and a weight of 26 pounds that are so small but so cute

 Colors and patterns  Dogs can come in different colors Black white and brown Patterns include Sable Irish spotting Piebald spotting extreme white spotting and tan points Colors and patterns can mix during mating creating much difference

The Chihuahuas start goes back to Pre Columbian Mexico as the descendants of the Techichi a long haired and silent dog The Techichi was liked by the Toltec people Toltecs made their most important city in Tula in the Mesa Central Region They also built the city of Teotihuacan near todays Mexico City Chihuahuas are believed to mate with Techichi and Chinese Crested dogs to form todays Chihuahuas Another reason why this would have happened is that Techichis mated with with Spanish terriers which were well liked at the time and were known for their small body and black and tan colors Mating with another species of dog increased the Techichis bark while lowering its size Chihuahuas were named after the Chihuahua state in Mexico which is the place where the dog became known for its popularity in the United States The name Chihuahua has nothing to do with the dog but the word Chihuahua comes from the Nahuatl word xicuagua which means sandy dry place

Minmi is a genus of small ankylosaurian dinosaur that lived during the Lower Cretaceous of Australia about 119 to 113 million years ago 

A recent cladistic analysis suggests that Minmi is the most basal known ankylosaur That does not mean it was the ancestor of the group it is far too late for that It means its body is not specialized and is relatively unchanged from whatever was the ancestral group

Two good specimens of Minmi have been described including a mostly complete skeleton and additional fragments may belong to this genus The dinosaur grew to about 2 m long and was roughly 1 m tall to the top of the shoulder

Minmi is classified in the Ankylosauria but is too primitive to be included in either the Ankylosauridae or Nodosauridae 

As with other ankylosaurians Minmi was herbivorous Unlike most herbivorous dinosaurs there is direct evidence of the diet of Minmi gut contents are known from the well preserved nearly complete specimen The gut contents consist of fragments of fibrous or vascular plant tissue fruiting bodies spherical seeds and tissue The most common remains are the fibrous or vascular fragments which have clean cut ends 

Because of the small size of the fragments they are probably nibbled from plants or chopped in the mouth These small fragments may have come from twigs or stems but their size is more suggestive of vascular bundles in leaves The clean cuts and lack of gastroliths suggest that the animal relied on chewing to grind food The seeds and fruiting bodies were apparently swallowed whole When compared to to gut contents and scat from modern herbivorous lizard emu and goose this shows Minmi had a more sophisticated process for cutting up plant material

It had bony protrusions on its head back abdomen legs and along the tail Several types of armour are known in place in Minmi including small ossicles small keeled scutes on the body large scutes without keels on the snout large keeled scutes on the neck shoulders and possibly tail spike like scutes on the hips and a combination of ridged and keeled scutes and triangular plates on the tail There was one preserved ring of scutes around the neck The arrangement of armour is unclear on the tail although the triangular plates may have run on the sides of the tail with long scutes forming a row along the top of the tail However unlike other ankylosaurians Minmi had horizontal plates of bones that ran along the sides of its vertebrae

Rugops was a dinosaur related to Carnotaurus It lived in what is now Africa about 95 million years ago It was a medium sized carnivorous dinosaur up to 27 feet long 

Rugops lived at the same time Spinosaurus Carcharodontosaurus and Deltadromeus in the Upper Cretaceous 

Rugops was a carnivore with weak jaws and small teeth It may have been a scavenger feeding on dead animals It also may have preyed on sauropods such as Paralititan and Aegyptosaurus and ornithopods such as Ouranosaurus The name Rugops means wrinkled face The bony wrinkles on its snout may have helped to support a structure such as horny crest or a wattle like on a rooster or a turkey 

Abrictosaurus was a heterodontosaurid dinosaur from the Lower Jurassic of what is now southern Africa It was a small bipedal herbivore or omnivore about 12 meters long and weighing less than 45 kilograms

Abrictosaurus is usually considered the most basal member of the family Heterodontosauridae Lycorhinus and Heterodontosaurus both had high crowned cheek teeth which overlapped each other in the jaw forming a continuous chewing surface analogous to those of Cretaceous hadrosaurids Abrictosaurus had more widely separated cheek teeth with lower crowns more similar to other early ornithischians 

The family as a whole has canine like tusks Tusks were clearly present on one of the two specimens of Abrictosaurus The upper caniniform measured 105 millimeters high while the lower reached 17 mm 

Abrictosaurus had smaller less powerful forelimbs than Heterodontosaurus and one fewer phalanx bone in both the fourth and fifth digits of the forelimb

Heterodontosaurus is a genus of small herbivorous dinosaur with prominent canine teeth which lived in the Lower Jurassic of South Africa It was related to Abrictosaurus It had 3 different kinds of teeth

C supremus

Camarasaurus was a large plant eating dinosaur It was about 18 meters long and weighed about 18 metric tones Its name comes from its skull which is in the shape of an arch It lived during the late Jurassic Period between 155 and 145 million years ago These dinosaurs may have lived in herds

It was first discovered in 1877 in Colorado by Oramel W Lucas Its bones have also been discovered in New Mexico Utah and Wyoming

There are four species of Camarasaurus

It was shown in the movie When Dinosaurs Roamed America A toy company named Ugobe makes toy robots that are like Camarasaurus

Zizhongosaurus was a very large plant eating dinosaur It was a large sauropod It was related to Camarasaurus

The Great Fire Of London was a tragedy that happened in London England in 1666 The fire lasted for four days from September 2 until September 5

It threatened the aristocratic district of Westminster Charles IIs Palace of Whitehall and most of the suburban slums However it did not reach these districts It burned down 13200 houses 87 churches St Pauls Cathedral and most of the government buildings It is believed that it destroyed the homes of 70000 of the 80000 people that lived in the city It is not known how many people died in the fire Only a few deaths are certain but for many of the victims there were no records Also the fire may have cremated many leaving no recognisable remains 

The fire started at the bakery of Thomas Farriner in Pudding Lane It began just after midnight on Sunday September 2 and grew very fast Firefighters of the time usually made firebreaks by destroying buildings around the fire so it could not spread This did not happen soon enough because the Lord Mayor Sir Thomas Bloodworth was not certain what to do By the time he ordered such measures it was too late

The fire pushed north on Monday into the center of the city Some people thought that foreigners were setting the fires They believed it was the French and Dutch Both countries were Englands enemies in the Second Anglo Dutch War a war that was happening at that time On Thursday the fire spread over most of the City destroying St Pauls Cathedral and crossed over the River Fleet It was close to setting fire to Charles IIs court at Whitehall 

The attempt to put out the fire is believed to have been successful because of two things

The social and economic problems created by the disaster were very big Leaving London to go and live elsewhere was strongly encouraged by Charles II He feared a London rebellion amongst the refugees who had lost their property Despite numerous radical proposals London was reconstructed on essentially the same street plan used before the fire

The fire is said to have also helped to get rid of the Great Plague which had hit London in 1665 and killed about 70000 of the 90000 population

The Golgi complex also known as the Golgi apparatus or simply the Golgi is a cytoplasmic organelle It is found in eukaryote cells such as those of animals plant and fungi It was discovered by Camillo Golgi in 1898 Golgi was ignored and his discovery was said to be dirt on his lenses Years later electron microscope pictures showed structures just like in the original Golgi drawings It is made of several flattened sac like membranes which some people say look like a stack of pancakes The main function of the Golgi apparatus is to process and package macromolecules such as proteins and lipids They come to the Golgi after being built and before they go to their destination The Golgi complex inspects them for flaws and discards extra material added during their manufacture wraps them up and then targets them for packaging The Golgi complex is especially active in processing proteins for secretion The Golgi releases special enzymes called lysosomes which clean off any extra amino acids When the package is ready it is pinched off the Golgi and released into the cytoplasm The Golgi complex is part of the cellular membrane system along with the endoplasmic reticulum

The sunflower is an annual plant in the family Asteraceae with a large flower head The stem of the flower can grow up to 3 metres tall with a flower head that can be 30 cm wide

Birds and other animals enjoy eating sunflower seeds Humans like to eat them too although not all kinds and often they are covered with chocolate salt or honey Other types of sunflowers include the California Royal Sunflower which has a burgundy flower head

The sunflower is the state flower of Kansas That is why Kansas is sometimes called the Sunflower State To grow well sunflowers need full sun They grow best in fertile wet well drained soil with a lot of mulch In commercial planting seeds are planted 45 cm apart and 25 cm deep Sunflower whole seed are sold as a snack food after roasting in ovens with or without salt added Sunflowers can be processed into a peanut butter alternative Sunbutter In Germany it is mixed together with rye flour to make Sonnenblumenkernbrot which is quite popular in German speaking Europe It is also sold as food for birds and can be used directly in cooking and salads Sunflower oil extracted from the seeds is used for cooking as a carrier oil and to produce margarine and biodiesel as it is cheaper than olive oil A range of sunflower varieties exist with differing fatty acid compositions some high oleic types contain a higher level of healthy monounsaturated fats in their oil than Olive oil

The cake remaining after the seeds have been processed for oil is used as a livestock feed Some recently developed cultivars have drooping heads These cultivars are less attractive to gardeners growing the flowers as ornamental plants but appeal to farmers because they reduce bird damage and losses from some plant diseases Sunflowers also produce latex and are the subject of experiments to improve their suitability as an alternative crop for producing hypoallergenic rubber Traditionally several Native American groups planted sunflowers on the north edges of their gardens as a fourth sister to the better known three sisters combination of corn beans and squash9 Annual species are often planted for their allelopathic propertiescitation needed However for commercial farmers growing commodity crops the sunflower like any other unwanted plant is often considered a weed Especially in the midwestern USA wild species are often found in corn and soybean fields and can have a negative impact on yields Sunflowers may also be used to extract toxic ingredients from soil such as lead arsenic and uranium They were used to remove uranium cesium 137 and strontium 90 from soil after the Chernobyl disaster

The Nibelungenlied translated as The Song of the Nibelungs is an epic poem in Middle High German It tells the story of dragon slayer Siegfried at the court of the Burgundians and of the revenge of his wife Kriemhild which leads to the death all the heroes of the Bugundians and of Kriemhild as well

The saga of Siegfried was also used in the opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen of Richard Wagner Nibelung in this context means dwarf

The Nibelungenlied is based on earlier works It was part of oral tradition meaning it usually was not written down During the Middle Ages people started to write down stories more and more Overall there are about 35 German sources and one Dutch source for the story There was an original manuscript but it has been lost The three oldest manuscripts have been labelled A B and C 

B seems to be closest to the original however the real relation between the three manuscripts is unknown The Nibelungenlied probably had a broad oral tradition as there were many different versions It is difficult to judge how these oral versions influenced the written ones

Manuscripts A and B end with daz ist der Nibelunge not for this reasons they are known as the Not versions Manuscript C ends with daz ist der Nibelunge liet It is known as the Lied version In total the C text has been edited with regard to the public of the time It is less dramatic This probably made it more popular Aesthetically the B text would have been the greatest artistic achievement for a contemporary public

The author who wrote down the original that is now lost is unknown However there are a few candidates

Serious researchers tend to ignore the last three options because there is not enough evidence to support them

This was probably not in the original though but added later The original probably began by introducing Kriemhild

English translations

A dwarf is a short humanlike creature in Norse mythology as well as other Germanic mythologies fairy tales fantasy fiction and role playing games 

In some stories dwarves are mean living under bridges and having a bad reputation for stealing treasure One example is the Norwegian Troll It is an ugly and foolish creature who tells lies It causes problems everywhere it goes That is how the Internet troll got its name In Robert Louis Stevensons story Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde Edward Hyde is described as a dwarf

On the other hand J R R Tolkiens hobbits and the munchkins in The Wizard of Oz are likeable honest good and smart 

A dwarf can also be a short human Often dwarf is used as an insult for short people but some people have a genetic condition which was called dwarfism Not all short people have this condition

Mole is the SI unit of measurement used to measure the number of things usually atoms or molecules One mole of something is equal to 6022141510 of it So One mole of hydrogen atoms means 6022141510 hydrogen atoms One mole of grapefruits means 6022141510 grapefruits We call this number Avogadros number We use this number because it is the number of carbon atoms in 12 grams of carbon 12 which is the most common kind of carbon We can measure anything in moles but it is not very useful for most things because the numbers are so big For example one mole of grapefruits would be as big as the earth 

Because different molecules and atoms do not have the same mass one mole of one thing does not weigh the same as one mole of something else Atoms and molecule mass is measured in u One u is equal to one gram per mole This means that if an atom has a mass of one u one mole of this atom weighs one gram

Moles mass Relative mass Example How many moles are there in 20 grams of hydrogen A value of 1 can be used for hydrogens relative mass although the correct value is slightly larger So moles massrelative mass 201 20 moles

Moles concentration x volume Example How many moles are there in 100cm3 of 01M H2SO4 1 dm3 is the same as 1000 cm3 so the value in cubic centimetres needs to be divided by 1000 1001000 x 01 001 moles

A methane molecule is made from one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms Carbon has a mass of 12011 u and hydrogen has a mass of 1008 u This means that the mass of one methane molecule is 12011 u or 16043 u This means that one mole of methane has a mass of 16043 grams

A mole can be thought of as two bags of different sized balls One bag contains tennis balls and the other footballs There are the same amount of balls in both bags but the mass of the footballs is much larger It is a different way to measure things Moles measure the number of particles not the mass So both bags contain three moles

A mole is simply a unit of the number of things Units are invented when existing units can not describe something well enough Chemical reactions often take place at levels where using grams wouldnt make sense yet using absolute numbers of atomsmoleculesions would be confusing too

The SI units for molar concentration are molm3 However most chemical writing uses moldm3 or mol dm3 which is the same as molL These units are often written with a capital letter M sometimes preceded by an SI prefix for example millimoles per litre or millimolar micromoleslitre or micromolar or nanomolesL or nanomolar

The absolute yield of a chemical reaction mostly stated in moles

Plesiosaurus was a large fossil marine reptile a genus in the order Plesiosauria 

The first specimen discovered by Mary Anning in 1820 21 was missing its skull She found it on the Jurassic Coast of Lyme Regis Dorset England In 1823 she found another one this time complete with its skull The name Plesiosaurus was given by the Rev William Conybeare

Plesiosaurus was a predator living mostly on fish and belemnites It would swim through schools of fish and use its long neck and sharp teeth to snap them up

Plesiosaurus was a fairly typical member of its order and measured around 3 to 5 metres in total length The snout was short but the jaws were able to open very wide and had a series of conical teeth in sockets The neck was quite long and the short tail was used for steering Like all plesiosaurs it used its large paddles to swim

Only two species are known and the genus existed for about 25 million years from the beginning of the Jurassic period

The Oort cloud or pikOort cloud is a cloud of comets and other objects which astronomers believe is way beyond the orbits of Pluto and the Kuiper belt The Oort Cloud is believed to be the source of long period comets in the Solar System

The Oort cloud may lie about 50000 AU or nearly a light year from the Sun This means the cloud is nearly a quarter of the way to Proxima Centauri the nearest star to the Sun 

The Kuiper belt and scattered disc the other two reservoirs of trans Neptunian objects are less than one thousandth of the Oort clouds distance The outer limit of the Oort cloud defines the boundary of the Solar System and the region of the Suns gravitational dominance

The Dutch astronomer Jan Hendrik Oort was the creator of the Oort Cloud idea The Oort cloud was named after him as were the Oort Comet and Oort Constants

The Oort cloud takes up a lot of space and has trillions of comets about tens of millions of kilometers apart 

The Oort cloud is made up of an Inner Oort cloud and an Outer Oort cloud The Outer cloud is weakly bound to the Sun and gives the solor system comets The Inner Cloud is also called the Hill Cloud and may be the maker of comets

The objects in the Oort cloud are believed to consist of much ice and since the object 1996 PW was found it is believed that rocky objects might be in the Oort Cloud 

The Oort cloud is thought to be the remains of a disk made out of gas which surrounded the Sun long ago

Dynasty means rulers who belong to the same family for generations The term is also used to describe the era during which that family ruled

Famous dynasties were 

from England The House of Tudor and the House of Stuart

from China The Shang Dynasty the Yuan Dynasty the Ming Dynasty and the Qing Dynasty

The Han Dynasty came to power in 202 BC They followed the philosophy of Confucianism and Legalism This was called the Han Sythesis Under this dynasty China made much progress in arts and science The empire also became larger and larger China started trading with a number of other countries Merchants used the Silk Road to reach China During this dynasty Buddhism was introduced in China The Han dynasty was a very important period in Ancient China and many consider it to be the golden age of China

The Zhou Dynasty defeated the Shang Dynasty using the mandate of heaven and said they were immortal at about 3000 BC and came to power They changed the capital from Henan to a place near present day Xian near the Yellow River The Zhou Dynasty also brought a new theory This theory told the people that kings had the order of the gods to rule the country Almost all dynasties of Chinese rulers continued to repeat this theory The kings of this dynasty won many new areas For the first time in the history of China large number of persons also moved from one area to other area for settlement

During the Zhou Dynasty the origins of matured Chinese philosophy developed The greatest Chinese philosophers were Kong Fuzi founder of Confucianism and Laozi founder of Daoism Other philosophers theorists and schools of thought in this era were Mozi founder of Mohism Mengzi a famous Confucian who expanded upon Kong Fuzis legacy Shang Yang and Han Feizi responsible for the development of ancient Chinese Legalism and Xunzi

A rebellion is when people refuse to obey orders and fight back against authority It may happen when the citizens of a country take over the government by force because they do not trust the current system Also throughout history there have been some slave rebellions when slaves fought back against their masters and against the slave system in general Some slaves who have led slave rebellions include Spartacus and Nat Turner

An example would be the Zhou leaders in China who made the rulers of other Chinese states that they captured live with their own families in the Zhou capital Anyang However they failed to stop rebellion this way because it only brought on groups of lords who might rebel under their control The Zhou dynasty declined because other lords that were ruling parts of China rebelled

A battle is a fight between two or more groups where each group is trying to defeat the others Battles are most often fought during wars military campaigns or two or more people fighting If two armies fight many battles over period of time it is called a war

Battles can very important for example the 1389 Battle of Kosovo which was a draw in military terms changed the history of the Balkans Europe and the entire world The outcome changed Ottoman politics and had influence in the region for well over 500 years

Edward was the eldest of the four sons of Richard Plantagenet Duke of York The Duke of York was a very powerful man and had a claim to the throne of England He became more popular than the existing king Henry VI of England who was thought to be weak When the duke tried to take the throne from Henry VI the Wars of the Roses broke out By the time Edward was eighteen he and his brother Edmund Earl of Rutland who was seventeen were old enough to take part in the fighting and Edward turned out to be a very good soldier He was helped by Richard Neville 16th Earl of Warwick a clever nobleman who fought for the Duke of York At the Battle of Wakefield in 1460 Edwards father and his brother Edmund were both killed As his fathers heir he now claimed the throne In March 1461 he entered London with his army and was crowned king although he was only nineteen King Henry VI was put into prison

For a while Edward ruled the country well with help from the Earl of Warwick Then Edward met a woman called Elizabeth Woodville whom he wanted to marry The Earl of Warwick did not know about their romance and he wanted King Edward to marry a foreign princess in order to make an alliance with another country which would have made his position stronger Elizabeth and Edward got married secretly in about 1464 and they had ten children in the nineteen years of their marriage 

When the Earl of Warwick learned of Edwards marriage he was angry He grew even more angry as time went on because Elizabeths family became powerful and the king no longer respected Warwick as he had done in the beginning In 1459 he rebelled against the king with help from another of Edwards younger brothers George Duke of Clarence George was married to the Earl of Warwicks elder daughter Isabel The rebels went to France and made an alliance with Queen Margaret who was the wife of King Henry VI The Earl of Warwick managed to defeat King Edward in battle in 1471 and freed King Henry VI from prison Henry was now king again and Edward had to escape to Burgundy while his wife and children went into hiding 

The Duke of Burgundy was married to Edwards sister Margaret so he was willing to help raise more troops When Edward returned to England he defeated the Earl of Warwick in battle and killed him Shortly afterwards Queen Margaret and her son arrived in England They were also defeated in battle by King Edward and his throne was safe To make sure of this Edward arranged for King Henry VI to be killed

While Edward was away in Burgundy his wife Elizabeth had given birth to a son Edward who was given the title of Prince of Wales He would be the next king Edward ruled with help from his two brothers George who had once rebelled against him was now loyal and the youngest brother Richard Duke of Gloucester had always been loyal There were still quarrels between them and the powerful Woodville family George and Richard also quarrelled with each other and in the end King Edward had to put George in prison where he died

Edward IV died very suddenly at the age of forty His son became King Edward V of England but his reign did not last long Edwards brother Richard thought that it would not be a good idea for a boy to be king and he took the throne himself No one really knows what happened to Edwards two sons the Princes in the Tower

Pterosaurs were flying reptiles which lived in the Mesozoic era at the same time as the dinosaurs Most pterosaurs were quite small but in the Upper Cretaceous some grew larger than any other flying animals The pterosaur Quetzalcoatlus had a wing span of up to 12 metres 

The first fossils occur in the Upper Triassic and the group continues until the KT extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous Pterosaurs are the earliest vertebrates known to have evolved powered flight Their wings were made from a flap of skin between their bodies and a big fourth finger The pterosaurs fall into two groups The earlier Rhamphorhynchoids had long tails and toothed jaws The pterodactyloids had short tails and many had beaks with no teeth

The first pterosaur fossil was discovered in the Late Jurassic Solnhofen limestone in Germany in 1784 This was exactly the same place as Archaeopteryx was found Georges Cuvier first suggested that pterosaurs were flying creatures in 1801 Since the first pterosaur fossil was found twenty nine species of pterosaurs have been found in those deposits alone A famous early UK find was an example of Dimorphodon by Mary Anning in 1828 at Lyme Regis Dorset England The name Pterosauria was coined in 1834

Pterosaurs were genuine fliers able to flap or soar Their bodies were covered with fine hairs so they were able to regulate their temperature They are a close sister group to the dinosaurs part of the Archosauria

This early group flourished from the Upper Triassic to the end of the Jurassic When we first see them in the fossil record they have developed three families so biologists know their early evolution is not yet revealedp240 246 These three families are represented by the three genera Rhamphorhynchus Dimorphodon and Eudimorphodon At least one more family appears at the start of the Jurassic the Anurognathidae

The group always has a long tail usually stiffened by rod like bony tendons to keep it straight This indicates their flight was extremely stable which means it kept on course and did not dart about much This feature is also found in Archaeopteryx and in early bats and in insects like dragonflies It can be interpreted like this Early planes were highly stable and so are airliners To dart about quickly requires special advanced brains and reflexes which later birds and pterosaurs had but early ones did not The analogy in planes would be fighter planes which need such fast reactions that the details are worked out by computer with the pilot indicating where to go It requires more brains to control an unstable craft than it does a stable one

All species in the group have teeth This again has a parallel with birds Archaeopteryx and many Cretaceous birds have teeth modern birds do not The disadvantage of teeth is that they are quite heavy when the animal can do without them they will gradually get selected out Obviously without teeth food cannot be chewed but there are ways around that In the first place both birds and pterosaurs are mainly carnivorous in the second place stones in the gizzard or stomach can do the grinding if needed

The group died out at the end of the Jurassic which was a minor extinction event Even near the end of the Jurassic Rhamphorhynchus was the most common pterosaur found at the famous Archaeopteryx site at Solnhofen in Bavaria Germany so it is surprising that they became extinct so soon after that A single specimen of the insect eating Anurognathus was also found at Solnhofen It had a shorter tail than any other rhamphorhynchoid This suggests its need to dodge about to catch insects agile and highly manoeuvrablep270

Fossil pterodactyloids appear in the Upper Jurassic They were short tailed pterosaurs indicating that they had more sophisticated control of their flight and that no doubt gave them some advantages 2300 specimens of 17 different species of pterosaur has been found at Solnhofen from eight different generap263 They include the earliest examples of Pterodactylus and Germanodactylus a genus which is also found in England and China Ctenochasma also from Solnhofen had a comb of 260 thin teeth showing it to be a filter feeder that may have waded or swam in the water There were several other genera with similar life styles

In the Lower Cretaceous there were many pterodactyloids mostly quite small Gradually larger versions evolved and by the Upper Cretaceous most pterosaurs had huge wing spans and clearly covered huge distances soaring on upcurrents in a warm environment Pteranodon with a wing span of over 20 feet and Quetzalcoatlus with a wingspan of 40 feet are famous examples The question of their eating habits is still undecided

Since birds were already common in the Lower Cretaceous they would have competed vigorously with the smaller pterodactyloids That may explain the extinction of the smaller pterosaur species though the lack of fossils from the forested areas makes it difficult to judge The huge Upper Cretaceous types clearly lived a different life style from the smaller species and one which was not yet accessible to birds As the climate changed in the Upper Cretaceous becoming colder and more seasonal the number of pterosaurs became fewer Like most of the larger species on Earth the huge pterosaurs did not survive the KT extinction event At least some families of birds did So ended the competition between the two types of flying reptile through the long 79 million years of the Cretaceous periodp346

There are many adaptations of the head and jaws of pterosaurs so it is quite certain that different forms used different feeding methods as birds do Overall most fossils have been found in marine strata which suggests that they could fly well over water and that fish was on the menu for many species The jaws of fish eaters was long and often held forward pointing teeth good for catching fish Remains of a last fish supper have been found in Pteranodon

Fossils show that one pterosaur the Pterodaustro found in Argentina had comb like strainers in its mouth The pterosaur probably ate by filling its lower jaw with water and pushing the water out of its mouth through the strainers The strainers could catch any plankton or other small creatures that were in the water and when the water was gone the animal could eat what was left Other species had long compressed lower jaws which suggest they were skimmers at the top of the water

The other main item of diet was the insects Flying insects were abundant in the Mesozoic and many pterosaur species give clear signs that this was their food These have a broad mouth often with short peg like teethp339341

For a long time people thought pterosaurs could only glide and soar and were not strong enough to flap their wings In the 20th century after aeroplanes had been invented our understanding of flight advanced English palaeontologists showed that pterosaurs could fly and Tilly Edinger showed that by the end of the Jurassic pterosaur brains were more like that of modern birds than of Archaeopteryx Recent work has used working model to simulate their flightp218 The wing membrane was about 1mm thick with a tough skin and had long fibres reinforcing it This can be clearly seen in some of the fossilsp332 The structure helped the wings survive the stresses of flight The larger pterosaurs were mainly soarers as is the case with birds today 

How pterosaurs moved on the ground is something of a mystery and would certainly have been clumsy Both two legged and four legged stances have been proposed A sleeping pose upside down like a bat is quite convincing for Pterodactylusp337

Pterosaurs also had special bones They were extremely light and some were almost hollow Tiny holes in the bones are evidence of air sacs which extended into the vertebrae and limb bones as it does with birds Also present were supporting struts which made these bones stronger With these special bones even the largest of pterosaurs Quetzalcoatlus probably weighed less than 200 pounds

Pterosaurs were probably egg layers and some eggs have been found at pterosaur sites There is evidence that some species such as Pteranodon had sexual dimorphism The skeletons with large cranial crests and small pelvic canals were presumably males Where several specimens occur at the same location adults can be distinguished from juveniles Evidence of tooth wear in Eudimorphodon suggests the young were insectivorous while the adults ate fishp343 Development took place rapidly in these warm blooded reptiles and much of their life style parallels that of birds It is a fair assumption then that birds became their direct competitors in most environments The high energy level needed for flight explains why both reptilian forms developed similar metabolism In many respects birds and pterosaurs are good examples of convergent evolution

Quetzalcoatlus was a huge pterosaur the largest animal ever to fly It had a 10 to 12 meters wing span but was light in construction 

Quetzalcoatlus had an unusually long neck and when it stood on the ground it was as tall as a giraffe 

Its fossil record is from the Upper Cretaceous of North America 70655 million years ago Quetzalcoatlus became extinct at the KT extinction event 

The feeding habits of Quetzalcoatlus are unknown though two theories have been proposed One idea is that it ate fish by flying with its jaw in the water and snapping up fish when it hit them The other theory is that it was a carrion feeder like vultures and buzzards It was certainly a soarer flying on up currents of air in a warm environment and its remains come from a site which was far inland in the Cretaceous

This question and its flight are still being discussed The lack of a more detailed skeleton is the main problem in reaching conclusions

The first Quetzalcoatlus fossil was found in Big Bend National Park in Texas by a college student from the University of Texas in Austin His name was Douglas Lawson When he was in the park he saw a bone sticking out of a rock Since the bone looked very hollow like the bone of a bird he thought it was part of a flying creature and he was right With his professors help he kept digging until lots of bones from an arm and wing were found but sadly the rest of the animals body was missing Many others have looked for the rest of that huge pterosaur but it has never been found Other fossils of Quetzalcoatlus have been found of course but none were as big as the one Lawson found

Since Quetzalcoatlus was so large two researchers suggested it was too heavy to fly This would have been astonishing because in the whole fossil record there is no flightless pterosaur It has been thought their mobility on the ground was too poor for them to survive without flight However a recent discussion of this idea concluded they probably could fly after all Another analysis suggested their flight was quite strong Since we have only a few bones the question of weight cannot be settled at present

Quetzalcoatlus was shown in the movie When Dinosaurs Roamed America eating a dead Triceratops carcass

Mozilla was the base of Mozilla Firefox

Fedora is a distribution of Linux developed by the community supported Fedora Project and sponsored by Red Hat It is designed to be safe and is used by companies and governments Fedoras mission statement is Fedora is about the rapid progress of Free and Open Source software

Linus Torvalds author of the Linux kernel says he uses Fedora because it had fairly good support for PowerPC when he used that processor architecture He became used to the operating system and continues to use it

Fedora Core 1 was the first version of Fedora and was released on November 6 2003 and was codenamed Yarrow Fedora Core 1 was based on Red Hat Linux 9 and shipped with version 2419 of the Linux kernel version 24 of the GNOME desktop environment and version 314 of KDE

Fedora Core 2 was released on May 18 2004 codenamed Tettnang It shipped with Linux 26 GNOME 26 KDE 322 and SELinux XFree86 was replaced by the newer Xorg a merger of the previous official X11R6 release which additionally included a number of updates to Xrender Xft Xcursor fontconfig libraries and other significant improvements

Fedora Core 3 was released on November 8 2004 codenamed Heidelberg This was the first release of Fedora Core to include the Mozilla Firefox web browser as well as support for the Indic languages This release also replaced the LILO boot loader with GRUB SELinux was also enabled by default but with a new targeted policy which was less strict than the policy used in Fedora Core 2 Fedora Core 3 shipped with GNOME 28 and KDE 33 It was the first release to include the new Fedora Extras repository

Fedora Core 4 was released on June 13 2005 with the codename Stentz It shipped with Linux 2611 KDE 34 and GNOME 210 This version introduced the new Clearlooks theme which was inspired by the Red Hat Bluecurve theme It also shipped with the OpenOfficeorg 20 office suite as well as Xen a high performance and secure open source virtualization framework It also introduced support for the PowerPC CPU architecture and over 80 new policies for SELinux

The last two cores introduced specific artwork for that version This is a trend that has continued in later Fedora versions

Fedora Core 5 was released on March 20 2006 with the codename Bordeaux and introduced the Fedora Bubbles artwork It was the first Fedora release to include Mono and tools built with it such as Beagle F Spot and Tomboy It also introduced new package management tools such as pup and pirut This release replaced the old LinuxThreads with the Native POSIX Thread Library

Fedora Core 6 was released on October 24 2006 codenamed Zod This release introduced the Fedora DNA artwork replacing the Fedora Bubbles artwork used in Fedora Core 5 The codename is derived from the infamous villain General Zod from the Superman DC Comic Books This version introduced support for the Compiz compositing window manager and AIGLX It shipped with Firefox 15 as the default web browser and Smolt a tool that allows users to inform developers about the hardware they use

None of these distributions are maintained by the Fedora Project

Fedora 10 codenamed Cambridge was released on 25 November 2008

Bagels are a type of bread made with flour They look like doughnuts and they are leavened with yeast They have a crisp shiny crust and a dense inside Bagels are glazed and in a ring shaped roll They are different from doughnuts because they are boiled before baked The bagel is regarded as a special kind of Jewish food They are eaten usually for breakfast or a snack

Bagels are made from the basic bread ingredients of flour yeast salt and sweet kinds of spices Flour gives the bread its chewy taste which can be made more light by eggs milk and butter They are the only bread product that is boiled before it is baked

Bagels are often toasted in a toaster and then paired with foods like cream cheese and jam or with butter Bagels can also be used to make sandwiches with meat and egg and cheese Bagel sandwiches are usually eaten for breakfast or lunch

The first bagel was made in 1683 when a baker from Vienna Austria was grateful to the King of Poland for saving Austria from the Turkish people The baker changed the local bread so that it would look like the Kings stirrup The new bread was called beugel which was from the German word for stirrup bugel

Bagels were first sold in grocery stores in the 1950s Frozen bagels were first introduced in 1960

When Austrian Jews went away to America they brought the beugel with them The first beugel bakeries were founded in New York City in the 1920s Later the name was changed and called a bagel Bagels have been used as a symbol of the continuous cycle of lifewithout beginning and without end

A doughnut is a sweet deep fried piece of dough or batter 

Ring doughnuts are made by joining the ends of a long thin piece of dough into a ring or by using a doughnut cutter which perfectly cuts the outside and inside shape leaving a doughnut shaped piece of dough and a doughnut hole from dough removed from the center This smaller piece of dough can be cooked or re added to the batch to make more doughnuts A disk shaped doughnut can also be stretched and molded into a torus until the center breaks to form a hole Or a doughnut depositor can be used to place a circle of liquid dough into the deep fryer Doughnuts can be made from a yeast based dough for more puffy doughnuts or a special type of cake batter Yeast raised doughnuts contain about 25 oil by weight whereas cake doughnuts oil content is around 20 but they have extra fat in the batter before frying Cake doughnuts are fried for about 90 seconds at about 190 C to 198 C turning once Yeast raised doughnuts absorb more oil because they take longer to fry about 150 seconds at 182 C to 190 C Cake doughnuts normally weigh between 24 g and 28 g whereas yeast raised doughnuts normally are 38 g and are mostly larger when finished

The two most common types of doughnut are ring doughnuts which are shaped like rings and filled doughnuts which are round and have jam jelly custard whipped cream or chocolate inside them Most doughnuts have an icing made with icing sugar water and flavourings Some doughnuts are rolled in sweet foods such as sugar or shredded coconut

Doughnuts are often eaten in the morning along with a cup of hot coffee Doughnuts are sold at doughnut shops or grocery stores People also eat doughnuts as a dessert or as a snack

Doughnuts can cause health problems if they are eaten too often One of these problems is that doughnuts contain a large amount of fat Eating too much fat can lead to clogged arteries When the arteries get clogged blood does not go through them easily Also doughnuts contain a large amount of sugar and white flour which are turned into fat when they come inside our body Doughnuts are a health worry in Canada where each person eats more doughnuts per year than any other country

Mary II was Queen regnant of England Scotland and Ireland from 1689 until her death Mary was a Protestant She became queen after the Glorious Revolution which resulted in the deposition of her Roman Catholic father James II and VII Mary ruled together with her husband William III and II He became the ruler of both countries when she died in 1694 Popular histories usually call their joint reigns as those of William and Mary Mary had less power than William when William remained in England When William went to military campaigns however she governed alone She was a powerful firm and effective ruler She gave most of her authority to her husband but he greatly depended on her She was very active in the Church of England ruling it as its Supreme Governor Though she shared this position with her husband she used most of its power herself

Mary was born at St James Palace in London on 30 April 1662 Her father was James Duke of York and her mother was his first wife Lady Anne Hyde She was their oldest daughter Marys uncle was Charles II Her grandfather by her mothers side was Edward Hyde 1st Earl of Clarendon He served for a long time as Charless chief advisor Her mother gave birth to eight children but only Mary and her younger sister Anne lived to adulthood

The Duke of York became a Roman Catholic in 1668 or 1669 but Mary and Anne had a Protestant education as Charles II had commanded Marys mother died in 1671 and her father married again in 1673 He took Mary of Modena a Catholic as his second wife She was also known as Mary Beatrice dEste Before her marriage Mary wrote many letters to Frances Apsley the daughter of James IIs hawks keeper However she did not return Marys interest

When she was 15 Lady Mary became betrothed to her first cousin the Protestant William Prince of Orange William was the son of Mary Princess Royal and Prince William II of Nassau At first Charles II did not want Mary to marry William He wanted Mary to marry the heir to the French Throne the Dauphin Louis instead This was because he hoped that England would become friends with France He also wanted to have a Catholic successor to the throne But because of Parliaments pressure he later approved their marriage He thought that it would make the Protestants like him more but he was wrong Mary and William married in London on 4 November 1677 It was reported that Mary wept through the whole ceremony

Mary went to the Netherlands and lived there as Williams wife The Dutch people liked her because of her lively friendly nature and Mary loved William deeply However the marriage was often unhappy Her three pregnancies ended in miscarriage or stillbirth and Mary was very sad that she did not have a child Her husband was often cold to her and he had an affair with Elizabeth Villiers one of Marys ladies in waiting for a long time After some time though he grew warmer towards Mary

When Charles II died without any broken wikt linklegitimatelegitimate children in 1685 the Duke of York became King as James II in England and Ireland He also became James VII in Scotland He tried to give freedom of religion to non Anglicans He did this by making the acts of Parliament broken wikt linkinvalidinvalid by Royal Decree The public did not like this Several Protestant politicians and noblemen entered into negotiations with Marys husband as early as 1687 In May 1688 James forced Anglican clergymen to read the Declaration of Indulgence The Declaration of Indulgence was a statement that gave religious freedom to those who did not agree with the Church of England This made him much less popular Protestants became even more fearful when his wife Mary of Modena gave birth to a sonJames Francis Edwardin June 1688 They were fearful because the son would unlike Mary and Anne be raised a Roman Catholic Some said that the boy had been secretly carried into the Queens room in a bed warming pan instead of her stillborn baby There was no strong proof to support this story but Mary publicly doubted the boys legitimacy She sent a list of suspicious questions to her sister Anne about the boys birth

On 30 June the Immortal Seven secretly asked William who was in the Netherlands with Mary to come to England with an army William who was jealous of Marys position and power did not want to go at first But Mary told William that she did not care about political power She said she would be no more but his wife and that she would do all that lay in her power to make him King for life

William agreed to attack He declared that James newborn son was the pretended Prince of Wales He also gave a list of what the English people wanted and said that he only wanted to have a free and lawful Parliament assembled The Dutch army which had been turned back by a storm in October landed on 5 November The English Army and Navy went over to William At this time the English peoples confidence in James was very low They did not even try to save their King On 11 December the King tried to run away but failed He tried to run away again on 23 December This second attempt was successful and James escaped to France He lived there in exile until his death

Though Mary was sad because of the deposition of her father William ordered her to look happy when they arrived in London Because of this people thought she was being cold to her father James also thought his daughter was unfaithful to him This hurt Mary deeply

In 1689 a Convention Parliament called by the Prince of Orange came together to discuss what they should do William of Orange felt uncomfortable about his position He wanted to rule as a King not simply as a husband of a Queen The only example of joint monarchy was from the sixteenth century This was Queen Mary I and the Spanish Prince Philip When they married it was agreed that Prince Philip would take the title of King But Philip II was King only during his wifes lifetime He also did not have much power William wanted to remain King even after his wifes death Some important people suggested making Mary the only ruler But Mary who was faithful to her husband refused

On 13 February 1689 Parliament passed the Declaration of Right In this declaration it said that James by trying to run away on 11 December 1688 had abandoned the government so no one at the time was king Normally Jamess oldest son James Francis Edward would have been the heir However Parliament offered the crown to William and Mary as joint Sovereigns instead But it was added that the sole and full exercise of the regal power be only in and executed by the said Prince of Orange in the names of the said Prince and Princess during their joint lives The declaration was later extended to take out all Catholics This was because it hath been found by experience that it is inconsistent with the safety and welfare of this Protestant kingdom to be governed by a papist prince

William and Mary were crowned together at Westminster Abbey on 11 April 1689 The Archbishop of Canterbury usually performed coronations But William Sancroft the Archbishop at that time felt that James IIs removal had been wrong Therefore the Bishop of London Henry Compton crowned them instead On the day of the Coronation the Convention of the Estates of Scotland declared at last that James was no longer King of Scotland William and Mary were offered the separate Scottish Crown This was because the two kingdoms were not united until the Acts of Union in 1707 They accepted on 11 May

Even after this was declared there was still strong support for James in Scotland John Graham of Clevehouse the Viscount of Dundee raised an army and won a victory at Killiecrankie on 27 July But Dundees army suffered great losses and he was seriously wounded at the start of the battle This stopped the only effective resistance to William and the revolt was quickly crushed The next month there was a great defeat at the Battle of Dunkeld

In December 1689 Parliament passed one of the most important documents in English history This was the Bill of Rights This measure gave several rights to Parliament and the people Among other things it declared that the Sovereign could not break laws passed by Parliament demand taxes if the Parliament did not agree raise an army during a time of peace if the Parliament did not agree or punish members of the House of Parliament for anything they said during discussions

After either William III or Mary II died the other was to continue to rule The person who would become the monarch after them would be any of their children After the children would be Marys sister Anne and her children Last of all would be any children William III might have had from any marriage after that

From 1690 William was often away from England at first fighting Jacobites in Ireland While her husband was away Mary took care of the government She was a firm ruler and ordered her own uncle Henry Hyde 2nd Earl of Clarendon to go to prison for trying to put James II back onto the throne In 1692 she fired and put John Churchill 1st Duke of Marlborough in prison for similar reasons This made her much less popular It also damaged her relationship with her sister Anne Anne had been strongly influenced by Churchills wife Sarah She appeared at court with Sarah and supported Churchill which made Mary very angry She demanded that Anne make Sarah go away Mary did not visit Anne during her pregnancy after that After the baby was born Mary did visit Anne but she spent her time berating Anne for her friendship with Sarah The sisters never saw each other again

William had crushed the Irish Jacobites by 1692 but he continued with campaigns away from England to begin a war against France in the Netherlands When William was away Mary acted in her own name but on his advice When he was in England Mary never joined in political matters as had been agreed in the Bill of Rights However she did join in the affairs of the Church and all church matters passed through her hands

Mary died of smallpox at Kensington Palace on 28 December 1694 She was buried at Westminster Abbey When she died Henry Purcell was called to write her funeral music titled Music for the Funeral of Queen Mary William had grown to depend on Mary more and more and was very sad when she died It is reported that he said that from being the happiest he was now going to be the miserablest creature on earth

After Mary IIs death William III continued to rule as King Princess Annes last living child William Duke of Gloucester died in July 1700 Parliament saw that William would have no more children Because of this it passed the Act of Settlement 1701 After Anne the Crown would go to their nearest Protestant relative Sophia Electress of Hanover and her Protestant heirs When William III died in 1702 he was succeeded by Anne She was succeeded by the son of Electress Sophia George I

Mary gave money to the College of William and Mary in 1693 She also began the Royal Hospital for Seamen Greenwich

William III and Mary II called themselves William and Mary by the Grace of God King and Queen of England France and Ireland Defenders of the Faith etc when they began their rule On 11 April 1689 the Estates of Scotland recognized them as Sovereigns From then on William and Mary called themselves William and Mary by the Grace of God King and Queen of England Scotland France and Ireland Defenders of the Faith etc

Mesopotamia from the Greek language means between the rivers It includes the Euphrates and the Tigris rivers and the fertile land which surrounds them It is part of the Fertile Crescent Mesopotamia is today is split Most of it is in Iraq but parts are in Syria Turkey and Iran 

The area is often called the Cradle of Civilization The ancient writing called cuneiform was first used around 3000 BC by the Sumerians They lived in city states According to Genesis in the Old Testament Abraham lived in Mesopotamia before moving to Canaan

Historically important cities in Mesopotamia included Uruk Nippur Nineveh and Babylon as well as major territorial states such as the city of Ma asesblu the Akkadian kingdom the Third Dynasty of Ur and the Assyrian empire Some of the important historical Mesopotamian leaders were Ur Nammu Sargon Hammurabi and Tiglath Pileser I

Many advances in technology were made by the ancient Sumerians and Mesopotamians such as irrigation and trade by river and flood control Mesopotamians had agriculture and domesticated animals or livestock from the earliest records Babylon is probably the first city built by settled people Mesopotamia also was the place where the wheel was first used First it was a pottery wheel that was used to make clay pots then Sumerians adapted it for transport

Mesopotamia is made up of different regions Northern Mesopotamia is made up of hills and plains Seasonal rains and the rivers and streams come from the mountains Early settlers farmed the land and used timber metals and stone Southern Mesopotamia is made up of marshy areas and wide flat plains Cities developed along the rivers which flow through the region Early settlers had to irrigate the land along the banks of the rivers in order for their crops to grow 

Mesopotamia has been conquered many times by many different peoples It was the heartland of the Sumerian Akkadian Babylonian and Assyrian empires As each new group moved into the region they adopted some of the culture traditions and beliefs of the people who had come before It was conquered by Alexander the Great the Parthians the Romans the Persian Empire the Arabs It is still one of the most fertile parts of the Middle East

Ancient Mesopotamia begins in the late 6th millennium BC and ends with either the rise of the Achaemenid Persians in the 6th century BC or the Muslim conquest of Mesopotamia in the 7th century CE This long period may be divided as follows

The Epic of Gilgamesh is an ancient story about a relationship between Gilgamesh and his close companion Enkidu Enkidu is a wild man created by the gods as Gilgameshs equal to distract him from oppressing the citizens of Uruk Together they undertake dangerous quests that incur the displeasure of the gods Firstly they journey to the Cedar Mountain to defeat Humbaba its monstrous guardian Later they kill the Bull of Heaven that the goddess Ishtar has sent to punish Gilgamesh for turning down her advances

The second part of the epic is about Gilgameshs distressed reaction to Enkidus death which takes the form of a quest for immortality Gilgamesh attempts to learn the secret of eternal life by undertaking a long and perilous journey to meet the immortal flood hero Utnapishtim The words addressed to Gilgamesh in the midst of his quest foreshadow the end result 

Joss Hill Whedon is an American writer director and producer He was born Joseph Hill Whedon on June 23 1964 in New York He created the well known television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer Angel and Firefly He has also written several movie scripts and several comic book series After graduating from high school in 1982 he went to Winchester College in England He then got a film degree from Wesleyan University in 1987

After moving to Los Angeles Whedon got his first writing job on the television series Roseanne After working on movie scripts for several years he went back to television where he created three television series Joss has had a couple of cameos in his series Buffy Angel and Firefly He has also been in an episode of Veronica Mars

Whedon has been said to be the worlds first third generation television writer His father is Tom Whedon a writer for The Electric Company in the 1970s and The Golden Girls in the 1980s His grandfather is John Whedon a writer for The Donna Reed Show in the 1950s His brother Zack Whedon is a writer on HBOs Deadwood

The movie Buffy the Vampire Slayer filmed by director Fran Rubel Kuzui after a script of Whedons was not well liked by critics and audiences Years after Whedon picked up its idea again and turned it into a hugely successful television series also called Buffy the Vampire Slayer

The episode Hush got an Emmy Award nomination for Best Writing in a Drama Series in 2000 Another episode that got an Emmy Award nomination was Once More With Feeling written and directed by Whedon This was a musical episode in which the actors were singing and dancing

The series aired on The WB Network for five seasons then moved to UPN for its last two seasons It was the first series in television history to change networks between seasons without being cancelled and then picked up by a different network Though Buffy first aired on Mondays at 9pm from the middle of the second season it ran on Tuesdays at 8pm In the musical episode Buffy makes the comment Dawns in trouble Must be Tuesday

Angel was a spin off of Buffy the Vampire Slayer The series was named after Buffys vampire with a soul boyfriend It was created by Whedon and David Greenwalt Tim Minear also helped at times First shown in September 1999 on the WB the series was on after Buffy on Tuesday evenings When Buffy switched networks in 2001 Angel aired in a number of different time slots The series last episode had more people watching than the final Buffy episode Joss Whedon was briefly in the series as the character Numfar in its second season The WB cancelled the series in May 2004 while it was in its fifth season As Whedon had not planned to end Angel he had to change the story and ending of both the final season and the series

The series Firefly did not go smoothly Fox canceled it in 2002 after airing only 11 of the 14 episodes and airing them out of order The original two hour pilot was the last episode aired The contract with Fox did not allow the series to be shown by another network Because of how Fox handled Firefly Whedon has said that he will not work with Fox again under any circumstances

Whedon had been writing a movie script about the Firefly series for Universal Studios When the television series came out on DVD the sales of the DVD were good enough to make sure the movie could be produced In early 2004 Whedon said that a Firefly movie had been accepted by Universal and shooting started in July 2004 The movie called Serenity was in movie theaters in the United States on September 30 2005 It was well liked by critics and fans but did not make much money in theaters

Although Whedon has said that he would not work with Fox again it was announced on November 1 2007 that this was changed Whedon was hired to create seven episodes of a new series named Dollhouse starring Eliza Dushku Dushku and Whedon have worked together before on Buffy The series is about people who have memories skills and even complete personalities put into their minds for special jobs After the job their minds are erased until the next job Dollhouse tells the story of Dushkus character Echo as she starts to remember things about herself even though her mind is constantly being erased The series is about her trying to learn who she really is

Dollhouse first aired on February 13 2009

Whedon has written and helped write several movies including Buffy the Vampire Slayer Toy Story Alien Resurrection and Titan AE He was nominated for an Academy Award for Toy Storys screenplay

He also wrote helped edit and rewrite the scripts of Speed Waterworld Twister and X Men Except for Speed not much of Whedons work stayed in the final versions of any of these screenplays He has said that he had a good script for Alien Resurrection which was ruined by its director Jean Pierre Jeunet His Waterworld script was thrown out Only two of his lines were kept in the final script of X Men Even the Buffy movie was very different from what he originally wrote According to Graham Yost the writer of Speed Whedon wrote most of its dialogue

He wrote and directed 2005s Serenity based on his television series Firefly Serenity won the 2006 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation Long Form

In 2006 Whedon was scheduled to write and direct Warner Bros version of Wonder Woman He eventually stopped working on the script Universal Pictures agreed to a script by Whedon called Goners which he will also direct

Parts of the storyline in the movie X Men The Last Stand are very similar to what he wrote in the Marvel comic book Astonishing X Men The idea of a cure for mutation was his story The scientist who finds the cure in the movie is named Dr Kavita Rao This is the same name as the scientist in the comic book Simon Kinberg has said someone at the studio who had read Whedons comics asked the writers to use a mutant cure idea in their script

In an interview with Empire Online Whedon said he would like to direct a Harry Potter movie However he has not seen any of the movies and will not watch any until JK Rowling is done writing the series

Whedon has loved comic books all his life He wrote the Dark Horse Comics series Fray The story takes place in the far future of the Buffyverse

He was also involved with the Buffy comic book series He wrote the main storyline of the five issue mini series Tales of the Vampires and three stories in the Tales of the Slayers One of those stories was about Melaka Fray from Fray

The three issue mini series Serenity Those Left Behind was based on the Firefly series It took place just before the movie Serenity It was released from June to August of 2005 The first two issues sold out before going into a second printing 

Whedon has said that more Serenity comics are planned for the near future Whedon and other Buffy writers write more for the Buffy series These stories would take place after the final episode They would be considered Season 8 The first 6 issues are due out in March 2007 Both projects will be published by Dark Horse Comics In August 2007 Dark Horse Comics began a series on online comics on MySpace One of the series shown Sugarshock is written by Whedon 

Whedon is also writing Astonishing X Men in Marvel Comics popular series about the X Men This has been one of Marvels best selling comics in 2006 It has been nominated for many awards It won the award for Best Continuing Series in 2006 

It has also been said that Whedon helped writers with the ending to the comic Civil War

Whedon will become the new writer of the Marvel comic Runaways when series creator Brian K Vaughan finishes his run Whedon is actually a fan of the series He had a letter published in the first volume The letter was included in the Volume 1 hardcover version

Whedon sees himself as a feminist Feminist themes are common in his work The best example is what he says is his habit of writing about teenage girls with superpowers This is seen in Buffy Firefly and Serenity Whedon says his mother is the reason for his feminist idea When Roseanne Barr asked him how he could write so well for women he replied If you met my mom you wouldnt ask 

The character Kitty Pryde from the X Men comic was an early model for Whedons strong teenage girl characters If theres a bigger influence on Buffy than Kitty I dont know what it was She was an adolescent girl finding out she has great power and dealing with it Many of Whedons young female characters went through the same type of thing Whedon has now come full circle writing the character of Kitty Pryde in the Astonishing X Men comic

Whedon is interested in the homosexual community He is strongly for gay rights In his works including Buffy the Vampire Slayer he has gay characters as both the major and the minor characters In Buffy he used scenes that suggested that either Xander Harris or Willow Rosenberg might be homosexual At the time he did not know which character he wanted to be gay He decided that Willow would take part in a lesbian relationship with another young woman fellow college student Tara Maclay Two more minor characters in the series Larry and Scott were also homosexuals In Angel the script hinted at a homosexual experience between Spike and Angel In Firefly Inara Serra was shown as being bisexual She accepted both male and female clients

The dialogue in Joss Whedons series and movies is notable It is often very witty and has many pop culture references Some are easy to notice other are more difficult He also likes to turn nouns into adjectives by adding a y at the end of the word According to one of the Buffy writers Its just the way that Joss actually talks 

Many characters die in Whedons series This is very true in Buffy It is common for extras and even minor characters to die in action based series and movies Whedon also kills off main characters He gets the audience to care about the character before their death It is a part of doing his job On the Serenity DVD commentary Whedon says that hed rather have fans say Whyd they kill I liked him than Oh Hes dead Turn the page Whedon often kills off characters right after something very good happens to them

As seen in Buffy Firefly and Angel nearly all of the romantic relationships Whedon series end badly One member in the relationship will usually end up dying or turning evil The break up will end up being very painful 

There is a strong theme that family is the group of people that a person lives their life with not the people that raised them as a child This is a major theme for the main characters in all of his television series

Whedon often shows fathers in a bad way Most of them are not around Wes father was shown several times to be abusive While mothers play a big part in his works characters rarely talk about or seem to be ever affected by their fathers Whedons characters often find someone to take the place of a father in their lives

Firs are in about 45 55 species of evergreen trees in the family Pinaceae All are trees reaching heights of 1080 m tall and trunk diameters of 054 m when mature The difference between firs and other members of the pine family is that their needle like leaves are attached to the twig by a base that resembles a small suction cup and by erect cylindrical female cones 525 cm long that release the winged seeds The male cones are normally much smaller and spread through the tree so that the wind can help pollinate the female cones

Like all members of the pine family these trees have a sticky sap called resin

Fir wood is not suitable for construction because it is not very resistant to insects and decay It is usually sawn or crushed into fine sheets or pieces and made into plywood or chipboard for indoor or temporary outdoor use However because different species have different shapes sizes and colours fir trees are used widely as ornamental trees in gardens and parks They can be used as shelter trees to protect other plants from wind or as specimen trees growing alone to show off their beauty

A cone is an organ on plants in the division Pinophyta that contains the reproductive structures It is the part of a tree that lets the tree reproduce Its formal name in botany is strobilus plural strobili

The familiar woody cone is the female cone which produces seeds The male cones which produce pollen are usually smaller and much less conspicuous even at full maturity The individual plates of a cone are known as scales

The male cone is structurally similar across all conifers differing only in small ways from species to species Extending out from a central axis are microsporophylls Under each microsporophyll is one or several microsporangia

Conifer cones and their seeds have been used for lots of different purposes They are often used for decorations Some seeds for example the seeds of pinyon pines are used in prepared foods and baking

Boomerang is the name of at least four television networks owned by Cartoon Network Boomerang was one of the two actual spin offs of Cartoon Network showing classic animated cartoons and animated television series from the Warner Bros Metro Goldwyn Mayer and Hanna Barbera archives

Formerly a segment of programming within the Cartoon Network the channel was launched at the end of the 20th century and introduced to satellite in April 1 2000

A boomerang is a flying tool that is best known for its ability to return to the thrower It used to be made of wood but most of the modern boomerangs are made of other materials

Most people know that Australian Aborigines used boomerangs for hunting But the oldest boomerang was found in a cave in Poland and is more than 20000 years old This kind of boomerang does not return to the thrower but it can fly longer distances and more stably than other things which can be thrown These days boomerangs are usually used for recreation 

Most of the boomerangs do not have the classical L shape The modern boomerang is special in that it will return to the one who threw it if it is thrown correctly However some boomerangs do not return because their wings do not have the right profile Most of the boomerangs are made for right handed use Left handed people have to use other boomerangs that are mirror inverted or have to throw with their right hand 

A boomerang is not thrown like a frisbee It has to be thrown almost vertically with an inclination of about 1020 degrees and with a lot of rotation When facing the wind throw with an angle of 3045 degrees to the right of the wind Be sure to choose a field that is big enough Watch out for passers by and do not throw when people are standing in the range of the boomerang See also the link provided in the section below

There are a lot of boomerang clubs in many countries all over the world These clubs organise workshops and tournaments The best boomerang throwers come from Australia France Germany Japan Switzerland and the United States of America A few years ago the International Federation of Boomerang Associations was founded to help to spread knowledge about boomerangs

Baldur once had a nightmare that he would be killed His mother Frigg made all the things on Earth vow not to hurt him The mistletoe did not vow however and Frigg considered it to be so inimportant that she did not mind Loki found out that the mistletoe had not vowed made a spear out of mistletoes and tricked Hodhr to kill Baldur with it The death of Baldur is the start of Ragnarok Many gods and goddesses came to his funeral His wife Nana also died of sadness His father Odin placed the golden ring Draupnir on Baldur but he later sent the ring back from Hell This ring somehow came to Freyrs hand

A prophecy is a claim of what the future will be like which is not based on any ordinary source of information In some ways prophecies are similar to religion Not all people believe in prophecy People that do think they come from God or a God They are often hard to understand and need interpretation Very often they concern one very specific event People who make prophecies are called prophets In Ancient Greece people who made prophecies were called oracles most notably the Oracle of Delphi Since then people like Nostradamus have made prophecies

Anatotitan was a type of dinosaur called a hadrosaur It did not have a crest unlike its later relative Parasaurolophus An Anatotitan grows to be 12 meters long Its fossils have been found in South Dakota and Montana One of the skulls found measured nearly 12 meters long The duckbill part of its muzzle is almost as wide as its head which makes it larger than any another hadrosaur There are two species of Anatotitan A copei and A longiceps

Anatotitan was first discovered in 1882 by paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope and was named Trachodon mirabilis Another hadrosaur discovered in 1892 was named Claosaurus annectens by Othniel Charles Marsh In 1942 two paleontologists decided that C annectens belonged in its own genus called Annatosaurus and renamed C annectens A annectens T mirabilis was renamed A copei Many paleontologists now think Annatosaurus is actually Edmontosaurus while others think it belongs in another genus called Anatotitan

Anatotitan was shown in the movie When Dinosaurs Roamed America and the television series Walking with Dinosaurs

The Book of Job is the 18th book in the Hebrew Bible or Old Testament The book of Job is poetry 

The Bible says In the land of Uz there lived a man whose name was Job This man was blameless and upright he feared God and shunned evil 2 He had seven sons and three daughters 3 and he owned seven thousand sheep three thousand camels five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred donkeys and had a large number of servants He was the greatest man among all the people of the East 5 When a period of feasting had run its course Job would send and have them purified Early in the morning he would sacrifice a burnt offering for each of them thinking Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts This was Jobs regular custom The Bible also says that Job was a pious rich loyal and a man who loved God

One day Satan and the Angels of God went to God God tells Satan about his servant Job and how good he is Satan says that the only reason why he is like that is because God was good to him and gave him sons and daughters and many animals Satan asks if he can test Job and God lets him God tells Satan not to kill Job

The first test Satan did was to take away all of Jobs animals killing the servants that were with the animals and killing all of Jobs sons and daughters while they were eating together Even though Satan did these things to Job Job did not curse God like Satan wanted Job to do

Satan and the Angels went to meet God again Like before God talked about how good his servant Job is Satan says that Job will curse God if he makes Job sick which he did This is the last meeting with Satan the Angels

Satan afflicted sores all over Jobs body Jobs wife told him to curse God and die Job told her that if he said that that would be foolish Even though Job lost everything he had and suffered from painful sores all over his body he did not sin against God by cursing him Satan had failed in trying to make him sin This is the final time Satan is mentioned in the Book of Job

When Jobs friends heard about the things that happened to him they went to comfort him Most of the book tells about Job and his friends talking The names of his friends are Eliphaz Bildad and Zophar Towards the end of the book Jobs friends start to think that Job is not good because a lot of bad things are happening to him Job keeps on saying that he is good but he starts to wonder if God really is good

After God speaks to Job and his three friends God gets very angry at two of Jobs friends for thinking that Job was not a good man and for saying things about God they did not know about and Job prays for his friends God answers his prayer God blesses Job because he did not curse Him God gives him more than he had before

Abide with Me is a religious song or hymn It was written by Henry Lyte in 1847 The hymn was sung at the wedding of King George VI of the United Kingdom and the wedding of Queen Elizabeth II The song is sung at the start of the FA Cup finals

Abide with me fast falls the eventide

The darkness deepens Lord with me abide

When other helpers fail and comforts flee

Help of the helpless O abide with me

Swift to its close ebbs out lifes little day

Earths joys grow dim its glories pass away

Change and decay in all around I see

O Thou who changest not abide with me

Not a brief glance I beg a passing word

But as Thou dwellst with Thy disciples Lord

Familiar condescending patient free

Come not to sojourn but abide with me

Come not in terrors as the King of kings

But kind and good with healing in Thy wings

Tears for all woes a heart for every plea

Come Friend of sinners and thus bide with me

Thou on my head in early youth didst smile

And though rebellious and perverse meanwhile

Thou hast not left me oft as I left Thee

On to the close O Lord abide with me

I need Thy presence every passing hour

What but Thy grace can foil the tempters power

Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be

Through cloud and sunshine Lord abide with me

I fear no foe with Thee at hand to bless

Ills have no weight and tears no bitterness

Where is deaths sting Where grave thy victory

I triumph still if Thou abide with me

Hold Thou Thy cross before my closing eyes

Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies

Heavens morning breaks and earths vain shadows flee

In life in death O Lord abide with me

Reste avec nous Seigneur le jour dcline

La nui sapproche et nous menace tous

Nous implorons ta prsence divine

Reste avec nous Seigneur reste avec nous

En toi nos coeurs ont salu leur Matre

En toi notre me a trouv son poux

A ta lumire elle se rent renatre

Reste avec nous Seigneur reste avec nous

Les vains bonheurs de ce monde infidle

Nenfantent rien que regrets ou dgots

Nous avons soif dune joie ternelle

Reste avec nous Seigneur reste avec nous

Dans nos combat si ta main nous dlaisse

Satan vainqueur nous tiendra sous ses coups

Que ta puissance arme notre faiblesse

Reste avec nous Seigneur reste avec nous

Sous ton regard la joie est sainte et bonne

Prs de ton coeur les pleurs mme sont doux

Soit que ta main nous frappe ou nous couronne

Reste avec nous Seigneur reste avec nous

Et quand au bout de plerinage

Nous partirons pour le grand rendezvous

Pour nous guider dans ce dernier passage

Reste avec nous Seigneur reste avec nous

Hail Mary is a Christian prayer to Mary the mother of Jesus Most of the text comes from the Gospel of Luke though there were some additions in the 13th century In the prayer the person praying asks Mary to intercede for them with God

The Hail Mary is used within Roman Catholicism as the basis of the Rosary The prayer is also used by the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox as well as by many other groups within the Catholic tradition of Christianity including Anglicans Independent Catholics and Old Catholics Some Protestant denominations also make use of the prayer 

The prayer uses two passages from Saint Lukes Gospel Hail full of grace the Lord is with thee blessed art thou amongst women and Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb

In mid thirteenth century Western Europe the prayer was only three words and the added word Mary after the word Hail We know this from the writings of Saint Thomas Aquinas on the prayer

The first of the two passages from Saint Lukes Gospel is the greeting of the Angel Gabriel to Mary originally written in Koine Greek The opening word of greeting chare here translated Hail really means Rejoice Be glad This was the normal greeting in the language in which Saint Lukes Gospel is written and is still spoken that way in Modern Greek For this reason both Hail and Rejoice are good English translations of the word

The word here translated as full of grace lets there be different translations Grammatically the word is the feminine present perfect passive voice participle of the verb charit which means to show or bestow with grace and in the passive voice to have grace shown or bestowed upon one The form of the verb is intensive so we know the translation is full of grace 

The text also appears in the story of the annunciation from the apocryphal Infancy Gospel of Matthew in chapter 9

The Hail Mary prayer of the Eastern Orthodox Church and Eastern Catholic Churches is in the form             

A different translation of the same text into English is

To the Biblical texts this adds the opening invocation Theotokos Virgin the name Mary and the concluding for you have borne the Saviour of our souls

The article on Hail Mary in the Catholic Encyclopedia says that the Hail Mary was not used in this form before about 1050 Nevertheless a later story attributes the current Hail Mary to Ildephonsus of Toledo who lived in the 7th century According to the story he used the angels greeting only without the later addition

Saint Thomas Aquinas spoke of the name Mary indicating who was the full of grace person addressed as the only word that had been added in the West even by the mid thirteenth century to the Biblical verses of which the prayer was composed But at about the same time the name Jesus was also added to specify who was meant by the phrase the fruit of thy womb 

For this reason the Western version of the prayer is not derived from the Greek version even the earliest Western forms have no trace of the phrases Mother of God and Virgin and for thou hast given birth to the Saviour of our souls which are part of the Greek version 

To the greeting and praise of Mary of which the prayer thus consisted a petition Holy Mary Mother of God pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death Amen was commonly added around the time of the Council of Trent The Dutch Jesuit Petrus Canisius is credited with adding in1555 in his Catechism the sentence 

Eleven years later the sentence was included in the Catechism of the Council of Trent of 1566 The Catechism of the Council of Trent says that to the first part of the Hail Mary by which we render to God the highest praise and return Him most gracious thanks because He has bestowed all His heavenly gifts on the most holy Virgin the Church of God has wisely added prayers and an invocation addressed to the most holy Mother of God we should earnestly implore her help and assistance for that she possesses exalted merits with God and that she is most desirous to assist us by her prayers no one can doubt without impiety and wickedness

The current Latin version is therefore as follows

For translations from the Latin into various languages see Wikisource

The Syriac Orthodox Church uses a version of the Hail Mary much closer to the current Western form than to the Greek version

The prayer is said in the following manner

In the Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches the prayer is very common in the Greek form indicated above or in translations from it Although it is not said quite as often as in the West it is well known oft used and appears in several canons of prayer It is typically sung thrice at the end of Vespers during an All Night Vigil as well as occurring many times in the course of daily prayer

There exist two variant versions in Church Slavonic

The first is the older and remains in use by the Old Believers as well as those who follow the Ruthenian recension The second appeared in 1656 under the liturgical reforms of Patriarch Nikon of Moscow and is in use by the Russian Orthodox Church the Serbian Orthodox Church the Bulgarian Orthodox Church and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church

The Hail Mary is the essential element of the Rosary a prayer method in use especially among Latin Rite Catholics and that appears in the East only among Latinised Ukrainian and Maronite Catholics It consists of four sets of five Mysteries These meditate upon events of Jesus life during his childhood public ministry Passion and from his Resurrection onwards Each of these Mysteries is prayed as a decade consisting of one Our Father ten Hail Marys and one Glory Be

The Hail Mary is also the central part of the Angelus a devotion generally recited thrice daily by many Catholics as well as some Anglicans and Lutherans

Anglo Catholics also employ the Hail Mary in devotional practice Traditional Anglo Catholics use the prayer in much the same way as the Roman Catholics including use of the Rosary and the recitation of the Angelus Many Anglican churches contain statues of the Virgin Mary and the faithful use devotional prayers including the Hail Mary However there might be some variations in local usage reflecting the differing theological leanings of the two bodies

Many people have written music for the Hail Mary or Ave Maria Among the most famous settings is the version by Charles Gounod adding melody and words to Johann Sebastian Bachs first prelude from the Well Tempered Clavier Antonn Dvoks version was composed in 1877  Another setting of Ave Maria was written by Giuseppe Verdi for his 1887 opera Otello Russian composer Csar Cui who was raised Roman Catholic set the text at least three times as the Ave Maria op 34 for 1 or 2 womens voices with piano or harmonium and as part of two of his operas Le Flibustier and Mateo Falcone Settings also exist by Mozart Byrd Elgar Verdi Saint Saens Rossini Brahms and Perosi as well as numerous versions by less well known composers such as JB Tresch

In Slavonic the text was also a popular subject for setting to music by Eastern European composers These include Rachmaninov Stravinsky Bortniansky and several others

This text was also very often set by composers in the Renaissance including Jacques Arcadelt Josquin Desprez Orlando di Lasso and Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina Before the Council of Trent there were actually different versions of the text so the earlier composers in the period sometimes set versions of the text different from the ones shown above Josquin Desprez for example himself set more than one version of the Ave Maria Here is an example of a text set by Josquin which begins with the first six words above but continues with a poem in rhymed couplets 

 Franz Schuberts Ellens dritter Gesang is often misidentified as Schuberts Ave Maria because it opens with the greeting Ave Maria even though it is not a setting of the traditional Ave Maria prayer The original text of Schuberts song is from Sir Walter Scotts The Lady of the Lake and was translated into German by Adam Storck Adding to the confusion the traditional Ave Maria prayer is often sung to Schuberts melody of Ellens dritter Gesang and in Walt Disneys Fantasia the tune is used with yet another text beginning with the phrase

Even though Protestant Christianity generally avoids any special veneration of Mary access to the beautiful and culturally significant tradition of Marian music is made easier by replacement texts These texts replace the words of the standard Ave Maria preserving word boundaries and syllable stresses so that music written for the former text can be sung with the latter An example is the Christ centric Ave Redemptor

A studio is a place where an artist can work Studios can be used for many things such as making photos movies television shows cartoons or music The word comes from the Latin word studium which means to eagerly want something

A music studio is a room or group of rooms that are used for practicing music Most music studios have a piano and a mirror 

A recording studio is used for recording music speech or other kinds of sound Many recordings become works of art in themselves

The Electric Light Orchestra also known as ELO were a popular English rock band from the 1970s and early 1980s Their leader was musician and songwriter Jeff Lynne Lynne wrote and sang most of their songs He also produced their recordings Other members included Richard Tandy on keyboards Bev Bevan on drums Mike DAlbuquerque and later Kelly Groucutt on bass guitar Hugh McDowell Mik Kaminski and Melvyn Gale played violin and cello The orchestras name is a joke on electric light and a Light Orchestra

The band began as a side project of another band The Move by musicians Roy Wood and Jeff Lynne While The Move had added touches of classical music to their pop hits Wood and Lynne wanted to blend rock music and classical music more closely Move drummer Bevan joined their project Wood played nearly all the non rock instruments on their first album They made the most of recording studio technology including multitrack recording and overdubbing

Their first album was titled Electric Light Orchestra It was released with that name in the United Kingdom When the album was released in the United States their American record label United Artists did not know the album was titled after the group They phoned ELOs British label to ask for the title When nobody answered No Answer was written down Mistaken later for the title the album appeared in America as No Answer The bands first single was titled 10538 Overture It became an FM radio favourite In time ELOs music became more popular than The Moves had been The Move disbanded and Electric Light Orchestra became a full time group

Roy Wood decided to leave ELO partway through the recording of the second album He started another band called Wizzard Jeff Lynne took over leadership and McDowell Kaminski and Gale joined The album ELO 2 was finished and released but was not as well liked as the first A single on the album was a cover version of Chuck Berrys Roll Over Beethoven It added parts of many Beethoven compositions to Berrys song It became another radio hit

Their third album On the Third Day included a rock interpretation of In the Hall of the Mountain King The album had another hit single titled Showdown ELO began to tour the United States They started with small audiences They became more popular with time and added theatrical touches to their shows New contact microphones made it possible for the classical musicians to move around and even dance on stage as pop musicians did The audiences enjoyed watching them

By their fourth album Eldorado ELO had gone from overdubbing their small membership to recording with real orchestras They had problems when they worked in their native England British classical musicians usually kept more to union rules than to the job of making music They sometimes walked out during recordings This hurt the process of making their records so ELO tried a studio called Musicland in Munich Germany They liked the way the studio worked and the German musicians were more devoted ELO used Musicland many more times

Their next album Face the Music yielded two hit singles Strange Magic and Evil Woman ELO became even more popular A compilation album Ol ELO featured most of their early singles Three songs from their 1976 album A New World Record became worldwide hits These were Telephone Line Livin Thing and Do Ya which was a remake of a Move song

ELO recorded a double album in 1977 Out of the Blue which included Turn to Stone Sweet Talkin Woman and Mr Blue Sky which also became hit records The band toured worldwide with a stage set that looked like a UFO which opened to reveal the band performing inside Their shows included lots of stage lighting and laser effects

Their next new album Discovery did not appear until 1979 ELOs record label Jet Records changed distributors from United Artists to Columbia Records and this was part of the delay Discovery included two singles Shine a Little Love and Dont Bring Me Down Dont Bring Me Down was the first ELO single to not include any classical instruments Columbia issued a Greatest Hits album which overlapped some of the Ol ELO songs with later ones

ELO became less popular during the 1980s They had fewer hits They recorded the Xanadu soundtrack with singer Olivia Newton John They also released the albums Time in 1981 Secret Messages in 1983 and finally Balance of Power which included Calling America in 1986 By this time the classical musicians had left Lynne now was recording their parts with synthesizers or session players

Jeff Lynne was now producing other recording artists including The Everly Brothers and stopped working with Electric Light Orchestra in 1986 Most of the remaining members though wanted to continue working together and regrouped first as a band named OrKestra then later as ELO Part II These lineups toured for years playing ELOs old hits and releasing two albums of new material while Lynne continued his producing career Lynne also released a solo album Armchair Theatre in 1990 and formed the Traveling Wilburys with former Beatle George Harrison

Lynne recorded an album Zoom in 2001 again using the ELO name but with a new set of musicians He made a handful of television appearances with the new lineup They played both old and new songs He also planned to tour with them Interest in the band was not strong though and most of the shows were cancelled 

Electric Light Orchestras music had only a weak presence in popular culture from the mid 1980s until the early 2000s Their blend of classical and rock music made their music hard to put in radio play lists ELOs music has made a comeback in the 2000s through its use in movie soundtracks and also in commercial jingles such as for Monster

The word vicious has several meanings

The term Ash can have different meanings

Ash trees are medium to large trees of the genus fraxinus of the family Oleaceae The family contains between 45 and 65 species Some of them are evergreen but most are deciduous They grow in most parts of the world The seeds are commonly known as keys in English They are a type of fruit known as a samara Most of the ash species have light green oval shaped pinnate leaves If they are deciduous they may turn yellow before dropping sometimes frost may cause them to drop while still green

Ash wood is used to make various tools handles and bows It also makes very good firewood Ash trees are also perfect material for old fashion shafts for bow and arrows

In Norse Mythology the World tree Yggdrasil is commonly thought to be an ash tree The first man Askr was formed from an ash The first woman was made from an alder 

In the Western Christian calendar Ash Wednesday is the first day of Lent It ends in a Carnival It generally is 40 days before Easter The date is different each year Generally it is between February 4 and March 10 In truth there are 46 days between Ash Wednesday and Easter but Sundays are not counted in this period 

Those able to and willing to should fast voluntarily between Ash Wednesday and Easter There are exceptions though Pregnant women sick people children and the old usually dont have to 

Ash Wednesday is a very important part of Lent

Valkyries are lesser goddesses in Norse Mythology They serve the chief god Odin Their task is to choose those who have died in the most heroic way in battle The Valkyrie then carries the chosen one off to Valhalla This chosen one would then be called einherjars They would then be shared between Odin and Freyja They would fight at Odins side at Ragnark the battle at the end of the world In Valhalla the Valkyries would also serve drink and care for the well being of the feasting warriors 

The old Norse people thought that Valkyries rode giant wolves and that they had black wings which corrospond to ravens these two creatures both scavenge corpses on the battlefield symbolising death and destruction With the spread of Christianity the idea of what a Valkyrie was like changed more and more to a Romantic description of a beautiful woman 

Richard Wagner composed some operas featuring Valkyries These operas are Die Walkre Siegfried and Gtterdmmerung They feature a story of a valkyrie Brnnhilde her punishment for disobeying her father and her falling in love with Siegfried The music for the opening of Act Three of Die Walkre is very famous It is called the Ride of the Valkyries

Zosterops is a type of bird There are many different species of Zosterops around the world

Dimorphodon was a prehistoric flying pterosaur from the early Jurassic period It had a big head a small brain a tall beak and two types of teeth Variation in teeth is rare in pterosaurs 

Like Rhamphorhynchus Dimorphodon is only found in Jurassic strata It was the first pterosaur found in England by Mary Anning in 1828

The name Cryolophosaurus means cold crested lizard The characteristic feature of this dinosaur is the large crest on the top of the skull above the eyes The nasal bones extend toward the back of the skull as ridges and then join with the lacrimal bones to form a grooved crest which extends perpendicularly from the skull Cryolophosaurus was discovered in the Jurassic Hanson Formation in the Transantarctic Mountains and represents the only theropod dinosaur to be found in Antarctica

The dinosaur was discovered by Dr William Hammer during a 1990 91 expedition Dr Hammer is a professor of geology at Augustana College in Rock Island IL where a cast of Cryolophosaurus currently resides The find of this dinosaur was significant because it proves that the dinosaurs lived on all of the continents and that high latitude climates were tolerated by dinosaurs Cryolophosaurus is also of significance because it represents the oldest known tetanuran from any continent it is the only one from the Early Jurassic

Coloborhynchus was a pterosaur It has been found in Lower Cretaceous rocks in England and Brazil It is a similar genus to Anhanguera and Ornithocheirus

The type specimen of Coloborhynchus is known only from a partial upper jaw It can only be distinguished from its relatives by its unique combination of tooth socket positions In Coloborhynchus the two front teeth pointed forward and were higher on the jaw than the other teeth while the next three pairs of teeth pointed to the sides The final two pairs of teeth in this specimen point downward Finally a unique oval depression was located below the first pair of teeth

The possible species Coloborhynchus capito is the largest toothed pterosaur known A specimen from the Cambridge Greensand has a very large upper jaw tip which displays the typical teeth which distinguish C capito from other species The jaw tip is nearly 10 cm tall and 56 cm wide with teeth up to 13 cm in base diameter If the proportions of this specimen was the same as other known species of Coloborhycnhus the total skull length could have been up to 75 cm leading to an estimated wingspan of convert7mft

Alder trees are found in all parts of the northern hemisphere and they are often found on poor andor wet soil Alders have alternate simple leaves with a toothed edge The male flowers are in the form of hanging catkins and the female flowers are much smaller catkin like structures The pollen is transferred from the male to the female flower by the wind The female flower parts develop into little green rounded cone like fruits which turn brown in autumn and open to release the seeds 

The best known species are the Black Alder which can be seen throughout Europe The largest is probably the Red Alder native to North America It reaches about 32 35 metres in height The widespread Green Alder is a shrub rarely more than 5m high The commonest alder in the UK is the Black Alder also called the Common Alder or European Alder 

Alder is a preferred tree for bees especially in spring It is also used to make charcoal 

Futabasaurus was a plesiosaur from the Upper Cretaceous A complete skeleton of one has not been found It is not known very well Futabasaurus is also a name given to a meat eating dinosaur It is different from the plesiosaur

An ovum is the name for the haploid female reproductive cell or gamete Both animals and land plants produce ova 

Ova are made and released by a females ovaries At birth a female has all of her eggs and from puberty she releases an egg once a month until none are left This is called oogenesis 

When the ovum is fertilised by a males sperm it becomes a zygote which develops into a new organism The ovum is fertilized inside the female body and the embryo then develops inside the uterus being fed by the mothers placenta

The ovum is the largest cell in the human body You can see it without a microscope The human ovum is between 100 and 200 m long They are nevertheless much smaller than the cleidoic eggs laid externally by reptiles and birds which is why they need a long period of internal development in the womb

The sexual cycle is quite different in other mammals whose females are only receptive during their heat which triggers the release of eggs from the ovary Sexual activity then continues for a few days then ceases entirely until the next heat

In many plants ova are made inside archegonia through meiosis The archegonium has a long neck with the egg cell inside When the egg is mature the neck opens and sperm swims in to fertilize the egg

In flowering plants the female gametes are made of only eight cells called the embryo sac inside the ovule The cell closest to the opening of the embryo sac becomes the egg cell When pollinated sperm swims into the embryo sac and fertilizes the egg The zygote then develops into an embryo inside the ovule

 ImageGray3pngA human ovum ImageAcrosomereactiondiagramensvgSperm cells trying to fertilize an ovum ImageSperm eggjpgA sperm cell fusing with an ovum 

Ovules produce the cells which get fertilised during sexual reproduction in plants The word literally means small egg 

In seed plants the ovule is the structure that gives rise to and contains the female reproductive cells The megagametophyte produces the egg cell for fertilisation 

The horn is a brass instrument It developed from the horns that some animals have on their heads Modern horns are often called French horns

Horns were often used during hunting These early brass instruments were round so that the hunter could put his arm through it and carry it on his shoulder and blow it while riding a horse The riders could send messages to one another by blowing particular notes

In the 17th century the modern orchestra was developing Orchestras played for operas Opera stories in those days were usually about gods and goddesses or kings and queens There was often a hunting scene in the story Hunters were asked to come and play their horns in the orchestra for these scenes This is how the horn became an orchestral instrument

A brass instrument gives one basic note A few other notes can be got by changing the pressure with the lips Gradually horn players discovered that if they put their right hand in the bell they could change the basic note This made it possible to play lots of different notes When Mozart wrote his horn concertos he was writing for a hand horn When a note is played using the hand in the bell it makes the note sound different more muffled A Mozart horn concerto sounds very different when played on a modern horn

Another way to change the notes on a horn was to use crooks These are like extensions to the horn The longer the tube the lower the note so adding a crook would give a lower basic note 

By the 1830s the modern horn with three valves had been invented These valves change the length of the tube so that the horn had now become chromatic ie it could play all the notes including sharps and flats Composers like Richard Wagner and Richard Strauss wrote complicated music for the horn which would never have been possible on the natural valveless instruments However some composers preferred the sound of the natural horn Brahms wrote for the natural horn when he wrote his Horn Trio for piano violin and horn Benjamin Britten in his Serenade for tenor horn and strings asks for the horn to played naturally for the fanfare at the beginning to make it sound like a hunting horn 

The horn has a conical bore This means that the tubing gradually becomes wider the tubing is the same thickness all the way along The modern horn has 64 metres of tubing  It makes a beautiful warm sound but it is quite hard to play because the mouthpiece is small and the harmonics are very close together The horn is a transposing instrument usually in F

At the end of the 19th century the so called double horn was invented which was like a combination of a horn in F and a horn in B flat

In the 18th century there were generally two horns in an orchestra This became three or four in the 19th century and some large orchestras now may have up to eight horns

In Norse mythology Valhalla is a giant hall In it Odin presides over all those warriors which were slain in battle and deeemed worthy to attend The Valkyries choose the warriors These warriors will fight on Odins side at Ragnark the battle at the end of the world 

During the day they fight during the night they consume Also they would drink during the day whilst they fight alcoholic mead

Horns are part of the body of some animals They grow on the animals head They are projections made of hard skin The horn has a lot of keratin in it the same protein that is in human hair and nails 

Normally horned animals will have two horns but the rhinoceros has just one horn in the middle of its head

Animals often use their horns for fighting one another

Thousands of years ago people used the horns of dead animals for musical instruments In later times they were used for carrying gunpowder

Mead is a fermented alcoholic drink It is made from honey Its history is possibly as old as that of beer It is made by mixing honey water and yeast Some kinds of mead also include spices or fruit Mead is sometimes called honey wine Archaeologists discovered that people made mead 9000 years ago Mead was described in the Rigveda which is a Hindu religious text Mead is popular in Central Europe and the Balkans Mead is also made in Ethiopia and South Africa

Bergstrae is the name of a mountain route and the area around it which stretches across the western edge of the Odenwald in southern Hesse and northern Baden Wrttemberg Germany 

The name Bergstrae also refers to the district Kreis Bergstrae the independent wine growing region of Hessische Bergstrae and the Badische Bergstrae in the Baden wine growing area

The route goes almost straight from north to south at the spot where the Rhine lowlands meet the western edge of the Odenwald The name comes from the roads route along the foot of the mountains the Rhine lowlands once being too damp to build a road there

The route mostly follows the modern B3 road It begins in Darmstadt and after passing through Eberstadt splits into the Old Bergstrae and the New Bergstrae which goes somewhat farther to the west The two routes meet again at Zwingenberg

In Weinheim Ltzelsachsen the route splits into an old and a new Bergstrae again The new one passes west of the old route as far as Heidelberg Handschuhsheim where the two meet once more The route carrying on after the Neckar from Heidelberg to Wiesloch is still usually known as the Bergstrae even though the type of country and climate typical of the Bergstrae is no longer as clear

The Caucasus or Caucasia is a region in Eurasia bordered on the south by Iran on the southwest by Turkey on the west by the Black Sea on the east by the Caspian Sea and on the north by Russia The Persian name for the region is Qafqz Caucasia includes the Caucasus Mountains and surrounding lowlands 

The Caucasus Mountains are commonly known as a line between Asia and Europe and the lands in Caucasia are different considered to be in one or both continents The northern portion of the Caucasus is known as the Ciscaucasus and the southern portion as the Transcaucasus The highest peak in the Caucasus is Mount Elbrus which in the western Ciscaucasus in Russia is generally considered the highest point in Europe

The Biblical Mount Ararat where Noahs Ark landed is known as the landmark of the ancient Armenian realm The peak of Ararat is seasonally capped with snow In Greek mythology the Caucasus or Kaukasos was one of the pillars supporting the world Prometheus was chained there by Zeus The Roman poet Ovid placed Caucasus in Scythia and said it was a cold and stony mountain which was the abode of personified hunger

The Hamidian massacres took place around 1895 until 1897 The estimated number of Armenians killed are around 100000  300000

These events are known by the Armenians as the Great Massacres The Armenians believed the Hamidian measures showed the extension of the Turkish state to do a systematic policy of murder and plunder against a small population The Armenian revolutionary groups started around the end of the Russo Turkish War of 1878 and grew with the first introduction of Article 166 of the Ottoman Penal code 166 and the raid of Erzerum Cathedral

Alfred Pampalon was born in the city of Lvis Quebec and died at 28 in Sainte Anne de Beaupr He was a Redemptorist priest known for having a deep faith in God and a deep love of Mary He is a patron for people with addictions

He was known to be a modest prayerful person and was thought of as honest and pure by his classmates 

Pampalon was devoted to Mary before going to a Redemptorists monastery he went to a statue of Mary and asked her to pray for the monks to let him join The Monastery allowed him to join despite his poor health because they saw his strong desire to become a Redemptorists father While training to become a Roman Catholic priest his fellow students asked him how he managed to study philosophy so well and he replied he imagined Mary was asking him the questions He would make his head touch the floor and pray to her daily and while dying he would pray to her throughout the day

At the age of 26 Pampalon found out that he had tuberculosis During this time he stayed devoted to God moving back to Quebec to be a priest there While dying from tuberculosis he gave communion baptized people and heard confessions Before his death he was in constant pain and would spend his days in prayer The night before he priest died he said in a soft voice O death O holy death come do come O divine Savior my hope is in your merits I am happy to suffer for you I want to go to Heaven to see you and Mary After this he got up and sang the Magnificat in a loud voice He has become known as the Hail Mary Saint because of this

The Norns are female deities in Norse mythology who govern fate Their names are Urd Verdandi and Skuld Skuld is also the name of a Valkyrie

The Norns are at the base of the ash tree Yggdrasil They spin threads and weave the tapestry of fates Each persons life is a thread in their loom The length of the thread is the length of the persons life Even the gods have their threads and are therefore not immortal though the Norns hide the strings from the gods So everything is set out beforehand There is no luck there is no randomness everything is determined by destiny

The Greeks called deities similar to the Norns Moirae and the Romans called them Parcae

The three Norns appear at the beginning of Richard Wagners opera Gtterdmmerung and foretell the downfall of the gods when a thread of fate breaks

Liopleurodon was the largest species of Pliosaur It is the largest carnivore ever to live It grew up to 25 metres long and weight 150 tons It was a relative of Pliosaurus and Kronosaurus It lived around 160 155 million years ago 

Libonectes was a plesiosaur related to Elasmosaurus It lived 80 to 65 million years ago It grew up to 12 metres long It was a predator of small fish the fish ate plankton in the upper pelagic layers of the sea

Dimetrodon was a prehistoric reptile from the Permian period It was thought to be a dinosaur with a sail like the Spinosaurus but people later found out that it was a four legged animal It lived 238 million years ago

Spinosaurus was a huge meat eating dinosaur from the Cretaceous 112 to 97 million years ago 

This dinosaur grew up to 12 17 meters long stood up to 5 metres high and weighed up to 8 tons It had a two meter high sail on its back like Dimetrodon Several uses have been suggested for this sail such as to help control its body temperature as a way to attract a mate and to intimidate or frighten enemies It lived in what is now Sahara Desert but which then was mangrove forests alongside shoreline conditions tidal flats and channels From the shape of its teeth and jaw it may have been mainly a piscivore

Its bones were first discovered in Egypt in 1912 and named by German paleontologist Ernst Stromer in 1915 Two species S aegyptiacus and S marocannus are recognized by many paleontologists although many say there is only one Spinosaurus looked like Baryonyx except it was larger and more heavily built Six specimens of Spinosaurus have been uncovered Spinosaurus is much longer than Tyrannosaurus

It was featured as the main dinosaur in the 2001 film Jurassic Park III It has also apppeared on postage stamps in several countries and many toy companies have made models of Spinosaurus

Anhanguera which means Old Devil was a pterodactyl from the Upper Cretaceous It was found in the Santana Formation of Brazil and specimens from England are also placed in this genus 

It ate fish and grew to 14 feet across The species Anhanguera piscator is now placed in the genus Coloborhynchus

Rhamphorhynchus is a genus of long tailed pterosaurs in the Upper Jurassic It is the best known of the long tailed pterosaurs the sub order Rhamphorynchoidea 

Rhamphorhynchus had a long tail stiffened with ligaments which ended in a small diamond shaped rudder on the end of its tail which helped keep it stable when it was flying

The jaws of Rhamphorhynchus housed needle like teeth which were angled forward with a curved sharp beak like tip lacking teeth Their diet was mainly fish and insects

Like other pterosaurs its body was covered with hairs which suggests it had termperature regulation and a high rate of metabolism This is also found in birds and bats and seems necessary for active flight

The genus was quite successful it is the most common pterosaur found in the Solnhofen limestone beds in Bavaria Germany These are the same strata where Archaeopteryx was found

This early group flourished from the Upper Triassic to the end of the Jurassic When we first see them in the fossil record they have developed three families so biologists know their early evolution is not yet revealedp240 246 These three families are represented by the three genera Rhamphorhynchus Dimorphodon and Eudimorphodon This sub order was the earliest kind or pterosaur which were succeeded by the more derived short tailed pterosaurs the Pterodactyloids such as Pterodactylus In the Upper Jurassic both the two sub orders were extant

The group always has a long tail stiffened by rod like bony tendons to keep it straight This indicates their flight was extremely stable which means it kept on course and did not dart about much This feature is also found in Archaeopteryx and in early bats and in insects like dragonflies 

It can be interpreted like this To dart about quickly requires special advanced brains and reflexes to keep control Later birds and pterosaurs had extra control wiring in their brains but early ones did not The evidence for this is the extra size of pterodactyl and bird brains compared with the reptile brains the groups started out with That much of this increase is connected to seeing and flying is clear from how bird brains work

The analogy would be planes Early planes were highly stable and so are airliners Fighter planes are fundamentally much less stable and have to be in order to jink about This needs such fast reactions that the details are worked out by computer with the pilot indicating where to go 

It requires more brains to control an unstable craft than it does a stable one And the same principle applies to pterosaurs birds and bats Early birds bats pterosaurs and insects were all more stable with tails or long abdomens This helped the flying animal to keep on track which is what we mean by stable 

All species in the group have teeth The group died out at the end of the Jurassic which suffered a minor extinction eventp270

This classification is simple but unfortunately it is paraphyletic because the two suborders are not sister groups But there is not enough evidence to see which earlier group the pterodactyloids arose from So this is the best we can do 

Zhejiangopterus is a pterosaur that was found in China It lived in the late Cretaceous 

At least six specimens of adults have been found Zhejiangopterus was a moderately large pterosaur Its wingspan was first estimated at five metres Later estimates reduced this to about 35 metres 

Its skull was long low perfectly arched and lacked a keel or any other crest sometimes seen in related species The beak was long thin sharply pointed and lacked teeth The cervical vertebrae were elongated The first six dorsal vertebrae had fused together This helped the chest keep stable against the forces generated by the wings

Several pairs of belly ribs were preserved Its upper leg bone was half the size of its upper arm bone and strong and thin The wings were short but robust

Tupuxuara was a pterosaur that lived 112 million years ago It was found in the Santana Formation the remains of an inland sea 

Some species were quite small but the largest skull suggests a wingspan of 55 metres It was an Azdarchid pterosaur the same group as Quetzalcoatlus

Anurognathus was a genus of small Rhamphorhynchoid pterosaurs which lived 150 million years ago in the Upper Jurassic period It had a short head with pin like teeth for catching insects It was found in the Solnhofen limestone the same place as Archaeopteryx They grew up to 35 cms wingspan

Although it is in the long tailed pterosaur group Rhamphorhynchoidea its tail was comparatively short This was an adaptation which made it more manoeuvrable in hunting According to Dderlein the reduced tail of Anurognathus was similar to the pygostyle of modern birds 

With an estimated wingspan of fifty centimetres and a nine centimetre long body its weight was limited forty grammes for a specimen with a 35 centimetre wingspan 

Later a second smaller specimen was found probably of a subadult individual Its slab and counterslab are separated and both were sold to private collections This second fossil is more complete and better articulated It shows impressions of a large part of the flight membrane and under UV light remains of the muscles of the thigh and arm become visible It provided new information on many points of the anatomy The skull was shown to have been very short and broad wider than long

The Thirty Nine Articles are the historic statements of Anglican beliefs The Articles were not meant to be a complete statement of the Christian faith They are a statement of the position of the Church of England against the Roman Catholic Church and against Protestants 

The articles were made in 1563 under the direction of Archbishop Matthew Parker They are based on the Forty Two Articles written under the direction of Thomas Cranmer in 1552 and passed under Edward VI of England in 1553 They are printed in the Book of Common Prayer and other Anglican prayer books Priests deacons and bishops of the Church of England have to take an oath that what is said in the Articles is agreeable to the Word of God Other Anglican churches do not make such a requirement

The Thirty Nine Articles was needed because at that time in English history it was not possible to find an agreement about Protestantism Rather than have the church become divided they needed a way to list what the church believed John Henry Newman before he converted to Roman Catholicism tried to show that the Articles could be seen in a way less hostile to Catholic belief

Outside the Church of England Anglican opinions of the Thirty Nine Articles vary The Episcopal Church in the United States of America sees them as an historical document and but does not make its members follow them Anglican priest John Wesley changed the Thirty Nine Articles for use by American Methodists in the 18th century These new Articles of Religion are still the official United Methodist Church doctrine

Vivien Leigh was an English actress She is most famous for playing Scarlett OHara in Gone with the Wind in 1939 and Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire in 1951 Leigh won Academy Awards for both of these roles

Leigh was married to Laurence Olivier and often acted in plays and movies with him Olivier was Leighs second husband The first was Leigh Holman and Miss Leigh was still legally married to him when she came to the US to accompany Laurence Olivier who came to Hollywood to star in David O Selznicks production of Rebecca directed by Alfred Hitchcock It was lucky that Miss Leighs agent just happened to be David O Selznicks brother Myron Miss Leigh wrote long letters to her husband then during the shooting of GWTW complaining about the script the change of director from George Cukor to Victor Fleming The change was made at the insistence of Clark Gable who felt that Cukor was devoting too much time and attention to directing Miss Leigh and her co star Olivia deHavilland Miss Leigh also complained in her letters of Gables bad breath due to his dentures

When her divorce was final she married Olivier Leigh believed that Olivier was the best actor of his generation and worked very hard to be worthy of acting with him  on stage of course Leigh believed as did Olivier that the only place real acting took place was on the stage Her movie career reflects her lack of enthusiasm for that medium concentrating instead on acting with Lord Olivier in live theatre Many critics however did not feel that she had the presence and vocal prowess that Olivier possessed and her reviews were often negatively compared to her husband

Leigh was considered to be very beautiful and this sometimes meant that she thought that she was not taken seriously as an actress However her ill health was often a bigger problem Leigh suffered from bipolar disorder and often had tuberculosis These meant that her career went through period of decline and that she was sometimes considered difficult to work with

The prayer to the Sacred Heart of Jesus is a Roman Catholic devotion The prayer was written by Saint Margaret Mary Alacoque It is starting to become popular among Anglicans and Lutherans

From the time of John the Evangelist and Paul of Tarsus within Christianity there have always been various devotions to the love of God but there is nothing to indicate that during the first ten centuries of Christianity any specific devotion was rendered to the wounded Heart of Jesus3 In the eleventh and twelfth centuries the first indications of devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus are found It was in the fervent atmosphere of the Benedictine or Cistercian monasteries in the world of those who followed the teachings of St Anselm or St Bernard of Clairveaux that the devotion arose although it is impossible to say positively what were its first texts or who were its first devotees c To St Gertrude St Mechtilde and the author of the Vitis mystica it was already well known

From the 13th century to the sixteenth century the devotion was propagated but it did not seem to have developed in itself It was everywhere practised by individuals and by different religious congregations such as the Franciscans Dominicans Carthusians etc It was nevertheless a private individual devotion of the mystical order Nothing of a general movement had been inaugurated except for similarities found in the devotion to the Five Wounds by the Franciscans in which the wound in Jesus Heart figured most prominently

In the sixteenth century the devotion passed from the domain of mysticism into that of Christian asceticism It was established as a devotion with prayers already formulated and special exercises found in the writings of Lanspergius of the Carthusians of Cologne the Louis of Blois a Benedictine and Abbot of Liessies in Hainaut John of Avila and St Francis de Sales the latter belonging to the seventeenth century

The historical record from that time shows an early bringing to light of the devotion Ascetic writers spoke of it especially those of the Society of Jesus The image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus was everywhere in evidence largely due to the Franciscan devotion to the Five Wounds and to the habit formed by the Jesuits of placing the image on their title page of their books and the walls of their churches

Nevertheless the devotion remained an individual or at least a private devotion Jean Eudes made it public gave it an Office and established a feast for it Pre Eudes was the apostle of the Heart of Mary but in his devotion to the Immaculate Heart there was a share for the Heart of Jesus Little by little the devotion to the Sacred Heart became a separate one and on August 31 1670 the first feast of the Sacred Heart was celebrated in the Grand Seminary of Rennes Coutances followed suit on October 20 a day with which the Eudist feast was from then on to be connected The feast soon spread to other dioceses and the devotion was likewise adopted in various religious communities It gradually came into contact with the devotion begun at Paray and resulting in a fusion of the two

The most significant source for the devotion to the Sacred Heart in the form it is known today was a nun of the religious congregation of the Visitation of Mary Saint Margaret Mary Alacoque who claimed to have received visions of Jesus Christ There is nothing to indicate that she had known the devotion prior to the revelations or at least that she had paid any attention to it These alleged revelations were numerous and the following apparitions are especially remarkable

On December 27 probably 1673 the feast of St John Margaret Mary reported that Jesus permitted her as He had formerly allowed St Gertrude to rest her head upon His Heart and then disclosed to her the wonders of His love telling her that He desired to make them known to all mankind and to diffuse the treasures of His goodness and that He had chosen her for this work

In probably June or July 1674 Margaret Mary claimed that Jesus requested to be honored under the figure of His Heart of flesh also claiming that when He appeared radiant with love He asked for a devotion of expiatory love frequent reception of Communion especially Communion on the First Friday of the month and the observance of the Holy Hour

During the octave of Corpus Christi 1675 probably on June 16 the vision known as the great apparition reportedly took place where Jesus said Behold the Heart that has so loved men instead of gratitude I receive from the greater part only ingratitude and asked Margaret Mary for a feast of reparation of the Friday after the octave of Corpus Christi bidding her consult Father de la Colombire then superior of the small Jesuit house at Paray Solemn homage was asked on the part of the king and the mission of propagating the new devotion was especially confided to the religious of the Visitation and to the priests of the Society of Jesus

A few days after the great apparition Margaret Mary reported everything she saw to Father de la Colombire and he acknowledging the vision as an action of the spirit of God consecrated himself to the Sacred Heart and directed her to write an account of the apparition He also made use of every available opportunity to circulate this account discreetly through France and England

At his death February 15 1682 there was found in his journal of spiritual retreats a copy in his own handwriting of the account that he had requested of Margaret Mary together with a few reflections on the usefulness of the devotion This journal including the account and an offering to the Sacred Heart in which the devotion was well explained was published at Lyons in 1684 The little book was widely read even at Paray

Margaret Mary reported feeling dreadful confusion over the books contents but resolved to make the best of it approving of the book for the spreading of her cherished devotion Outside of the Visitandines priests religious and laymen espoused the devotion particularly a Capuchin Margaret Marys two brothers and some Jesuits among the latter being Fathers Croiset and Gallifet who promoted the devotion

The death of Margaret Mary October 17 1690 did not dampen the zeal of those interested on the contrary a short account of her life published by Father Croiset in 1691 as an appendix to his book De la Dvotion au Sacr Cur served only to increase it In spite of all sorts of obstacles and of the slowness of the Holy See which in 1693 imparted indulgences to the Confraternities of the Sacred Heart and in 1697 granted the feast to the Visitandines with the Mass of the Five Wounds but refused a feast common to all with special Mass and Office

The devotion spread particularly in religious communities The Marseilles plague 1720 furnished perhaps the first occasion for a solemn consecration and public worship outside of religious communities Other cities of the South followed the example of Marseilles and thus the devotion became a popular one In 1726 it was deemed advisable once more to importune Rome for a feast with a Mass and Office of its own but in 1729 Rome again refused However in 1765 it finally yielded and that same year at the request of the queen the feast was received quasi officially by the episcopate of France On all sides it was asked for and obtained and finally in 1856 at the urgent entreaties of the French bishops Pope Pius IX extended the feast to the Catholic Church under the rite of double major In 1889 it was raised by the Catholic Church to the double rite of first class

On May 15 2006 Pope Benedict XVI sent a letter to FatherPeter Hans Kolvenbach the Superior General of the Society of Jesus on the 50th Anniversary of the encyclical Haurietis Aquas about the Sacred Heart by Pope Pius XII In his letter to Father Kolvenbach Pope Benedict reaffirmed the importance of the devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus

The Catholic acts of consecration reparation and devotion were introduced when the feast of the Sacred Heart was declared In his Papal Bull Auctorem Fidei Pope Pius VI praised devotion to the Sacred Heart Finally by order of Leo XIII in his encyclical Annum Sacrum as well as on June 11 he consecrated every human to the Sacred Heart The idea of this act which Leo XIII called the great act of his pontificate had been proposed to him by a religious woman of the Good Shepherd from Oporto who said that she had supernaturally received it from Jesus Since c 1850 groups congregations and States have consecrated themselves to the Sacred Heart

Peter Coudrin of France founded the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary on Dec 24 1800 A religious order of the Roman Catholic Church the order is best known for its missionary work in Hawaii

Worship of the Sacred Heart mainly consists of several hymns the Salutation of the Sacred Heart and the Litany of the Sacred Heart It is common in Roman Catholic services and occasionally is to be found in Anglican services

The Feast of the Sacred Heart is a holy day in the Roman Catholic liturgical calendar and is celebrated 19 days after Pentecost As Pentecost is always celebrated on Sunday the Feast of the Sacred Heart always falls on a Friday

The Enthronement of the Sacred Heart is a Catholic ceremony in which a priest or head of a household consecrates the members of the household to the Sacred Heart A blessed image of the Sacred Heart either a statue or a picture is then enthroned in the home to serve as a constant reminder to those who dwell in the house of their consecration to the Sacred Heart The practice of the Enthronement is based upon Pope Pius XIIs declaration that devotion to the Sacred of Jesus is the foundation on which to build the kingdom of God in the hearts of individuals families and nations4

Sacred Heart is still a widely used name for many Catholic institutions including schools colleges and hospitals in many countries around the world It is also the name of many Catholic parishes religious orders and stores selling Catholic goods For a list of institutions named after the Sacred Heart see Sacred Heart

Religious imagery depicting the Sacred Heart is frequently featured in Catholic and sometimes Anglican homes Sometimes images display beneath them a list of family members indicating that the entire family is entrusted to the protection of Jesus in the Sacred Heart from whom blessings on the home and the family members are sought The prayer O Sacred Heart of Jesus I place all my trust in Thee is often used One particular image has been used as part of a set along with an image of the Blessed Virgin Mary In that image Mary too was shown pointing to her Immaculate Heart expressing her love for the human race and for her Son Jesus Christ The mirror images reflect an eternal binding of the two hearts

Many members of the Carlist military forces of the 19th and 20th centuries in Spain wore detentes or amulets with an image of the Sacred Heart These Catholic monarchists believed the image would protect them against wounding by the enemy firearms

Some non Catholics including Charismatic Protestants have criticized devotion to the Sacred Heart as idolatry in that worship is directed towards a body part The response of Catholics is to contend that the Sacred Heart is a traditional symbol depicting Christs holy blood as a fountain Some Catholics have been critical of the overly sentimental nature of such devotion5 but most of these critics concede that the images essentially reflect the core Christian tenet of love

William Clark Gable was an American actor He is best known for playing the part of Rhett Butler in the 1939 movie version of Gone with the Wind Gable won an Academy Award for playing Fletcher Christian in the 1935 film version of Mutiny on the Bounty

The last movie that Gable starred in was The Misfits in 1961 This film also starred Marilyn Monroe and was written by Arthur Miller Gable died shortly afterwards in Los Angeles California after having had a fourth heart attack

Nyctosaurus was a pterosaur from the Upper Cretaceous It had a wing span of 1 meter and a very big crest It was in the Pterodactyloidea and related to Pteranodon 

Marilyn Monroe was an American actress singer and model She spent much of her childhood in foster homes Monroe began a career as a model which led to a film contract in 1946 Her first role was that of Evie in the 1947 film Dangerous Years Her early roles may have been small ones but her acting in The Asphalt Jungle and All About Eve were well liked by critics Monroes star grew with her acting in films such as Gentlemen Prefer Blondes How to Marry a Millionaire Some Like It Hot and The Seven Year Itch Her performance in Bus Stop was highly respect by critics and she won a Golden Globe Award for her performance in Some Like it Hot

The final years of Monroes life were marked by illness and personal problems The situation around her death from an overdose of barbiturates has been the subject of guessing Though officially called a probable suicide the possibility of an accidental overdose as well as the possibility of homicide have not been ruled out In 1999 Monroe was ranked as the sixth greatest female actress of all time by the American Film Institute

Marilyn was born in the Los Angeles County Hospital on 1 June 1926 as Norma Jeane Baker She was the third child born to Gladys Pearl Baker

Monroes birth certificate names the father as Martin Edward Mortenson His residence is listed as unknown The name Mortenson is listed as her last name on the birth certificate but her mother immediately had it changed to Baker Baker was the last name of her mothers first husband It was also the last name that her mother still used Gladys Baker had married a Martin E Mortenson in 1924 but they had separated before Gladys pregnancy Several of Monroes biographers think that Gladys Baker used his name so it did not appear to be an illegitimate birth Mortenson died at the age of 85 and Monroes birth certificate together with her parents marriage and divorce documents were discovered then The documents showed that Mortenson filed for divorce from Gladys on March 5 1927 and it was broken wikt linkfinalizefinalized on October 15 1928

Throughout her life Marilyn Monroe denied that Mortenson was her father She said that when she was a child she had been shown a photograph of a man that Gladys said was Monroes father That man was Charles Stanley Gifford She remembered that he had a thin mustache and looked similar to Clark Gable Monroe said she had amused herself by pretending that Gable was her father

Gladys was mentally unstable and financially unable to care for her daughter She gave Monroe to foster parents Albert and Ida Bolender of Hawthorne California where Monroe lived until she was seven

In 1933 Gladys bought a house and brought Norma Jeane to live with her A few months after moving in however Gladys suffered a mental breakdown beginning a series of mental episodes that would bother her for the rest of her life In My Story Monroe said her mother was screaming and laughing as she was taken to the State Hospital in Norwalk Norma Jeane was declared a ward of the state and Gladys best friend Grace McKee became her guardian It was Grace who had told Monroe that someday she would become a movie star Grace let Norma Jeane wear makeup and took her out to get her hair curled They would go to the movies together forming the basis for Norma Jeanes fascination with films and the actors on the screen

Grace McKee married Ervin Silliman Goddard in 1935 Nine year old Monroe was sent to the Los Angeles Orphans Home and then to several foster homes During the time at Hollygrove several families were interested in adopting her This never happened because her mother would not sign the papers to let the families adopt her In 1937 Grace took Monroe back to live with her Goddard and one of Goddards daughters from a previous marriage This arrangement did not last for long as she was nearly sexually assaulted by a drunk Doc Goddard on at least one occasion

Grace sent her to live in with her great aunt Olive Brunings This arrangement also did not last long as 12 year old Norma Jeane was assaulted by one of Olives sons Biographers and psychologists have questioned whether at least some of Norma Jeanes later behavior was a manifestation of the effects of childhood sexual abuse in the context of her already problematic relationships with her psychiatrically ill mother and subsequent caregivers

In early 1938 Grace sent her to live with yet another one of her aunts Anna Lower who lived in the Van Nuys section of Los Angeles The time with Lower provided the young Norma Jeane with one of the few stable periods in her life Years later she would reflect fondly about the time that she spent with Lower whom she affectionately called Aunt Ana Unfortunately by 1942 the elderly Lower developed serious health problems and thus Norma Jeane went back to live with the Goddards It was there where she met a neighbors son James Dougherty and began a relationship with him

Her time with the Goddards would once again prove to be short At the end of 1942 Grace and Doc decided to relocate to Virginia where Doc had received a lucrative job offer It is unclear whether the Goddards did not or could not take Norma Jeane with them nevertheless Grace needed to find a home for her before they moved An offer from a neighborhood family to adopt Norma Jeane was proposed but Gladys still would not allow it With few options left Grace approached Doughertys mother and suggested that Jim marry her so that she would not have to return to an orphanage or foster care Dougherty was initially reluctant because Norma Jeane was only sixteen years old but he finally relented and married her in a ceremony arranged by Ana Lower after graduating from high school in June 1942 Monroe would state in her autobiography that she did not feel like a wife she enjoyed playing with the neighborhood children until her husband would call her home In 1943 with World War II raging Dougherty enlisted in the Merchant Marine and was shipped out to the Pacific Frightened that he might not come back alive Norma Jeane begged him to give her a child before he left Dougherty disagreed feeling that she was too young to have a baby but he promised that they would revisit the subject when he returned home After he shipped out Norma Jeane moved in with Doughertys mother

While Dougherty was in the Merchant Marine Monroe found employment in the Radioplane Munitions Factory She sprayed airplane parts with fire retardant and inspected parachutes During this time Army photographer David Conover snapped a photograph of her for a Yank magazine article He encouraged her to apply to The Blue Book Modeling Agency She signed with the agency and began researching the work of Jean Harlow and Lana Turner She was told that they were looking for models with lighter hair so Monroe broken wikt linkbleachbleached her brunette hair to a golden blonde

Monroe became one of Blue Books most successful models appearing on dozens of magazine covers Jim Dougherty was not aware of his wifes new job He only became aware of it when he discovered a shipmate of his admiring a photo of a sexy model in a magazine That model was Doughterys wife Norma Jeane Dougherty wrote her several letters telling her that once he returned from service she would have to give up her modeling An unhappy Monroe who now saw the chances of a modeling and acting career decided then to divorce Dougherty The marriage ended when he returned from overseas in 1946

Her successful modeling career brought her to the attention of Ben Lyon a 20th Century Fox executive He arranged a screen test for her Lyon was impressed and said Its Jean Harlow all over again She was offered a six month contract with a starting salary of 125 per week Lyon did not like her name and chose Carole Lind as a stagename after Carole Lombard and Jenny Lind He soon decided it was not an appropriate choice Monroe was invited to spend the weekend with Lyon and his wife Bebe Daniels at their home It was there that they decided to find her a new name Following her idol Jean Harlow Norma Jeane decided to choose her mothers maiden name of Monroe Several names such as Norma Jeane Monroe and Norma Monroe were tried and initially Jeane Monroe was chosen Lyon however felt that there were too many actresses with the name Jean Wanting a more unique name Lyon suggested Marilyn commenting that she reminded him of Marilyn Miller the sexy 1920s Broadway actress Monroe did not like it at first because Marilyn was the combination of the name Mary Lynn a name she did not like Lyon however felt that the name Marilyn Monroe was sexy had a nice flow and would be lucky due to the double M and thus Norma Jeane Baker took the name Marilyn Monroe

She appeared in Scudda Hoo Scudda Hay and Dangerous Years in 1947 but when her contract was not renewed She returned to modeling Monroe attempted to find opportunities for film work and while unemployed she posed for nude photographs That year she was also crowned the first Miss California Artichoke Queen at the yearly artichoke festival in Castroville

In 1948 Monroe signed a six month contract with Columbia Pictures She was introduced to the studios head drama coach Natasha Lytess who became her acting coach for several years Monroe starred in the low budget musical Ladies of the Chorus The film was not a success and her contract was not renewed During her short time at Columbia studio president Harry Cohn corrected a slight overbite she had In addition he had her golden brownish blonde hair lightened to platinum blonde

She had a small role in the Marx Brothers film Love Happy in 1949 She impressed the producers who sent her to New York to feature in the films promotional campaign

Love Happy brought Monroe to the attention of the talent agent Johnny Hyde who agreed to represent her He arranged for her to audition for John Huston who cast her in the drama The Asphalt Jungle as the young mistress of an aging criminal Her performance brought strong reviews and was seen by the writer and director Joseph Mankiewicz He accepted Hydes suggestion of Monroe for a small comedic role in All About Eve as Miss Caswell Her role was as an aspiring actress described by another character as a student of The Copacabana School of Dramatic Art Mankiewicz later commented that he had seen an innocence in Monroe that he found appealing Following Monroes success in these roles Hyde arranged for a seven year contract for her with 20th Century Fox shortly before his death in December 1950 

Monroe enrolled at UCLA in 1951 where she studied literature and art appreciation She appeared in several minor films with long established performers such as Mickey Rooney Constance Bennett June Allyson Dick Powell and Claudette Colbert In March 1951 she appeared as a presenter at the 23rd Academy Awards ceremony

In 1952 Monroe appeared on the cover of LOOK magazine wearing a Georgia Tech sweater as part of an article celebrating female enrollment to the schools main campus

In the early 1950s Monroe and Gregg Palmer both unsuccessfully auditioned for roles as Daisy Mae and Abner in a proposed Lil Abner television series based on the Al Capp comic strip but the show was never made

In March 1952 Monroe faced a possible scandal when one of her nude photos from a 1949 session with photographer Tom Kelley was put in a calendar The press tried to figure out who the anonymous model was and commented that she closely resembled Monroe As the studio discussed how to deal with the problem Monroe suggested that she should simply say that she had posed for the photograph but that she should emphasize that she had done so only because she had no money to pay her rent She gave an interview in which she discussed the reasons that led to her posing for the photographs Because of the interviews the public felt sympathy for her life as a struggling actress

She made her first appearance on the cover of LIFE magazine in April 1952 where she was described as The Talk of Hollywood Stories of her childhood and upbringing portrayed her in a sympathetic light a cover story for the May 1952 edition of True Experiences magazine showed a smiling and wholesome Monroe beside a caption that read Do I look happy I should for I was a child nobody wanted A lonely girl with a dream who awakened to find that dream come true I am Marilyn Monroe Read my Cinderella story It was also during this time that she began dating baseball player Joe DiMaggio A photograph of DiMaggio visiting Monroe at the 20th Century Fox studio was printed in newspapers throughout the United States and news of a romance between them created more interest in Monroe

Over the following months four films in which Monroe acted were released She had been lent to RKO Studios to appear in a supporting role in Clash by Night a Barbara Stanwyck drama directed by Fritz Lang Released in June 1952 the film was popular with audiences with much of its success credited to curiosity about Monroe who received generally favorable reviews from critics

This was followed by two films released in July the comedy Were Not Married and the drama Dont Bother to Knock Were Not Married featured Monroe as a beauty pageant contestant Variety described the film as lightweight Its reviewer commented that Monroe was featured to full advantage in a bathing suit and that some of her scenes suggested a degree of exploitation In Dont Bother to Knock she played the starring role of a babysitter who threatens to attack the child in her care The melodrama was poorly reviewed although Monroe commented that it contained some of her strongest dramatic acting Monkey Business a comedy directed by Howard Hawks starring Cary Grant and Ginger Rogers was released in September It achieved good ticket sales despite weak reviews In O Henrys Full House for 20th Century Fox released in August 1952 Monroe had a single one minute scene with Charles Laughton yet received top billing alongside him and the films other stars

Darryl F Zanuck considered that Monroes film potential was worth developing and cast her in Niagara as a woman scheming to murder her husband played by Joseph Cotten During filming Monroes make up artist Whitey Snyder noticed her stage fright The director made him spend hours gently comforting Monroe as she prepared to film her scenes

Much of the critical commentary following the release of the film focused on Monroes overtly sexual performance and a scene which shows Monroe making a long walk toward Niagara Falls received frequent note in reviews After seeing the film Constance Bennett reportedly quipped Theres a broad with her future behind her Whitey Snyder also commented that it was during preparation for this film after much experimentation that Monroe achieved the look and we used that look for several pictures in a row the look was established

While the film was a success and Monroes performance had positive reviews her conduct at promotional events sometimes drew negative comments Her appearance at the Photoplay awards dinner in a skin tight gold lam dress was criticized Louella Parsons newspaper column quoted Joan Crawford discussing Monroes vulgarity and describing her behavior as unbecoming an actress and a lady Monroe had previously received criticism for wearing a dress with a neckline cut almost to her navel when she acted as Grand Marshall at the Miss America Parade in September 1952 A photograph from this event was used on the cover of the first issue of Playboy in December 1953 with a nude photograph of Monroe taken in 1949 inside the magazine

Her next film was Gentlemen Prefer Blondes co starring Jane Russell and directed by Howard Hawks Her role as Lorelei Lee a showgirl required her to act sing and dance The two stars became friends with Russell describing Monroe as very shy and very sweet and far more intelligent than people gave her credit for She later recalled that Monroe showed her dedication by rehearsing her dance routines each evening However she arrived late on set for filming every day Realizing that Monroe remained in her dressing room because of stage fright and that Hawks was upset with her being late Russell started walking her to the set

At the Los Angeles premiere of the film Monroe and Russell pressed their hand and footprints in the cement in the forecourt of Graumans Chinese Theatre Monroe received positive reviews and the film earned more than double its production costs Her singing of Diamonds Are a Girls Best Friend became associated with her Gentlemen Prefer Blondes also marked one of the earliest films in which William Travilla dressed Monroe Travilla dressed Monroe in eight of her films including Bus Stop Dont Bother to Knock How to Marry a Millionaire River of No Return Theres No Business Like Show Business Monkey Business and The Seven Year Itch

How to Marry a Millionaire was a comedy about three models how made a plan to attract a husband who had a lot of money Monroe worked with Betty Grable and Lauren Bacall for the movie It was directed by Jean Negulesco The producer and scriptwriter Nunnally Johnson said that it was the first film in which audiences liked Marilyn for herself and that she diagnosed the reason very broken wikt linkshrewdshrewdly She said that it was the only picture shed been in in which she had a measure of broken wikt linkmodestymodesty about her own attractiveness

Monroes films of this period established her dumb blonde persona and added to her popularity In 1953 and 1954 she was listed in the annual Quigley Poll of the Top Ten Money Making Stars This list was created from the votes of people who showed movies throughout the United States for the actors that had made the most money in their theaters over the last year

During this time Monroe talked about her acting hopes telling the New York Times I want to grow and develop and play serious dramatic parts My dramatic coach Natasha Lytess tells everybody that I have a great soul but so far nobodys interested in it She saw a possibility in 20th Century Foxs upcoming film The Egyptian but was stopped by Darryl F Zanuck who refused to screen test her

Instead she was assigned to the western River of No Return with Robert Mitchum Director Otto Preminger did not like Monroes need to use Natasha Lytess who coached Monroe and told her opinion of Monroes acting at the end of each scene Eventually Monroe would not speak to Preminger and Mitchum had to solve the fight Of the finished movie Monroe said I think I deserve a better deal than a grade Z cowboy movie in which the acting finished second to the scenery and the CinemaScope process

In late 1953 Monroe was scheduled to begin filming The Girl in Pink Tights with Frank Sinatra When she failed to appear for work 20th Century Fox suspended her

She and Joe DiMaggio were married in San Francisco on January 14 1954 They traveled to Japan soon after The couple combined a honeymoon with a business trip previously arranged by DiMaggio For two weeks she took a secondary role to DiMaggio as he conducted his business telling a reporter Marriage is my main career from now on Monroe then traveled alone to Korea where she performed for 13000 American Marines over a three day period She later said that the experience had helped her get over a fear of performing in front of large crowds

Returning to Hollywood in March 1954 Monroe fixed her disagreement with 20th Century Fox She then appeared in the musical Theres No Business Like Show Business The film did not make back its production costs and was poorly received Ed Sullivan described Monroes performance of the song Heat Wave as one of the most broken wikt linkflagrantflagrant violations of good taste he had seen Time magazine compared her negatively to co star Ethel Merman Bosley Crowther of The New York Times said that Mitzi Gaynor had passed Monroes embarrassing to behold performance The reviews echoed Monroes opinion of the film She had made it reluctantly on the assurance that she would be given the starring role in the film adaptation of the Broadway hit The Seven Year Itch

In September 1954 Monroe filmed one of the key scenes for The Seven Year Itch in New York City In it she stands with her co star Tom Ewell while the air from a subway grating blows her skirt up A large crowd watched as director Billy Wilder ordered the scene to be refilmed many times Among the crowd was Joe DiMaggio who was reported to have been very mad by the scene and the crowd watching After a fight witnessed by journalist Walter Winchell the couple returned to California where they stayed away from the press for two weeks Monroe then announced that they had separated Their divorce was granted in November 1954 The filming of The Seven Year Itch was completed in early 1955 After saying no what she considered to be inferior parts in The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing and How to Be Very Very Popular Monroe decided to leave Hollywood on the advice of Milton Greene

Milton Greene had first met Monroe in 1953 when he was assigned to photograph her for Look magazine While many photographers tried to show her sexy image Greene presented her in more modest poses and she was pleased with his work As a friendship grew between them she talked to him about her concerns with her 20th Century Fox contract and the roles she was offered Her salary for Gentlemen Prefer Blondes was 18000 while Jane Russell was paid more than 100000 Greene agreed that she could earn more by leaving 20th Century Fox He gave up his job in 1954 mortgaged his home to finance Monroe and allowed her to live with his family as they made a plan for the future of her career

On April 8 1955 journalist Edward R Murrow interviewed Greene and his wife Amy as well as Monroe at the Greenes home in Connecticut on a live telecast of the CBS program Person to Person

Truman Capote introduced Monroe to Constance Collier who gave her acting lessons She felt that Monroe could not be a stage but had a lovely talent that was so fragile and subtle it can only be caught by the camera After only a few weeks of lessons Collier died Monroe had met Paula Strasberg and her daughter Susan on the set of Theres No Business Like Show Business and had previously said that she would like to study with Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio In March 1955 Monroe met with Cheryl Crawford one of the founders of the Actors Studio and convinced her to introduce her to Lee Strasberg The next day Lee interviewed her and agreed to accept her as a student

In May 1955 Monroe started dating playwright Arthur Miller they had met in Hollywood in 1950 and when Miller discovered she was in New York he arranged for a mutual friend to reintroduce them On June 1 1955 Monroes birthday Joe DiMaggio accompanied Monroe to the premiere of The Seven Year Itch in New York City He later hosted a birthday party for her but the evening ended with a public quarrel and Monroe left the party without him A lengthy period of estrangement followed

Throughout 1955 Monroe studied with the Actors Studio She discovered that one of her biggest issues in her career was her severe stage fright She became friends with actors Kevin McCarthy and Eli Wallach who each she was sincere in her approach to her studies They noted that she tried to avoid attention by sitting quietly in the back of the class When Strasberg felt Monroe was ready to give a performance in front of her peers Monroe and Maureen Stapleton chose the opening scene from Eugene ONeills Anna Christie Monroe had performed poorly during each rehearsal she was able to complete the performance without forgetting her lines Kim Stanley later recalled that students were discouraged from applauding but that Monroes performance had resulted in applause from the audience While Monroe was a student Lee Strasberg commented I have worked with hundreds and hundreds of actors and actresses and there are only two that stand out way above the rest Number one is Marlon Brando and the second is Marilyn Monroe

The Seven Year Itch was released and became a success earning about 8 million Monroe received positive reviews for her performance and was in a strong position to negotiate with 20th Century Fox On New Years Eve 1955 they signed a new contract which required Monroe to make four films over a seven year period The newly formed Marilyn Monroe Productions would be paid 100000 plus a share of profits for each film In addition to being able to work for other studios Monroe had the right to reject any script director or cinematographer she did not approve of

The first film to be made under the contract and production company was Bus Stop directed by Joshua Logan Logan had studied under Konstantin Stanislavsky approved of method acting and was supportive of Monroe Monroe stopped working with her drama coach Natasha Lytess and replaced her with Paula Strasberg Strasberg was always on set during the filming of Monroes subsequent films

In Bus Stop Monroe played Chrie a saloon singer with little talent who falls in love with a cowboy Her costumes make up and hair showed a character who lacked class Monroe sang and danced poorly on purpose to match the role Bosley Crowther of The New York Times said Hold on to your chairs everybody and get set for a rattling surprise Marilyn Monroe has finally proved herself an actress In his autobiography Movie Stars Real People and Me director Logan wrote I found Marilyn to be one of the great talents of all time she struck me as being a much brighter person than I had ever imagined and I think that was the first time I learned that intelligence and yes brilliance have nothing to do with education Logan tried to get Monroe an Academy Award nomination and said good things about her professionalism until the end of his life Though not nominated for an Academy Award she received a Golden Globe nomination

During this time the relationship between Monroe and Miller had developed The couple was able to maintain their privacy for almost a year but now the press began to write about them as a couple and sometimes called them The Egghead and The Hourglass The reports of their romance were soon replaced by news that Miller had been called to testify before the House Un American Activities Committee to explain his possible communist connections Called upon to identify communists he was association with Miller refused and was charged with contempt of Congress He was acquitted on appeal During the case Monroe was urged by film executives to leave Miller rather than risk her career She refused and called them as born cowards The press began to talk about a possible marriage but Monroe and Miller refused to confirm the rumor In June 1956 a reporter was following them by car As they attempted to get away from him the reporters car crashed The crash killed his female passenger Monroe became very upset upon hearing the news Miller and Monroe announced their engagement partly in hopes that it would reduce the media interest they was around them They were married on June 29 1956

Bus Stop was followed by The Prince and the Showgirl directed by Laurence Olivier who also co starred Prior to filming Olivier praised Monroe as a brilliant comedienne which to me means she is also an extremely skilled actress During filming in England he did not like Monroes need for her drama coach He thought Strasberg was a fraud whose only talent was the ability to butter Marilyn up He recalled his attempts at explaining a scene to Monroe only to hear Strasberg say Honey just think of Coca Cola and Frank Sinatra

Despite Monroe and Olivier fighting Olivier later commented that in the film Marilyn was quite wonderful the best of all Monroes performance was praised by critics especially in Europe where she won the David di Donatello the Italian equivalent of the Academy Award as well as the French Crystal Star Award She was also nominated for a BAFTA

It was more than a year before Monroe began her next film During her break she spent the summer with Miller in Amagansett Long Island She suffered a miscarriage on August 1 1957

With Millers encouragement she returned to Hollywood in August 1958 to star in Some Like it Hot The film was directed by Billy Wilder and co stared Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis Wilder had experienced Monroes lateness stage fright and inability to remember lines during production of The Seven Year Itch However her behavior was now more hostile and included her refusals to participate in filming and occasional uses of profanity Monroe often refused to take direction from Wilder or insisted on numerous retakes of simple scenes until she was satisfied She developed a working relationship with Lemmon but she disliked Curtis after hearing that he had described their love scenes as like kissing Hitler Curtis later stated that the comment was intended as a joke During filming Monroe discovered that she was pregnant She suffered another miscarriage in December 1958 as filming was completed

Some Like it Hot became a major success and was nominated for five Academy Awards Monroe was praised for her performance and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress  Motion Picture Musical or Comedy Wilder commented that the film was the biggest success he had ever been associated with He discussed the problems he had during filming saying Marilyn was so difficult because she was totally unpredictable I never knew what kind of day we were going to have would she be cooperative or broken wikt linkobstructionobstructive He had little patience with her method acting technique and said that instead of going to the Actors Studio she should have gone to a train engineers school to learn something about arriving on schedule Wilder had become ill during filming and explained We were in mid flight and there was a nut on the plane Looking back at it he discussed Monroes certain indefinable magic and absolute genius as a comic actress

By this time Monroe had only completed one film Bus Stop under her four picture contract with 20th Century Fox She agreed to appear in Lets Make Love which was to be directed by George Cukor However she was not satisfied with the script and Arthur Miller rewrote it Gregory Peck was originally cast in the male lead role but he refused the role after Millers rewrite Cary Grant Charlton Heston Yul Brynner and Rock Hudson also refused the role before it was offered to Yves Montand Monroe and Miller became friends with Montand and his wife actress Simone Signoret The filming went well until Miller was required to travel to Europe on business Monroe began to leave the film set early and on several occasions failed to attend but her attitude improved after Montand talked to her about it Signoret returned to Europe to make a film and Monroe and Montand began a brief affair that ended when Montand refused to leave Signoret The film was not a critical or commercial success

Monroes health declined during this period and she began to see a Los Angeles psychiatrist Dr Ralph Greenson He later recalled that during this time she frequently complained of insomnia She told Greenson that she visited several medical doctors to obtain what Greenson considered a large variety of drugs He concluded that she was getting close to the point of addiction but also noted that she could give up the drugs for extended periods without suffering any withdrawal symptoms According to Greenson the marriage between Miller and Monroe was strained He said that Miller appeared to genuinely care for Monroe and was willing to help her Greenson stated that his main goal at the time was to try a harsh reduction in Monroes drug intake

In 1956 Arthur Miller had lived briefly in Nevada and wrote a short story about some of the local people he had met there a divorced woman and some aging cowboys By 1960 he had developed the short story into a screenplay and thought of it as containing a good role for Monroe It became her last completed film The Misfits directed by John Huston and costarring Clark Gable Montgomery Clift Eli Wallach and Thelma Ritter Shooting begin in July 1960 with most taking place in the hot Northern Nevada desert Monroe was often ill and unable to perform Without Dr Greensons help there she had resumed her use of sleeping pills and alcohol A visitor to the set Susan Strasberg later described Monroe as mortally injured in some way In August Monroe was rushed to Los Angeles where she was in the hospital for ten days Newspapers reported that she had been near death although what her illness was not said Louella Parsons wrote in her newspaper column that Monroe was a very sick girl much sicker than at first believed and said that she was being treated by a psychiatrist

Monroe returned to Nevada and completed the film but she became upset with Miller and public fights were reported by the press Making the film had proved to be a hard experience for the actors In addition to Monroes problems Montgomery Clift was often unable to perform due to illness By the final day of shooting Thelma Ritter was in hospital because of exhaustion Gable commenting that he felt unwell left the set without attending the wrap party Monroe and Miller returned to New York on separate flights

Within ten days Monroe had announced her separation from Miller and Gable had died from a heart attack Gables widow Kay said to Louella Parsons that it had been the eternal waiting on the set of The Misfits that had added to his death though she did not name Monroe When reporters asked Monroe if she felt guilty about Gables death she refused to answer Journalist Sidney Skolsky recalled that in private Monroe said she felt regret for her poor treatment of Gable during filming and described her as being in a dark pit of despair Monroe later attended the christening of the Gables son at the invitation of Kay Gable

The Misfits received poor reviews and was not a commercial success though some praised the performances of Monroe and Gable Huston later commented that Monroes performance was not acting in the true sense and that she had drawn from her own experiences to show herself rather than a character She had no techniques It was all the truth It was only Marilyn

During the following months Monroes need for alcohol and prescription medications began to take a toll on her health Friends such as Susan Strasberg later spoke of her illness Her divorce from Arthur Miller was finalized in January 1961 with Monroe citing incompatibility of character In February she voluntarily entered the Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic Monroe later described the experience as a nightmare She was able to phone Joe DiMaggio from the clinic and he immediately traveled from Florida to New York to help her transfer to the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center She remained there for three weeks Illness prevented her from working for the remainder of the year She underwent surgery to fix a blockage in her Fallopian tubes in May The following month underwent gall bladder surgery She returned to California and lived in a rented apartment as she recovered

In 1962 Monroe began filming Somethings Got to Give which was to be the third film of her four film contract with 20th Century Fox It was to be directed by George Cukor and co starred Dean Martin and Cyd Charisse She was ill with a virus as filming began She suffered from high temperatures and sinusitis On one occasion she refused to perform with Martin as he had a cold Producer Henry Weinstein recalled seeing her on several occasions being physically ill as she prepared to film her scenes He thought it was her fear of performing He commented Very few people experience terror We all experience anxiety unhappiness heartbreaks but that was sheer primal terror

On May 19 1962 she attended the birthday celebration of President John F Kennedy at Madison Square Garden at the suggestion of Kennedys brother in law actor Peter Lawford Monroe performed Happy Birthday along with a specially written verse based on Bob Hopes Thanks for the Memory Kennedy responded to her performance with the remark Thank you I can now retire from politics after having had Happy Birthday sung to me in such a sweet wholesome way

Monroe returned to the set of Somethings Got to Give and filmed a scene in which she appeared nude in a swimming pool Commenting that she wanted to push Liz Taylor off the magazine covers she gave permission for several partially nude photographs to be published by Life Having only reported for work on twelve occasions out of a total of 35 days of production Monroe was dismissed The studio 20th Century Fox filed a lawsuit against her for half a million dollars The studios vice president Peter Levathes issued a statement saying The star system has gotten way out of hand Weve let the inmates run the asylum and theyve practically destroyed it Monroe was replaced by Lee Remick and when Dean Martin refused to work with any other actress he was also threatened with a lawsuit

After she was fired Monroe was part of several high profile publicity events She gave an interview to Cosmopolitan and was photographed at Peter Lawfords beach house drinking champagne and walking on the beach She next posed for Bert Stern for Vogue in a series of photographs that included several nudes Published after her death they became known as The Last Sitting Richard Meryman interviewed her for Life in which Monroe reflected upon her relationship with her fans and her uncertainties in calling herself a star and a sex symbol She referred to the events surrounding Arthur Millers appearance before the House Un American Activities Committee in 1956 and her studios warning that she would be finished if she showed public support for him She commented You have to start all over again But I believe youre always as good as your potential I now live in my work and in a few relationships with the few people I can really count on Fame will go by and so long Ive had you fame If it goes by Ive always known it was fickle So at least its something I experienced but thats not where I live

In the final weeks of her life Monroe engaged in discussions about future film projects and arrangements were made to continue talks about contracts Among the projects was a biography of Jean Harlow later filmed unsuccessfully with Carroll Baker Starring roles in Billy Wilders Irma La Douce and What a Way to Go were also discussed Shirley MacLaine eventually played the roles in both films Kim Novak replaced her in Kiss Me Stupid a comedy in which she was to star opposite Dean Martin A film version of the Broadway musical A Tree Grows In Brooklyn and an unnamed World War Ithemed musical co starring Gene Kelly were also discussed but the projects did not occur Her dispute with 20th Century Fox was resolved and her contract renewed into a 1 million two picture deal Filming of Somethings Got to Give was scheduled to begin again in early fall 1962 Also on the table was an Italian film offer worth several million giving her script director and co star approval Allan Whitey Snyder who saw her during the last week of her life said Monroe was pleased by the roles available to her and that she never looked better and was in great spirits

On August 5 1962 LAPD police sergeant Jack Clemmons received a call at 425 am from Dr Ralph Greenson Monroes psychiatrist saying that Monroe was found dead at her home in Brentwood California She was 36 years old At the autopsy eight milligram percent of Chloral Hydrate and 45 milligram percent of Nembutal were found in her system Dr Thomas Noguchi of the Los Angeles County Coroners office stated the cause of death as acute barbiturate poisoning resulting from a probable suicide Many theories including murder circulated about the way she died and the timeline after the body was found Some theories involved John and Robert Kennedy while other theories suggested CIA or mafia involvement

On August 8 1962 Monroe was interred in a crypt at Corridor of Memories 24 at the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Westwood Los Angeles Lee Strasberg delivered the eulogy The crypt space immediately to the left of Monroes was bought and reserved by Hugh Hefner in 1992

In August 2009 the crypt space directly above that of Monroe was placed for auction on eBay Elsie Poncher plans to take her husbands body out of the crypt above and move him to an nearby plot She advertised the crypt hoping to make enough money to pay off the 16 million mortgage on her Beverly Hills mansion The winning bid was placed by an anonymous Japanese man for 46 million but the winning bidder later backed out because of the paying problem 

In her will Monroe left Lee Strasberg her personal belongings which amounted to just over half of her estate She expressed her desire that he distribute the effects among my friends colleagues and those to whom I am devoted Instead he stored them in a warehouse and willed them to his widow Anna Inez Melson successfully sued Los Angeles based Odyssey Auctions in 1994 to prevent the sale of items taken by Monroes former business manager In October 1999 Christies auctioned most of the items including those recovered from Melsons family The action made US 13405785

Anna Strasberg then sued the children of four photographers to determine rights of publicity which permits the licensing of images of dead people for commercial reasons The decision was worth millions as to whether Monroe was a resident of California or New York

On May 4 2007 a judge in New York ruled that Monroes rights of publicity ended at death In October 2007 Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed Senate Bill 771 The law was supported by Strasberg and the Screen Actors Guild and established that non family members may inherit rights of publicity through the residuary clause of the deceaseds will provided that the person was a resident of California at the time of death

In March 2008 the United States District Court in Los Angeles ruled that Monroe was a resident of New York at the time of her death The court cited that the executor of her estate told California tax authorities this and that a 1966 sworn affidavit by her housekeeper quoted Monroe as saying that she considered New York City her primary home The decision was reaffirmed by the United States District Court of New York in September 2008

Monroe had three marriages Her first was to James Dougherty Her second married was to Joe DiMaggio Monroes third and final marriage was to Arthur Miller It was also widely rumored that she had had an affair with President John F Kennedy his brother Senator Robert Kennedy or both Marlon Brando in his autobiography Songs My Mother Taught Me also said that he had had a relationship with her

Monroe married James Dougherty on June 19 1942 at the home of Chester Howell in Los Angeles In The Secret Happiness of Marilyn Monroe and To Norma Jeane with Love Jimmie he claimed they were in love but her hopes to be a celebrity took her away In 1953 he wrote an article called Marilyn Monroe Was My Wife for Photoplay in which he said that she threatened to jump off the Santa Monica Pier if he left her In the 2004 documentary Marilyns Man Dougherty made three new claims He said that he invented the Marilyn Monroe persona Dougherty claimed that studio executives made her divorce him He also said that he was her true love and her dedicated friend for life

Doughertys actions seem to go against these claims He remarried months after Monroe divorced him His sister told the December 1952 Modern Screen Magazine that he left Monroe because she wanted to pursue modeling after he had given her permission to do so He confirmed Monroes story of the beginning of their relationship in an AE Network Monroe documentary that his mother had asked him to marry her so that she would not be returned to an orphanage When Monroe died on August 5 1962 one of the responding officers knew Dougherty and called him at 400 am with the news Dougherty turned to his wife and said Say a prayer for Norma Jean Shes dead On August 6 The New York Times reported that after being told of her death Dougherty replied Im sorry and continued his LAPD patrol He did not attend Monroes funeral

In 1951 Joe DiMaggio saw a picture of Monroe with Chicago White Sox players Joe Dobson and Gus Zernial He did not ask the man who arranged the photo to set up a date for him and Monroe until 1952 Monroe wrote in My Story that she did not want to meet him because she thought he might be a stereotypical jock They broken wikt linkelopeeloped at San Francisco City Hall on January 14 1954 During their honeymoon in Japan she was asked to visit Korea as part of the USO She performed ten shows in four days for over 100000 servicemen

In February 1961 Monroe entered the Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic She contacted DiMaggio who helped her get released She later joined him in Florida where he was serving as a batting coach at the New York Yankees training camp Bob Hope jokingly dedicated Best Song nominee The Second Time Around to them at the 1961 Academy Awards

According to Allen on August 1 1962 DiMaggio quit his job with a PX supplier to ask her to remarry him He quit because he was alarmed by how Monroe had got involved with people he considered bad to her well being

After Monroes death DiMaggio claimed her body and arranged her funeral For 20 years he had a half dozen red roses delivered to her crypt three times a week

In 2006 DiMaggios adopted granddaughters auctioned most of his estate which included two letters Monroe wrote to him and a photograph signed I love you Joe Marilyn

In January 1964 Millers play After The Fall opened featuring a beautiful but slightly aggressive woman named Maggie Simone Signoret noted in her autobiography the morbidity of Miller and Elia Kazan resuming their professional association over a casket In interviews and in his autobiography Miller insisted that Maggie was not based on Monroe However he never pretended that his last Broadway bound work Finishing the Picture was not based on the making of The Misfits He appeared in the documentary The Century of the Self and stated his disapproval of the psychological work being done on her before her death

On May 18 1962 Monroe made her last major public appearance singing Happy Birthday Mr President at a birthday party for President John F Kennedy at Madison Square Garden The dress that she wore to the event specially designed and made for her by Jean Louis sold at an auction in 1999 for USD 126 million

Rumors have existed since the 1960s that Monroe had affairs with Robert Kennedy or John Kennedy or both Allegations of an affair with President Kennedy did not make it into the press until the 1970s A pamphlet was published in 1964 after Monroes death called The Strange Death of Marilyn Monroe by investigator Frank Cappell It alleged a relationship between Monroe and Bobby Kennedy John Kennedys supposed mistress Judith Exner in her 1977 autobiography also wrote about an affair that she said the president and Monroe had

Journalist Anthony Summers examines the issue of Monroes relationships with the Kennedy brothers at length in two books his 1993 biography of FBI Director J Edgar Hoover entitled Official and Confidential The Secret Life of J Edgar Hoover and his 1985 biography of Monroe entitled Goddess In the Hoover book Summers concludes that Monroe was in love with President Kennedy and wanted to marry him in the early 1960s He writes that she called the White House often According to his book when the married President had to stop their affair Monroe became even more depressed Summers writes that Monroe then became involved with Robert Kennedy who may have visited Monroe in Los Angeles about the time that she died

Troodon is a genus of relatively small bird like meat eating dinosaurs from the later part of the Cretaceous period 7565 million years ago The alternate spelling Trodon show that the os are pronounced separately as in zoology

Discovered in central Montana in 1855 it was among the first dinosaurs found in North America Its species ranged widely with fossil remains recovered from as far north as Alaska and the Judith River formation of Alberta and as far south as Wyoming and even possibly Texas and New Mexico

Troodon had a large brain in proportion to its body weight and was very smart It had a sickle claw an enlarged and retractable second toe claw bone Troodon had 122 teeth The size and shape of the leg bones show that the Troodon would have been a fast runner Troodon is thought to have been a predator like other theropods This view is supported by its sickle claw on the foot and apparently good binocular vision

Troodons size ranged widely In general individuals that lived further North were larger than those that lived in more Southern areas Troodons in Alaska were especially large up to 12 feet long 5 feet tall and weighing up to 175 pounds Meanwhile Troodons that lived in more Southern locations were only around 7 feet long 3 feet tall and weighed up to 50 pounds about the size of a Velociraptor 

One of Troodons closest known relatives was a dinosaur called the Anchiornis When palaeontologists first found its fossil they saw that it had been covered in feathers just like a modern bird Because Troodon is believed to have been the direct descendant of Anchiornis there is a possibility that it might also have had feathers However no fossil evidence for feathers in Troodon has been found yet If Troodon did have feathers as some scientists believe then they probably resembled fur more than feathers There is a modern bird called the Kiwi that has feathers which are very similar in appearance to those of extinct raptor dinosaurs such as Troodon 

The genus now includes specimens previously classified as Stenonychosaurus 

Troodon nests full of eggs have been found in Montana When scientists CAT scanned them they found baby Troodon skeleton embryos inside of them They found skeletons of a small plant eating dinosaur named Orodromeus with the eggs as well as a skeleton of an adult Troodon At first it was believed that the eggs had belonged to the Orodromeus and that the Troodon was there intending to rob the nest 

However it was later discovered that the eggs belonged to the Troodon when baby Troodon embryos were found inside the eggs It is now believed that the adult Troodons had killed the Orodromeus and brought them back to feed their babies Troodons laid up to 24 eggs in their nests which were earth mounds They were able to lay two eggs at a time so large clutches would take two weeks to lay

Saurornithoides was a fast running dinosaur from 79 million years ago It was related to Troodon Its fossils have been found in Mongolia and China Like its cousin Troodon Saurornithoides was an intelligent predator with large eyes and good vision Saurornithoides had a retractable sickle shaped claw on the second claw of each foot that it used for attacking prey Saurornithoides probably fed on small prey such as lizards frogs insects and small mammals It may also have hunted in packs to bring down other dinosaurs Saurornithoides was discovered in the Gobi Desert on an expedition in the 1920s that was led by Roy Chapman Andrews The dinosaurs Velociraptor Protoceratops and Oviraptor were also discovered during these expeditions to the Gobi Desert It is so similar to Troodon that some paleontologists believe that it is the same dinosaur as Troodon If so then the name Troodon would take priority because it was coined first

Siegfried is a strong hero in the Nibelungenlied a epic poem written about the year 1200 He killed the dragon Fafnir and took its treasure the Nibelungenschatz After killing the dragon he bathed in its blood and so changed his skin so that he could not be wounded any more

But a leaf fell from a linden tree above while he was bathing and landed on his back and the little patch of skin that it covered did not touch the dragons blood so that Siegfried remained vulnerable in that one spot 

Siegfried wants to marry Kriemhild the sister of Gunther kin of the Burgundians in Worms But before he is allowed to marry her he has to help Gunther to win against Brnhild the queen of Iceland He does it with the help of a cloak which lets him become invisible

After their marriage Siegfried and Kriemhild live in Siegfrieds kingdom for some years Then they come to visit Worms and Kriemhilds family again Brnhild the wife of Gunther and Kriemhild argue about who is of higher rank Now Kriemhild tells Brnhild that Siegfried helped Gunther in his fight against her and that he gave a proof of this victory to Kriemhild Therefore Brnhild becomes so furious that she decides that Siegfried must be killed This is done by Hagen one of Gunthers men while Siegfried is drinking from a well during a hunt in the Odenwald Hagen also takes the treasure of Siegfried from Kriemhild and throws it into the Rhine

The name Siegfried in German means victory peace

m 1673 wid 1701 issue Mary II of England

James II of EnglandVII of Scotland became King of Scots King of England and King of Ireland on 6 February 1685 and Duke of Normandy on 31 December 1660 He was the last Roman Catholic king of Scotland England or Ireland Some of his citizens did not like his religious ideas leading a group of them to disobey and fight against him This was called the Glorious Revolution because no one was killed He was not replaced by his Roman Catholic son James Francis Edward but by his Protestant daughter and son in law Mary II and William III who became rulers in 1689

The belief that James not William III or Mary II was the one true ruler became known as Jacobitism James made one serious attempt to recover his throne when he landed in Ireland in 1689 After his defeat at the Battle of the Boyne in the summer of 1690 he returned to France living the rest of his life under the protection of King Louis XIV His son James Francis Edward Stuart and his grandson Charles Edward Stuart attempted to restore the Jacobite line after Jamess death but failed

The issue listed are the children of James II who survived into adulthood Illegitimate are not listed 

The Fichtelgebirge is a mountain range in northeastern Bavaria Germany It extends from the valley of the Red Main River to the Czech border where it is continued by the much higher Ore Mountains

The highest mountain is the Schneeberg Rivers rising from the Fichtelgebirge are the White Main the Saxon Saale the Ohe and the Fichtelnaab which later joins the Waldnaab Cities on the edge of the mountains include Bayreuth and Hof

The mountains slope gradually away to the north and the south but there is a steep slope to the west where the Red Main forms the boundary of the mountains

The Fichtelgebirge attracts many tourists both during summer and winter mainly for hiking and skiing but also to see the large rock formations

The Ore Mountains are a mountain range in Germany and the Czech Republic They form the border between both countries for 150 km extending from the western border of Saxony to the Elbe river

The Ore Mountains are famous for many Christmas traditions As the ores silver and tin were not found any more in the mines former miners had to look for new ways to feed their families In addition to lace making and weaving the inhabitants went into wood carving Nutcrackers smoking men pyramids and Schwibbogen are some of many Christmas goods made in the Ore Mountains Seiffen in the East Ore Mountains was a centre of the wooden toy industry

Consort issue Henry V

His father John of Gaunt was the third son of King Edward III and had a lot of power in the reign of King Richard II

Henry and Thomas de Mowbray 1st Duke of Norfolk argued in 1398 King Richard ordered Henry to live outside England for ten years but Thomas de Mowbray was exiled from England for life

The next year John of Gaunt died and Richard would not allow Henry to inherit Gaunts land Instead Henry had to ask for the lands from Richard 

Henry met with the exiled Thomas Arundel former Archbishop of Canterbury Henry and Arundel returned to England while Richard was on a military campaign in Ireland 

With Arundel as his advisor Henry Bolingbroke began a military campaign took land from those who opposed him and ordering his soldiers to destroy much of Cheshire

Henry gained enough power and support to have himself declared King Henry IV He imprisoned King Richard and by passing Richards seven year old heir presumptive Edmund de Mortimer 

Henry was crowned on 13 October 1399 It was the first time since the Norman Conquest in 1066 that the monarch made a public speech in English Henry consulted with Parliament frequently but was sometimes at odds with them especially over religious matters On Arundels advice Henry was the first English king to allow the burning of heretics mainly to suppress the Lollard movement

An oratorio is a piece of music for orchestra choir and solo singers It usually tells a story from the Old Testament An oratorio may be about two hours long a whole concert It is rather like an opera but whereas an opera is acted out in costume on a stage an oratorio is sung and played in a concert hall or church The oratorio as we know it was created in the 18th century The words were normally in the composers own language not in Italian like most operas were at that time

The word oratorio had been used many centuries ago for music dramas performed in churches in western Europe In Italy oratorios and operas were both being composed in the 17th century In Germany composers like Heinrich Schutz and later Johann Sebastian Bach were writing Passions which tell the story of the crucifixion These are not usually called oratorios but they are similar

The first important composer of oratorios was George Frideric Handel Handel who was born in Germany had become English Handel had written a lot of operas but in 1732 he started to write oratorios instead and quite suddenly people became very interested in oratorios He used the same sort of music as in his operas the work would start with an overture and then there would be recitative arias and choruses for the choir The chorus was very important in oratorios they got more to sing than in most operas This meant that choral societies became very popular and this tradition spread from England to other countries in Europe Handels most famous oratorio is Messiah Unlike most of his other oratorios the story is not from the Old Testament  It tells the story of the birth life and death of Jesus In Britain Handels Messiah is traditionally performed around Christmas Other oratorios by Handel include Deborah Saul Samson Judas Maccabaeus and Solomon Handel composed all these oratorios to English texts

In the 19th century the oratorio was very popular At the turn of the century Joseph Haydn wrote some of his best music in his two oratorios Die Schpfung and Die Jahreszeiten Mendelssohn wrote St Paul Elijah and the Hymn of Praise Dvok Berlioz and Gounod are among the most important Romantic composers of oratorio and in the 20th century famous oratorios include Elgars Dream of Gerontius Waltons Belshazzars Feast and Tippetts Child of our Time

Pterodactylus was a small pterosaur or flying reptile It lived in the later Jurassic period at the same time as many dinosaurs Pterodactylus is typical of the short tailed pterosaurs a sub order which continued to the end of the Cretaceous The first specimens were found at Solnhofen in Bavaria Germany These carbonate strata formed in warm lagoons also yielded the famous Archaeopteryx Pterodactylus may have lived on small islands in the lagoon or on the coast 

Rutiodon was a type of phytosaur Phytosaurs were crocodile like animals that lived during the time of dinosaurs It was shown in the movie When Dinosaurs Roamed America trying to catch a Coelophysis It jumped out of the water and roared without warning

When Dinosaurs Roamed America is a 2001 television movie from the Discovery Channel The movie is narrated by John Goodman This movie tells us about species of dinosaurs that lived in North America through the ages of the Mesozoic era The backgrounds of the movie are real places of America

Beowulf is the hero of the Anglo Saxon poem Beowulf He was the son of Ecgeow a banished warrior of the Wgmundings Ecgeow had killed a man from another clan and had to flee to the Danes The Danish king Hrogar accepted him as one of his warriors

When king Hrogar came into difficulties because his land was raided by the giant Grendel Ecgeows son Beowulf came to help him with twelve warriors During the night Grendel arrived to attack the sleeping men Beowulf attacked him without his sword and tore the arm off the beast Grendel flew and his arm was fixed to the wall During the following night Grendels Mother arrived and Beowulf had an even harder fight against her but he won

There have been many ficton books and films made based on Beowulf Beowulf appeared in most of them 

A clan is a group of people who  following a tradition  belong to the same kin 

The easiest way to describe them is as sub groups of tribes Usually they form groups of 7000 to 10000 people 

Muon catalyzed fusion is a type of cold nuclear fusion which means that nuclear fusion can happen at low temperatures and under normal pressure There need to be 3 particles a muon a positively charged triton and a positively charged deuteron The muon which has a greater mass than an electron drags the heavier triton and the deuteron to it creating something called a muonic heavy hydrogen ion This means that the particle is a hydrogen atom with more protons then electrons that contains a muon and that contains extra neutrons which make it heavier This reaction can be done at room temperature or below such as 270 degrees Celsius

To create these a stream of negative muons is sent onto blocks of protium deuterium and tritium The muon bumps out the electron in the hydrogen atom Because the electron is replaced any 2 atoms are bound together This makes a molecular ion also called a special muonic molecule A muon is 207 times more massive then an electron Because of the difference in mass the atom changes Because it is heavier the atoms in the molecular ion are pressed very tightly together and then the nuclei the centers of the atoms join together The following process is called nuclear fusion The 2 nuclei join together and glue together But their weights do not just add up a part of their mass is released as energy This is the energy used 

Now the process continues because the muon is thrown out of the nuclei when they fuse so it can join other nuclei which continues the reaction Sometimes the muon is attached to something else thrown out from the nucleus and the muon is lost This stops the reaction 

The good thing about this is that muon catalyzed fusion uses little energy and produces much energy The only problem is that the reaction is not stable so it does not last a long time because the muons are lost This process is still a long way from being used for business

Nomadic people are people who move from place to place rather than living in one place The best known examples of nomads are gypsies Roma Sinti Irish travellers and academic postdocs Many other ethnic groups and communities are traditionally nomadic such as Berbers Kazakhs and Bedouin

People are nomads for many reasons Most nomads are husbandmen herding their livestock such as cattle or horses from pasture to pasture These people have to change places according to the weather Other nomads are traders and craftsmen traveling to exchange goods or to practice their craft where it is needed

Nomads who follow their herds usually live in movable broken wikt linkdwelldwellings with few things inside like Mongols Nomads who trade or practice crafts usually have wagons in which they travel because wagons are better for carrying goods

Sami of the Laplands have been mistaken in the past as a nomadic tribe following a herd of reindeer However they are a migratory people who lead there own specific herd of reindeer to specific winter feeding grounds and then return them in the spring to a specific feeding ground close to a permanent home base where their family livesThis cycle continues annually

The Red Panda is a mammal It is the only species of the Ailuridae family There are two subspecies Ailurus fulgens fulgens and Ailurus fulgens styani 

Most that are bred at Japanese zoos are Ailurus fulgens styani They are called  in Japan and in China both literally translating to english as small bear cat

The Red Panda lives in the southern part of China Sikkim Nepal and the Himalaya mountains in high trees In the Indian state of Sikkim it is the state animal

Red Pandas are about 50 60 centimeters long They weigh between three to five kilograms They have chestnut colored hair and their faces have white designs They eat fruits roots bamboo shoots acorns and insects They are active at night and sleep on trees in the daytime They act alone not in groups 

In recent years more zoos in Japan are breeding Red Pandas They have become popular for how they look 

A Red Panda which is famous is Futa Kun Surprisingly he can stand on his two rear legs

Refraction is the change in direction of a wave caused by the change in the waves speed Examples of waves include sound waves and light waves Refraction is seen most often when a wave passes from a medium to a different medium Different types of medium include air and water When a wave passes from one medium to another medium the wave will change its speed and its direction For example when a light wave travels through air and then passes through water the waves speed will slow down and it will change direction

An example of how refraction works is placing a straw in a cup of water with part of the straw in the water When looking at a certain angle the straw appears to bend at the waters surface This is because of the bending of light rays as they move between the air and the water

A good and simple way to understand how light works is to think of it like a car When the car hits the gravel surface on an angle the tire that hits it first will lock up causing it to turn in that direction Therefore if light hits a medium on the right greater than its optical density it will bend right

When light refracts in a prism it splits into colours of the rainbow

Psychedelic mushrooms is the name given to certain kinds of mushrooms They contain the alkaloid psilocybin and other related tryptamine derivatives Psilocybin changes certain things in the brain This leads to the nerve cells giving more signals  generally translated to a different consciousness This can lead to effects like hallucinations or visions They can also be used for medical purposes to treat cluster headaches obsessive compulsive disorder and certain kinds of depression

Physiologically they do not harm the human body and can be used to treat cluster headaches and other medical conditions Some psychological problems are possible from use but not likely or common 

Psilocybin can kill in extremely high doses The LD50 of Psilocybin is 280 mgkg for rats this is about 15 times that of caffeine In normal psychedelic mushrooms psilocybin makes up about 1 of their weight Therefore nearly 17 kilograms of dried mushrooms or 17 kilograms of fresh mushrooms would be required for a 60kg person to reach the 280mgkg LD50 rate of rats

Harold Ulf full name      Harold Godwinson royal house     House of Godwin father        Godwin Earl of Wessex mother        Gytha Thorkelsdttir date of birth    Circa 1022 place of birth    Wessex England date of death    death date10661014dfy place of death    Battle of Hastings Sussex place of burial   Waltham Abbey Essex or Bosham Harold Godwinson or King Harold II of England was an English king He ruled England after king Edward the Confessor died He ruled from 5 January 1066 until he was killed at the Battle of Hastings Harold Godwinson was killed it is generally assumed by an arrow shot by one of Williams archers but some reports say he was cut down by many soldiers Before Harold Godwinson became king he swore to William Duke of Normandy that he would help him become king Harold Godwinson had three brothers Tostig Swegen and Gryth He also had a sister called Edith She was married to the king so he was his brother in law He claimed to have been made King by Edward the confessor

Harold Godwinson has a powerful background that perhaps allows historians to think him as rightful King for those times His father was Godwin the powerful Earl of Wessex and his mother was also from a rich and noble house His sister Edith was married to the King before him Edward the Confessor Also when Godwin died Harold inherited his earldom as well as being knighted Earl of East Anglia and Earl of Hereford Now Wessex was in those days an enormous amount of land that covered about a third of England Having added the lands of East Anglia and Hereford Harold ruled over a large portion of England making him the most powerful man in the whole kingdom after the King

The Spanish Armada was a Spanish navy fleet most famous for being used by Spains King Philip II to attack Britain in 1588 It was defeated by the Royal Navy of England under command of Sir Francis Drake during queen Elizabeth Is reign It started on 12 July 1588 and ended during August 1588

The Armada was led by the Duke of Medina Sidonia who had no naval experience He replaced the original commander who died in February

The defeat of the armada is often attributed to a severe storm which scattered the spanish vessels prior to their engagement of the British fleet meaning they could not utilise vastly superior numbers to their advantage as planned The British only had 55 ships

Another key element in the action were the superior ships used by the British as the oarred spanish galleons had inferior maneuvrability and could have their sweeps shorn off completely by a heavy vessel sailing past in close proximity The galleons were also considerably smaller than the British privateers meaning they carried less guns

The morale and dedication of the British sailors was high buoyed by the famous speech by Queen Elizabeth and national loyalty and led by experienced captains who had years of naval battles behind them Phillip died in 1598 with fever

However even though the English sailors had done so well they didnt get paid and were made to stay on their ships and Guard in case there was another spanish attack

The Sun is seen in the sky and makes light When the Sun is in the sky it is day When the Sun is not in the sky it is night The Sun is the star at the centre of the Solar System The planets including Earth go around it

The Sun gives off energy as electromagnetic radiation That includes light infra red energy ultraviolet light and radio waves It also gives off a stream of particles which reaches Earth as solar wind The source of all this energy is the reaction in the star which turns hydrogen into helium and makes huge amounts of energy

The Sun is an average star like many others in our galaxy the Milky Way It has existed for a little over 45 billion years and is going to continue for at least as long again 

Our Sun makes up 9986 of the matter in the solar system Even the giant planet Jupiter is tiny compared to the Sun The planets in our solar system move around the Sun in orbits Our Sun can be seen in the sky in the day time It is seen as a large yellow ball The Sun is basically a very very large ball of plasma bubbling with non stop explosions These explosions give off so much energy that if we could gather all the Suns energy for one second it would be enough to power the USfor 9 million years Even though the Sun is 93 million miles from the earth we still feel this energy 

The Sun is so bright that it can hurt to look at it and can damage human eyesight so one should never stare at the Sun and should never use binoculars or a telescope to look at it The Sun makes light heat and the solar wind Solar wind moves past the earth outside its atmosphere It is made of plasma and small particles that fly away from the Sun all the way as far as Neptune The Sun is the main source of energy for life on Earth It is no wonder that for ancient peoples the Sun was an object of worship

The Sun is at the middle of our solar system Each planet travels in a more or less round orbit with the Sun in the center Each planet orbits at a different distance from the Sun The orbits of the planets are not perfect circles They are closed curves called ellipses The planets closest to the Sun get more heat Planets farther away are colder Only the earth has a climate that is right for humans

Almost all life on our planet ultimately depends on the light energy that comes from our Sun Plants use solar energy as food so they can grow This process is called photosynthesis the green in the leaves is a pigment which is called chlorophyll

In the center of the Sun in its core great heat and pressure combine hydrogen gas into helium gas which produces large amounts of energy This is called nuclear fusion

People can look at the Sun if they use special lenses that make it safe When they do this darker spots are sometimes seen on the surface of the Sun these spots are called Sunspots The number of Sunspots on the Sun gets bigger and then smaller in a cycle of about 11 years These Sunspots affect the weather on Earth and can also affect electronics A solar storm in 1989 shut down the electric power grid in Quebec and put the entire province in darkness for nine hours

Scientists think that the Sun started from a very large cloud of dust and small bits of ice 46 billion years ago At the center of that huge cloud some of the material started to build up into a ball Once this ball got big enough reactions inside it caused that ball to shine

At that point the Sun blew away all the rest of the cloud from itself and the planets formed from the rest of this cloud

At its core or very center hydrogen atoms collide together at great temperature and pressure so that they fuse to form atoms of helium This process is called nuclear fusion This fusion changes a very small part of the hydrogen atoms into a large amount of energy This energy then travels from the core to the surface of the Sun called the photosphere where it shines into space Energy can take thousands of years to reach the Suns surface because the Sun is so huge and most of the way it is passed from atom to atom along the way

If the Sun is viewed through a very special telescope dark areas known as Sunspots can be seen These areas are caused by the Suns magnetic field The Sunspots only look dark because the rest of the Sun is very bright

This is a cycle of 11 years and every 11 years there are more Sunspots on the Sun than in the past or future years Between these 11 years Sunspots may decrease in number This cycle has been around since about the 1700s before that was the Maunder Minimum a few hundred years where there were very few Sunspots Astronomers do not know what caused this

Some space telescopes like the ones that orbit the Sun have seen huge arches that extend from the Sun These are called solar prominences Solar prominences come in many different shapes and sizes some of them are so large that the Earth could fit inside of them and there are a few shaped like hands

There are three different layers that make up the atmosphere of the Sun

This is the surface of the Sun The light that the Earth receives from the Sun is radiated from this layer Below this layer the Sun is opaque or not transparent to light

This is the layer of which the Suns rays shine It can be best seen during a solar eclipse

Sometimes the Sun disappears from the sky and all that people see is a black but shining ball This is because the Moon has moved right in front of the Sun and blocks almost all of its light These happen almost every year and very similar solar eclipses happen every 18 years 113 days a period called the Saros

Scientists called astrophysicists say our Sun is a main sequence star in the middle of its life In about another 4 5 billion years they think it will get bigger and become a red giant star The Sun would be up to 250 times its current size as big as 14 AU and will swallow up the earth

Earths fate is still a bit of a mystery Previous calculations show that Earth could escape to a higher orbit This due to the solar wind which drops 30 of the Suns mass But a newer study shows that Earth would possibly vanish itself due to the tidal forces This would happen while the Sun continues to get bigger However the Sun will lose mass

Anyway Earths ocean and air would have long since worn out This is even though the Sun is still in its main sequence stage After the Sun reaches a point where it can no longer get bigger it will literally explode But not like a supernova Rather it will expand rapidly and lose its layers forming a planetary nebula Eventually the Sun will shrink into a white dwarf Then over several hundred billion or even a trillion years the Sun would fade into a black dwarf

The sign of the cross is a physical gesture made by Catholics It is usually done at the beginning and ending of prayers The right hand goes from the forehead to the chest to the left shoulder and to the right shoulder This is sometimes done while saying Father Son Holy Spirit

Though the word Jell O is a name brand it is commonly used in the United States as a generic name for all gelatin products

Pteranodon was a large pterosaur from the Upper Cretaceous period

With its wings open it was up to 9 meters across Pteranodon might have live much like and albatross spending a lot of time over the ocean looking for fish It had no teeth in its long mouth and it had a small pouch like a pelican at the back of its jaw Pteranodon had a big crest at the back of its head Pteranodon longiceps had a straight crest that went backwards and Pteranodon sternbergi had a bigger flatter crest that went upward

Pteranodons like modern birds did not have teeth in their beaks This was unlike Pterodactylus which had teeth in their beaks 

Fossil Pteranodon have been found in Kansas Alabama Nebraska Wyoming and South Dakota

S H Kress Co was a group of five and dime department stores in the United States between 1896 to 1981 The business was started in Nanticoke Pennsylvania by Samuel H Kress in 1896 Kress Stores were common in many cities and towns of the United States In 1964 S H Kress Co was bought by Genesco Inc Genesco began closing down the stores in 1980

The Kress chain was known for the architecture of the stores A number of former Kress stores now used for other things are said to be landmarks Some of the most well known Kress locations included New York Citys Fifth Avenue Canal Street New Orleans and one at Hollywoods Hollywood Boulevard The one at Hollywood Boulevard is now preserved at a theme park in Florida

Henry V of England was the King of England from 1413 to 1422 He was born at Monmouth Wales It is not known whether he was born on 9 August 1386 or 16 September 1387

Henry V was the son of Henry Bolingbroke later Henry IV and Mary de Bohun who died before Bolingbroke became king

During his reign Henry increased his power as King of England and also took the title of King of France over which English kings had been fighting for decades He defeated the French at the famous Battle of Agincourt in 1415

Athletes Foot is a condition where the foot is dry and cracked which can be mildly painful It was named athletes foot because it was common in people who play sports or do exercise The infection can be spread to other areas of the body such as the armpits knees and elbows

Athletes foot causes scaling flaking itching blisters and cracked skin It can be cured by using antibiotics

Civil rights are rights that all people in a country have The civil rights of a country apply to all the citizens within itsborders These rights are given by the laws of the country 

Civil rights include freedom of speech freedom of the press freedom of religion and freedom of assembly Civil rights also include the right to own property and the right to get fair and equal treatment from the government from other citizens and from private groups 

In democratic countries a persons civil rights are protected by law and custom The constitutions of many democracies have a Bill of Rights that describes the peoples liberties and rights A well known example is the United States Bill of Rights 

A court of law decides if a persons civil rights have been violated The courts also decide the limits of civil rights so that people do not use their freedoms to take away the rights of other people

Ununpentium is a chemical element  It is also named eka bismuth  It has the symbol Uup It has the atomic number 115 It is a superheavy element 

Ununpentium does not exist in nature It is a synthetic element made from a fusion reaction between americium and calcium

Ununpentium is in the center of the theoretical island of stability No stable isotopes of ununpentium have yet been found Models predict that the stable isotope of ununpentium should have 184 neutrons The stable isotope with 184 neutrons is 299Uup The isotope that has been made has only 173 neutrons

On February 2 2004 a report that ununpentium and ununtrium were made was written in a journal named Physical Review C The report was written by a team of Russian scientists at Dubna Universitys Joint Institute for Nuclear Research and American scientists at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory

These people reported that they bombarded americium with calcium to make four atoms of ununpentium

Scientists of Japan also report that they have made Ununpentium 

In May 2006 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research this element was made by another method and what the final products from radioactive decay were was found by chemical analysis

Ununpentium is a temporary IUPAC systematic element name

Not enough ununpentium has been made to measure its physical or chemical properties It is thought that it would be a hard metal It may have a low melting point of about 250 C It may be slightly colored 

Ununpentium is in the same group as bismuth but its chemical properties will be different  The chemistry of ununpentium will be very influenced by special relativity It will make its properties different to the other elements in the periodic table that have a smaller atomic number One important difference from bismuth is the presence of a stable oxidation state of I The ion is thought to have chemical properties like Tl

Ununpentium is inside the island of stability This is probably why it is found in popular culture It is more likely to be talked about in UFO conspiracy theories

The most popular story about ununpentium is from Bob Lazar It is not pseudoscience because it is a refutable theory however Lazars claims are not backed by any direct experimental evidence at this time

Ununseptium is the temporary name of a chemical element It has not been discovered It has the temporary symbol Uus The element would have the atomic number 117 Ununseptium can also be named eka astatine

Ununseptium was discovered in 2009 10 6 atoms were detected

Wham was an English pop band It was created in 1981 by George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley For a short time they were known in the United States as Wham UK because another band already had that name They are best known for the song Last Christmas

George Michael is a two time Grammy Award winning English singer songwriter

George Michael who rose to fame in the 1980s when he formed the pop duo Wham with his school friend Andrew Ridgeley The duo released a string oh hit singles in 1982 like Young Guns and Wham Rap both written by Michael In 1983 Whams debut album Fantastic was released It reached 1 in the UK charts and had the hit single Club Tropicana with a music video shot in Ibiza following a year Wham changed it imaged with the release of their second album Make it Big which was a critical and commercial success hitting 1 in both the UK and the USA and spawning four singles all topping the charts on both sides of the Atlantic One of the most popular songs in the album Careless Whisper Micheals first solo single released in 1984 while he was still performing with Wham In 1986 Wham disbanded after a release of a third studio album single and concert at Wembley Stadium

Following his split with Wham George Michael began a successful solo career releasing four studio albums Faith Listen Without Prejudice Vol 1 Older and Patience Michael has sold over 100 million records worldwide as of 2010 encompassing 11 British 1 singles 9 British 1 albums 10 US 1 singles and 2 US 1 album His 1987 debut solo album Faith has sold over 20 million copies worldwide alone and its considered by some music critics to be one of the greatest albums in pop music history In 2004 Radio Academy has named Michael the most played artist on British radio between the period of 1984 2004

In 2006 George Michael announced his first tour in 15 years 25 Live tour was a massive worldwide undertaking by Michael that spanned forth individual tours over the course of five years

Michael was initially private about being homosexual During his Wham career was been in relationships with well known women such as actress Brooke Shields and model Pat Fernandes Between 1986 1988 he was romantically involved with Kathy Yueng an American makeup artist who was featured in I Want Your Sex Music Video Nonetheless his sexual orientation was well known among London music business people

These persisted into his solo career but Michael had already established a relationship with Anselmo Feleppa whom he had met at the 1991 concert Rock in Rio Feleppa died of an AIDS related brain hemorrhage in 1993 Michaels single Jesus to a Child is a tribute to Feleppa as is his 1996 album Older Since 1996 Michael had been in a long term relationship with businessman Kenny Goss They have homes in London and Dallas

Prophylaxis is a Greek word and concept It means any action taken to guard or prevent beforehand The corresponding adjective is prophylactic 

The concept of prophylaxis has two parts First is forethought A person has to realise the need first of all Second is taking appropriate action

Any failure of prophylaxis is a failure at either stage 1 or stage 2 Successful prophylaxis means one has anticipated and avoided some undesirable outcome 

Prophylaxis is the central idea in preventative medicine People usually think medical treatment helps sick people to get healthy Prophylactic treatment is helpful in a different way Primary prophylaxis tries to stop healthy people from getting sick Secondary prophylaxis tries to stop people who are sick from getting worse 

Prophylaxis may also be used as a synonym for birth control Condoms are prophylactic because when you use them a female will not get pregnant and it reduces the spread of sexually transmitted diseases

Prophylaxis is also a term in chess It was introduced by the grandmaster Aaron Nimzovich in his book My system The term refers to actions taken by a player to thwart the opponents plans and moves of these type are often called prophylactic moves

One simple example of a prophylactic move is when a player moves a rooks pawn forward one square to prevent a back rank mate

The lemon is a small tree that is green even in the winter It came from Asia and is also the name of the trees oval yellow fruit The fruit is used for cooking and other things in the world usually for its juice

People do not know for sure where lemons have come from However most people think that lemons first grew in India northern Burma and China The lemon is the common name for Citrus Lemon A lemon is a yellow citrus fruit It is related to the orange Lemon juice is about 5 citric acid and has a pH of 2 to 3 Lemon plants vary in size yet stay generally small The tallest height they can get is about 6 meters tall

Lemons taste sour The juice zest and pulp are often used in cooking often on fish and other meat for better taste  Lemon is also used to flavour drinks such as lemonade or soft drinks 

An elevator or lift is a vertical transport vehicle that efficiently moves people or goods between floors of a building They are generally powered by electric motors that either drive traction cables and counterweight systems or pump hydraulic fluid to raise a cylindrical piston Languages other than English may have loanwords based on either elevator or lift Because of wheelchair access laws elevators are often a legal requirement in new multi story buildings especially where wheelchair ramps would be impractical

Some argue that lifts began as simple rope or chain hoists A lift is essentially a platform that is either pulled or pushed up by a mechanical means A modern day lift consists of a cab mounted on a platform within an enclosed space called a shaft or sometimes a hoistway In the past lift drive mechanisms were powered by steam and water hydraulic pistons In a traction lift cars are pulled up by means of rolling steel ropes over a deeply grooved pulley commonly called a sheave in the industry The weight of the car is balanced with a counterweight Sometimes two lifts always move synchronously in opposite directions and they are each others counterweight

The friction between the ropes and the pulley furnishes the traction which gives this type of lift its name 

Hydraulic lifts use the principles of hydraulics to pressurize an above ground or in ground piston to raise and lower the car Roped hydraulics use a combination of both ropes and hydraulic power to raise and lower cars Recent innovations include permanent earth magnet motors machine room less rail mounted gearless machines and microprocessor controls 

The technology used in new installations depends on a variety of factors Hydraulic lifts are cheaper but installing cylinders greater than a certain length becomes impractical for very high lift hoistways For buildings of much over seven stories traction lifts must be employed instead Hydraulic lifts are usually slower than traction lifts

Lifts are a candidate for mass customization There are economies to be made from mass production of the components but each building comes with its own requirements like different number of floors dimensions of the well and usage patterns

Elevator doors protect riders from falling into the shaft The most common configuration is to have two panels that meet in the middle and slide open laterally In a cascading configuration the doors run on independent tracks so that while open they are tucked behind one another and while closed they form cascading layers on one side This can configured so that two sets of such cascading doors operate like the center opening doors described above allowing for a very wide elevator cab In less expensive installations the elevator can also use one large slab door a single panel door the width of the doorway that opens to the left or right laterally

General

All elevators whether traction or hydraulic require a machine room to store large electric motors and a controller cabinet This room is located above the hoistway and may contain machinery for a single or a group of elevators Modern day traction motors boasting gearless and permanent magnet drive can be more compact and efficient electronic microprocessors have replaced the mechanical relays As a result traction elevators can be built without a dedicated room above the shaft saving valuable space in building planning

The new lift design presents a departure from the traditional looped over the top traction rope routing of traction elevators The ends of the cables are fixed to the supporting structure and the length of the cable are connected to the car and counterweight by means of a force multiplying energy saving compound pulley system Machine room less elevators have become a welcome alternative to the older hydraulic elevator for low to medium rise buildings

Kone a Finnish elevator company first developed the machine room less elevator in 1996

Facts

  national and local building codes did not address elevators without machine rooms

The first reference to an elevator is in the works of the Roman architect Vitruvius who reported that Archimedes built his first elevator probably in 236 BC In some literary sources of later historical periods elevators were mentioned as cabs on a hemp rope and powered by hand or by animals It is supposed that elevators of this type were installed in the Sinai monastery of Egypt In the 17th century the prototypes of elevators were located in the palace buildings of England and France

In 1852 Elisha Otis introduced the safety elevator which prevented the fall of the cab if the cable broke The design of the Otis safety elevator is somewhat similar to one type still used today A governor device engages knurled roller locking the elevator to its guides should the elevator descend at excessive speed He demonstrated it at the New York exposition in the Crystal Palace in 1854

In 1874 JW Meaker patented a method which permitted elevator doors to open and close safely

The first electric elevator was constructed by the German engineer Werner von Siemens in 1880

In 1882 when hydraulic power was a well established technology a company later named the London Hydraulic Power Company was formed It constructed a network of high pressure mains on both sides of the Thames which ultimately extended to 184 miles and powered some 8000 machines predominantly lifts and cranes

In 1929 Clarence Conrad Crispen with Inclinator Company of America created the first residential elevator Crispen also invented the first inclined stairlifthttpinclinatorcomabout inclinatorasp

Pneumatic or Vacuum elevators operate without cables and can be installed more easily and quickly than their alternatives since their housing comprises prefabricated sections which are considerably narrower than conventional lift shafts These sections are often transparent and afford the passenger a near 360 view

Statistically speaking elevators are extremely safe Their safety record is unsurpassed by any other vehicle system In 1998 it was estimated that approximately eight 100 millionths of one percent of elevator rides resulted in an anomaly and the vast majority of these were minor things such as the doors failing to open For all practical purposes there are no cases of elevators simply free falling and killing the passengers inside of the 20 to 30 elevator related deaths each year most of them are maintenance related  for example technicians leaning too far into the shaft or getting caught between moving parts and most of the rest are attributed to easily avoidable accidents such as people stepping blindly through doors that open into empty shafts or being strangled by scarves caught in the doors In fact prior to the September 11th terrorist attacks the only known free fall incident in a modern cable borne elevator happened in 1945 when a B 25 bomber struck the Empire State Building in fog severing the cables of an elevator cab which fell from the 75th floor all the way to the bottom of the building seriously injuring the sole occupant  the female elevator operator While it is possible for an elevators cable to snap all elevators in the modern era have been fitted with several safety devices which prevent the elevator from simply free falling and crashing An elevator cab is typically borne by six or eight hoist cables each of which is capable on its own of supporting the full load of the elevator plus twenty five per cent more weight In addition there is a device which detects whether the elevator is descending faster than its maximum designed speed if this happens the device causes bronze brake shoes to clamp down along the vertical rails in the shaft stopping the elevator quickly but not so abruptly as to cause injury In addition a hydraulic buffer is installed at the bottom of the shaft to cushion any impact somewhat

Most recently there was an incident in a modern cable borne elevator that took place in a childrens hospital in Seattle Washington on October 9 2007 The elevator involved was a ThyssenKrupp ISIS machine room less elevator The ISIS used Kevlar fiberglass ropes instead of conventional braided steel ropes all other traction elevators use One of the ISIS elevators broke free from its cables slipping between the 6th and 4th floors the Kevlar ropes were the cause of this incident After the incident ThyssenKrupp discontinued production of the ISIS and the following year replaced it with the Synergy machine room less elevator which uses conventional braided steel ropes making it much safer

Past problems with early hydraulic elevators meant those built prior to a code change in 1972 were subject to possible catastrophic failure The code had previously required only single bottom hydraulic cylinders In the event of a cylinder breach an uncontrolled fall of the elevator might result Because it is impossible to verify the system completely without a pressurized casing it is necessary to remove the piston to inspect it The cost of removing the piston is such that it makes no economic sense to re install the old cylinder therefore it is necessary to replace the cylinder and install a new pistonCitation neededdateFebruary 2007 Another solution to protect against a cylinder blowout is to install a life jacket This is a device which in the event of an excessive downward speed clamps onto the cylinder and stops the car This device is also known as a Rupture Valve in some parts of the world

In addition to the safety concerns for older hydraulic elevators there is risk of leaking hydraulic oil into the aquifer and causing potential environmental contamination This has led to the introduction of PVC liners around hydraulic cylinders which can be monitored for integrity

In the past decade recent innovations in inverted hydraulic jacks have eliminated the costly process of drilling the ground to install a borehole jack This also eliminates the threat of corrosion to the system and increases safety

There are at least four means of moving an elevator

Geared traction machines are driven by AC or DC electric motors Geared machines use worm gears to control mechanical movement of elevator cars by rolling steel hoist ropes over a drive sheave which is attached to a gearbox driven by a high speed motor These machines are generally the best option for basement or overhead traction use for speeds up to 500 ftmin

Gearless traction machines are low speed high torque electric motors powered either by AC or DC In this case the drive sheave is directly attached to the end of the motor Gearless traction elevators can reach speeds of up to 2000 ftmin or even higher A brake is mounted between the motor and drive sheave to hold the elevator stationary at a floor This brake is usually an external drum type and is actuated by spring force and held open electrically a power failure will cause the brake to engage and prevent the elevator from falling

In each case cables are attached to a hitch plate on top of the cab or may be underslung below a cab and then looped over the drive sheave to a counterweight attached to the opposite end of the cables which reduces the amount of power needed to move the cab The counterweight is located in the hoist way and rides a separate rail system as the car goes up the counterweight goes down and vice versa This action is powered by the traction machine which is directed by the controller typically a relay logic or computerized device that directs starting acceleration deceleration and stopping of the elevator cab The weight of the counterweight is typically equal to the weight of the elevator cab plus 40 50 of the capacity of the elevator The grooves in the drive sheave are specially designed to prevent the cables from slipping Traction is provided to the ropes by the grip of the grooves in the sheave thereby the name As the ropes age and the traction grooves wear some traction is lost and the ropes must be replaced and the sheave repaired or replaced 

Elevators with more than 100 of travel have a system called compensation This is a separate set of cables or a chain attached to the bottom of the counterweight and the bottom of the elevator cab This makes it easier to control the elevator as it compensates for the differing weight of cable between the hoist and the cab If the elevator cab is at the top of the hoist way there is a short length of hoist cable above the car and a long length of compensating cable below the car and vice versa for the counterweight If the compensation system uses cables there will be an additional sheave in the pit below the elevator to guide the cables If the compensation system uses chains the chain is guided by a bar mounted between the counterweight rails

A climbing elevator is a self ascending elevator with its own propulsion The propulsion can be done by an electric or a combustion engine Climbing elevators are used in guyed masts or towers in order to make easy access to parts of these constructions such as flight safety lamps for maintenance An example would be the Moonlight Towers in Austin Texas where the elevator holds only one person and equipment for maintenance

Many elevator installations now feature emergency power systems which allow elevator use in blackout situations and prevent people from becoming trapped in elevators

When power is lost in a traction elevator system all elevators will initially come to a halt One by one each car in the group will return to the lobby floor open its doors and shut down People in the remaining elevators may see an indicator light or hear a voice announcement informing them that the elevator will return to the lobby shortly Once all cars have successfully returned the system will then automatically select one or more cars to be used for normal operations and these cars will return to service The car selected to run under emergency power can be manually overridden by a key or strip switch in the lobby In order to help prevent entrapment when the system detects that it is running low on power it will bring the running cars to the lobby or nearest floor open the doors and shut down

In hydraulic elevator systems emergency power will lower the elevators to the lowest landing and open the doors to allow passengers to exit The doors then close after an adjustable time period and the car remains unusable until reset usually by cycling the elevator main power switch Typically due to the high current draw when starting the pump motor hydraulic elevators are not run using standard emergency power systems Buildings like hospitals and nursing homes usually size their emergency generators to accommodate this draw However the increasing use of current limiting motor starters commonly known as Soft Start contactors avoid much of this problem and the current draw of the pump motor is less of a limiting concern

Elevators may feature talking devices as an accessibility aid for the blind In addition to floor arrival notifications the computer announces the direction of travel and notifies the passengers before the doors are to close

In addition to the call buttons elevators usually have floor indicators and direction lanterns The former are almost universal in cab interiors with more than two stops and may be found outside the elevators as well on one or more of the floors Floor indicators can consist of a dial with a rotating needle but the most common types are those with successively illuminated floor indications or LCDs Likewise a change of floors or an arrival at a floor is indicated by a sound depending on the elevator

Direction lanterns are also found both inside and outside elevator cars but they should always be visible from outside because their primary purpose is to help people decide whether or not to get on the elevator If somebody waiting for the elevator wants to go up but a car comes first that indicates that it is going down then the person may decide not to get on the elevator If the person waits then one will still stop going up Direction indicators are sometimes etched with arrows or shaped like arrows andor use the convention that one that lights up red means down and green means up Since the color convention is often undermined or overrided by systems that do not invoke it it is usually used only in conjunction with other differentiating factors An example of a place whose elevators use only the color convention to differentiate between directions is the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago where a single circle can be made to light up green for up and red for down Sometimes directions must be inferred by the position of the indicators relative to one another

In addition to lanterns most elevators have a chime to indicate if the elevator is going up or down either before or after the doors open usually in conjunction with the lanterns lighting up Universally one chime is for up two is for down and none indicates an elevator that is free

Observatory service elevators often convey other facts of interest including elevator speed stopwatch and current position as with the case for Taipei 101s service elevators

The mechanical and electrical design of elevators is dictated according to various standards which may be international national state regional or city based Whereas once many standards were prescriptive specifying exact criteria which must be complied with there has recently been a shift towards more performance based standards where the onus falls on the designer to ensure that the elevator meets or exceeds the standard

Some of the national elevator standards include

Because an elevator is part of a building it must also comply with standards relating to earthquake resilience fire standards electrical wiring rules and so forth

The American National Elevator Standards Group sets an elevator weight standard to be 2200 lbs

Additional requirements relating to access by disabled persons may be mandated by laws or regulations such as the Americans with Disabilities Act

The Brixton riot of April 11 1981 was the biggest of three riots in Brixton London and the biggest riot in London

Brixton in south London was a very poor area with many problems high unemployment much crime bad housing Many Black people and people from the Caribbean lived there Many people there did not like the police 

The riot was unplanned On the evening of the 10th at around 515pm a black boy with a knife wound was stopped by police As he was brought to a police car by two police men along Railton Road a large crowd attacked the police and the fight only ended when more police men arrived the youth was taken to hospital

Through the night of the 10th and on Saturday 11th the police brought many police men into the area Throughout the day crowds slowly got together In early evening as the police tried to make some arrests on Atlantic Road the riots started a few bricks were thrown and windows smashed More police came and more things were thrown The police retreated leaving their cars to be burned Other cars were burned and things were stolen from shops on Railton Road Mayall Road Leeson Road and Brixton Road before the police came back

The police closed the Atlantic Railton Mayall area from public although many other streets had groups of rioting people as well The rioters started throwing with bricks bottles and Molotov cocktails Cars and buildings were burned and fire engines attacked as they tried to stop the flames

The riot was at its peak at around 8pm with two public houses schools and other buildings burning Two hours later the police had the area under some control although the fire brigade returned at the next morning only By 1am the area was largely under control with no large crowdss except the police on the streets There were tries to start violence again on the 12th but they were stopped by more than 1000 police men on the streets

The riot was followed by almost 300 police injuries and 65 bad civilian injuries over 100 cars were burned including 56 police cars almost 150 buildings were damaged with thirty burned There were 82 arrests

The British Museum in London is one of the worlds largest and most important museums of human history and culture It has more than seven million objects from all continents They illustrate and document the story of human culture from its beginning to the present As with all other national museums and art galleries in Britain the Museum charges no admission fee 

The British Museum set up in 1753 and opened in 1759 It was the first museum in the world to be open to everyone The museum gradually grew over the next two hundred years It has nearly six million visitors a year and is the second most popular art museum in the world 

Some of the museums most popular and important exhibits include the Rosetta Stone and the Elgin Marbles

The history of the British Museum began with the English physicist Hans Sloane who died aged 93 in 1753 During his life he had collected many important things from all around the world When he died he did not want his collection to be split up between his relatives He sold his collection to the parliament of King George II The parliament set up the British Museum to hold the collection By the time he died Sloane had collected over 80000 objects from all over the world including Egypt Greece Rome and the Americas The collection was mostly books and manuscripts There were many important archaeological pieces included as well

The government looked at many possible places to build the new museum including Buckingham House which later became Buckingham Palace Eventually a building called Montagu House was chosen The Museum opened on the 15th of January 1759 although all visitors had to be shown around by stewards Over the years the museum began to concentrate more and more on historical objects and sculptures For this reason they were given the Rosetta Stone by King George III in 1802 The Rosetta Stone had previously been important to French historians trying understand the Hieroglyph language written by the Ancient Egyptians In 1816 the Museum acquired the Elgin Marbles from Thomas Bruce 7th Earl of Elgin Elgin had taken them from the Parthenon in Athens Greece several years earlier Many people disagreed with the way Elgin took them from Greece They compared his acts to looting and vandalism People still argue about this issue today In 1822 King George III donated the entire Royal Library to the museum This contained over 65000 books and pamphlets In 1823 the original building was demolished and work began on new buildings to hold the ever growing collection Some of the space was freed up when the National Gallery opened in 1824 as many of the Museums paintings and drawings were moved there

The Museums collection continued to get bigger over the following years and more and more buildings were added to hold the new objects Important discoveries by people working for the British Museum included the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus by Charles Newton in 1857 and the Temple of Artemis in 1869 Many things found at these sites were taken to the Museum where they have remained ever since In 1852 the British Museums famous round Reading Room was opened It had enough space to display a million books at once The collection continued to get bigger and bigger Eventually the Natural History Museum was set up in 1887 to hold the natural parts of the Museums collection It was around this time that electric lights were first put in the Museum It was one of the first public places in England to do so In the early 1900s the Museums board of directors bought all the houses surrounding it knocked them all down and built over them In 1939 just before the start of World War II most of the Museums exhibits were taken to other places because the directors were worried the Nazis might bomb the Museum during the Blitz The exhibits were stored in old London Underground stations as well as other places The evacuation proved to be a good idea as parts of the Museum were destroyed by bombs in 1940

Much of the 1950s was spent fixing the parts of the Museum destroyed by the bombing and bringing back the pieces that had been taken away During all this time the collection continued to get bigger although space was slowly running out for all the books being brought in The British Library was set up in 1973 to deal with this problem In 1972 the Museum was loaned the Tutankhamun collection from the Museum of Cairo They held a big exhibition called The Treasures of Tutankhamun and it attracted over 15 million people to come and see it In 1998 the central courtyard which had been unused before was turned into the Great Court with the Reading Room at its centre The Great Court has over 2 acres of space under its roof This makes it the largest covered public space in Europe It was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in January 2000 Since then the Museum has collected more things to do with history rather than more modern pieces They now have a large collection of Roman British Ancient Greek and Ancient Egyptian artefacts as well as objects from many other cultures and times around the world

Because of its extremely large size the Museums collection is split into many parts called departments The departments have changed many times over the years They are sometimes merged together split into smaller departments or re named and changed altogether

The British Museums department of Ancient Egypt and Sudan is one of the biggest collections of Ancient Egyptian art in the world Only the Egyptian Museum in Cairo has a bigger collection They cover Egyptian and Sudanese history from around 10000 BC all the way to the 12th century AD a period of around 12000 years 

Around 150 of the objects in the Egyptian department were part of the first collection which was given to the Museum by Hans Sloane in 1753 In 1801 the British defeated the French led by Napoleon Bonaparte at the battle of the Nile After the battle British forces took lots of Ancient Egyptian artifacts from the defeated French They were given to the British Museum in 1803 These objects included the famous Rosetta Stone

The department continued to get bigger paying for archaeologists to go to Egypt and Sudan They did this until 2001 when the Egyptian government made it much harder for Museums to take historical artefacts back to their own country The collection now has over 110000 exhibits

The British Museums department of Greece and Rome is one of the biggest collections of Ancient Greek and Roman objects in the world The objects come from nearly 4000 years of European history from 3200 BC all the way to the 4th century AD

It contains parts of two of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World the Mausoleum at Halikarnassos and the Temple of Artemis at Ephesos It also had many pieces taken from the Parthenon in Athens Greece Like the rest of the Museum the department gets most of its collection from excavations or the acquiring of private collections Some of the earliest objects in the collection were bought from the collection of Sir William Hamilton in 1772 In recent years the Museums rules on how it can get objects have become much stricter Other countries rules on allowing Museums to take objects away have also got stricter This has meant the British Museum has gradually taken fewer items each year in recent times

The British Museum Department of the Middle East has the largest collection of Mesopotamian art in the world outside Iraq It has some 300000 objects covering the Neolithic period until present It has objects from all over the Middle East including Mesopotamia Anatolia Levant and some pieces from central Asia The Assyrian and Sumerian collections are also some of the biggest in the world

Python is an open source programming language that was made to look good and be easy to read It was created by a programmer named Guido van Rossum in the year 1991 The language is named after the TV show Monty Python and many examples include jokes from the show

Python is an interpreted language An interpreted language allows the programmer to give the source code to the computer and the computer runs the code right away This means if the programmer needs to change the code they can see the result of any changes quickly This makes Python a good programming language for beginners and for rapid development because unlike some compiled languages you do not have to go through the Compile Build Run Debug cycle with Python

Python is a high level programming language A high level language has advanced features which allow the programmer to write instructions without having to worry about how the computer is going to carry them out This makes writing programs easier and faster Python derives some of its syntax from C and can use modules written in C

Python is used by hundreds of thousands of programmers and is used in lots of applications Sometimes only Python code is used for a program but most of the time it is used to do simple tasks while another programming language is used to do the more complex tasks

Its standard library is what functions come with the program when it is installed The standard library has lots functions in it On the Internet there are many other libraries available that make it possible for the Python language to do more things These libraries make it a powerful language meaning that it can do lots of different things

Here are some of the things Python is often used for

For example

In this triangle if angle C is 90 degrees then the opposite side c is the hypotenuse The hypotenuse is important in trigonometry where it is used to calculate many functions

The length of the hypotenuse can be calculated if the other two sides are known using Pythagoras Theorem In fact the length of any side of a right triangle can be calculated if the other two sides are known using this theorem

Xylem is the water transporter cells of plants It carries water around a plant

Xylem vessels are a long straight chain made of tough long dead cells known as vessel elements The cells are arranged end to end and the cell walls which would normally surround the whole cell dissolve where ever they are touching another cell wall This makes a tube sometimes the cells are just filled with holes rather than have no blocking cell wall they have lignified cell wall and a large central cavityThe vessel cells are also devoid of protoplasmVessel members are interconnected through perforations in their common wallsThe presence of vessel is a characteristic feature of angiosperms The secondary walls of vessels are filled with lignin a kind of hard glue 

Xylem vessels work because of the transpiration stream It is caused by the evaporation of water from the cells in the leaf to the atmosphere This transpiration causes millions of tiny rings of cartilage to form in the cell wall of the leaf The resulting surface tension causes pressure in the xylem that pulls the water from the roots and soil This is called capillary action

The Xylem vessels were discovered by Rubert Higgins while he was on vacation in the Bahamas

A Neural network is an artificial system It is modeled after the way the human brain works Several computing cells work in parallel to produce a result This is usually seen as one of the possible ways Artificial intelligence can work Most neural networks can tolerate if one or more of the processing cells fail 

What is important in the idea of neural networks is that they are able to learn by themselves an ability which makes them remarkably distinctive in comparison to normal computers which cannot do anything for which they are not programmed

Warm blooded animals are animals who can control the temperature of their body When they are cold they shiver or shake to make them warmer When they are warm they sweat to become cooler This is different from cold blooded animals who need to move to sunlight to become warmer 

Warm blooded animals do not need to move to make them warm or cold but movement is part of their physiology This is because all movement by animals creates heat from the chemical reaction of respiration So polar bears do not freeze because their metabolism produces heat and movement produces more heat During hibernation bears exist several degrees lower that they do in active life 

Warm blooded animals have thermal insulation hair feathers or in water blubber

Warm blooded animals are homeotherms or homoiotherms cold blooded animals are poikilotherms

The boy was riding home on his bicycle from his girlfriends house when he saw a police car and thought it was chasing him Police were searching him but police have said that the police car was looking for a different person While the chase Hickey lost control of his bicycle rode into a spiked fence

Friends and relatives came together at The Block to be sad Fliers were given out which said that it was the fault of the police that the boy died and unhappy aboriginal youths arrived from other parts of Sydney at the Redfern railway station The police closed the entrance to the station but the crowd had turned violent and began to throw bottles bricks and Molotov cocktails The violence became into a full riot around The Block during which Redfern railway station was burning for a short time and was heavily damaged The riot went on into the early morning until police used Fire Brigade water hoses to get the crowd apart One car stolen in a western suburb was burnt and 40 police officers were hurt

Fingering means choosing which finger to use for each note when playing a piece on a musical instrument When learning to play a piece it is important to try to find a good fingering Once a good fingering has been found it should always be used so that the piece is always played in the same way and the fingers learn where to go Sometimes printed music has some fingering printed above the notes This can be helpful to the player but it is not always necessary to use the printed fingering Peoples hands are different and a fingering that is good for one player may not be good for another 

When playing keyboard instruments the fingers are numbered from 1 to 5 on each hand the thumb is 1 the index finger is 2 the middle finger is 3 the ring finger is 4 and the little finger is 5 The fingers were not always numbered like that In Britain in the 19th century the thumb was shown by a cross and the fingers were numbered from 1 to 4 This was known as English fingering while the other way was known as Continental fingering However from the beginning of the 20th century the British used the normal 1 to 5 fingering

Ideas about fingering have changed during the history of music In the Baroque times French composers writing for the harpsichord often fingered scale passages 2 3 2 3 etc so that the notes were grouped in twos Later this idea went out of fashion In the early 19th century Carl Czerny wrote lots of studies for piano which helped to exercise all the fingers equally This is how we learn to play the piano today

Fingering for the organ is similar to fingering for the piano However organists use a lot of finger substitution which means changing to a different finger while a note is held down This is useful in music such as hymn tunes which have lots of chords It helps to make the music legato An organist playing on the pedals also needs to decide which foot to use for each note This is called footing A v sign means play with the toe a square u sign means play with the heel When these signs are placed above the note it means the right foot below means for the left foot

Fingering on string instruments will show which position to play in The fingers are numbered from 1 to 4 because the thumb is behind the neck of the instrument The number 0 means play an open string It is only the left hand which fingers the notes because the right hand is either plucking or bowing Bowed instruments like the violin have no markings on the fingerboard so the player has to get used to the exact place to put the fingers otherwise it will not be in tune Plucked instruments such as guitars and banjos have frets which show where to put the fingers

Sometimes the fingering printed or written in the music may also need to show which string to play on A tune that could be played in first position on a D string on the violin could also be played on the G string in fifth position This is harder to do but a good player can make it sound particularly warm and beautiful Sometimes notes can be fingered as harmonics instead of as ordinary stopped notes This makes them sound very light and airy

Cellists can also play in thumb position if they have several notes which are high and quite near one another This means putting the thumb high up on the fingerboard often across two strings

The double bass is so big that the distances between the notes are very big too To go up from one note to the next they use finger 1 then 2 then 4 Finger 3 is just helping finger 4 to press down on the string There are a few players who use a different fingering system using fingers 1 2 3 4 This means that the hand has to stretch a lot It is difficult to play in tune like this although it saves having to change the hand position so much

Harp music looks like piano music there are two staves one which usually has a treble clef for the right hand the other with a bass clef for the left hand Some piano music can be played on the harp but the piano fingering will not work On a piano starting with the thumb and going along the fingers to the little finger means going to higher notes in the right hand and to lower notes in the left hand On the harp it is the other way round The thumb is numbered 1 and the fingers are 2 3 and 4 The little finger is not used in harp playing

In woodwind instruments there is normally one basic fingering each note is a particular combination of fingers However at more advanced levels different fingerings can be used in order to create different effects Beginners books may have a fingering chart to show how to get the different notes A low F sharp on a descant recorder will be fingered 1 2 3 0 2 3 This means fingers 1 2 and 3 of the left hand and fingers 2 and 3 of the right hand The first hole of the right hand position is left open

On the recorder some of the notes especially sharps and flats have complicated fingering This is called cross fingering The flute oboe clarinet and bassoon all have metal keys to help reach the low holes and to make it easier to play the sharps and flats The usual system for these keys was invented in the 19th century by Theobald Bhm

Sometimes there is an alternative fingering for some notes This can be used to make it easier to play fast trills but the usual fingering will sound better for normal notes

Good fingering is fingering which avoids moving the hand up and down unnecessarily It should also help the music to sound good eg legato music for smooth tunes clear music for fast repeated notes

Other uses

An icon is an image picture or representation which has a religious meaning It is a sign or a likeness that stands for a real object or person Although the word icon can be used for images of other religions it is most often used to describe a painting on a wooden panel that has been done in the Orthodox Christian tradition and may also be used for carved ivory panels and panels of silver or gold These icons show a holy being such as Jesus Mary a saint or an angel They also show scenes from the Bible such as the Crucifixion and scenes from lives of the saints In Orthodox Christianity an icon is thought of as a window through which a person can get a view of Gods truth 

How a Christian Orthodox icon is painted 

The traditional way of making an icon was used in Egypt in Early Christian times to make portraits of dead people to use for their funerals Like icons these funeral portraits were done on a wooden panel and the paint was mixed with yolk of egg From the time that Christianity was made legal by the Emperor Constantine in the early 300s artists began to use the same method for painting holy pictures 

It was always hoped that a painting would last for a long time so everything had to be very carefully prepared A board had to be chosen that would not crack or warp and which did not have any knotty bits that might fall out The board was sanded smooth and then coated with a gluey paint called size which would hold the coloured paint well but stop the expensive colours from being soaked up by the wood The artist would prepare the paints very carefully Some of the colours were made from gound up semi precious stones Others were made from chemicals 

Before the artist could start on the panel he had to prepare the design It was not important for the artist to think of something new and different It was much more important that he could copy another icon very accurately The same designs were used over and over 

Although all icons were thought of as a window to Heaven some icons were believed to have special properties It was believed that praying and lighting candles before some icons would bring healing or the help of the saint who was shown in the picture These icons became very famous and were often copied 

After the artist had drawn the design onto the surface of the size in thin green or brown paint he would put the paint on in layers building up the colours bit by bit Most of the colours were quite transparent and this made the painting look glowing When the figures were finished the artist would set the work in a wooden frame and gild it by covering the background with a little pieces of gold leaf that had been beaten into very thin sheets When a candle was lit near the icon it shone on the gold surface and made the figures stand out

Icons in other religions Throughout history some religions such as Christianity and Hinduism have often used images such as paintings and statues while others such as Judaism and Islam do not often use images of people 

In Hinduism there is much use of sacred objects because there is a belief in murti the idea that the Spirit of God can be present in an icon

The Brights is a group that was started by Paul Geisert and Mynga Futrell to make a name that sounds good for people who have views on life based on nature They did not like that names like atheist and non believer sounded bad to some people and they wanted a word that sounded better to these people

Paul Geisert chose the word bright Mynga Futrell says a bright is a person who has views on life that are free of more than natural ideas She says these persons morals come from their views on life

Some people both religious and non religious do not like the Brights using the word bright in this way They believe it suggests that people with views on life based on nature are smarter than those with other views on life However this is not why the name was chosen it tries to show that people with views based on nature are looking on the bright side of life

Dish can mean a plate or pan for food or a kind of food prepared for a meal 

Some radio antennas are in the shape of dishes

A hinge is something that connects two objects and lets them rotate The most common examples are the hinges that connect doors to walls or door frames To open a door on hinges one pushes the side far from the hinges and the door rotates around the side with hinges

Hinges can be very large or very small Small hinges are used for jewelery boxes and other small things with lids Very large hinges have been used at the bottom of buildings to let a building sit on loose soil or mud without breaking

Visible light is the light that can be seen by the human eye It is a small part of the spectrum of light and radiation given off by stars like the sun

Light is electromagnetic radiation that is in the form of a wave Each wave has a wave length or frequency The human eye sees each frequency as a different color Rainbows show the entire spectrum of visible light The separate colors moving in from the outer edges are usually listed as red orange yellow green blue and violet Other colors can be seen only with special cameras or instruments outside of red is infrared and inside of violet is ultraviolet

Light and color are forms of analog information However electronic cameras and computer displays work with digital information So electronic cameras or document scanners make a digital version of a color image by separating out the full color image into separate red green and blue images Later a digital display uses pixels of just those three colors Computer screens use only these three colors in different brightness levels The brain combines them to see all of the other colors in the image 

People think of objects as having color Scientist explain this because the molecules that make up the object absorb certain light waves leaving the other light waves to bounce off The human eye sees the wave lengths of all of the light that was not absorbed and the combination of those leaves the brain with the impression of a color

An instrument can be mean refer to several things An instrument is an object used to do something It is a tool

Producer is something that creates one thing or one being Producer is related to reproducer which means to produce again

In the entertainment industry a producer is a person who makes things happen The producer is of the person in charge of providing the money and hire people to do the job It is also the job of the producer to deal with getting whatever is being made out to the public A movie producer must find people to provide money to make the movie hire the main actors and director for the movie and get the movie distributed so that people can see it Producers are commonly found dealing with movies television and music

In large entertainment companies the title of executive producer is often given to people who provide a large amount of money to get something created Other executive producers speak for the CEO of the company on how the movie or television program is made

In smaller companies especially for television series the executive producer is often the creator of the series Main writers who have been with the series for a long time are often given the title of executive producer

Italian wines are those produced in Italy the oldest wine producing region and are considered to be among the best wines in the world Wine is a popular beverage in Italy Many Italians drink it with every meal and in between and offer it to guests as soon as they arrive 

Depending on the vintage Italy is the worlds largest or second largest producer of wine along with France 

In 2005 Italy was second globally producing about 20 of the global production of wine compared to France which produced 22

In 2005 Italys share in dollar value of table wine imports into the US was 32 Australias was 24 and Frances was 20 Italian and Australian share has rapidly increased in recent years

Grapes are grown in almost every part of Italy with more than 1 million vineyards under cultivation Each region is proud of its carefully tended neatly pruned vines

Italian wines tend to be acidic dry light to medium bodied with lots of flavour and smell Because of these characteristics Italian wines are in general better drunk with food than they are beverages to be enjoyed on their own

In some places the vines are trained along low supports In others they climb as slender saplings The people of each region are also proud of the wine they make from their own grapes 

Most winemaking in Italy is done in modern wineries But villagers making wine for their own use sometimes tread the grapes with their bare feet until the juice is squeezed out They believe this ancient method still makes the best wine

The term Monster can mean different things

A platelet is a cell fragment that circulates in the blood Platelets are involved in haemostasis through the making of blood clots A low platelet count can cause a person to bleed without their blood clotting A high platelet count can increase the risk of thrombosis which stops blood from flowing properly

Platelets do not have a cell nucleus They are disc shaped and are 15 to 3 micrometers in diameter The body does not have a lot of platelets so they can all be used up quickly They contain RNA a canalicular system and several different types of granules lysosomes dense bodies and alpha granules the contents of which are released when the platelet is activated

Eastern Europe is the eastern region of Europe The term Eastern Europe still means such European countries that until the end of the Cold War were Post Soviet states in Europe or states in Europe that once belong to the Soviet Union But without include the Baltic states

Following are Eastern Europe countries

The term Eastern Bloc referred to the former Communist states of Eastern and Central Europe including the countries of the Warsaw Pact along with Yugoslavia and Albania which were not aligned with the Soviet Union after 1948 and 1960 respectively

Communist governments were initially installed in a Bloc politics process that included extensive political and media controls along with a Soviet approach to restricting emigration Events such as the Tito Stalin split and Berlin Blockade prompted stricter control While the Bloc persisted through revolts such as the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia its command economies experienced inefficiencies and stagnation preceding the Blocs dissolution 

Truthiness is a word used by Stephen Colbert It was first used on October 17 2005 in the first episode of the television show The Colbert Report The word is used to describe something that feels truthful Facts and logic have nothing to do with truthiness The truthiness of something is only measured by it instinctively feeling correct

The word was picked as the word of the year for 2005 by the American Dialect Society on January 6 2006 It was also selected by the Merriam Webster dictionary on December 10 2006 as its 2006 Word of the Year It beat the term google to get Word of the Year

On the October 5 2005 Cobert Report Stephen Colbert has this to say about truthiness

A multi core CPU is a computer processor which has two or more sections Each section of the chip executes instructions as if it was a separate computer The actual processors are still on one chip On this chip every core looks mostly like the other They are several mostly independent cores which work together in parallel A dual core processor is a multi core processor with two independent microprocessors A quad core processor is a multi core processor with four independent microprocessors As you can see the name of the processor is based on the number of the microprocessors on the chip

Until 2005 single core processors outnumbered multi core processorsfact In the years before there were only multi core solutions used in individual casesfact In the majority of cases they enhanced the frequency But at a frequency about 4 GHz the CPU would get too hot and take a lot of electricity This was the point when multi core processors became more important Therefore the demand for multi core processors increased In the second half of 2006 the best processors were dual core processors Since 2006 the development has gone on so that the new processors get four or more independent microprocessors Today single core processors are not used in new personal computers But they remain popular in embedded systems 

In the next years the trend will go to multi core processors more and more The main reason is that they are faster than single core processors and they can be still improved But in the future there will be still some applications for single core processors because not every system needs a fast processor

The Western Bloc during the Cold War means the powers allied with the United States and NATO against the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact 

Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact were called the Eastern Bloc This term was rather common while the governments and press of the Western Bloc used to speak of themselves as the Free world 

The Free World is a term that was used during the era of the Cold War It was often used by non communist nations to describe themselves It was used to describe the greater personal freedom that the people of non communist countries had compared to the Soviet Union and its East European allies 

On the other hand many of the non communist countries that were allied with the Free World during the Cold War repressed people and sometimes had dictators as their leaders This included countries in South America Asia and Africa

The President of the United States was often called the leader of the Free World This was very common especially in the United States itself The President of the US is sometimes still called this

Neil Young sang a song called Rockin in the Free World

The Warsaw Pact or Warsaw Treaty Organization was officially named the Treaty of Friendship Co operation and Mutual Assistance and was an organization of Central and Eastern European Communist states 

It was established in 1955 in Warsaw Poland against the NATO The Pact lasted till the end of the Cold War when some members left in 1991 following the collapse of the Eastern bloc and political changes in the Soviet Union The treaty was signed in Warsaw on May 14 1955 and official copies were made in the languages of Russian Polish Czech and German

All the Communist states of Central and Eastern Europe signed except Yugoslavia

Central Europe is the region around Carpathian Mountains lying between the areas of Eastern and Western Europe In addition Northern Southern and Southeastern Europe mean different regions but in some way they may or overlap into Central Europe 

The term has come back into fashion since the end of the Cold War which had divided Europe politically into East and West with the Iron Curtain splitting Central Europe in half The understanding of the concept of Central Europe varies considerably from nation to nation and also has from time to time

The region usually means

Microraptor was a small feathered dinosaur related to Velociraptor It had flight feathers and could glide and fly About two dozen well preserved fossil specimens have been recovered from Liaoning China They are from the Lower Cretaceous Jiufotang Formation 125 million years old 

Adult specimens are 4283 centimeters long so Microraptor was one of the smallest dinosaurs

Microraptor is one of a number of dinobirds found in the same area of China They were buried in volcanic ash during huge eruptions

Microraptor was among the first non avian dinosaurs discovered with the impressions of feathers and wings Three specimens of M zhaoianus have been described in detail in addition to two specimens of M gui and three specimens of M sp described by Xu and colleagues in 2003 from which most feather impressions are known

Unusual even among early birds and feathered dinosaurs Microraptor is one of the few known bird precursors to sport long flight feathers on its feet as well as its forearms and hands This led Xu Xing to describe it as a four winged dinosaur and to speculate that it may have glided using all four limbs for lift Their bodies had a thick covering of feathers A diamond shaped fan on the end of the tail gave stability during flight 

Sankar Chatterjee found that in order for Microraptor to glide or fly the fore and hind wings must have been on different levels and not overlaid Using this biplane model he calculated possible methods of gliding and determined that Microraptor most likely launched itself from a perch swooped downward in a deep U shaped curve and then lifted again to land on another tree The feathers not directly employed in the biplane wing like those on the tibia and the tail could have been used to control and alter the flight path The hind wings would also have helped control the gliding flight 

Chatterjee also used computer algorithms to test whether or not Microraptor was capable of true powered flight in addition to gliding The data showed that Microraptor could sustain some level powered flight so it is possible that the animal flew as well as glided

Orange can mean

Places in South Africa

Other places in the world

An orange is a type of citrus fruit which people often eat Oranges are a very good source of vitamins especially vitamin C Orange juice is an important part of many peoples breakfast The sweet orange which is the kind that are most often eaten today grew first in Asia but now grows in many parts of the world 

Oranges are round orange coloured fruit that grow on a tree which can reach 10 metres high Orange trees have dark green shiny leaves and small white flowers with five petals The flowers smell very sweet which attracts many bees 

An orange has a tough shiny orange skin Inside the fruit is divided into segments which have thin tough skins that hold together many little sections with juice inside There are usually ten segments in an orange but sometimes there are more Inside each segment of most types of orange there are seeds called pips Orange trees can be grown from pips but some types of orange trees can only be grown from cuttings The segments and the skin are separated by white stringy stuff called pith In most types of oranges the skin can be peeled off the pith and the segments can be pulled apart with the fingers to be eaten In some oranges it is hard to take the skin off With mandarin oranges the skin pith and segments can all be pulled apart very easily Orange skin is often called orange peel 

Oranges are an important food source in many parts of the world for several reasons They are a commonly available source of vitamin C The juice is a refreshing drink They last longer than many other fruits when they are stored They are easy to transport because each orange comes in its own tough skin which acts as a container They can be piled into heaps or carried in bags lunchboxes and shipping containers without being easily damaged

The colour orange takes its name from the fruit The word orange is unusual because it is one of only a few English words that does not rhyme with anything

Sweet orange trees were brought to Italy Spain and Portugal from India in the fifteenth century Before that time only sour oranges were grown in Italy From Europe orange trees were taken to the United States South America Africa and Australia which all grow oranges for sale 

There are several different types of sweet orange One of the most common types is called the Valencia orange which comes from Spain and is also grown in Africa and Australia It is one of the most important commercial oranges 

One type of sweet orange is called the blood orange or sanguine orange These oranges often have red marks on the skin and some parts of the inside look as if they have blood in them Some blood oranges make juice that is ruby red

In the 1850s in Brazil there was a tree growing in a monastery garden that made very strange fruit Inside each orange skin there was a large orange with no seeds At the bottom of the orange was a baby orange which was really the bigger oranges twin The little orange made a strange bump at the bottom of the orange skin that looked just like a human belly button These oranges were named Navel Oranges They tasted very sweet they had no seeds and they peeled quite easily This made them a very good orange to grow commercially But they could not grow from seed They could only grow from cuttings Nowadays thousands of these orange trees have been planted from cuttings Navel Oranges are grown in California and exported to many countries of the world Every navel orange in the world has the same genetic make up as the oranges on that tree in the monastery in Brazil 

Mandarins small flattened oranges with skins that come off easily are believed to have come from China Now there are several varieties These include tangerines which are redder than most mandarins and clementines which are large smooth and plump Mandarins of all sorts are very useful lunchbox fruit because they are easy to peel and eat but do not get squashed easily 

Nowadays many people of the world eat an orange or drink orange juice every day because oranges are one of the best and cheapest sources of Vitamin C Human bodies unlike many other animals do not manufacture Vitamin C so a human needs vitamin C in their diet regularly Oranges are also a very good source of dietary fibre But they do not contain high amounts of minerals If a person eats an orange and a banana together then they have had a very nourishing snack that supplies both vitamins and minerals

The Diplodocus was a long necked whip tailed giant and could grow up to 27 m long It had an 8 m long neck and 14 m long tail Its weight was approximately 22680 kg It had a short 6 ft long head Its size helped protect it from other dinosaurs It used its long neck to poke into forests because its body was too big It is also believed to have knocked the trees down

Diplodocus skeletons are among the longest dinosaur skeletons ever found Fossils were discovered in Western North America particularly in the Rocky Mountains of the western USA A complete tail has never been found

Seismosaurus was thought to be its own species of dinosaur In 2004 and 2006 it was decided to be a large species of Diplodocus It is now known as Diplodocus hallorum

Onions are vegetables They are plants in the genus Allium When people talk about onions they usually mean garden onions Onions have bulbs which are edible in most species They have a strong flavour and a very distinctive smell 

Onions have been grown for a very long time They were probably first grown in Ancient Egypt together with leek and garlic but maybe earlier Now most of the worlds cultures eat onions

Farmers and gardeners can grow onions from seeds or from bulbs If they plant seeds they must later pull out most of the young plants so the rest can grow better This is called thinning Or they can plant young bulbs This is faster but the onions that grow this way are weaker than the onions that started as seeds

Onions can be eaten in different ways Fried onions are often served with hot dogs Pickled onions are eaten with chips or with salad Raw onions are sliced for hamburgers Chopped onions are put in many stews and curries Onions are sometimes roasted whole

When you cut an onion you open some cells Then some chemicals can react When one chemical floats through the air and reaches your eyes they sting There are ways to keep the chemical away You can

A bacteriophage is a virus that infects bacteria The term is commonly shortened to phage

Bacteriophages are similar to viruses that infect eukaryotes in that there are many different kinds of structures and functions Bacteriophages are typically made of an outer protein hull that has genetic material inside it The genetic material can be ssRNA dsRNA ssDNA or double stranded DNA between 5 and 500 kilo base pairs long with either circular or linear arrangement Bacteriophages are usually between 20 and 200 nanometers in size

Deconstruction is a way of understanding how something was created usually things like art books poems and other writing Deconstruction is breaking something down into smaller parts Deconstruction looks at the smaller parts that were used to create an object The smaller parts are usually ideas 

Sometimes deconstruction looks at how an author can imply things he does not mean It says that because words are not precise we can never know what an author meant

Sometimes deconstruction looks at the things the author did not say because he made assumptions 

One thing it pays attention to is how opposites work It says that two opposites like good and bad are not really different things Good only makes sense when someone compares it to bad and bad only makes sense when someone compares it to good And so even when someone talks about good they are still talking about bad But this is just one thing it does

Because of things like this deconstruction argues that books and poems never just mean what we think they mean at first Other meanings are always there too and the book or poem works because all of those meanings work together The closer we look at the writing the more we find about how it works and how meaning works for all things If we deconstructed everything we might never be able to talk or write at all But that does not mean deconstruction is useless If we deconstruct some things we can learn more about them and about how talking and writing work

Deconstruction works because words are slippery Reading is like trying to hold a wet fish because the meanings are all different Jacques Derrida calls this slippage along the chain of signifiers

There is no way to explain what a deconstructionist is or does However some people who were very close to Derrida are usually called deconstructionists These are people like Helene Cixous and Jean Luc Nancy If someone really deconstructed everything he or she could not talk or think Instead there are people who deconstruct things Jacques Derrida began deconstructing things in the 1960s but he was not the first Martin Heidegger had talked about deconstruction in 1927 with Being and Time but he used the word Destruktion Heidegger might even say that he got the idea from Ancient Greek Philosophers like Plato and Aristotle Other important people who talked about it include Paul de Man and Judith Butler

Nihilism is the belief that values are falsely invented The term nihilism can also be used to describe the idea that life or the world has no distinct meaning or purpose Nihilists believe that there are no true morals

Most people think of Friedrich Nietzsche when they think about nihilism because he said that morals were invented Even people who know about Nietzsche call him a nihilist But in his books Nietzsche said that people needed to create their own morals to get over nihilism Other than him not many famous philosophers are considered nihilists However it is still an important belief for philosophy

Apart from Nietzsche a popular text which draws heavily on nihilism is the novel Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky

Coronary heart disease also called coronary artery disease is a progressive reduction of blood to the heart muscle because of the narrowing of the coronary artery It is caused by a build up of atheromatous plaques inside the arteries that deliver blood to the myocardium Most people with coronary heart disease can look well for years before they start experiencing symptoms often a heart attack If it goes untreated some of the atheromatous plaques might break away and block the blood flow to the heart Coronary heart disease is the most common cause of sudden death and it is also the most common cause of death in people over 65 years old Men are 10 times more likely to suffer from coronary heart disease than womenYet it kills a lot of people

Impairment of heart function due to the blood flow to the heart compared to its needs caused by obstruction changes in coronary circulation of the heart 

Atherosclerosis is a form of cardiovascular disease It is where fatty materials build up in the arteries constricting blood flow due to a blood clot The artery walls also constrict due to the presence of foam cell These are created when Low Density Lipoproteins diffuse through the artery walls and become oxidised by free radicals White blood cells then try to ingest the oxidised cholesterol which creates the foam cells

If a complete blockage of an artery occurs then this prevents cells from receiving oxygen and nutrients and the cells will die This is bad in any case but especially if it happens in the coronary arteries This will result in a section of the heart dying and a myocardial infraction may occur 

Atherosclerosis

Fructose is a simple sugar found in many foods It is also one of the three most important blood sugars the other two being glucose and galactose Honey tree fruits berries melons and some root vegetables such as beets sweet potatoes parsnips and onions contain fructose usually with sucrose and glucose

Peer pressure is a force that happens within a group of people It often happens to children during puberty The group defines some social values For somebody to stay cool in that group they feel as if they have to act like other people in that group  Social pressure leads people to do things they would not do otherwise  For example it can make a person to smoke cigarettes or marijuana to drink alcohol commit crimes andor many other things

In biology a cuticle is something that covers the outside of living things called organisms Cuticles are usually tough but also bendable In plants cuticles in the leaves help it from losing to much water by evaporation

Leek is a vegetable It belongs to the same genus as the onion and garlic It can be used for cooking

A great power is a nation or state that is able to influence other states in most of the world That is possible because it has great economic political and military strength Its opinions are taken into account by other nations before taking diplomatic or military action Characteristically they have the ability to intervene militarily almost anywhere and they also have soft cultural power often in the form of economic investment in less developed portions of the world

The Great powers today are thought to be

A bite is a wound received from the teeth of an animal Animals may bite things in self defence Animals also bite things to cut them into smaller pieces before they eat them

Bites can cause many medical problems such as

Bite wounds should be washed ideally with povidone iodine soap and water The injury should then be loosely wrapped with a bandage Open bite wounds are not sutured because of the risk of infection

Animal bites caused by carnivores may infect the victim with rabies if the animal that bit them carries it If possible the animal is caught and the head is looked at for signs of rabies Signs of rabies include foaming at the mouth self mutilation growling jerky behaviour and red eyes If the animal lives for ten days and does not develop rabies then the animal probably is not infected In cases where the animal cannot be found prophylactic rabies treatment is carried out in most places

Many of the worlds snakes are not considered dangerous to humans but even a bite from a safe snake may injure the victim if the wound is not treated properly and large snakes such as constrictors are capable of causing a lot of damage with their bites

The black widow spider and some scorpions are considered dangerous to humans mostly to small children and elderly adults Only the Sydney funnel web spider of Australia is frequently dangerous to adults and it lives only within 100 miles of Sydney Antivenins are available in the United States for black widow spiders and the dangerous scorpions native to the region

Northern Europe is the northern part of the European continent Most people see the following states as part of it

Before the 19th century the term Nordic or Northern was commonly used to mean Northern Europe in a sense that included the Nordic countries European Russia the Baltic countries and Greenland

In earlier eras when Europe was dominated by the Mediterranean region everything not near this sea was termed Northern Europe including Germany the Low Countries and Austria In medieval times the term Thule was used to mean a semi mythical place in the extreme northern reaches of the continent

In a European Union context Denmark Sweden Finland Germany Belgium and the Netherlands are often seen as belonging to a Northern group

Western Europe in the first place is a geographic region of Europe and includes the following eleven countries

During the Cold War Western Europe was mainly a socio political concept and meant the European countries of the First World It was distinguished from Eastern Europe by differences of economics politics and religion rather than by clear geography 

Today the term Western Europe has less to do with geography and more to do with economics The concept is also commonly associated with liberal democracy capitalism and also with the European Union Most of the countries in the region share Western culture and many have economic and political ties with countries in North and South America and Oceania In addition Scandinavia is commonly associated with social democracy and remains fairly neutral throughout international disputes

A Furnace is a device used for heating The word has two different meanings though

Southern Europe is a region of the European continent Most people see Spain Portugal Italy and Greece and over all the Mediterranean countries of the European continent as parts of Southern Europe Very often the South of France is also included 

Geographically Southern Europe would be the south half of the landmass of Europe This definition is relative with no clear limits The Alps mountains are a physical barrier between Italy and the rest of Europe

For its official works and publications the United Nations Organization has its own special definition of regions As it counts always the whole state Corsica as part of France is not part of Southern European but Italian Tyrol belongs to it as it is part of Italy

The climatic definition of southern Europe would be similar to the areas of Mediterranean climate The Mediterranean climate is often thought to be a typical characteristic of Southern Europe 

Countries of Latin Europe are often associated with the concept of Southern Europe especially Southwest Europe Greece and the Balkan nations are often associated with them in the concept of Southern Europe especially Southeast Europe

Although there is no precise definition the following territories are commonly thought to be parts of Southern Europe

Corsica is the fourth largest island in the Mediterranean Sea It is located west of Italy southeast of France and north of the island of Sardinia Corsica is one of the 26 esteemed rgions of France and always has been Some people want Corsica to be a part of Italy Corsica has more power to do what it wants instead of listening to France but loves France so much that it decides not to much like the other rgions Corsica is referred to as a rgion 

Corsica is famous in the world for the beautiful places for tourism and as the birthplace of Napolon Bonaparte

Corsica has 1000 km of coastline and more than 200 beaches and is very mountainous with Monte Cinto as the highest peak at 2706m and 20 other peaks of more than 2000m

Big towns

Other towns and villages

Corsica is the most mountainous Mediterranean island The island has a Mediterranean climate with hot dry summers and mild rainy winters The natural vegetation is Mediterranean forests woodlands and shrubs The mountains are cooler and are rich of forests of oak and pine Much of the coastal lowlands has been cleared for agriculturewhich has reduced the mountain forests considerably The island has a natural park which protects thousands of rare animal and plant species The park was created in 1972 and includes the Golfe de Porto the Rserve Naturelle de Scandola and some of the highest mountains on the island This park is protected

The capital of the territorial collectivity of Corsica is Ajaccio The territorial collectivity is divided in two dpartements Corse du Sud and Haute Corse These two dpartements were created on September 15 1975 by the dpartement of Corse

Tourism is the biggest source of Corsican economy The island has a pleasant climate beautiful mountains and really beautiful coastlines that make it a popular destination among the French and other Western Europeans However the island has not had the same level of intensive development as other parts of the Mediterranean Tourism is particularly concentrated in the area around Porto Vecchio and Bonifacio in the south of the island and Calvi in the northwest

Corsica is currently governed almost as any other rgion of France There are lots of movements on the island the independence of Corsica and of Corsicans from France The French government is against full independence There is support on the island for to have more autonomy but polls show that a large majority of Corsicans are opposed to full independence Some groups who claim to support Corsican independence have carried out a violent campaign since the 1970s that includes bombings and a few accidental assassinations usually against pieds noirs and other non Corsicans or buildings of the French government Corsican independence groups attack when they are sure there wont be a danger for victims However not all groups for independence has nice treaties Sometimes independence groups are known to practice extortion and other intimidatory tactics similar to mafia activity in Sicily and southern Italy Non Corsican homeowners may be threatened with the destruction of their home or they are constrict to pay a revolutionarian taxfor to help the groups in the attacks

In 2000 Prime Minister Lionel Jospin agreed to give more autonomy to Corsica but just for stopping the violence The propose of autonomy for Corsica would have included greater protection for the Corsican language the islands traditional language However the plans for increased autonomy were opposed by the Gaullist opposition in the French National Assembly In a referendum on July 62003 a narrow majority of Corsican voters opposed to the project from the government of Jean Pierre Raffarin and Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy that would have suppressed the two dpartements of the island and granted more autonomy to the territorial collectivity of Corsica

In Corsica the official language is French but lots of people speak u corsu a dialect of Corsica protected by UNESCO Corsu is not so different to the Tuscan dialects or to Gallurese language spoken in the near by island of Sardinia Corsu has two varietes Supranacciu common in the north east of island and the Suttanacciu common in the south of the island The native Corsican language is closer to Italian than French but both come from Latin The ancient Romans spoke Latin

In Corsica football is a very common sport The island has in the first league of France 2 teams The AC Ajaccio and the SC Bastia Another very famous sport in Corsica is volleyball with the GFCO Ajaccio Volley Ball team

A maser is a device that produces light and heat by using atoms to release energy A maser takes the small vibrations in atoms and amplifies them to release light and heat Originally they were referred to by the acronym MASER or Microwave Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation Unlike most radio transmitters maser waves tend to have very similar wavelengths Their usage was first predicted by Albert Einstein but they were not used until the 1960s

The World Wide Web Consortium is an organization created by Sir Tim Berners Lee in order to continue the development of the web and its languages Tim Berners Lee also wants to make standards for the languages and to improve them As of 2 April 2010 the World Wide Web Consortium has 328 Members

This is a list of pterosaurs

Deinonychus was a medium sized theropod dinosaur of the Dromeosaur family It was a larger relative of the famous Velociraptor

This 34 meter long dinosaur lived during the Lower Cretaceous about 115 108 million years ago Fossils have been recovered from the US states of Montana Wyoming and Oklahoma

Deinonychus has been described as the single most important discovery of dinosaur paleontology in the mid 20th century

Paleontologist John Ostroms study of Deinonychus in the late 1960s started the debate on whether dinosaurs were warm blooded It is now accepted that all or most smaller theropods had feathers whose function was temperature regulation 

Ostrom noted the small body sleek horizontal posture andespeciallythe enlarged claws on the feet which suggested an active agile predator Before this the popular idea of dinosaurs had been one of plodding reptilian giants

Deinonychus means Terrible claw This refers to the large sickle shaped claw bone on the second toe of each hind foot In life archosaurs have a horny sheath over this bone which extends the length Ostrom reconstructed the claw as over convert120mmin long 

The species name antirrhopus means counter balance which refers to Ostroms idea about the function of the tail As in other dromaeosaurids the tail vertebrae have a series of ossified tendons and super long bone processes These features seemed to make the tail into a stiff counterbalance

A fossil of the very closely related Velociraptor mongoliensis has an articulated tail skeleton that is curved laterally in a long Sshape This suggests that in life the tail could swish to the sides with some flexibility

Deinonychus remains have been found closely associated with those of the ornithopod Tenontosaurus Teeth discovered associated with Tenontosaurus specimens imply it was hunted or at least scavenged upon by Deinonychus

A Cheerleader is a person who does cheerleading or leads cheers for sporting events or during competition This is usually done as a group It is done to keep the spirit of a sports team up 

This sport is originally from the United States It was first seen in the beginning of the 1900s It was and is still used to support a local sports group 

Because of the athletic ability often needed in cheerleading many people think cheerleading is a sport Cheerleaders perform routines that include dancing tumbling cheering stunting and jumping Cheerleading teams can compete in competitions against other cheer teams as well as perform for different sporting events

The My Opera Community is a virtual community which provides help and social networking services for people who use the Opera browser

The My Opera Community started in August 2001 It currently has over 1000000 members who are from all over the world

Permanent used as an adjective usually means that something is very hard to get rid of or destroy Permanent may also mean other things

Linen is a material made from the fibers of the flax plant It is usually used to make cloth

It is often used in the creation of light clothing and table coverings 

The flax plant is one of the plants humans have grown and used Linen cloth was already made at least 6000 years ago in Egypt and Mesopotamia This makes linen one of the oldest fibers and cloths used by humans besides wool and hemp Linen and hemp were the most important fiber plants in Europe for a long time Linen was for example also used to wrap Egyptian mummies

Hieroglyphs are a type of writing which use symbols or pictures to stand for sounds and words The Egyptians Luwians and Mayan cultures used hieroglyphs They have also been found in Turkey Crete United States and Canada They are thought to have started when pictures were used to tell stories on pots and other artwork Over time they became letters The word hieroglyph comes from the Greek words and and was first used to mean the Egyptian hieroglyphs The Greeks who came to Egypt saw the picture letters which were often found carved on house walls tombs and monuments 

Ancient Egyptians used pictures to make a phonetic alphabet so that each sound could be written with a picture word a phonogram or pictograph For example a zig zag for water n came to mean the letter n because the Egyptian word for water started with n This same picture became our letter M in the Latin alphabet because the Semitic word for water started with m and Semitic workers changed the symbols to fit sounds in their own language In the same way our Latin letter N came from the hieroglyph for snake D as the word for snake started with n in Semitic In Egyptian this picture had stood for a sound like English J because of their word for snake Some pictures came to represent ideas and these are known as ideograms

The Egyptians used between 700 and 800 pictures or glyphs They were written from right to left and from top to bottom They did not use punctuation

Archaeologists believe that the Egyptians began using hieroglyphs about 3300 or 3200 BC They were in use for more than 3500 years Most Egyptians did not write in hieroglyphs it was only the nobles priests and government official who used them They were hard to learn and took a long time to write People stopped using hieroglyphs when Christianity took hold in Egypt Writing in hieroglyphs grew more rare with the last known inscription made in 396 BCE

After the end of the Egyptian civilization in 30 BC people no longer knew how to read the hieroglyphs When the French took over Eypyt in 1798 French soldiers found a large stone This is now called the Rosetta Stone The Rosetta Stone had writing in three different languages One language was hieroglyphs one was Ancient Greek and the third was demotic a simplified form of hieroglyphs Jean Franois Champollion guessed that the writing on the stone was the same but in three languages By using the Ancient Greek he was able to work out the name of the ruler Ptolemy V in hieroglyphs After many years study he was able to work out how to read the other words 

Papyrus is a kind of paper that the Ancient Egypt Modern Nubians used for writing It was made from a kind of reed called cyperus papyrus

Papyrus plants grow 2 3m tall They were first used in Ancient Egypt but they were also used throughout the Mediterranean region The Egyptians also used the papyrus plants to make boats mattresses mats rope sandals and baskets

Sodium hypochlorite is an unstable compound composed of sodium and hypochlorite ions It is stable in solution though It is light green and has the chemical formula NaClO It is a strong oxidizing agent It is used to disinfect and as a bleach to remove stains from clothing It is not good for cotton because the sodium hydroxide normally contained eats away the clothing fibers It reacts with acids to produce chlorine

Raisins are dried grapes They contain a lot of sugar

Taste buds are small bumps on the tongue They are the sense organs which detect the taste of things that go into the mouth They are involved in detecting the five elements of taste perception salty sour bitter sweet and umami

Nectar in botany is a liquid made by the flowers of plants It is very sweet because it has a lot of sugar in it Plants make nectar to attract pollinating animals It is made in glands called nectaries The Nectaries are usually at the bottom of the perianth This means the animal trying to get the nectar have to touch the parts of the plant that are used for reproduction By doing this the animal getting the nectar helps the plants reproduce Some plants make nectar outside the flower These plants do it to attract predatory insects These insects will eat both the nectar and any plant eating insects found near the plant

Nectar is economically important because it is where the sugar for honey comes from It is also useful in agriculture and horticulture because the adults of many predatory insects as well as hummingbirds eat nectar Nectar from fruits can also be drank by people

A hunting dog is any dog who helps humans in hunting There are several types of hunting dogs The major categories of hunting dog include hounds terriers curs type dogs and gun dogs These categories have smaller groups in them that are based on different things the dogs are good at doing

Purebred dogs are dogs whose ancestors are all the same breed

A breed of dog is a particular subspecies that has been bred through time to exhibit certain characteristics for example a bulldog is bred to be short and have a flat nose while a greyhound is bred to be light and run fast Some dogs are bred to look special which is why poodles have fluffy hair

Mass Transit Railway or MTR is the main rapid transit railway system in Hong Kong Since the MTR service first opened in 1979 the network has grown to 150 stations Built and run by MTR Corporation Limited the MTR system is a very popular mode of public transport in Hong Kong with around 246 million passengers riding each day

Hong Kongs growing economy caused a lot of traffic problems Hong Kong government made a study of these problems The first line was opened in 1979 The MTR was popular quickly with the people of Hong Kong so later they built more lines to cover more ground People are still arguing about how and where to expand the MTR network next

During the 1960s the government of Hong Kong thought they need to accommodate increasing road traffic that growing Hong Kongs economy would bring British transport consultants Freeman Fox Wilbur Smith Associates were appointed to study the transport system of Hong Kong The consultants released the Hong Kong Mass Transport Study in September 1967 which proposed the construction of a mass transport underground railway system in Hong Kong

In 1970 an underground network with four lines was laid out and planned as part of the British consultants new report Hong Kong Mass Transit Further Studies The four lines were to be the Kwun Tong Line Tsuen Wan Line Island Line and East Kowloon Line However the lines that were eventually constructed were somewhat different compared with the lines that were originally proposed by the Hong Kong Mass Transport Study

In 1972 the Hong Kong government authorised construction of the Initial System a 20 km system that roughly translates to the Kwun Tong Line today Negotiations with four major construction consortia started in 1973 The governments intention was to tender the entire project based on the British design as a single tender at a fixed price A consortium from Japan signed an agreement to construct the system in early 1974 but in December of the same year it pulled out from the agreement stemming from fears of the Arab oil crisis

Several weeks later in early 1975 a government agency known as the Mass Transport Provisional Authority was established to take charge of the project It announced that the Initial System would be slightly reduced to 156 kilometres and renamed it the Modified Initial System Plans for a single contract were also abandoned in favour of 25 engineering contracts and 10 electrical and mechanical contracts

In addition the government owned Hong Kong Mass Transit Railway Corporation was established to replace the Mass Transport Provisional Authority

Construction of the Modified Initial System commenced in November 1975 After almost four years the northern section was completed on 30 September 1979 On 1 October 1979 the northern section was opened with trains running from Shek Kip Mei to Kwun Tong The route from Tsim Sha Tsui to Shek Kip Mei was opened in December of the same year

In 1980 the first harbour crossing was made by an MTR train as the Kwun Tong Line was extended even farther to Chater station now known as Central station To deal with increasing patronage trains were also extended to six cars

The government approved construction of the Tsuen Wan Line in 1977 then known as Tsuen Wan Extension and works commenced in November 1978 The project added a 105 kilometre section to the MTR system from Prince Edward to Tsuen Wan The line started service on 10 May 1982 with a total cost of construction at HK41 billion

When service of this line started the section of the Kwun Tong Line from Chater to Argyle present day Mong Kok station was transferred to the Tsuen Wan Line Thus Waterloo became the terminus of the Kwun Tong Line and both Argyle and Prince Edward stations became interchange stations This change was made because system planners expected traffic of the Tsuen Wan Line would exceed that of the Kwun Tong Line This forecast proved quite accurate necessitating a bypass from the northwestern New Territories to Hong Kong Island Launched in 1998 the Tung Chung Line serves exactly that purpose

Although land acquisitions were made for a station at Tsuen Wan West the station was never built This is not to be confused with Tsuen Wan West Station on KCR West Rail which lies on the newly reclaimed area near the former ferry pier

It is interesting to note that since the lines opening in 1982 this is the only line whose alignment has virtually remained the same for the past 23 years For example the Kwun Tong Lines alignment has changed for 2 times since its opening  the taking over of Tsuen Wan Line from Mong Kok to Central and the taking over of Eastern Harbour Crossing section by the Tseung Kwan O Line

Government approvals were granted for construction of the Island Line in December 1980 Construction commenced in October 1981 On 31 May 1985 the Island Line was opened with service between Admiralty and Chai Wan stations Both Admiralty and Central stations became interchange stations with the Tsuen Wan Line Furthermore each train was extended to eight cars

On 23 May 1986 service reached Sheung Wan station Construction for this station was delayed for one year as government offices which sat on top of the station had to be removed to a new location before construction could start

In 1984 the government approved the construction of the Eastern Harbour Crossing a tunnel to be used by cars and MTR trains The Kwun Tong Line was extended across the harbour to Quarry Bay which became an interchange station for the Kwun Tong Line and the Island Line The extension was launched on 5 August 1989 An intermediate station Lam Tin started operations on 1 October 1989

The decision was made in October 1989 to construct a new international airport at Chek Lap Kok on Lantau Island to replace the overcrowded Kai Tak International Airport The government invited the MTR to build a train line then known as the Lantau Airport Railway to the airport But construction did not begin until the Chinese and British governments settled their financial and land disagreements in November 1994

In the end the new line was included in the financing plans of the new Hong Kong International Airport as the airport was not considered viable without direct public transport links Construction costs were also shared by the MTR which was granted many large scale developments in the construction plans for the new stations

The Lantau Airport Railway turned into two MTR lines the Tung Chung Line and the Airport Express The Tung Chung Line was officially opened on 21 June 1998 by Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa and service commenced the next day The Airport Express opened for service on 6 July 1998 along with the new Hong Kong International Airport

The Airport Express line is the second most popular means of transport to the Hong Kong International Airport In 2005 22 of the commuters took the Airport Express to and from the airport 

The Quarry Bay Congestion Relief Works involved extending the Hong Kong Island end of the Kwun Tong Line from Quarry Bay to North Point via a 42kilometre tunnel The project was initiated due to overcrowding at Quarry Bay and persistent passenger complaints about the five minute walk from the Island Line platforms to the Kwun Tong Line platform Construction began in September 1997 and was completed in September 2001 at a cost of HK30 billion The tried and true cross platform interchange arrangement is repeated here

Construction of the Tseung Kwan O Line was approved on 18 August 1998 to serve new housing developments Construction began on 24 April 1999 and the line officially opened in 2002 taking over the train tracks running through the Eastern Harbour Tunnel from the Kwun Tong Line running from Po Lam to North Point When the line was opened the Kwun Tong Line was diverted to Tiu Keng Leng on the new line Construction costs were partly covered by the Hong Kong Government and private developers which linked construction of the Tseung Kwan O Line to new real estate and commercial developments Previously less developed areas were opened up for development with more transport options

While the construction of the Tung Chung Line was still underway the plan to build a railway corridor serving the northwestern New Territories was conceived Space had been reserved for the addition of an interchange station and two extra tracks between Olympic and Lai King Originally known as the Airport Railway Phase 2 the contracts of the West Rail Line Interface Works were awarded shortly after construction works of the West Rail commenced The project comprised Mei Foo Interchange modification of the existing Mei Foo station on the Tsuen Wan Line to provide a pedestrian link to the West Rail Line Mei Foo Station Nam Cheong Station and quadruplication works

The works were completed in stages The Tung Chung Line trains have been diverted to the new track since mid May 2003 whereas the Mei Foo station interchange subway and the Nam Cheong station were opened at the same time the West Rail Line opened for public use in December 2003 The Kowloon Southern Link extension from Nam Cheong Station to East Tsim Sha Tsui Station was opened on 16 August 2009 with West Rail Line trains now terminating at Hung Hom Station interchange station for East Rail Line

The interchange between the Tsuen Wan Line and the Kwun Tong Line the Island Line and the Tseung Kwan O Line as well as that between the Kwun Tong Line and the Tseung Kwan O Line are two stations long allowing cross platform interchange wherein a passenger leaves a train on one side of the platform and boards trains on the other side of the platform for another line For example when passengers are travelling on the Kwun Tong Line towards Tiu Keng Leng getting off at Yau Tong would allow them to switch trains across the platform for the Tseung Kwan O Line towards North Point Whereas staying on the train and reaching Tiu Keng Leng would allow them to board the Tseung Kwan O Line trains towards Po LamLOHAS Park This design makes interchanging more convenient and passengers do not have the need to change to different levels However this interchange arrangement is not available for all transferring passengers at Kowloon Tong Central Hong Kong Nam Cheong Mei Foo Tai Wai Station and Sunny Bay stations mainly because this service is available only when there are two continuous stations shared as interchange stations by two lines

Two major works were undertaken to facilitate interchange between Kwun Tong Line and East Rail Line The modification of Kowloon Tong Station started in June 2001 A new pedestrian link to Kowloon Tong Station southern concourse and a new entrance were opened on 15 April 2004 to cope with the increase in interchange passenger flow Modification to Tsim Sha Tsui Station involved upgrading station facilities and concourse layout to facilitate access from the East Tsim Sha Tsui Station via its pedestrian links New entrances to the subway links were opened on 19 September 2004 and 30 March 2005 with the whole scheme completed in May 2005

The Ma On Shan Line was constructed by the KCR to serve Ma On Shan and City One residential areas and operation of the line was outsourced to the MTR The system mostly runs on a viaduct between the middle of roads with stations stopping right next to major buildings The only time the trains dont run on viaducts is when the railway meets the route 2 highway where it runs in the middle and then raises back to a viaduct The railway is slightly different from all other Hong Kong railways because the trains run on the right not the left this is so that passengers can easily interchange from the Ma On Shan line to the East Rail Line towards Hong Hum The majority of passengers using the line get off the train at Tai Wai to interchange to the East Rail Line using the line as a feeder route

The Disneyland Resort Line previously known as Pennys Bay Rail Link provides service to the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort which was opened on 12 September 2005 Service to Sunny Bay station on the Tung Chung Line started in 2005 The new line and the Disneyland Resort station opened on 1 August 2005 It is a 35kilometre single track railway that runs between Sunny Bay station and Disneyland Resort station The Disneyland Resort station itself was designed to blend in with the ambience of the resort The line currently operates fully automated trains running every four to ten minutes without a driver and the carriages were changed from the existing M Train rolling stock to match the recreational and adventurous nature of the 35 minute journey

The new AsiaWorld Expo Station is an extension of the Airport Express serving the new international exhibition centre known as the AsiaWorld Expo at Hong Kong International Airport The station opened on 20 December 2005 along with the exhibition centre To cope with the projected increase in patronage Airport Express trains have been expanded to utilise eight carriages from the previous seven Additional trains will also be deployed on the Tung Chung line during major exhibitions and events

On 5 October 2000 the operator of the MTR network MTR Corporation Limited became Hong Kongs first rail company to be privatised marking the beginning of the Hong Kong governments initiative to dissolve its interests in public utilities Prior to its listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange the Mass Transit Railway Corporation was wholly owned by the Hong Kong government The offering involved the sale of about one billion shares and the company now has the largest shareholder base of any company listed in Hong Kong In June 2001 MTRCL was transferred to the Hang Seng Index

MTRCL has often developed properties next to stations to complement its already profitable railway business Many recently built stations were incorporated into large housing estates or shopping complexes For example Tsing Yi station is built next to the Maritime Square shopping centre and directly underneath the Tierra Verde housing estate

On 11 April 2006 MTRCL signed a non binding memorandum of understanding with the Hong Kong government the owner of Kowloon Canton Railway Corporation to merge the operation of the two railway networks in Hong Kong in spite of the strong opposition by the KCRC staff The minority shareholders of the corporation approved the proposal at an extraordinary general meeting on 9 October 2007 allowing MTRCL to take over the operation of the KCR network and combine the fare system of the two networks on 2 December 2007

On 2 December 2007 the Kowloon Canton Railway Corporation granted a 50 year service concession of the KCR network to MTRCL in return for making annual payments to KCRC thereby merging the railway operations of the two corporations under MTRCLs management At the same time MTRCL changed its Chinese name from to but left its English name unchanged After the merger the MTR network included three more lines East Rail Line West Rail Line and Ma On Shan Line as well as the Light Rail network and Guangdong Through Train to Guangzhou

On 28 September 2008 fare zones of all commuter lines which is ex KCR were merged A passenger could travel on these networks with only one ticket except where a transfer is made between Tsim Sha Tsui and East Tsim Sha Tsui stations where two tickets are required Student discounts on Octopus Card were also issued

Various campaigns and activities are taken to help ensure that the MTR is a safe system to travel on Poster campaigns displaying information on topics such as escalator safety are a common sight in all MTR stations and announcements are made regularly as safety reminders to travelling passengers 

Bylaws have been recently introduced to deter potentially dangerous actions on the MTR such as the ban of flammable goods on the MTR and rushing into trains when the doors are closing Penalties ranging from fines to imprisonment have been imposed for such offenses Metallic balloons are also banned due to previous incidents on KCR and on MTRs Island Line where a metallic balloon interfered with the operation of the overhead power lines

Police officers patrol on trains and stations and police posts are available at some stations The Hong Kong Police Force has a Railway District responsible for the MTR and the KCR Closed circuit television cameras are installed in stations

Tung Chung Line the Airport Express and Tseung Kwan O Line except Quarry Bay station had platform screen doors installed upon construction These doors prevent people from falling onto the rails and MTRC allowed the assumption that this implementation was primarily a safety campaign without heavily promoting it directly In fact the primary motivation was to separate the stations from the tunnels hence allowing substantial energy savings on station air conditioning and tunnel ventilation Automatic platform gates have also been installed at the Sunny Bay and Disneyland Resort stations Their heights are half of the PSDs and only prevent people from falling onto the rails

In June 2000 The MTR Corporation proceeded with its plans to retrofit 2960 pairs of platform screen doors at all 30 underground stations on the Kwun Tong Line Tsuen Wan Line and Island Line in a six year programme The programme made MTR the worlds first railway to undertake the retrofitting of PSDs on a passenger carrying system already in operation A prototype design was first introduced at Choi Hung station in the 3rd quarter of 2001 HK010 per passenger trip was levied on Octopus card users to help fund the HK2 billion retrofit programme The whole installation scheme was completed in October 2005 The original completion year was 2006 The MTR Corporation said that part of the cost had to be assumed by passengers

With the high level of daily passenger traffic facilities of MTR stations are built with durability and accessibility in mind The elevators and escalators in stations are heavy duty with the elevators installed by Otis Elevator CompanyFujitec and the escalators installed by Constructions Industrielles de la Mediterrane and Otis Elevator Company

After extensive retrofits the MTR system has become in general disabled friendly the trains have dedicated wheelchair space the stations have special floor tiles to guide the blind safely on the platforms and there are extra wide entry and exit gates for wheelchairs as well

Unlike many other metro systems around the world main line MTR stations do not have toilet facilities although their installation has been contemplated Only stations on the Airport Express and Disneyland Resort Line have access to toilet facilities

The MTR network is unique in its arrangement of interchange stations Interchange stations between the Island Tsuen Wan Kwun Tong and Tseung Kwan O lines are arranged in pairs such an arrangement allows cross platform interchange wherein a passenger leaves a train on one side of the platform and boards trains on the other side of the platform for another line 

Most of those stations make use of a cross platform interchange system where the commuter can change to another line on the opposite platform For example when a person is travelling on the Kwun Tong Line towards Tiu Keng Leng getting off at Yau Tong would allow him to change trains across the platform for the Tseung Kwan O Line towards North Point Whereas staying on the train and reaching Tiu Keng Leng would allow you to change trains for the Tseung Kwan O Line towards Po Lam

This not only makes it more convenient for passengers it also reduces the amount of traffic per station Riders are made aware of the closest connection point by way of in train visual and auditory messages Although riders can disregard these tips the design of the stations are for the convenience of passengers

A full GSM CDMA and TDMA mobile phone network is in place through out the MTR system of stations and tunnels Passengers can stay connected underground

Currently full 3G network coverage in all stations and tunnels for the MTR system has been provided by 3 Hong Kong SmarTone Vodafone and PCCW Mobile Passengers with subscription services will be able to make video calls and access high speed video content on their mobile phones regardless whether the train is above ground or under ground

Until recently MTR stations only had branches of the Hang Seng Bank and Maxims Cakes stores owned by Jardine Matheson and a handful of other shops Since the privatisation of the MTR however numerous shops have been added to certain stations turning them into miniature shopping centres Services available at most stations include

Apart from retailers there are also dentists and medical clinics drycleaners and florists along the Tseung Kwan O Line Standard services include payphones vending machines and self service photo booths

Recruit was the first free magazine which was solely distributed in MTR stations since July 1992 However in July 2002 the contract between the magazine and MTR was terminated Another recruitment magazine Jiu Jik published by South China Morning Post replaced Recruit as the only free recruitment magazine distributed in MTR stations on every Tuesdays and Fridays

At the same time there was another entertainment magazine Hui Kai Guide However it is no longer distributed in MTR stations since 2006

The Metropolis Daily published by Metro International is the first free newspaper distributed free in MTR stations from Monday to Friday and in 2005 there is another weekend newspaper Express Post distributed every Saturday except public holidays

The Metropop also published by Metro International started its distribution in MTR stations every Thursdays since April 27 2006 few months after the termination of Hui Kai Guide It is a weekly magazine featuring cultural affairs and city trends

The Airport Express also offer value added services to travellers on the line Toilets and check in facilities are available at every station on the line A free Airport Express shuttle bus service transports travellers from stations to their respective hotels as well Flight passengers can even have in town check in at the station which offers a more convenient and time saving routine

As of January 2005 there are two different fare classes on the MTR Adult and concessionary Only children below the age of 12 senior citizens 65 years or older or full time Hong Kong students between the ages of 12 and 25 qualify for the concessionary rate Children below the age of 3 travel free

Similar to some other metro systems in the world the fare payable by a passenger depends on the approximate distance travelled However taking any particular station as the origin the other stations fall into fare zones depending on the distance from the origin The fare to all stations in a zone is the same and increases with distance especially if the journey involves a harbour crossing Adult fares range from HK380 to 2600 Concessionary fares are usually half the adult fare and range from HK240 to 1300 Fares for the Airport Express Line are significantly higher

The price of using MTR is very low For example the price of going from Tsing Yi to Causeway Bay by taxi is around HK200 Travelling the same distance by MTR costs HK1180 for grown up people and HK540 for young and very old people People can buy a one way ticket or a Octopus card to enter MTR Octopus card is a contact less smart card

The Octopus card is a rechargeable contactless smart card used in an electronic payment system in Hong Kong It was launched in September 1997 for use on both the MTR and the KCR and now is the most widely used electronic cash system for transactions in Hong Kong as many retailers are fitted with readers

The Octopus card uses radio frequency identification technology so that users need only hold the card in front of the reader Physical contact is not required and the card need not even be taken out because the reader can penetrate through material This fare collection system has been so popular that many cities such as Singapore London Chicago and Taipei have adopted the idea launching their own version of smart cards respectively named EZ link Oyster card and EasyCard

Except for the Airport Express MTR fares are slightly lower when using an Octopus card compared to using single journey tickets For example the cost of the 3 minute journey from Admiralty to Tsim Sha Tsui across the Victoria Harbour is HK79 using the Octopus card compared with HK90 for a single journey ticket

Two types of tourist passes are available one allows unlimited rides for a single day while the other allows three days of unlimited rides on the MTR with a stored value of HK20 refundable deposit of HK50 and choice of either a single or return trip on the Airport Express

Tourists are required to produce proof of tourist status when purchasing the pass and whenever requested by a ticket inspector during spot checks

The magnetic fare card system is used for single journey tickets These tickets are pre paid for between pre determined stations and are good for only one trip There are no return tickets except on the Airport Express 

Fares for the Airport Express are substantially different from main line fares Apart from single tickets same day return tickets and one month return tickets are also available

A one day pass can be used to unlimited travel tofrom Hong Kong Disneyland within the same day and costs HK50 This pass can be purchased from any MTR Customer Service Centres or Airport Express Customer Service Centres

Four variations of rolling stock operate on the MTR on 15kV DC overhead electrification All trains are electric multiple units equipped with ATC and ATP operating on 1432 mm rail gauge Except for the rolling stock of the Airport Express all trains are designed with features to cope with high density passenger traffic on stopping services Examples are the latitudinal seating arrangement additional ventilation fans and 5 doors on each side per car

The Tung Chung Line and the Airport Express use dedicated rolling stock designs specified to their respective lines Initially run in 7 car formations they have now been lengthened to eight cars These two variations are built jointly by Adtranz and Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles between 199497 

The other lines are operated using a mixture of the other two variations known as the M Train and the K Stock The M Stock of M Train are the oldest trains on the MTR built originally by Metro Cammell and refurbished by United Goninan The M Train is the only variation that uses sliding doors as opposed to others which use plug doors The K Stock are built jointly by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and ROTEM and a further order of 32 cars is due to be in service on the Tung Chung Line by 2007

The Disneyland Resort Line uses driverless M Trains with their appearance overhauled to suit the atmosphere and theme of the line Windows on each carriage and the handrails inside are made into the shape of Mickey Mouses head and there are bronze made Disney characters decorating the interior of the carriages

With the objective not only bring MTR passengers more time for life but also more time for art the Art in MTR Initiative has been a success since its reception in 1998 where the Airport Express Artwork Programme was the pioneer project Thereafter live performances art exhibitions display of artwork by established and emerging artists students and young children have been brought into the MTR stations MTR Corporation Limited have even made art part of the station architecture when building new stations or renovating existing ones Artworks are exhibited in different forms on the network including arttube open art gallery community art galleries roving art living art and art in station architecture

Athelstan or thelstan called the Glorious was the first King of England He reigned from 924 to 939 He was the son of King Edward the Elder Athelstans reign is sometimes overlooked but it was of great importance to political developments in the 10th century

Athelstan was the son of Edward the Elder and grandson of Alfred the Great His father succeeded after some difficulty to the Kingdom of the Anglo Saxons formed by Alfred His father had also been the King of Mercia When Edward died Athelstan quickly became King of Mercia but he was not immediately accepted as King of England His borther lfweard had more support in England but died soon after Edward This made it easier for Athelstan to become king

For Athelstan it was very important to have many allies A year after his crowning he married one of his sisters to the Viking King of Northumbria Sithric However Sihtric died only a year later and Athelstan seized Northumbria This move made him king of more land than any other before him roughly the same as modern England Historical records indicate that the other rulers in Great Britain accepted him as king at Bamburgh around this time

Athelstan died at Gloucester in 939 and was succeeded by his half brother Edmund I

Firefly is an American science fiction television series It first aired in the United States and Canada on September 20 2002 It is set in the future but also has many things about it which would be expected in a story of the American Old West This combination of past and future gives a unique science fiction setting for the story It was created by writer and director Joss Whedon creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel He created it with his production company Mutant Enemy Whedon was the executive producer along with Tim Minear

Firefly was first broadcast on the FOX network It was cancelled after only eleven of the fourteen episodes were shown Even though the show did not last long it sold very well when it was released onto DVD and had great fan support Because of this Whedon and Universal Pictures made a movie based on the series titled Serenity The movie was named after the fictional spaceship in the show It won an Emmy in 2003 for Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series 

The series is set in 2517 AD It follows the adventures of the crew of Serenity a Firefly class spaceship The cast play the nine characters who live on Serenity Whedon described the show as nine people looking into the blackness of space and seeing nine different things The show looks at the changing lives of people who fought on the losing side of a civil war It also shows the pioneer culture that is on the edges of their star system It is a future where the only two superpowers the United States and China joined to create a single government This government was called the Alliance This also caused the two cultures to blend into each other Whedon said that nothing has changed in the future There are more people with better technology but they still have the same problems politically morally and ethically

Whedon came up with the idea for the show after reading The Killer Angels a novel about the Battle of Gettysburg during the American Civil War He wanted to follow people who had fought on the losing side of a war He wanted to look at their lives after the war on the edges of civilization It was meant to be the kind of drama with a lot of people trying to figure out their lives in a pioneer environment Whedon wanted to have a show that was about when life was physical and things did not come easy to people Whedon was also very interested in science fiction and wanted to make something for television that was character driven and dirty

For the name of the show Joss Whedon wanted something that had strength and movement He felt that the word firefly had both The fact that it was also something small with a powerful name made him like it more From there he created the ship in the image of a firefly

While making the first episode Whedon was arguing with FOX that the show should be shown in widescreen format Because of this he filmed scenes with actors on the edge of both sides so that they would have to show it that way However the pilot was turned down by the FOX executives They thought that it did not have enough action They also did not like the captain FOX told Whedon on a Friday afternoon that he had to make a new script by Monday morning or they would not do it Whedon and Tim Minear spent the weekend writing a new episode The Train Job In this new episode the captain was more happy and they added larger than life characters These characters were the henchman Crow and the hands of blue men that also introduced a X Files type ending

Production designer Carey Meyer built the ship Serenity in two parts It was built as a complete set It had ceilings and working lights built in as part of the set that the cameras could use It also had movable parts This helped with moving the camera around inside the set There were other good things about this set design One was that it let the people watching feel that they were really in a ship For Whedon the design of the ship was very important It defined the known space for the viewer He wanted to show that it was simple and that it was beat up but lived in and ultimately it was home Each room had a feel to it usually shown by the paint color 

Their small budget was a reason to use the ship for much of telling the story When the characters did go off of the ship the worlds all had Earth atmosphere and colors They could not afford to build alien worlds

The theme song The Ballad of Serenity was written by Joss Whedon and performed by Sonny Rhodes Whedon wrote the song before the series was approved by Fox An early recording done by Whedon can be found on the DVD release The soundtrack to the series was released on CD on November 8 2005 by Varse Sarabande The musical score matches the blending of cultures in the show Cowboy guitar blended with an Asian feel was the musical background for the series Greg Edmonson wrote the music for the series He said that he wrote for the emotion of the moment

In casting his nine member crew Whedon looked first at the actor and how they got along with others All nine cast members were chosen before filming began However while filming the original pilot Serenity Whedon saw that the actress cast as Inara Serra was not right for the roleMorena Baccarin auditioned for the role and two days later was on the set in her first television show 

Whedon asked Nathan Fillion to play the lead role of Malcolm Reynolds After telling him the idea for the show and showing him the pilot Fillion wanted the role Fillion was called back several times to read for the part before he was cast

Alan Tudyk auditioned and was told to come back in to test with the possible Zoes It was down to him and one other person The Zoes did not work out and Tudyk was sent home He got a call telling him he had the part anyway 

Veteran science fiction fantasy actress Gina Torres did not at first want to do another science fiction show but was won over by the quality of the source material As she recalled So you had these challenged characters inhabiting a challenging world and that makes for great storytelling AND NO ALIENS 

Adam Baldwin grew up watching westerns The character of Jayne Cobb was a role that was perfect for him

Canadian actress Jewel Staite has been an actress since age nine She videotaped her audition from Vancouver she was asked to come to Los Angeles to meet Whedon where she was cast for the role of Kaylee Frye the ships engineer

Sean Maher remembers reading for the part and liking the character of Simon Tam He said it was Whedons personality and vision that sealed the deal for him For the role of Simons sister Whedon called in Summer Glau for an audition and test the same day Glau had first worked for Whedon on an episode of Angel Two weeks later Whedon called her to tell her she had the part This was Glaus first speaking role 

The veteran television actor Ron Glass has said that until Firefly he had not thought about a science fiction western role but he fell in love with the pilot script and the character of Shepherd Book

The series takes place in the year 2517 on several planets and moons The television series does not say if these are in one star system The movie Serenity makes clear that all the planets and moons are in one large system The characters refer to Earth that was and in the movie it is said that long before the events in the series a large population had left from Earth to a new star system Earth that was could no longer sustain our numbers we were so many The people settled in this new star system with dozens of planets and hundreds of moons Many of these were terraformed a process in which a planet or moon is altered to resemble the Earth The terraforming process was only the first step in making a planet livable Only the most central planets got more treatment This caused many of the border planets and moons to have environments that fit the Western setting

The show takes its name from the Firefly class spaceship Serenity that the main characters call home Its tail section lights up during acceleration looking like the glowing part of a firefly

The Alliance is shown to control the star system through an organization of core planets DVD commentary suggests that two main core planets make up the Alliance One is mostly Occidental in culture the other is Asian This explains the series mixed linguistic and visual themes The central planets are under Alliance control but the outer planets and moons resemble the 19th century American West with little government control Settlers people on the outer worlds have relative freedom from the central government The outer areas also have Reavers a cannibalistic race 

The captain of the crew of Serenity is Malcolm Mal Reynolds The episode Serenity shows that the captain and his first mate Zoe Washburne are veteran Browncoats of the civil war A later episode titled Out of Gas shows that Mal bought the spaceship Serenity to continue living beyond Alliance control Much of the crews work is made up of cargo runs or smuggling One of the main story arcs is that of River Tam and her brother Simon River was a child prodigy Her brain was experimented on She seems to have schizophrenia and often hears voices It is later found out that she is a reader someone with psychic abilities Simon gave up a very good career as a surgeon to save her from the Alliance They join the crew in the original Serenity Because of this rescue they are both wanted criminals

Firefly takes place in a multi cultural future Because of this Mandarin Chinese is a common second language It is used in advertisements and characters in the show often use Chinese words and curses 

The show also has slang not used in todays culture There are changes to modern words or new words The Japanese katakana and an Old West dialect are also used 

One of the problems that Whedon had with FOX was the tone of the show especially with the main character Malcolm Reynolds FOX wanted Whedon to make his character more jolly They felt he was too dark in the original pilot 

Firefly had an ensemble cast that played the nine crew members of the ship Serenity These characters fight criminals Alliance security forces the insane Reavers and the mysterious men with hands of blue  who seem to work for a secret agency which is part of the huge corporation The Blue Sun Corporation The crew needs to get enough income to keep their ship working While doing this they must stay hidden from people looking for them 

All nine major characters are in every episode with one exception Book is absent from Ariel

The Tropic of Capricorn or Southern tropic is one of the five major circles of latitude of a map of the Earth It is 23 26 22 south of the Equator

It marks the most southerly latitude at which the sun can appear directly overhead This happens at the December solstice when the southern hemisphere is tilted towards the sun to its maximum extent

The Tropic of Capricorn goes in the these countries starting at the prime meridian and going west

The Tropic of Capricorn is named because about 2000 years ago the sun was entering the constellation Capricornus on the December solstice Now the sun appears in the constellation Sagittarius during the December solstice The change is due to precession of the equinoxes The word tropic comes from the Greek tropos meaning turn This refers to the fact that the sun appears to turn back at the solstices

The Antarctic Circle is one of the five major circles of latitude that mark maps of the Earth It is the parallel of latitude at 66 33 39 south of the Equator crossing mostly the Southern Ocean

In the Antarctic Circle all places have twenty four hours of daylight on the Summer Solstice in December In June on the Winter Solstice all places have twenty four hours of night There is a minimum of one whole day that the sun does not set and one whole day that the sun does not rise

The area south of this circle is named the Antarctic and the zone to the north is the Southern Temperate Zone

The continent of Antarctica is a land mass that is most of the area within the Antarctic Circle The South Pole is in the center of the Antarctic Circle

There is no permanent population of persons south of the Antarctic Circle There are research centers from some nations on Antarctica Teams of scientists live in the research centers for part of the year In past centuries some whaling stations were set up on Antarctica and some of the whalers would live there for a year or more At least three children have been born in Antarctica They would be citizens of Antarctica if there were a nation on the continent

Toast is bread which has been grilled until hot and crispy either using a toaster a grill or rarely a flamethrower Toasted bread is both darker in color and crunchier than normal bread Crunchy bread means it has a consistency and a feeling in a mouth of crispiness Toast can be eaten with a range of condiments spread on the surface such as butter jam honey though these are optional as some people prefer their toast without

Swiss cheese is a group of cheeses with holes in them These cheeses got their name because they look like Swiss Emmental cheese

Swiss cheese is famous for having holes The holes are created by the bacteria which change milk to Swiss cheese Propionibacter uses the lactic acid which is produced by other bacteria and produces carbon dioxide gas the gas slowly forms bubbles which makes the holes The holes of the cheese are called the eyes and a Swiss cheese which does not have holes is called a blind cheese

In general Swiss cheeses with larger eyes have a better taste This is because the same factors that make the eyes larger make the taste of the cheese better too These factors include longer time and higher temperature given to the cheese to form

Henry VI was King of England from 1422 to 1461 and then from 1470 to 1471 He was also the King of France from 1422 to 1453

Henry was the only child of King Henry V of England and was his heir He was born on 6 December 1421 at Windsor He became king at the age of nine months on 31 August 1422 when his father died His mother Catherine of Valois was then only twenty years old Because she was the daughter of King Charles VI of France and France had been the enemy of England the English people did not trust her and she was not allowed to have a large part in raising her son

Humphrey Duke of Gloucester Henry IVs youngest son was given the position of Protector and Defender of the Realm and the Church until the King was old enough to rule His job was to keep the peace and deal with Parliament Henry IVs oldest living son John Duke of Bedford was made the Regent of France He was in charge of running the war that was happening Bedford also replaced Gloucester as Regent of England whenever he was in England

Henry was eventually made King of England at Westminster Abbey on 6 November 1429 a month before his eighth birthday He was made King of France at Notre Dame in Paris on 16 December 1431 Because he was a child he was not allowed to control the government until he was declared of age on his sixteenth birthday in 1437 the same year his mother died

Because of his success in the Hundred Years War Henry V had left England with a lot of land in France Since Henry VI was still a child and England was ruled by a Regent much of the land his father gained was lost Diplomatic mistakes as well as military failures caused the loss of most of the English land in France 

Henry VI was a deeply spiritual man and was not very interested in politics He let his court be controlled by a few noblemen who were called his favourites The people who wanted to end the war in France became more powerful and Henry went along with them Henry VI was told that the best way of get peace with France was to marry Margaret of Anjou who was a niece of King Charles VII of France Charles agreed to let Henry marry Margaret as long as he did not have to give her a dowry and was given the lands of Maine and Anjou by the English Henry agreed but did not let Parliament know about giving away Maine and Anjou thinking that the English people would not be happy to know that the land was being given away to France

The marriage happened in 1445 Margaret was much the opposite of Henry She was ready to take decisions and lead while he was happy to be led by her Margaret was a stronger ruler than Henry ever was even though she was only sixteen at that time

Henry VI was imprisoned in the Tower of London where he was murdered on 21 May 1471 Popular legend said that Richard Duke of Gloucester was guilty of his murder as well as the murder of Henry VIs son Edward of Westminster

King Henry VI was originally buried in Chertsey Abbey In 1485 his body was moved to St Georges Chapel Windsor Castle

He was succeeded by Edward IV son of Richard Duke of York

Saint Fons is a French city next to Lyon About 15000 people live there The name of the city does not come from a saint It is because there are many fountains near the city Originally the place name was Cent Fonts which was changed into the current city name The city split from Vnissieux in the middle of the 19th century The main reason for splitting was because of the chemical industry in the spot

Incidental music is music which has been written for a play It is not like opera where there is usually music all the way through Incidental music will be used between scenes or for particularly important moments in the play or for songs sung by the actors It is called incidental because the music is not as important as the play

Incidental music was used as long ago as the time of Ancient Greece It was used in the 16th and 17th centuries especially in the plays of Shakespeare whose characters often sing songs At this time incidental music was used more often for comedies than for tragedies Tragedies were about important people who were busy ruling their country and having wars In the plays they spoke in verse and were too noble to sing People thought that comedies were more suitable for including music The songs were often sung by actors playing the parts of shepherds nymphs or clowns

In later centuries music was used for all types of serious drama Sometimes large orchestras were used Many famous composers wrote music to be played by an orchestra during plays A famous example is the incidental music for Shakespeares A Midsummer Nights Dream composed by Felix Mendelssohn in 1842 Other composers worked with living poets such as Goethe and Schiller Beethoven wrote music for Goethes play Egmont This music is very closely linked to what happens in the story the overture describes the harshness of the Spanish oppression of the Netherlands which is what the play is about Schuberts famous Rosamunde overture comes from a play called Die Zauberharfe Schumanns music for Manfred is different it was never intended to be performed with the play it was just inspired by Schumanns imagination Many other composers wrote incidental music eg Sibelius and Grieg

In all these examples the music is now usually heard at concerts not as part of the original play Most of them have overtures and these overtures are often performed separately very often at the start of concerts

Incidental music was not used so much during the 20th century although the plays of Brecht which are often about political propaganda needed a new kind of popular music Brecht worked with composers like Weill and Eisler who understood the kind of message that he wanted in his plays Their music for Brechts plays is similar to cabaret music

Nowadays electronic music is often used in plays

A kayak is a small boat that is driven by manpower It typically has a covered deck and a cockpit covered by a spraydeck It is propelled by a double bladed paddle by a sitting paddler The kayak was used by the native Ainu Inuit Aleut and Eskimo hunters in sub Arctic regions of northeastern Asia North America and Greenland Modern kayaks come in a wide variety of designs and materials for specialized purposes

Kayaks typically are built for one two or occasionally three paddlers who sit facing forward in one or more cockpits below the deck of the boat The spray skirt or similar waterproof garment attaches securely to the edges of the cockpit so that no water from waves or spray may enter the boat Therefore in most styles the boat can roll upright again without it filling with water or ejecting the paddler

Kayaks differ distinctly in design and history from canoes which are craft propelled by single bladed paddles by a kneeling paddler although some modern canoes may be difficult for a non expert to distinguish from a kayak Kayaks are often called canoes in Great Britain and Ireland

A canoe is a small boat that is often driven by manpower or womanpower but also commonly sailed Canoes are pointed at both ends and usually open on top but can be covered Canoes are known as Paddle boats in some small towns in the south of Australia The use of a paddle or salvatore is used to propell the vehicle The most famous of rowers include the Szwedo of Luke in which he was the first man to complete 4 laps the woodend river in less then 3 days Beating the previous pre fisted jew and his record of 4 laps in 4 days

Binary is a way to show whole numbers using only 1 and 0 Computers work in binary

Binary is a number system and is known as a base 2 system because it uses two characters 0 and 1 Decimal the system most of the world uses for daily life is a base 10 system it uses 10 characters

1101 is an example of a binary number Here is how to change binary numbers to decimal numbers The value of the bit on the right side of the number is 1 Every other bit has a value two times the value of the bit to its right So the place values of the binary number 1101 are 8 4 2 and 1 Add the values of every bit that is a 1 together to get the decimal number Thus the code 1101 converted into decimal number will be 13

For another example the binary number 101 is 5 in decimal The bit on the right is 1 and has a value of 1 The middle bit has a value of 2 but it is a 0 so it is not added The bit on the left is 1 and has a value of 4 The bits that are 1s have values of 1 and 4 1 4 5

All computers use binary at the lowest level Most computer storage like compact discs and DVDs use binary to represent large files

With computers eight binary bits together is called a byte The size of files is commonly measured in kilobytes or megabytes A kilobyte is 1024 bytes A megabyte is 1024 kilobytes or 1048576 bytes while a gigabyte is 1024 megabytes

Monochrome comes from the two Greek words mono and chroma If something is monochromatic it only has a single color

In physics the word is used when talking about electromagnetic radiation of a single wavelength 

For an image the term monochrome usually means the same as black and white or grayscale It may also be used when talking about other combinations that only have two colors for example green and white or green and black In computing monochrome has two meanings

A semitone is the smallest musical interval used in Western music It is the distance between two notes which are next to one another in pitch 

A whole tone means a distance of two semitones ie the distance between two notes which are separated by one other note in pitch 

This is easy to see with a picture of a keyboard The distance between two white notes that are side by side may be a whole tone or a semitone

To go from a C to a C sharp is a semitone

To go from a C sharp to a D is a semitone

Nuclear power is the controlled use of nuclear energy Nuclear energy is energy in uranium that can be released by nuclear reactions in a machine called a nuclear reactor This energy is made into electricity which then can be used to power machines and heat homes In 2007 14 of the worlds electricity came from nuclear power Nuclear power plants also make radioactive waste that could be harmful if it is not stored properly

Enrico Fermi made the first nuclear reactor in 1941 Many reactors were built in the US during World War II during the Manhattan Project In 1954 the first nuclear power plant started in Obninsk near Moscow Most nuclear power plants in the US were built during the 1960s and 1970s Nuclear reactors also power some large military ships and submarines

Some serious nuclear accidents have occurred A scale was made to measure how dangerous accidents are It is called International Nuclear Event Scale The scale has 8 levels and 7 is the worst

Nuclear powered submarine mishaps include the Soviet submarine K 19 reactor accident the Soviet submarine K 27 reactor accident and the Soviet submarine K 431 reactor accident

The economics of nuclear power is challenging and following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster costs are likely to go up for currently operating and new nuclear power plants due to increased requirements for on site spent fuel management and elevated design basis threats

There is a debate about the use of nuclear power Supporters such as the World Nuclear Association and IAEA think that nuclear power is a sustainable energy source that reduces carbon emissions Anti nuclear opponents such as Greenpeace International and NIRS believe that nuclear power poses threats to people and the environment

In 2007 nuclear power plants made some 2600 TWh of electricity and provided 14 percent of the electricity used in the world which represented a fall of 2 per cent compared with 2006 As of May 9 2010 there were 438 nuclear reactors operating globally A peak was reached in 2002 when there were 444 nuclear reactors operating 

The nuclear emergencies at Japans Fukushima I Nuclear Power Station and other nuclear facilities raised questions about the future of nuclear power Platts has said that the crisis at Japans Fukushima nuclear plants has prompted leading energy consuming countries to review the safety of their existing reactors and cast doubt on the speed and scale of planned expansions around the world Following the Fukushima nuclear disaster the International Energy Agency halved its estimate of additional nuclear generating capacity to be built by 2035

Software Versioning is a way to tell the different states of Computer software apart Computer software has different states in its development process Each state in the process is given a unique Version Versions are either names dates or they can be done as some other form of numbering Sometimes these states are also called revisions 

Many times after a program has been made things called patches can be downloaded from the programs website The patches will make small changes or fixes to the main program When a patch is used the program is advanced to the next version For example a computer game is first at version 10 when it is released Later the player may download a patch which changes the game to version 11 101 or something similar to that

Sympathy exists when the feelings or emotions of one person lead to similar feelings in another person so that they share feeling Mostly sympathy means the sharing of unhappiness or suffering but it can also mean sharing other emotions In a broader sense it can refer to the sharing of political or ideological sentiments such as in the phrase a communist sympathiser

The psychological state of sympathy is closely linked with that of empathy but is not identical to it Empathy refers to the ability to perceive and directly experientially feel another persons emotions as they feel them but makes no statement as to how they are viewed 

Sympathy by contrast implies a degree of equal feeling that is the sympathiser views the matter similarly to how the person themselves does It thus implies concern or care or a wish to reduce negative feelings others are experiencing

A puddle is a small mass of liquid usually water uncontained on a surface It can form either in depressions in the surface or directly upon the flat surface held together by surface tension A puddle is generally considered to be small enough to step over or shallow enough to walk through and too small to traverse with a boat 

Puddles commonly form during rainstorms and can cause problems for transport especially when combined with cold conditions to form patches of ice which are highly slippery and difficult to see

A beam is an element that carries load 

Beams generally carry vertical forces but can also be used to carry horizontal loads The loads that a beam carries are led to columns or walls which lead the force to the next element

Beams are characterized by their broken wikt linkprofileprofile their length and their material In constructions of today beams are mostly made of steel reinforced concrete or wood

Twins are two animal offspring that are born from the same pregnancy

Human twins are two people that shared the uterus during a single pregnancy and one is normally born quickly after the first Because of the size of the uterus multiple pregnancies are less likely to last the full 38 weeks than most single birth pregnancies On average they last 35 weeks This also means about 50 of twins is born prematurely

Fraternal twins also known as non identical twins or dizygotic twins Two separate ova are fertilized which each becomes a zygote The two zygotes grow into two genetically different beings

Identical twins or monozygotic twins A single ovum is fertilized to form one zygote This zygote later splits and each half of the zygote becomes a twin The twins have the same genes

Semi identical twins A single ovum is fertilized by two sperm cells and splits The twins have the same genes from their mothers side but each twin has different genes from their fathers side

There are five variations of twinning that occur commonly in the world The three most common variations are all fraternal meaning the two twins are not from the same egg 

The last two variations are identical twins which means they come from one single egg that split later 

A ceiling is an overhead interior surface of a room that conceals the underside of the floor or roof structure above 

Ceiling Is An Upper limit on what is allowed

A column in architecture is a vertical element that transmits the weight of the structure above to the structure below Columns can be either a single piece or several pieces put together Columns are frequently used to support beams or arches on which the upper parts of walls or ceilings rest 

Stone columns were already used in the architecture of ancient Egypt as early as 2600 BC 

Identical twins are genetically identical they have the same genes They are formed by a fertilised egg dividing into two separate individuals and are always of the same sex They may be called monozygotic or MZ twins They contrast with fraternal twins who are formed by two separate eggs fertilised by two separate sperms and who are not always the same sex Both types of twin are carried in the same uterus at the same time so their birth environment is the same

Research shows that the frequency of monozygotic twinning is one in 240 births Fraternal twins are twice as common

Identical twins are natural clones Because they carry the same genes they may be used to investigate how much heredity contributes to individual people Studies with twins have been quite interesting If we make a list of characteristic traits we find that they vary in how much they owe to heredity For example

The way the studies are done is like this Take a group of identical twins and a group of fraternal twins and a group of siblings from the population Measure them for various traits Do a statistical analysis This tells you to what extent the trait is inherited You will find that all those traits which are partly inherited will be significantly more similar in identical twins 

Studies like this may be carried further by comparing identical twins brought up together with identical twins brought up in different circumstances That gives a handle on how much circumstances can alter the outcomes of genetically identical people

The person who first did twin studies was Francis Galton Darwins half cousin who was a founder of statistics His method was to trace twins through their life history making many kinds of measurement Unfortunately though he knew about mono and dizygotic twins he did not appreciate the real genetic difference Twin studies of the modern kind did not appear until the 1920s

Wilhelm Weinberg made the first estimate of the rate of twinning Realizing that identical twins would have to be the same sex while non identical twins could be either same or opposite sex Weinberg derived a formula for estimating the frequency of MZ and DZ twins from the ratio of same and opposite sex twins to the total of maternities Weinberg also estimated that the heritability of twinning itself was close to zero That means the capacity to have twins is not hereditary

Twinning is normal in many mammals such as rats cats dogs Identical twins are normal in a few species such as the nine banded armadillo Dasypus novemcinctus

Offspring produced by non sexual methods such as parthenogenesis are identical unless crossing over takes place in the production of eggs

A keyboard instrument is an instrument that is played by pressing the keys of a keyboard In a keyboard the notes are arranged with naturals forming the main body of the keyboard and sharps and flats placed in cuttings into the upper half of the naturals

The ways in which the sound is made varies a lot

In the 17th and 18th centuries the word Clavier was used in Germany to mean any kind of keyboard instrument Often the naturals were black and the sharps and flats were white but the layout was exactly the same 

The development of electronic instruments in the 20th century has brought about many different types of electronic keyboard instruments These include the ondes martenot and the synthesizer

Nowadays people often talk about a keyboard meaning an electronic keyboard This word is sometimes broken wikt linkpluralizepluralized as keyboards

Finance is how people study and figure out how people businesses and groups make and use money It can mean

The process of finance is learning how people and groups act in managing their money and most of all how they manage making money and making a profit with spending money and making a loss

A group that makes more money than it spends can lend or invest the excess profit On the other hand a group that makes less money than it spends can raise money by getting a loan or selling stock or spending less or making more money 

A bank is where many people borrowing money meet people lending money A bank gets money from lenders and pays interest The bank then lends this money to borrowers Banks allow borrowers and lenders of different sizes to meet 

Corporate finance is about things like the sale of stock by a company to the public Stock is ownership in a company broken up into pieces The stock gives whoever owns it part ownership in that company If someone buys one share of XYZ Inc and the company has 100 shares available the buyer is 1100th owner of that company and owns 1100th of the profit

Noahs Ark according to the book of Genesis in the Bible was a ship that God instructed Noah to build to save himself his family and every kind of animal because God was going to destroy the Earth by bringing about a great flood It also says that the ark rested on the highest point in the area which was Mount Ararat in what is now Turkey 

The size of the ship was 300 by 50 by 30 ells according to Genesis 614 This makes it about half the size of the ship RMS Queen Elizabeth 2 or 133 by 22 by 13 metres It would have had about the same tonnage as the RMS TitanicfactdateJuly 2010 

There have been many recorded sightings of the ark over the years however no physical evidence has been proven to show that the ark is currently on Mount Ararat 

According to the Bible the ark was made of gopherwood Gopherwood is possibly the wood of a cypress tree which was used for making ships in the Middle East Cypress was good for making ships because it had strong wood from a large trunk and limbs However no one knows for sure what kind of tree gopherwood was

The ark was 300 cubits long and 50 cubits wide the height was 30 cubits For a long time people did not know exactly how much a cubit was One day in the later years of the 19th century archaeologists found a tunnel in Jerusalem This tunnel had been built in the days of King Hezekiah At the entrance was an inscription that said the tunnel was 1200 cubits long The archaeologist measured the tunnel and saw it was 1800 feet long So now people know that the Hebrew cubit at least in the time of King Hezekiah was 18 inches

The shape and size of the ark were very good for floating Many cargo ships are built like Noahs ark because this design is very steady in the water

After Noah had finished putting the ark together with the gopherwood boards he had to make it watertight According to the Bible God told Noah to use pitch a waterproof material to paint it inside and outside

The building of the ark took Noah about 120 years according to the time God gave to human beings before the flood started

There are some problems with the way the story is understood that started during Renaissance The mythological creature called the Phoenix is unique How can there have been two of them And were the Sirens that lure sailors into their doom taken onboard too A popular solution was that they swam outside And the Bird of Paradise must have flown around the ark endlessly because it had no feet to land

At the same time a new kind of scholarship arose These people never questioned the literal truth of the Ark story They began to think about it from a practical point of view In the 15th century Alfonso Tostada told about the logic of the Ark including things such as arrangements for the getting rid of dung and the circulation of fresh air The well known 16th century geometrician Johannes Buteo worked out the ships internal dimensions He also allowed room for Noahs grinding mills and smokeless ovens Other people also used his model later on

By the 17th century America had been discovered and was being explored This led to new problems All the species had to be spread again from one point after the flood The obvious answer was that man had spread over the continents after the destruction of the Tower of Babel The different groups took animals with them Some of the results seemed peculiar though why had the natives of North America taken rattlesnakes but not horses wondered Sir Thomas Browne in 1646 How America abounded with Beasts of prey and noxious Animals yet contained not in that necessary Creature a Horse is very strange

Browne was among the first people to question the notion of spontaneous generation He was a medical doctor and amateur scientist making this observation in passing Biblical scholars of the time such as Justus Lipsius and Athanasius Kircher were also beginning to look at the Ark story more closely They tried to reconcile the Biblical account with natural historical knowledge of their time The resulting hypotheses were important They were a driving force behind the study of the geographical distribution of plants and animals They indirectly helped the development of biogeography in the 18th century Natural historians began to draw connections between climates and the animals and plants adapted to them One important theory said that the biblical Ararat was striped with different climatic zones When climate changed the associated animals moved as well Eventually they spread to repopulate the globe There was also the problem of an ever expanding number of known species for Kircher and earlier natural historians there was little problem finding room for all known animal species in the Ark but by the time John Ray was working just several decades after Kircher their number had increased dramatically Incorporating the full range of animal diversity into the Ark story was becoming increasingly difficult and by 1700 few natural historians could see any reasons to believe in a literal interpretation of the Noahs Ark narrative

In 2011 a full size replica of Noahs ark was built in Dordrecht in the Netherlands

Australian English is the kind of English language used in Australia

People from Britain and Ireland first came to live in Australia in 1788 They brought many different kinds of English with them These different kinds of English began to mix and change The new comers soon began to speak with their own distinctive accent and vocabulary 

More and more people came to Australia in the 19th and 20th centuries Many people came looking for gold Some came from Britain and Ireland Others came from non English speaking countries Australian English continued to grow and change

Australian English has also been influenced by American English During the Second World War there were many American soldiers staying in Australia American television shows and music have been popular in Australia since the 1950s

The Australian and New Zealand accents are similar 

In Australian English the r sound can only occur before a vowel Many words which sound different in other accents sound the same in Australian English Some examples are

Some Australian English vowels sound different to vowels of other kinds of English For example the vowel in day starts with a very open mouth This makes the Australian day sound close to the die of most British or American people Days of the week however are often different and the day sounds like dee

Australian English has some vowels not used in some other kinds of English For example the words bad and lad do not rhyme because bad has a long vowel and lad has a short one Also cot does not sound like caught and bother does not rhyme with father

As with American English the t sound can sometimes sound like a d sound This usually happens between vowels So for example 

Also in the Australian accent a t sound plus the sound of you comes out sounding like chew and a d sound plus the sound of you comes out sounding like Jew Here are some examples of things which sound the same

Australians pronounce wh and w the same Some examples are

Australians use many words that other English speakers do not use The famous Australian greeting for example is Gday  A native forest is called the bush and central Australia is called the outback

Many words were brought to Australia from Britain and Ireland For example mate meaning friend which is still used in Britain Some of these words have changed in meaning 

A few words have come from Australian Aboriginal languages These are mainly names for animals plants and places Some examples are dingo and kangaroo

Sometimes we do not know where a word came from For example dinkum or fair dinkum means true is that true this is the truth But nobody know where the word is from some say the word comes from Chinese others say the word comes from England

Australian spelling is generally very similar to British spelling In words like organise realise both ise and ize are accepted as in British English but ise is preferred In words like colour favourite our is the norm but some proper names such as the Labor party and Victor Harbor are spelled with or Program and jail on the other hand are more common than programme and gaol

Most linguists split Australian English up into three main kinds These are Broad General and Cultivated Australian English 

Broad Australian English sounds very strongly Australian when compared to other kinds of English Dame Edna Everage speaks Broad Australian English

General Australian English is the middle ground It is used by most Australians and can be heard in Australian made films and television programs Eric Bana and Nicole Kidman speak General Australian English 

Cultivated Australian English is close to British English Judy Davis and Geoffrey Rush speak Cultivated Australian English

The Australian accent does not change much across the country However some small differences include how the letter a sounds like in the words castle dance chance advance etc Some use the vowel in calm others use the vowel in mat or mad Another regional difference is the pronunciation of e sounds especially followed by l such as Melbourne helped cellist with Victorians pronouncing this e like the a sound in alchemy or chalice 

However there are differences in the words Australians use in different parts of the country For example football means rugby in NSW and Queensland but Australian rules football in Victoria In NSW a swimming costume is called a cossie or swimmers in Queensland it is called togs but its called bathers in most other states

A Christmas tree or Tannenbaum is one of the most popular traditions associated with the celebration of Christmas It is normally an evergreen coniferous tree that is brought into a home or used in the open and is decorated with Christmas lights and colourful ornaments during the days around Christmas An angel or a star is often placed at the top of the tree

Cell division is the process by which a cell called the parent cell divides into two cells called daughter cells When the cell divides everything inside it divides also The nucleus and the chromosomes divide and the mitochondria divide also There are two types of cell division In mitosis ordinary body cells divide in meiosis cells divide to produce gametes

Cells are the building blocks of life and cell division is a basic feature of life For simple unicellular organisms like amoeba one cell division reproduces the entire organism On a larger scale cell division can create offspring from multicellular organisms such as plants that grow from cuttings But most importantly cell division enables organisms that are able to sexually reproduce to develop from the one celled fertilised egg zygote After growth cell division allows for continual renewal and repair of the organism And binary fission is where a cell splits in two

In geography temperate latitudes of the globe lie between the tropics and the polar circles The changes in these regions between summer and winter are not extreme not burning hot or freezing cold However a temperate climate can have very unpredictable weather One day it may be sunny the next it may be raining and after that it may be cloudy This is usual in summer as well as in winterThe temperate regions has 4 seasons namely summerfallwinter and spring

The Lithuanian language is a Baltic language It is from Lithuania spoken in a few countries in Europe as well as in the Americas and Australia 

Lithuanian and Latvian are the only remaining Baltic languages Both languages have many things in common Lithuanian however adopted fewer words and phrases from German and other languages However long ago Lithuanian was affected by the Slavic languages so the main barbarisms were replaced with Lithuanian words only in 1920 by Lithuanian philologist Jonas Jablonskis and others 

There are two main dialects of Lithuanian Samogitian is the dialect mostly used in West Lithuania the other widely used in the whole country is Auktaitian The standard Lithuanian comes from West Auktaitian 

The first book written in Lithuanian is Katekizmas by Martynas Mavydas It was published in East Prussia in 1547

Gingivitis is the inflammation of the gums around the teeth Gingivitis may be caused by a build up of plaque and tartar because the teeth have not been cleaned properly It can also be a manifestation of a systemic disease as in diabetes or AIDS

Sometimes excessive brushing or flossing can wear out the gums causing gum recession

If gingivitis is not treated by proper oral hygiene it can lead to periodontitis which is a more advanced state of gum disease that affects the bone and is harder to treat

It is more common in women because they are dirty

Taiga is characterized by coniferous forests Taiga covers most of inland Alaska Canada Sweden Finland inland Norway northern Kazakhstan and Russia as well as parts of the extreme northern continental United States The taiga is the worlds largest region with forests In Canada boreal forest is the term used to refer to the southern part of these forests while taiga is used to describe the northern areas south of the Arctic tree line

The Conifers are cone bearing seed plants mostly trees with some shrubs They are formally the Division Pinophyta or Coniferophyta 

Conifers are Gymnosperms They are cone bearing seed plants with vascular tissue all living conifers are woody plants the great majority being trees 

Typical examples of conifers include cedars cypresses firs junipers kauris larches pines redwoods spruces and yews 

Species of conifers can be found in almost all parts of the world and are often the most common plants in their habitats as in the taiga Conifers are of great economic value and their wood is mainly used for timber and paper making The wood of conifers is known as softwood though yew wood is actually quite hard The division Coniferae contains about 700 living species

They were the dominant land plants of the Mesozoic era They were overtaken by the flowering plants which first appeared in the Cretaceous and became dominant in the Cainozoic era Conifers were the main food of herbivorous dinosaurs and their resins and poisons would have given protection against herbivores

In biology binomial nomenclature is how species are named As the word binomial suggests the name of a species is made by using two words the genus name and the species description Binomial nomenclature means two named description

The person who created this system for use was Swedish botanist and physician Carolus Linnaeus who tried to find names for all things in the natural world and gave every species a two part name This kind of naming had been used before Linnaeus but before Linnaeus hardly anybody used binomial nomenclature After Linnaeus almost everybody did

The value of the binomial nomenclature comes from its economy its widespread use and the uniqueness and stability of names from the system

Linnaeuss taxonomy system has two main features that contribute to its ease of use in naming and grouping organisms The first is the use of binomial nomenclature and the second is the ordering of species into broad categories 

Binomial nomenclature involves organizing an organisms scientific name into a combination of two terms These terms are the genus name and the species Both of these terms are italicized and the genus name is also capitalized

The names may come from any source whatsoever Often they are Latin words but they may also come from Ancient Greek from a place from a person a name from a local language etc In fact the people who come up with these names sometime use specific descriptors from a variety of sources including jokes and puns

The names are always treated grammatically as if they were a Latin sentence This is why the name of a species is sometimes called its Latin name but scientists like calling these names scientific names

The genus name must be unique inside each group of life Species names are reused and are sometimes given a third name which is a noun

System is a group of related things that work with each other These things can be real or imaginary Systems can be real things like a cars engine But systems can also be things made by persons to organize ideas groups people and anything else A subsystem is a little system within a big system 

What systems do Systems are a way to describe a set of items or people or things that are related and most systems describe ways of making them work together or why they work together already Some systems are nothing more than a different way of looking at a problem or thinking about a job being done 

Other systems are more like organizing books on a shelf so that people can find things more simply without having to search These can be systems about how to program computers or manage people

There are many kinds of systems A system can refer to

The Valencia orange is an orange first made by the Californian agronomist William Wolfskill on his farm in Santa Ana The orange was later sold to the Irvine Company who later used half of its land to grow the orange Orange County is named after this orange because of its popularity The Irvine Companys Valencia operation later split from the company and became Sunkist Cultivation of the Valencia in Orange County had stopped by the mid 1990s because of rising property costs which caused what remained of the Southern California orange industry to move to Florida It is usually harvested between March and June 

Papaya is a tall herbaceous plant in the genus Carica its edible fruit is also called papaya It is native to the tropical region of America mainly from southern Mexico to Central America Now these plants are grown in all tropical regions of the world

Papayas are plants of tropical regions and for growth and fruit production they need a warm climate They cannot live with low temperatures

The genus Carica was given that name by Linnaeus because the leaves of these plants are like those of the common fig

The common name comes from the Tano word papia that was changed in Spanish to papaya the word most used worldwide with some changes In Australia and some countries of the Caribbean the fruit is called papaw or pawpaw but another North American plant Asimina triloba of the Annonaceae family has also that name

The French name for the fruit is papaye and papayer for the plant In Portuguese the fruit is called mamo papaia or ababaia and the tree mamoeiro or papaeira

In Spanish there are other names besides papaya In Cuba it is called fruta bomba except in the eastern provinces where papaya is used In the Dominican Republic Los Llanos and Eastern Central Colombia the name is lechosa In Argentina and Paraguay the fruit is called mamn

Other names and translations can be seen at Wiktionary

It is a large plant like a tree without branches it is a herbaceous plant because the stem does not have much wood and remains soft and green until its death The single stem grows from 5 to 10 m tall with all the leaves on the top The leaves are large 5070 cm wide

Some plants have perfect flowers but other plants have flowers with only one sex

Generally the fruit is oval to nearly round and in some cases like a big pear Fruits are 15 50 cm long and 1020 cm wide and weigh up to 9 kg

The skin of the fruit is thin and tough it is not eaten because is too bitter First the skin is green but it changes to yellow in ripe fruits ready to be eaten In a ripe fruit the pulp is yellow orange pink and even light red Inside the fruit there are many small black seeds

Ripe papayas are eaten fresh after taking out the skin and the seeds sometimes they are cut in small pieces and mixed with other fruits for a fruit salad Papayas that are not completely ripe can be cut in pieces and cook with sugar and eaten as dessert In tropical regions it is very popular the juice of papaya after taking the skin and seeds this juice can be mixed with milk to make smoothies

Green papayas those that are not ripe are eaten in some Asiatic countries in salads curries and soups but they should be boiled before eating them Young leaves and stems are also cooked as a vegetable Green papaya is used in Thai cuisine both raw and cooked

The papaya is a source of iron and calcium a good source of vitamins A B and Riboflavin and an excellent source of vitamin C

The latex from the green fruits the leaves and the stem are rich in an enzyme called papain a protease that breaks down tough meat fibers Papain is a component in products sold in shops and that is used to make meat more soft before cooking it

Salmonberries are a type of fruit They are in the rose family Rosaceae

A grape tomato is a small usually oblong tomato They are similar in size to a small cherry tomato and they both have a similar taste but the grape tomato also has the similar oblong shape of a plum tomato The tomatoes were introduced to the United States market in 1997 by grower Andrew Chu who got them from Taiwans Known You Seed Co though the majority of the production is by a company called Procacci Brothers who market them as Santa Sweets They are considered a difficult crop to grow as they do not produce as heavily as many cherry tomato varieties

It is believed that the tomatoes originated in Southeast Asia They are eaten as bar snacks in some parts of Thailand

Adolf von Henselt born Schwabach Bavaria May 9 1814 died Warmbrunn Silesia October 10 1889 was a German pianist and composer He had piano lessons from Hummel in Weimar When he was a young man he played in concerts all over Germany Then he went to Russia where he was very successful and he settled there to live He became pianist at the court of the tsar and taught the tsars children how to play the piano

Henselt was known for his beautiful playing of the music of Chopin He was very good at playing widely spaced arpeggios and could make them sound very smooth even if he was not using the pedal

As a composer he is mostly remembered today for a few of his short works which are often quite sentimental eg Frhlingslied and Si oiseau jtais

The Cherry Tomato is a type of tomato that is a fruit They grow up to be about 1 inch This type of tomato was originally developed in Israel

A binary star is two stars which orbit around each other For each star the other is its companion star Many stars are part of a system with two or more stars Binary stars are important in astrophysics because looking at their orbits allows scientists to find out their masses This information can be used to learn the masses of individual stars

Binary stars are not the same as line of sight apparent double stars which look close together but are not connected by gravity Double stars may actually be far apart in space but binary stars are quite close together The first person to discover and prove true binary stars was the Anglo German astronomer William Herschel He published the first catalogue of binary stars and his son John Herschel found several thousand more and updated the catalogue

Some binary stars can be seen as two separate stars by people with good eyesightMizar and Alcor in the handle of the Big Dipper are an example a visual binary where the individual stars are visible Other binary stars are so close together that instruments must be used to tell them apart One way to tell binary stars and double stars apart is to watch them for a long time Over a few decades of observation true binary stars will move around each other but double stars always stay in the same position

Some stars appear to be in orbit around empty space and appear not to have a companion In this case the companion star is either very small and faint or it is a neutron star or a black hole The best known example of a star with an invisible companion is Cygnus X 1 in which the visible stars companion appears to be a black hole 

A visual binary star is one for which the separation of the two stars can be seen with a telescope The brighter star is the primary and the fainter star is the secondary Visual binaries take a long time to orbit one another in the area of hundreds or even thousands of years

A spectroscopic binary is one in which the two stars cannot be seen separately even with a telescope They are very close together and move around each other very quickly over a period of a few weeks or even a few days However they can be seen to be two separate stars by using a spectroscope which is able to record the Doppler change in the color of the light sent out by stars moving quickly toward or away from the Earth 

Some spectroscopic binaries have an orbit that is edge on to Earth When this happens the stars will take turns passing in front of and eclipsing the partner star in what is called an eclipsing binary In this case the amount of light we see from the double dims slightly during the time one star is in front of the other

An astrometric binary is one where only one companion can be seen For astrometric binaries fairly near the Earth it may be possible to see the visible companion wobble as it moves around its invisible companion By making measurements over a long period of time it may be possible to calculate the mass of the visible star and how long its orbit takes This method is also used to detect the presence of large planets orbiting a star as of 2007 over two hundred planets have been discovered in this way

Most binaries are detached binaries Except for their gravitational pull on one another they have no effect on each other

Some binaries are so close to one another that one or both stars is able to pull material from the other They may share the same stellar atmosphere and as friction slows them down over a long period they may merge into one star

Though it could be possible that binary stars may form when one star passes very close to another it is highly unlikely and would occur only in places where stars are densely packed together Our present understanding is that almost all binaries are formed together in the dense gas clouds where stars are born 

It is possible that a passing star will disrupt a binary system and provide enough gravitational force to split the binary Such separated stars go on to live lives as ordinary single stars Sometimes though enough gravitational force is involved that the two companions speed away from each other at great speeds resulting in what is known as runaway stars

Sometimes a star is in orbit around a white dwarf star If it is large enough and close enough to the white dwarf the dwarf may suck gasses from its companions atmosphere Over a period of time a great deal of gas may collect on the white dwarf As this gas is compacted by the white dwarfs gravity it will eventually undergo nuclear fusion resulting in a very bright outburst of light known as a nova In some cases the white dwarf may gather so much gas that the explosion completely destroys it in what is called a supernova Such an event may also result in runaway stars as the larger star no longer has a heavy companion which keeps it in orbit

The Imperial units or the Imperial system is a collection of measurement units Commonwealth countries used this system from 1824 until they changed to the metric system The imperial system is very similar to the American system but there are some differences 

The British nautical mile used to be 6080 feet In 1970 the UK adopted the international definition of 1852 metres

The full table of British apothecaries measure is

For a comparison to the US customary system see the article on Comparison of the Imperial and US customary systems

The imperial and US customary systems are very similar but there are some differences between them

The main difference is in units of volume The American system has two gallons a wet and a dry one The imperial gallon is bigger than each of these However the imperial fluid ounce is slightly smaller than the American one 

The international yard is exactly 09144 metres This definition was agreed upon by the United States Canada the United Kingdom South Africa Australia and New Zealand in 1959 However the United States continued to use its old length units for surveying purposes The US survey foot is exactly 363937 metre

Another difference is in units of mass In Britain people often use the stone One stone is 14 pounds Eight stones are one hundredweight Twenty hundredweights are one ton So one British ton is 2240 pounds It is very close to the tonne of the metric system 

In the United States people do not use the stone They usually use a hundredweight of 100 pounds This hundredweight is also called a short hundredweight Twenty short hundredweights are one short ton The British hundredweight is also called the long hundredweight and the Britsh ton is also called the long ton

The stone is a unit of mass in the imperial system It is equal to fourteen pounds 160 stone make up a long ton In the metric system 1 stone 635029318 kilograms

Maccabi Haifa Football Club was established in 1913 in the port city of Haifa It was a small struggling club that spent most of its time bouncing between the Liga Leumit and the lower leagues 

The club was overshadowed by their city rivals Hapoel Haifa who were then the darling club of the city of Haifa and especially of then mayor Abba Hushi But even in its first years the club adapted a very adventurous and offensive style of play based on technique and short passes In 1942 the club reached the Israel State Cup final but was humiliated 12 1 by Beitar Tel Aviv in the final which is the clubs worst defeat ever In 1962 the club won its only honour until the 80s when the team defeated Maccabi Tel Aviv 5 2 in the State Cup final In 1963 they reached the final again but failed to defend their title losing to arch rivals Hapoel Haifa 1 0

Maccabi Haifa F C is a professional football club in Israel Founded in 1913 it is Israels most successful club both domestically and in European competitions

In physical geography tundra is an area where the tree growth is hindered by low temperatures and short growing seasons The term tundra comes from tndr which means uplands tundra treeless mountain tract There are three types of tundra Arctic tundra Antarctic tundra and alpine tundra In all of these types the broken wikt linkvegetationvegetation is mostly grass moss and lichens Trees grow in some of the tundra The boundary between the tundra and the forest is known as the tree line or timberlineThe area itself encircles the Arctic Ocean of the Northern Hemisphere The climate in a tundra biome consists of freezing cold and dryness in the winter and cold summers The tundra ground is a barren place often covered with rocks Most water on the tundra is frozen within the soil The permanent frozen soil is called permafrost Permafrost and fierce winds prevent large trees from growing deep roots Plants in the tundra are small and grow close to the ground Plants called cushions grow in tight clumps in the tundra but lichens are the dominant plants Lichens cover the rocks The few trees that do grow on the tundra are dwarf willows and birch

The deep and cold snow makes life in the tundra very difficult Every animal must adapt in order to survive Some have thick fur that turns white during the winter Others find places to hibernate during the winter months Some examples of animals that live in the tundra are rodents hares sables caribou wolves arctic foxes bears walruses seals and snowy owls

The tree line or timberline is the edge of the habitat at which trees can grow Beyond the tree line they are unable to grow as conditions are too bad

There are several types of tree lines defined in ecology and geology

At the tree line tree growth is often not clear with the last trees forming low bushes If it is caused by wind these are known as krummholz from the German for twisted wood

The tree line like many other natural lines appears well defined from a distance but upon close inspection it is not that clear Trees grow shorter until they simply stop growing

Some typical tree line tree species

The alpine tree line at a location is dependent on local variables such as aspect of slope rain shadow and proximity to either geographical pole Given this caveat here is a list of average tree lines from locations around the globe

Like the alpine tree lines shown above polar tree lines are heavily influenced by local variables such as aspect of slope and degree of shelter trees can often grow in river valleys at latitudes where they could not grow on a more exposed site Maritime influences such as ocean currents also play a major role in determining how far from the equator trees can grow Here are some typical polar treelines

 The lift force lifting force or simply lift is the sum of all the forces on a body that force it to move perpendicular to the direction of flow 

The most common type of lift is that of a wing of an aircraft But there are many other common uses such as propellers on both aircraft and boats rotors on helicopters fan blades sails on sailboats and wind turbines

While the common meaning of the term lift suggests an upwards action lift can be in any direction For instance for a sail the lift is horizontal and for the wing on a race car the lift is down

There are a number of ways of explaining the production of lift some are more complicated than others some have been shown to be false The simplest explanation is that the wing deflects air downward and the reaction pushes the wing up More complicated explanations focus on the air pressure around the wing but these approaches are merely different expressions of the same underlying physical principles



The tropics are the region of the Earth near to the equator and between the Tropic of Cancer in the northern hemisphere and the Tropic of Capricorn in the southern hemisphere This region is also referred to as the tropical zone and the torrid zone

This area includes all the areas of the Earth where the sun reaches a point directly overhead at least once a year The word tropics comes from Greek tropos meaning turn because the apparent position of the Sun moves between the two tropics within a year 

Tropical plants and animals are those species that live in the tropics Tropical is also sometimes used in a general sense for a tropical climate a climate that is warm to hot and moist year round often with the sense of lush vegetation However there are places in the tropics that are anything but tropical in this sense with even alpine tundra and snow capped peaks including Mauna Kea Mt Kilimanjaro and the Andes as far south as the northernmost parts of Chile and Argentina Places in the tropics which are drier with low humidity are such as the Sahara Desert and Central Africa and Northern Australian Outback 

Kilimanjaro formerly Kaiser Wilhelm Spitze is a mountain in northeastern Tanzania Kilimanjaro is the tallest free standing mountain rise in the world rising 4600 meters from the base and includes the highest peak in Africa at 5895 meters It gives a dramatic view from the surrounding plains 

Mt kilimanjaro is also a strato like volcano It has explosive eruptions The last major eruption was about 100000 years ago

A tropical climate is a type of climate typical in the tropics It is a damp climate in which all twelve months have mean temperatures above 18C Tropical Climates have almost continuous rainfall throughout the year usually in the afternoon

Alpine tundra is a type of geological terrain It is to be found at high enough altitude at any latitude on Earth Alpine tundra lacks trees The lower parts do not have permafrost Because of this they are generally better drained than permafrost soils Alpine tundra changes to subalpine forests below the tree line 

Because alpine tundra is located in many different widely separated regions of the Earth there is no animal species found in all areas of alpine tundra

Some animals of alpine tundra environments include the Kea parrot marmot Mountain goats chinchilla pika golden eagle and snow leopard

Very cold and dry Winter temperatures below 10C Mainly mosses lichens and poor grasses Some dwarf trees like birch and alder grow in Tundras all types of tundra are classified as a dessert

Tundras are mainly found in Northern areas such as Siberia and the North of Canada

A fumarole is an opening in the crust of the Earth often in the neighborhood of volcanoes where steam and gases come out for instance carbon dioxide sulfur dioxide hydrochloric acid and hydrogen sulfide 

The name solfatara is given to fumaroles with sulfurous gases

The Kppen climate classification is one of the most widely used climate classification systems It was developed by Wladimir Kppen a German climatologist around 1900 It is based on the concept that native vegetation is the best expression of climate thus climate zone boundaries have been selected with vegetation distribution in mind

A polar circle is either the Arctic Circle or the Antarctic Circle On earth the Arctic Circle is at a latitude of 66 33 38 N and the Antarctic Circle is at a latitude of 66 33 38 S Areas between each polar circle and its pole will each year have at least one 24 hour period when the sun is continuously above the horizon and at least one 24 hour period when the sun is continuously below the horizion 

The Seine is a major river of north western France It is a commercial way and a tourist attraction particularly within the city of Paris The river is 776 km long It flows into the Atlantic the English Channel near Le Havre

Walk or Walking is the way people or animals travel on their legs If a person goes out walking it is said that he or she went for a walk Walking for a long time is known as a healthy exercise

The horizon is the line that separates earth from sky But at many places the true horizon cannot be seen as there are trees buildings mountains and so forth The line is then called visible horizon 

An arid environment has a high deficit of rainfall or snow So there is much less humidity added during the year than would be necessary for the demand for evaporation and transpiration This is mostly due to the high temperatures and few storms that bring rainfall Regions are classified as arid if their aridity index falls between 005 and 020

Most deserts are semi arid arid or hyperarid with the exception of Antarctica

The muon is an elementary particle It has a negative electric charge and half spin Its symbol is  It is one type of lepton

The muon has an average life time of 22 micro seconds or 00000022 seconds

A muon is like an electron but it is 200 times heavier Unlike an electron it decays into other particles The superparticle of a muon is called a smuon

Muons can be made in Particle accelerators with energy levels above 1057 MeV Cosmic rays from the Sun also make muons

Muons are unstable elementary particles and are heavier than electrons and neutrinos but lighter than all other matter particles They decay via the weak interaction Because the total of the lepton numbers of the starting and ending particles must be the same one of the product neutrinos of muon decay must be a muon type neutrino and the other an electron type antineutrino Because charge must be kept the same one of the products of muon decay is always an electron of the same charge as the muon So all muons decay to at least an electron and two neutrinos Sometimes besides these necessary products additional other particles that have a net charge and spin of zero are produced

The dominant muon decay mode is the simplest possible the muon decays to an electron an electron antineutrino and a muon neutrino Antimuons in mirror fashion most often decay to the corresponding antiparticles a positron an electron neutrino and a muon antineutrino

Magnoliopsida or dicotyledons is the name of a class of plants in taxonomy They are also called dicots It is the biggest group of flowering plants Seedlings in this group have two seed leaves Monocots have one seed leaf

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is the name for a number of procedures that should be applied if a person stop breathing or if they suffered from cardiac arrest These measures are performed to keep up an artificial circulation so that vital organs still get oxygen CPR does not start a persons heart again but it can keep the blood flowing around the body long enough for proper emergency treatment to be given

CPR can be done at different levels People outside the medical profession are usually expected to recognise the condition to alert emergency services and to keep up the artificial respiration perhaps with the use of an automated tool called defibrillator Emergency staff is trained to restart the circulation and to get the patients heart beating again These people can use drugs intubation artificial pacemakers and defibrillation to achieve this result

CPR is normally started on a person who is not breathing and is unconscious It is continued until the heart can be restarted or the cause is diagnosed CPR consists of regular compressions of the chest and rescue breathing If a persons heart is working properly but they are not breathing the aided breathing is called artificial respiration The aim of CPR is to keep a small amount of oxygenated blood flowing to the brain and heart so that if they are successfully resuscitated they are not permanently brain damaged

Time is a very important factor Each minute that passes before the onset of the CPR measures lowers the chance of survival by about ten percent In the case where the CPR starts within the first three to five minutes and a defibrillator is available the chance of survival can be as high as 50 or even 75 In European countries emergency services take about eight minutes or more to arrive once they have been alerted A victims survival therefore largely depends on the presence and quick action of other people present A quick call to emergency services and a quick start of basic CPR especially fibrillation can double to triple the chance of survival with adults and children

An airn is a type of white grape used to make wine

Jean Sibelius was a Finnish composer He is one of the most famous people from Finland and one of the greatest composers of symphonies of all times He was born at a time when Russia had a lot of power in Finland and the Finnish people were trying hard to keep their own culture and their independence This nationalism can be heard in a lot of his music especially some of the choral music After 1928 he composed very little He lived in retirement in his home in the Finnish countryside

Jean was born 100km north of the Finnish capital Helsinki His grandfather had changed the family name from a Finnish name to the Latin sounding Sibelius His father died during a cholera epidemic when Jean was very young His family spoke Swedish at home but when he was eleven he went to a Finnish speaking school He learned to play the violin and wanted to be a soloist He loved reading the Kalevala which was a long epic poem about the old Finnish legends He also loved the Swedish speaking poets who wrote poems about nature

In 1885 he went to Helsinki to study law but he soon gave up law and concentrated on his violin studies and composition He went to Berlin to continue his music studies He became good friends with the pianist and composer Ferruccio Busoni and went with him to Leipzig At this time he had mainly written chamber music In Vienna he had lessons from Karl Goldmark and heard lots of orchestral music He spent a lot of his money much of it on drink which was to be a big problem for him for many years

He went back to Finland in 1891 He earned money by teaching He wrote a big work for orchestra and singers called Kullervo The words were in Finnish the story was from the poem Kalevala This work made him famous

In 1892 he married Aino Jrnefelt Her father was a general and very keen on the Finnish language The Finnish were trying more and more at this time to be free of rule by Russia Sibelius wrote more patriotic music during the 1890s eg the tone poem En Saga and the Lemminkinen legends which include the popular The Swan of Tuonela His patriotic tone poem Finlandia is still very popular today His music at this time was influenced by Wagner and Tchaikovsky He also heard Finnish folk melodies and although he does not use them directly in his music they became part of his musical language In 1897 he was given a state pension which helped him financially although for many years he was still very often short of money because he had expensive tastes

Between 1899 and 1924 Sibelius composed the 7 symphonies which made him famous worldwide His friend the conductor Kajanus conducted Sibeliuss works when he took the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra on tour around Europe His wife was becoming worried about how much alcohol he was drinking in Helsinki so 1903 she persuaded him to move the family to a place called Ainola in the Finnish countryside They had a house built in Jrvenp Apart from a few short periods in Helsinki he spent the rest of his life there The first works he wrote there were his Symphony no 2 and the Violin Concerto He became seriously ill in 1908 and for several years he had to stop smoking cigars and drinking alcohol He continued to travel and visited England several times and the United States in 1914 where he was very popular After the war he continued to write more symphonies as well as some short light pieces The last great work that he wrote was the tone poem Tapiola in 1926 He tried to write another symphony but gave up and destroyed it He never wrote any more music He continued to live in retirement in his house in the Finnish country for another 30 years The house is now a Sibelius museum

Sibeliuss wife Aino came from a highly respectable family Although her father was a general in the army there was a very great interest in culture in the Jrnefeld family which included musicians painters and poets Jean fell in love with Aino on his first visit to her home Aino was to be a faithful wife to him all his life although she suffered a lot of hardship due to his drinking problems and his debts They had five daughters

Sibelius is best known for his symphonies and tone poems His symphonies are very different from one another none can be described as being typical of his style The early symphonies are Romantic in character in the later symphonies he tries out lots of new ideas and sounds His Violin Concerto is played by all the great violinists Sibelius wrote lots of songs for voice and piano These are mostly settings of Swedish poems He also wrote many choral works mostly in Finnish These vocal works are not so well known outside Finland because the language is not familiar abroad but there are some very good songs especially Luonnotar Besides his important works he also wrote many short works in order to earn enough money to live These include songs as well as many short piano pieces

Sibeliuss music today is extremely popular His music has also been an influence on recent composers

The Schutzstaffel abbreviated or SS was a large security and military organization of the National Socialist German Workers Party in Germany 

The SS was established in the 1920s as a personal guard unit for Nazi leader Adolf Hitler Heinrich Himmler was its leader from 1929 to 1945 During that time the SS grew from a small paramilitary formation to become one of the largest and most powerful organizations in Nazi Germany The Nazis saw the SS as an elite unit the partys Praetorian Guard with all SS personnel selected on the principles of racial purity and unconditional loyalty to the Nazi party 

In contrast to the black uniformed Allgemeine SS which was the political wing of the SS the military wing was called the Waffen SS which evolved into a second German army within the Wehrmacht It worked in tandem with the regular German army or Heer The Waffen SS compiled a record of fierce fighting and notorious brutality against civilians and prisoners of war Its units helped wipe out resistance by Polish Jews in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and slaughtered US prisoners of war near the Belgian town of Malmedy during the Battle of the Bulge in 1944

The SS was different from the German military Nazi party and German state officials because it had its own SS rank structure SS unit insignia and SS uniforms

As the Nazi party monopolized the political power in Germany key government functions such as law enforcement were simply absorbed into the SS Many SS organizations became the de facto government agencies To maintain the political power of the party the SS was given authority to establish and run the Sicherheitsdienst which was the security and intelligence service and the Geheime Staatspolizei or SS secret police effectively putting the SS above the law 

Heinrich Himmler the SS leader was one of the chief architects of the Final Solution The SS Einsatzgruppen murdered civilians mostly Jews in the countries occupied by Germany during World War II The SS was responsible for establishing and operating concentration camps and extermination camps in which millions of inmates died of inhumane treatment exploitation malnutrition or medical experiments After the war the judges of Nuremberg Trials declared the SS a criminal organization responsible for the implementation of racial policies of genocide and committing war crimes and crimes against humanity

A logarithm tells what exponent is needed to make a certain number so logarithms are the inverse of exponentiation

Just as an exponential function has three parts a logarithm has three parts The three parts of a logarithm are a base an argument and an answer

In this logarithm the base is 2 the argument is 8 and the answer is 3

Logarithms can make multiplication and division of large numbers easy because adding logarithms is the same as multiplying and subtracting logarithms is the same as dividing

Before calculators became cheap and common people used logarithm tables in books to multiply and divide The same information in a logarithm table was available on a slide rule a tool with logarithms written on it

William Penn was an English colonial leader He was given what would become the US state of Pennsylvania by King Charles II as a debt to his father Penn was a member of the Religious Society of Friends

Penn and his wife were made honorary United States citizens in 1984 by US President Ronald Reagan

George Herman Ruth Jr also known as Babe The Great Bambino The Sultan of Swat The broken wikt linkcolossusColossus of Clout and The King Of Crash was a very famous baseball player during the 1920s and 1930s in Major League Baseball He played with the Boston Red Sox New York Yankees and the Boston Braves and hit 714 home runs in his career Only two players Hank Aaron and Barry Bonds have hit more

Ruth learned to play baseball while growing up in Baltimore Maryland His first Major League Baseball team was the Boston Red Sox Ruth began playing as a pitcher He had some of the best pitching statistics in baseball The Red Sox won the World Series in 1915 1916 and 1918

At that time there was no designated hitter rule in the American League where the Red Sox played so Ruth got chances to hit as a pitcher The team realized that he was also good at hitting In 1918 Ruth began hitting more and pitching less He became an outfielder

Ruth was becoming a star player However by 1919 Red Sox owner Harry Frazee was having problems with money In 1920 the Red Sox sold Ruth to the New York Yankees for cash Even though the Red Sox had won several World Series in the years before this they would not win another one until 2004 Many baseball fans believed that the Red Sox had become cursed by trading Ruth and called this the Curse of the Bambino

Ruth spent most of the rest of his career with the Yankees where he became one of the most famous players in baseball history Ruth helped the Yankees win World Series championships in 1923 1927 1928 and 1932 He left the Yankees after the 1934 season and played one last season with the Boston Braves in 1935

In 1927 Ruth hit 60 home runs which was then a record for the most home runs in one season The record was broken by Roger Maris in 1961

Ruth died of throat cancer on August 16 1948

He also had a 474 career on base percentage which is second all time to Ted Williams 482

The band was originally called Creep and had another singer

People often say they created the nu metal genre Along with other bands of the time they were influences for a wave of nu metal alternative metal and rap metal bands through the mid 1990s and early 2000s helping Limp Bizkit and Slipknot more than other bands Despite this Korn have been quoted for disliking the term and even being called metal Jonathan Davis has said that Korns music can not be classified and that it contains many other influences besides simply metal The official review on the iTunes Store for their first album goes as far as saying that Korn hate the term 

Their first album was first sold in 1994 and also called KoRn Since then Korn has sold over 35 millions records worldwide  including 165 millions in the US making them one of the best selling metal acts of the last twelve years The bands catalogue consists of seven platinum studio albums in a row one platinum compilation album and seven consecutive debuts in top 10 of Billboard Top 200 best selling albums Korn has been selected for 6 Grammys and won 2 such awards 8 of their albums has been awarded as multi platinum despite only part of them being on Billboard

Aspirin is a brand name of Acetylsalicylic acid It has many uses but is most commonly used as a pain killer or used to reduce Fever or Inflammation It also has an Anti Platelet effect  it reduces the number of Platelets in the blood which reduces blood clotting in that function it is used to prevent Heart Attacks

There are some possible side effects to this drug for example high doses can create damage to the kidneys and children can develop Reyes syndrome through the use of this drug which causes the liver to become fatty and not work properly and also the brain to become enlarged It can be fatal however most children with Reyes syndrome survive with treatment

People with lung kidney disease Gout Hyperuricemia Hemophilia Diabetes or high blood pressure should not take aspirin except on the advice of a qualified medical professional Nor should people who are allergic to it to Ibuprofen or to Naproxen People with Asthma where attacks are brought about by aspirin should avoid using any Anti inflammatory drugs based on it 

The brand name is trademarked by the German firm Bayer in 80 countries worldwide but in countries where it is not trademarked aspirin is the generic name for the drug

Vctor Jara was a singer from Chile South America 

He was born into a family of very poor peasants but through a lot of hard work and effort was able to enter the University of Chile  something very unusual in a poor country like Chile In this manner he was able to escape the poverty of his parents 

At University he studied dramatic arts or acting he taught and directed theatre productions During this time he met and married Joan Turner a British ballet dancer and choreographer who worked in Chile 

Later Vctor Jara started to write and sing songs He began to sing songs about the life of humble and poor people in his country peasants factory workers miners abandoned children poor women He also dedicated music albums to people who live in the shanty towns 

Vctor Jara tried to use his music to bring awareness about the inequality between the richest and the poorest people in society How poor folk have a hard time acquiring the most basic things such as food health care education and housing He also supported politicians who called for a fairer distribution of wealth to end poverty 

In 1973 Vctor Jara was killed by a military dictatorship led by General Augusto Pinochet for singing songs about social problems and social injustice The US government of Richard Nixon supported the military regime

The company used to be known as the World Wrestling Federation or the WWF They changed their name to World Wrestling Entertainment after a lawsuit filed by the World Wildlife Fund

WWE has championships which are recognitions of a wrestler being the best in their brand The most important championships are the WWE Championship for Raw and the World Heavyweight Championship for SmackDown

There are also championships for specific divisions This includes the WWE Divas Championship which is fought for by the women on both brands There is also a tag team championship that is shared by both brands

Scutellosaurus was a small bipedal herbivorous dinosaur from the Lower Jurassic period 200196 million years ago It was about a metre long

Its back was armoured and it is placed in the Thyreophora with the other armoured dinosaurs It was one of the earliest members of this group and the most basal form so far known Its closest relatives may have been Emausaurus and Scelidosaurus These and the larger armoured dinosaurs Ankylosaurus Stegosaurus and Huayangosaurus were all quadrupedal The lightly built bipedal Scutellosaurus is similar in form to the ancestral dinosaurs which were bipedal

Scutellosaurus was around convert12mft long convert50cmin tall at the hips and weighed convert10kglb The fossil evidence includes two partial skeletons recovered from Arizona although of the skull only the lower jaw has been recovered There were also several hundred scutes running along its neck to its back and as far down as its tail Some of these shields were flat while others were pitted It had an unusually long tail possibly a counterbalance to the weight of the armoured body and long arms that suggest it may have browsed on all fours

The London Eye is a large metal structure It is also known as the Millennium Wheel and is one of the largest observation wheels in the world It was opened in 2000 It is 135 metres high The London Eye is a popular tourist destination More than three million people visited it last year At the time it was built in 1999 it was the tallest giant wheel in the world But then the London Eye was overtaken in May 2006 by the Star of Nanchang which is 160 metres high and stands in the eastern Chinese city Nanchang But on the 11th February 2008 the Singapore flyer overtook the Star of Nanchang with 165 metres The London Eye stands at the western end of Jubilee Garden on the South Bank of the river Thames between Westminster Bridge and Hungerford Bridge

Finlandia is a symphonic poem by the Finnish composer Jean Sibelius He wrote it in 1899 and made some changes to it the next year Finlandia is the Latin name for Finland At the time Sibelius wrote it Finland was called the Grand Duchy of Finland This was because it was being ruled by Russia The Finnish people wanted to rule Finland for themselves The music was composed for a pageant to encourage the Finnish people to work for freedom

Transpiration is the evaporation of water loss of water from those parts of plants that are outside the earth especially leaves but also stems flowers and fruits The amount of water lost by a plant depends on its size along with the surrounding light intensity temperature humidity wind speed and soil water supply

It happens because the plant needs to open its pores in order to obtain carbon dioxide gas from the air for photosynthesis Transpiration also cools plants and enables the flow of mineral nutrients from roots to shoots This mass flow is caused by the lower water pressure in the upper parts of the plants 

The reason for this low pressure is that water gets out of the leaves into the atmosphere Water gets into the plant at the roots by osmosis and it transports dissolved mineral nutrients to the upper parts of the plant through the xylem Transpiration is a process similar to evaporation It is a part of the water cycle and it is the loss of water vapor from parts of plants especially in leaves but also in stems flowers and roots Leaf surfaces are dotted with openings which are collectively called stomata and in most plants they are more numerous on the undersides of the foliage The stoma are bordered by guard cells that open and close the pore 1 Leaf transpiration occurs through stomata and can be thought of as a necessary cost associated with the opening of the stomata to allow the diffusion of carbon dioxide gas from the air for photosynthesis Transpiration also cools plants and enables mass flow of mineral nutrients and water from roots to shoots Mass flow of liquid water from the roots to the leaves is caused by the decrease in hydrostatic pressure in the upper parts of the plants due to the diffusion of water out of stomata into the atmosphere Water is absorbed at the roots by osmosis and any dissolved mineral nutrients travel with it through the xylem The rate of transpiration is directly related to the evaporation of water particles from plant surfaces especially from the surface openings or stomates on leaves Stomatal transpiration accounts for most of the water loss by a plant but some direct evaporation also takes place through the surfaces of the epidermal cells of the leaves The amount of water given off depends somewhat upon how much water the roots of the plant have absorbed It also depends upon such environmental conditions as sunlight humidity winds and temperature A plant should not be transplanted in full sunshine because it may lose too much water and wilt before the damaged roots can supply enough water Transpiration occurs as the sun warms the water inside the blade The warming changes much of the water into water vapor This gas can then escape through the stomata Transpiration helps cool the inside of the leaf because the escaping vapor has absorbed heat Transpiration helps cool the inside of the leaf because the escaping vapor has absorbed heat degree of stomatal opening and to the evaporative demand of the atmosphere surrounding the leaf The amount of water lost by a plant depends on its size along with surrounding light intensity2 temperature humidity and wind speed Soil water supply and soil temperature can influence stomatal opening and thus transpiration rate A fully grown tree may lose several hundred gallons of water through its leaves on a hot dry day About 90 of the water that enters a plants roots is used for this process The transpiration ratio is the ratio of the mass of water transpired to the mass of dry matter produced the transpiration ratio of crops tends to fall between 200 and 10003 Transpiration rate of plants can be measured by a number of techniques including potometers lysimeters porometers photosynthesis systems and heat balance sap flow gauges Desert plants and conifers have specially adapted structures such as thick cuticles reduced leaf areas sunken stomata and hairs to reduce transpiration and conserve water Many cacti conduct photosynthesis in succulent stems rather than leaves so the surface area of the shoot is very low Many desert plants have a special type of photosynthesis termed crassulacean acid metabolism or CAM photosynthesis in which the stomata are closed during the day and open at night when transpiration will be lower

In botany a stoma is a tiny opening or pore that is used for gas exchange 

Air containing carbon dioxide and oxygen enters the plant through these openings where it is used in photosynthesis and respiration Waste oxygen produced by photosynthesis exits through these same openings Also water vapor gets into the atmosphere through these pores in a process called transpiration

The pore is formed by a pair of specialized cells known as guard cells which are responsible for regulating the size of the opening and found mostly on the under surface of a plant leaf

Johann Georg Leopold Mozart was a composer music teacher and violinist He was the father and teacher of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart

Famine is a situation where there is not enough food for people to eat Without food the human body grows weaker and weaker until the person becomes very sick or dies In poor countries such as in parts of Africa famine can be common

The great Irish famine was a great famine that lasted from 1846 to 1849 in Ireland It was caused by Phytophthora infestans a kind of water mould it killed potatoes one of the main crops of Ireland at the time

In the Holodomor millions of people starved to death in the Ukraine in 1932 and 1933 as the Soviet Union government looked on

In telecommunications and signal processing Frequency modulation transmits information over a carrier wave by varying the frequency This technique is different from amplitude modulation which varies the amplitude but keeps the frequency constant In the context of broadcasting radio signals Frequency modulation is often shortened to FM When transmitting analogue sound the sound quality of FM signals is better than that of amplitude modulation signals However FM signals do not travel as far as AM

Many radio stations send out both kinds of signals reserving AM for talk shows and FM for music In addition FM is usually sent as two signals which can come to two different speakers in a home This creates FM stereo sound

The Monty Hall problem is a famous problem in probability The problem is based on a television game show from the United States Lets Make a Deal It is named for the host of this show Monty Hall

In the problem there are three doors A car is behind one door and goats behind the other two doors First the player chooses a door but does not open it Then the host who has knowledge of what is behind every door opens a different door which he is certain has a goat behind it Last the host lets the player choose whether to keep what is behind the first door or to change choices to the third door The rules of the problem are that the host has to open a door with a goat behind and has to let the player switch The question is whether changing choices increases the chances of getting the car

The chances of the car being behind the two doors that are still closed seem equal so most people say changing choices does not increase the chances of getting the car The true answer is that changing choices increases the chances of getting the car from 13 to 23

That comes from the fact that the player by choosing one door out of three has a one chance in three of selecting the door with the car The chance of the car being somewhere behind the other two doors is two out of three So to improve his chance of winning a car the player if given the choice should swap his one door for the other two doors right away But wait The host then tries to confuse the player by opening one of his own goat doors That changes nothing remember that the player is still swapping his one door for the other two doors

These are the options

1 If the player picks the car then the host will show a goat Then if the player changes his choice he will get a goat 

2 If the player picks a goat then the host will show the other goat Then if the player changes his choice he will get a car

3 If the player picks the other goat then the host will show the first goat Then if the player changes his choice he will get a car

So it is true that if the player changes then the player will win a car two times out of three

An emergency telephone number is a telephone number that can be used to quickly contact emergency services for assistance Many countries public telephone networks have a single emergency telephone number sometimes known as the universal emergency telephone number or the emergency services number Most emergency service numbers are three digits long so that they can be dialled quickly and remembered easily Some countries have a different emergency number for each of the different emergency services but they are often different only by the last digit

Satellite cities are smaller cities that are next to a large city that is the center of a metropolitan area They are different from suburbs subdivisions and bedroom communities because they have their own governments and enough jobs to support their own people Satellite cities could be separate cities outside of the larger metropolitan areas However working as part of a metropolis a satellite city gets cross commuting

Shanty towns are small towns in the outskirts of many cities especially in third world countries Normaly there are not many shanty towns in more economically developed countries Often of low cost with houses badly built with plywood corrugated metal sheets of plastic cardboard or any available material Often irregular structures good enough to keep the rain away or to protect from the summer sun Pets and animals are often left to roam for food and water 

Lack of clean water sanitation and toilets often make people especially children more exposed to illnesses such as hepatitis and cholera 

Many are built on land without a permit and often have no roads numbered street electricity or telephone lines Some homes in shanty towns have some services but they are unkept and pose health and fire hazards Sometimes shanty towns can take up whole parts of a city and may include millions of dwellers  such as in the cities of Brazil 

Many shanty town settlements are built on the banks of rivers and as a result the residents suffer the effect of floods or from industrial toxins in the water Some are built close to rubbish dumps

Residents of shanty town often have poor health lack education high crime suicides and shorter life expectancy

Pterodactyloidea is the suborder of short tailed pterosaurs Their fossil record starts in the late Jurassic They become extinct in the KT extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous period Pterodactylus Pteranodon and Quetzalcoatlus are in this suborder

This is the classification of the different divisions of pterodactyloidea

Michael Praetorius was a German composer organist and music theorist He was one of the most important composers of his day and he wrote lots of different kinds of music A lot of his music is based on hymns of the Protestant church

We are not quite certain about the date of his birth He was born at a time when there was a lot of argument about religion in Germany His father was a strict Lutheran and lost his job more than once because of his beliefs We know very little about the life of Praetorius He seems to have gone to the Lateinschule in Torgau where he had music lessons from Michael Voigt He probably never had music lessons after he left school Then he went to the University of Frankfurt an der Oder There Praetorius graduated in divinity Afterwards he found a job as organist to the Duke of Brunswick Wolfenbttel He soon earned a good salary He married in 1603 and had two sons

Although he had his job in Wolfenbttel for many years he also worked a lot in Dresden where he met Heinrich Schtz and in Magdeburg where he met Samuel Scheidt His health was not good possibly because he worked so hard When he died he left a lot of money to the poor

Praetorius wrote a very large amount of music Much of it has been lost He wrote a collection of French dances called Terpsichore for a small group of instruments These are very happy pieces and are very popular today A lot of his music is based on Protestant hymns written for the services in the Lutheran church He liked to write music in which two groups of singers or instrumentalists alternate His music for choir which includes many motets shows him to be one of the best composers of his time He liked to write music for two three or four choirs The tune would be in the top part so that the congregation could join in

Praetorius wrote a book about music theory called Syntagma Musicum Part One talks about religious music It is very interesting for us today because it tells us a lot about the way that Martin Luther wanted to change music in the church services In Part Two he described the musical instruments of his day Part Three talks about musical forms this included discussions about things like music notation transposition solmization and how to write for large choirs He was going to write a Part Four in which he wanted to discuss the technique of musical composition but he died before he could write it

In music the pitch of a note means how high or low a note is

The pitch of a note can be measured in a unit called Hertz A note that is vibrating at 256 Hz will be caused by sound waves that vibrate at 256 times a second This will be Middle C on the piano

Not all musical instruments give notes of a particular pitch Many percussion instruments like drums triangles and cymbals are instruments used for rhythms They do not play tunes because they have no definite pitch 

Some musicians have a sense of absolute pitch or perfect pitch This means that they always know what note is being played even without comparing it to another note Having a sense of absolute pitch does not necessarily make someone a good musician although it can be very useful

A congregation is a group of people who have come together for something usually for religious worship In Christian churches the word congregation is often used to mean all the people in the main part of the church but not the choir or the priests This term came from long ago after the church was first formed For example the order of service might say that the choir will sing verse 1 of a carol and the congregation are asked to join in at verse 2

The Soursop also known as the Zuurzak is a type of fruit that grows on a tree The tree is from warm parts of the Americas At first it was only found in the Caribbean islands parts of Central America and parts of South America Now it is grown in other warm and wet places such as the Pacific islands Florida and South East Asia

This fruit is large and has a spiky green skin which is not eaten The inside of the fruit is white and contains a sweet but sharp tasting juice The soursop contains black or brown seeds that are not eaten The fruit can be eaten raw or it can be made into juice for drinking The juice is used to make sweets candy and ice cream

Some people use the soursop fruit or leaves as a medicine Although the fruit contains sugars and a lot of vitamins it may not be good to eat a lot of it Scientists think that the soursop may make some people ill

A pond apple is a type of fruit It is not related to the apple They usually live near or in water

High and low are terms used to describe altitude They can also mean several other things High is the opposite of low Generally high means more of something and low means less of something 

High can mean an emotional condition He was high means that he was over excited Being high is slang for how someone feels when they are taking drugs

Height is how far one thing is above another It is usually the distance from the ground to something It can also be the distance from the top of something to the bottom of it

When measuring the height of something this measurement is how tall something is

Above and below are terms used about where things are compared to each other Something that is above something else is higher than it Something that is below something else is lower than it Above is the opposite of below

If the cheese in the refrigerator is on the top shelf and the meat is on the bottom shelf the cheese is above the meat It is higher than the meat The meat is below the cheese It is lower than the cheese

The words high and low can be used in many ways which may not always mean the distance from the ground

High numbers are big numbers Low numbers are small numbers If a number is greater than another number it is higher than that number

The pitch of a sound can be called high or low How high or low a note is depends on the frequency of the vibrations The higher the frequency the higher the pitch of the sound

High can mean advanced or greater

Sometimes high and low mean something like good and bad

High can mean an emotional condition He was high means that he was over excited Being high is slang for how someone feels when they are taking drugs

A pore in general is some form of opening usually very small

In biology

Vegetation means the plant life of a region or the plant community It means all ground cover by plants and is the main element of the biosphere When you say vegetation you do not think of any species composition life forms structure spatial extent naturalness or any other specific botanical or geographic characteristics That is meant by flora which refers exclusively to species composition 

Vegetation can refer to a wide range of spatial scales Primeval redwood forests coastal mangrove stands sphagnum bogs desert soil crusts roadside weed patches wheat fields cultivated gardens and lawns all are meant by the term vegetation

Player Killing is a part of online gaming with real people It is when you kill another persons character Some other terms in pking are PJing which means pile jumping or attacking someone when they are picking up the items dropped by a player they have just killed a player Safer which means someone who PKs safely and does not take risks making it widely considered unfair on the people trying to PK them and DD which means death dot which is when people in a Player Killing team all stand in the same place as each other making it appear to other players that there is only one person there However safing varies in how other people perceive it It can be used to stay alive however you usually lose a chance to hit when healing

The sebaceous glands are microscopic glands in the skin which produce an oilywaxy substance called sebum to lubricate the skin and hair In people these glands are found in greatest amounts on the face and scalp joined near the top inside hair follicles or sweat pores However they are in all skin areas except the palms and soles of the feet There are different kinds of these glands and sebum In the eyelids meibomian sebaceous glands emit a special kind of sebum into tears There are several related medical conditions including acne sebaceous cysts hyperplasia sebaceous adenoma and sebaceous gland carcinoma Washing skin or hair with plain detergent can cut the amount of sebum in oily skin Also water temperature over convert84FClkon can keep sebum melted during a wash

As a branched kind of acinar gland the sebaceous glands are found in people all over the skin except in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet

Sebaceous glands are often found in hair covered areas where they are connected near the top of hair follicles The glands deposit sebum on each hair and bring it to the skin surface along the hair shaft The structure consisting of hair hair follicle arrector pili muscle and sebaceous gland is known as a pilosebaceous unit 

Sebaceous glands are also found in non haired areas of the eyelids nose penis labia minora and nipples Here the sebum travels along ducts which end inside sweat pores near the surface of the skin

At the rim of the eyelids meibomian glands are a specialized form of sebaceous gland They secrete a form of sebum onto the eye which slows the drying of tears

Sebaceous glands produce the oily waxy substance called sebum that is made of fat wax and the leftover dead fat producing cells In the glands sebum is produced within specialized cells and is released as these cells burst sebaceous glands are thus classified as holocrine glands

Sebum has no smell but its bacterial breakdown can produce a bad smell Sebum is the cause of some people experiencing oily hair as in hot weather or if not washed for several days Earwax is partly composed of sebum Sebum can be washed using plain detergent to dissolve the waxy material in the skin Also water for washing should be over convert84FClkon to keep the sebum melted

Excess sebum has been linked to eating red meats fried oily or other foods but studies are not conclusive

It is commonly believed that sebum acts to save skin from drying or to waterproof hair and skin But some scientists have contended that low levels of sebaceous gland activity are not correlated with dry skin and it may serve little or no purpose in modern humans

The substances in sebum vary between species In people the lipid content is as follows

Also sapienic acid is a sebum fatty acid that is found only in people not in animals

The following medicines have been shown to reduce the flow of sebum from skin

The sebaceous glands of a human fetus in utero secrete a substance called Vernix caseosa a waxy or cheesy white substance covering the skin of newborn babies

The activity of the sebaceous glands increases during puberty because of heightened levels of androgens In males sebaceous glands begin to appear predominantly on the penis on the shaft and around the rim of the penile head during and after puberty This is however normal not to be confused with an STD In females they appear predominantly in the labia minora

Sebaceous glands are involved in skin problems such as oily skin acne and keratosis pilaris In the skin pores sebum and keratin can create a hyperkeratotic plug called a microcomedo which can block a pore and cause pimples The prescription medicine isotretinoin significantly reduces the amount of sebum produced by the sebaceous glands and is used to treat acne

The extreme use of anabolic steroids by bodybuilders for muscle gain can also cause acne The sebaceous gland is stimulated due to some steroid conversion into dihydrotestosterone This event may cause serious acne on the face neck chest back and shoulders

A blocked sebaceous gland can result in a sebaceous cyst 

A condition involving enlarged sebaceous glands is known as sebaceous hyperplasia 

Sebaceous gland carcinoma is a very uncommon and aggressive form of cancer involving the sebaceous glands sebaceous adenoma is a more benign neoplasm of the sebaceous glands

Sebum can also build up around body piercings

Certain species of Demodex mites feed on sebum and are commonly found in the sebaceous glands of mammals including those of humans

The preputial glands of mice and rats are large modified sebaceous glands that produce pheromones

A microorganism or microbe is a living thing that is too small to be visible to the human eye The study of microorganisms is called microbiology 

Microorganisms can be bacteria fungi archaea or protists Some microbiologists also include viruses but others consider these as non living

Most micro organisms are single celled or unicellular organisms but there are unicellular protists that are visible to the human eye and some multicellular species are microscopic

Microorganisms live almost everywhere on earth where there is liquid water including hot springs on the ocean floor and deep inside rocks within the earths crust Such habitats are lived in by extremophiles

Microorganisms are critical to nutrient recycling in ecosystems because they act as decomposers Because some microorganisms can also take nitrogen out of the air they are an important part of the nitrogen cycle Pathogenic or harmful microbes can invade other organisms and cause disease

Free living microbes get their energy in many different ways Some use photosynthesis like plants do Some break down natural chemicals in their environment Others feed on things that were once living such as fallen leaves and dead animals causing them to breakdown or decay The decayed materials mix with soil providing essential nutrients for plants to use Without this process the nutrients in the soil would run out These types of organisms are called decomposers They are the natural recyclers of living things on our planet Microbes also help us make some of our foods such as bread cheese yogurt beer and wine They feed on the sugar in grain fruit or milk giving these foods a special texture and taste 

Some microbes often called germs cause illness or disease They are parasites which live by invading living things Chickenpox mumps and measles are caused by these germs They are infectious diseases Some microbes can cause food to decay Moldy bread or fruit sour milk and rotten meat are examples of decayed food If eaten this rotten food and drink can cause stomach upsets Other microbes cause tooth decay You can protect yourself from harmful microbes by storing and preparing food properly cleaning your teeth washing your hands and by avoiding close contact with ill people

Amoeba is well known as a unicellular organism a protist The amoeba was first discovered by August von Rosenhof in 1757 It is a genus of protozoa that moves with false feet called pseudopodia

The amoeba is a member of a whole group of amoeboid eukaryotic protists They are heterotrophs eating bacteria and other protists

These are unique extensions of the organisms membrane They are used by the amoeba for phagocytosis and motility

Amoebae are often found within freshwater typically on vegetation in decay in still or slow moving water or in the benthic zone of some lakes However they are common organisms of study because it is easy to keep them in a laboratory They are used to study protozoa and to demonstrate cell structure and function 

A laboratory is a work place where scientific research experiments or measurement are done 

The word laboratory is also used for other places where the work done or equipment used are like those in scientific laboratories These include

Scientific laboratories can be found in schools and universities in hospitals in industry in government or military facilities and even aboard ships and spacecraft

Pseudopods or pseudopodia are a special way of amoebas to change their form to be able to move 

The false foot extends from the amoeba Then the main part of the amoeba flows into that pseudopod and the amoeba has changed its place 

Pseudopods are one of the three locomotion modes of unicellular organisms Pseudopods can also capture prey by phagocytosis

Pseudopods can be classified into several varieties according to their appearance

Heretic is a first person shooter video game made by ID Software for computers It is like Doom but it takes place in a fantasy world The monsters are mostly not human The player has the ability to look up and down which they could not do in Doom The weapons are also fantasy weapons It uses the same base as Doom and Doom 2 It has two sequels Hexen and Heretic 2

In a general sense locomotion simply means active movement or travel not only of biological individuals

Forms of locomotion are walking running crawling climbing swimming and flying 

A meerkat is a small mammal that lives in the Kalahari Desert in southern Africa It is a member of the mongoose family A group of meerkats is called a mob gang or mannor and usually all of the meerkats are brothers and sisters 

The meerkats scientific name is Suricata suricatta Some people call meerkats suricates People in South Africa call the meerkat the sun angel The name meerkat was invented by the Afrikaans language and the Dutch language

Meerkats live in holes in the ground called burrows They are active during the day and they also live in large family groups The group is led by a female and a male The meerkats are often all family They get rid of fleas in each others fur to become friends which is called grooming Sometimes if a minor member is in trouble with the leader it will groom the leader to try and calm them down

The meerkats help each other When the family is eating or playing together one meerkat takes time out and looks for animals that might want to eat meerkats If he or she sees one then he gives a chirp and the group runs to a burrow to be safe Also when pups are looking for food adults bring them food and teach them how to eat it 

Before pups start looking for food with the group they are babysat by older members at the burrow to protect them from danger Sometimes a female who never gave birth will produce milk for the pups

Meerkats can share their burrows with many different animals such as other mongooses and sometimes squirrels who live on the ground Sometimes even a snake will share the burrow with a meerkat 

Despite the family bond of meerkats sometimes a female might kill another females pups The leader might also kick out some females from the group Males sometimes leave the group for a short time to look for females in other groups to mate with

Meerkats have many different chirps that they use for different reasons They have a different chirp for being friends anger and for warning of an animal that will eat them

Meerkats eat mostly insects but they also eat lizards snakes spiders birds plants eggs and other small mammals Like all members of the mongoose family meerkats cannot be hurt by some venoms and they eat scorpions and some snakes without fear of illness poison or death They have no extra body fat so they must look for food every day and eat food every day

When the meerkat group is eating a guard will stand up and look for any animals that might eat its family If the guard sees an animal it gives a loud chirp and the family will run to a hole to be safe Many animals eat meerkats Most eagles hawks and falcons will eat them Baby meerkats called pups are sometimes also eaten by snakes Jackals and other big animals that eat meat will sometimes eat meerkats

When pups are looking for food they will cry loudly and an adult will come and feed them At first the adult gives the pup a dead animal then when the pup is older the adult will bring a live animal but will hurt it so the pup can kill it easier Then the adults start bringing live animals that are healthy and when the pup gets the hang of eating these the adults stop bringing food

The meerkat is a small mongoose that is awake during the day They weigh about one and a half pounds and the meerkat is ten to fourteen inches long The meerkat uses its tail to balance because it stands up on its back legs to look for animals that would eat it The eyes have black patches to lessen the bright light that comes into its eyes Meerkats have very long claws that help them dig and fight The back of the meerkat is furry and it has stripes to help it not be seen by predators The front side is black and has no fur because it needs to get warm in the morning to be ready for the day Meerkats also have ears that can open and close They close in order to keep sand out when they are burrowing

The meerkat is old enough to have children at one year Meerkats can have one to seven babies at one time Four is the most common Meerkats can give birth at any time of the year but like to give birth in spring and summer because there is more food Female meerkats can have up to three litters in one year When the babies are born they are pink and have no hair Their eyes and ears are closed When they are three weeks old the mother allows them to get out of the burrow By this time their eyes and ears have opened and they have light brown fur The babies cannot be left alone so one of the other meerkats besides the mother stays behind to watch them

After the mother mates with the father the babies develop for eleven weeks Then she gives birth in a burrow She feeds the babies milk until they start looking for food with the rest of the group which is when they turn one month old 

The leader of the group is a girl and her mate is the male leader This pair do not allow other minor members of their family to have babies If a female goes then the leader kicks her out and sometimes the leader kills her grandchildren Most of the meerkats in a group are either the leaders brothers and sisters or children 

New meerkat groups form when a female is kicked out and she teams up with a male and starts a new family

Therizinosaurus was a huge herbivorous theropod dinosaur from the end of the Cretaceous period 

New well preserved finds such as Alxasaurus in 1993 and Beipiaosaurus in 1996 provided details about the bird like pelvis feet and skulls of primitive members This helped confirm they belonged to the same group of theropod dinosaurs as Therizinosaurus and that therizinosaurs were more specifically advanced herbivorous maniraptoran theropods

Their fossils were first found in the late 1940s in Asia They were named in 1954 after more bones were found It was a thought to be a carnivore and herbivore it had very long claws  they were about 3 ft long 

The feeding habits of Therizinosaurus are unknown since no skull material has ever been found that could indicate its diet However like other therizinosaurs it was probably primarily herbivorous 

There are multiple possible functions that could have been served by the claws of Therizinosaurus such as defense against predators and in intraspecific fighting such as fighting for territory or for mating or to pull leafy tree branches towards its mouth The claws may have served all these functions

Diablo II Lord of Destruction Expansion

King Edward the Martyr or Eadweard II followed his father Edgar as King of England in 975 but was murdered after a reign of only a few years 

He was declared a holy martyr that means canonised as Saint Edward the Martyr in 1001 That seemed fair as Edward was thought to be a very good Christian who died for his faith and it was thought that the murderers were irreligious men

Edwards stepmother Queen Elfrida was against his accession to the throne as she wished her son Ethelred to become king instead But Edward was supported by more people  including St Dunstan  and was confirmed by the Witan 

King Edward was said to be a young man of great devotion and excellent conduct He was completely Orthodox good and of holy life Moreover he loved above all things God and the Church He was generous to the poor a haven to the good a champion of the Faith of Christ a vessel full of every virtuous grace 

On King Edwards accession to the throne there was a great famine in the land and violent attacks were stirred up against monasteries by a prominent noblemen who wanted the lands which his father King Edgar had endowed to them Many of these monasteries were destroyed and the monks forced to flee But the King stood firm together with archbishop Dunstan to defend the Church and the monasteries For this some of the nobles decided to remove him and replace him with his younger brother Ethelred 

On March 18 978 the king was hunting with dogs and horsemen near Wareham in Dorset Then he decided to visit his young brother Ethelred who was being brought up in the house of his mother Elfrida at Corfe Castle near Wareham He arrived alone at the castle When still on his horse Elfrida offered Edward a glass of mead and when he was drinking it he was stabbed in the back by one of the queens party Ethelred himself was then only ten years old so was not responsible for the murder An other tale comes from Henry of Huntingdon who tells that Elfrida herself committed the murder 

Edward was treasonably slain by his own family it is reported that his stepmother that is the mother of King Ethelred stabbed him with a dagger while she was in the act of offering him a cup to drink

The story of the relics of St Edward began at the moment of his death Immediately following the murder the body of the murdered king slipped from the saddle of his horse and was dragged with one foot in the stirrup until it fell into a stream at the base of the hill upon which Corfe Castle stands The queen then ordered that the body be quickly hidden in a hut nearby Within the hut however there lived a woman blind from birth whom the queen supported out of charity During the night a wonderful light appeared and filled the whole hut and struck with awe the woman cried out Lord have mercy and suddenly received her sight At this she discovered the dead body of the king The church of St Edward at Corfe Castle now stands on the site of this miracle At dawn the queen learned of the miracle and was troubled and again ordered the disposal of the body this time by burying it in a marshy place near Wareham But a year after the murder a column of fire was seen over the place where the body was hidden lighting up the whole area This was seen by some of the inhabitants of Wareham who raised the body Immediately a clear spring of healing water sprang up in that place Accompanied by what was now a huge crowd of mourners the body was taken to the church of the Most Holy Mother of God in Wareham and buried at the east end of the church This took place on February 13 980 

Because of a series of following miracles the relics were brought to the abbey at Shaftesbury When the relics were taken up from the grave they were found to be whole and not destroyed The transport of the relics was done in a great procession on February 13 981 and arrived at Shaftesbury seven days later There the relics were received by the nuns of Shaftesbury Abbey and were buried with full royal honours on the north side of the altar On the way from Wareham to Shaftesbury a further miracle had also taken place two crippled men were brought close to the bier and those carrying it lowered the body to their level and the cripples regained full health at once In 1001 the tomb in which the saint lay was said regularly to rise from the ground King Ethelred was filled with joy at this and instructed the bishops to raise his brothers tomb from the ground and place it into a more fitting place As the tomb was opened a wonderful fragrance issued from it  such that all present thought that they were standing in Paradise The bishops then took away the sacred relics from the tomb and placed them in a casket in the holy place of the Saints together with other holy relics This elevation of the relics of St Edward took place on June 20 1001 

St Edward was officially glorified by the All English Council of 1008 presided over by St Alphege archbishop of Canterbury King Ethelred ordered that the saints three feast days should be celebrated throughout England Shaftesbury Abbey was rededicated to the Mother of God and St Edward Shaftesbury was apparently renamed Edwardstowe only reverting to its original name after the Reformation Many miracles were recorded at the tomb of St Edward including the healing of lepers and the blind

During the sixteenth century under King Henry VIII monasteries were dissolved and many holy places were demolished but St Edwards remains were hidden so as to avoid desecration In 1931 the relics were recovered by Mr Wilson Claridge during an archaeological excavation their identity was confirmed by Dr TEA Stowell an osteologist In 1970 examinations performed on the relics suggested that the young man had been knifed in the back whilst riding his horse and had then been dragged along the ground by the terrified animal with his foot caught in a stirrup In about 1982 Mr Wilson Claridge donated the relics to the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia which placed them in a church in Brookwood Cemetery in Woking Surrey The St Edward Brotherhood of monks was organized there as well The church is now named St Edward the Martyr Orthodox Church Orthodox Christians recognize Edward and other Westerners whose sainthood was declared before the formal split between Orthodox and Catholics in the 11th century

Angel is a spin off from the American television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer Angel has a darker feel than Buffy and at times did better in the US Nielsen Ratings then Buffy The series was created by Buffys creator Joss Whedon along with David Greenwalt It first aired in October of 1999 Like Buffy it was produced by Whedons production company Mutant Enemy

The series tells the story of the vampire Angel Angel had his soul returned to him as punishment for killing a gypsy girl This made him tormented by all the bad things he had done During the first four seasons of the show he works as a private detective in a fiction version of Los Angeles California There he and a variety of others work to help the helpless and save the souls of those who had lost their way This usually meant fighting evil demons or humans that worked with demons He also had to fight his own violent nature The fifth season saw Angel taking over as the person in charge of the evil law firm Wolfram and Hart This was done to try to fight evil from the inside

Several years before the Angel first showed on television writer Joss Whedon created the idea behind Buffy the Vampire Slayer to change the Hollywood formula of the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed in every horror movie Whedon was not happy with the way that the Buffy idea was first done in the 1992 movie Buffy the Vampire Slayer He was given the chance to do the story better with the television series of the same name The early years of the series were about the life of Buffy Summers a high school aged vampire slayer and her group of friends in Sunnydale The supernatural parts in the series took the place of the real problems that are a part of adolescence and young adulthood The character Angel was first seen in the first episode He became a regular cast member during the secondthird seasons In the fictional universe created by Buffy Angel was born in 18th century Ireland After being turned into a soulless immortal vampire he became very well known for the evil things he did Over 100 years later Angel killed a gypsy girl Her family punished him by returning his soul He felt a very large amount of guilt for what he had done over all those years Angel eventually began on a path of redemption He hoped that he might make up for his past by doing good deeds In the Buffy third season final episode Angel leaves Sunnydale for Los Angeles to continue his path of redemption without Buffy Whedon believed that Angel was the one character who was bigger than life in the same way that Buffy was a kind of superhero 

While the main idea behind Buffy was High school as a horror movie in small town America Greenwalt and Whedon wanted to make Angel into a different gritty urban show 

Joss Whedon and David Greenwalt created a short video often called the Unaired Angel pilot for the WB Network The idea for the series was a new version of the old detective genre

On Valentines Day 2004 the WB Network said that Angel would not be brought back for a sixth season Joss Whedon posted a message on a popular fan site The Bronze Beta in which he showed his surprise He said he was heartbroken Fans created letter writing campaigns and online petitions They tried to get other networks UPN mainly to pick up the show 

Angels final episode Not Fade Away aired on the WB May 19 2004

Corfe Castle is a small village and ruined castle dating back to the 11th century It is in a gap in the Purbeck Hills five miles south of Wareham in Dorset England 

The oldest surviving structure on the castle site dates to the 11th century although there are good reasons to suppose that there was a stronghold there before the Norman Conquest Edward the Martyr was killed at the site on March 18 978

The stirrup is a ring with a flat bottom fixed on a leather strap usually hung from each side of a saddle to create a footrest for the rider on a riding animal suspended by an adjustable strap from the saddle for use as a support for the foot of a rider of a horse when seated in the saddle and as an aid in getting up

A canon is a piece of music in which two or more voices sing or play the same music starting at different times A round is a type of canon but in a round each voice when it finishes can start at the beginning again so that the piece can go round and round 

Different types of canon 

There are different kinds of canon Canons can be described according to distances between the entries of the voices If the second voice starts one bar after the first voice this is called a canon at the bar If it starts after only half a bar it is called a canon at the half bar It is even possible to have very close canons eg canon at the quaver Messiaen wrote a 3 part canon at the quaver in his Thme et Variations for violin and piano The pianists right hand his left hand and the violinist are the three parts

Canons can also be described according to the intervals between two voices If one voice starts on a C and the next voice starts the same tune on an F above this is a canon at the fourth If the second voice has the tune upside down this is called canon in inversion If the second voice has the tune at half the speed this is a canon in augmentation or an augmented canon The opposite is a canon in diminution

Strict canon means a canon where each voice imitates the first voice exactly all the way through the piece If this does not happen it is free canon  A canon may start off sounding like a fugue but fugues have their own form and rules Some canons have an accompaniment which is not part of the canon an example is the very popular canon by Johann Pachelbel for string orchestra

Canons were already popular in the 14th century when composers enjoyed writing music for several voices in which each voice has a share of melody  Composers like Machaut wrote canonic music His Sanz cuer men vois is a three part canon in which each part has different words

Probably the greatest writer of canons was Johann Sebastian Bach Many of his organ works have canons He wrote a famous set of Canonic Variations on Vom Himmel hoch da komm ich her which have several canons at different intervals and inversions He probably wrote this to show young composers how to write good canons Bach also wrote a work called the Musical Offering which has what he calls a canon per augmentationem contrario motu as well as a canon per tonos This last one is a modulating canon which means that the tune changes key This is hard to compose well so that it sounds good because when the first voice has just changed key the other one is still catching up in the other key

Bach was a great master at writing canons and other very complicated musical forms After 1750 composers became less interested in writing music which was all polyphonic although many composers still showed an interest in counterpoint Haydn Mozart and Beethoven all wrote canons and even Romantic composers like Schumann and Brahms showed an interest Csar Franck wrote a canon for the fourth movement of his Sonata for Violin and Piano It is quite easy to hear this canon because the violin plays the tune an octave higher than the piano and the piano holds on to a long note every other bar while the violin catches up

In the 20th century composers such as Schoenberg who wrote serial music were fond of canons Modern composers like Pierre Boulez have written rhythmic canons canons in which for example the rhythm of one part is the retrograde version of another

Carolus Linnaeus was a Swedish botanist physician and zoologist who created the binomial nomenclature In this system every kind of animal and plant is given a name consisting of two Latin words for its genus and species This became used by biologists all over the world and he is known as the father of modern taxonomy He was a good linguist and famous in his time He was made a noble by the Swedish king

Carl was born in Sweden He was going to be a priest but did not do well enough in school for that Instead his interest in botany got him started studying at a college for this Carl studied in Lund and tried to make something of the garden there He later went to another college

In 1735 Linnaeus moved to the Netherlands for three years Here he earned his degree in Medicine He also published his book on naming systems 

Later he moved to Stockholm and practised as a doctor In 1739 Linnaeus married Sara Morea in Stockholm Throughout the 1740s he conducted many field trips to many places in Sweden to name plants and animals When not on travels Linnaeus worked on his naming system so that they would work for plants animals and minerals 

The Swedish king Adolf Fredrik made Linnaeus a noble in 1757 and Linnaeus took the last name von Linn later often signing just Carl Linn

After he was made a noble he continued teaching and writing His reputation had spread over the world and he talked with many different people Linnaeus was upset by weak health and he had gout and tooth aches A stroke in 1774 weakened him and two years later he had another losing the use of his right side He died on January 1778 and was buried in Uppsala cathedral

Linnaeus also defined an idea of race as applied to humans but this idea is now seen as false He tried to identify people by where they were born features and skin color and then made up names for many creatures in stories such as the troglodyte satyr hydra and phoenix He said that not only did these creatures really exist but were just bad descriptions of real world ape like animals 

Linnaeus study took science on a path that was different from what the Church wanted The Lutheran Archbishop of Uppsala had accused him of impiety 

Botanists are scientists who study plants flowers and plant like things such as moss and seaweedBotany is a scientific study in a plants along with their growth use structure and process in all forms of plant life Botany can also refer to the study of the evolution ageing and decaying and demise of plant life

Modulation in music means that the music changes key  A piece of music might for example be in the key of C major Then it could modulate to G major so that the G now feels like the home key and the notes of a G major scale are used

Modulations like the one above are very common because G is closely related to C A modulation to the subdominant is also common Music often modulates to the relative minor

A modulation that goes to a key whose tonic is not part of the original key is called a chromatic modulation Modulating from C major to A flat major would be a chromatic modulation because A flat is not a note in the C major scale

Most pieces of music will modulate especially if they are long pieces It gives the music variety and helps to give it shape the farther away from the tonic it goes the more tension there is When the music eventually returns to the original key it feels like a homecoming 

A Member of Parliament is a person in the United Kingdom who represents the people of an area in the House of Commons They are voted for by the people in a general election  The Prime Minister chooses when to hold a general election but must have an election at least once every five years MPs are usually members of a group called a political party In the UK the three main political parties are as follows 

When a piece of music is in a major key the relative minor means the minor key which has the same key signature It can be found by taking the sixth note of the first scale and playing a minor scale starting on that note For example in C major the sixth note is an A Therefore A minor is the relative minor of C major C major is called the relative major of A minor

Electrolysis is a scientific way of splitting substances Electrolysis means electric splitting and involves the separation of substances through an electric current Metals above carbon in the reactivity series are extracted by electrolysis commercially 

Electrolysis is used in the mining industry to split reactive metals from their ores after they are extracted from the ground It is also used to plate things with metal because it costs less than using for example 100 pure solid gold to make jewelry

Many beauty companies use electrolysis to remove hair This is done by electrocuting the hair so it splits along its root This is usually done around the bikini line and genital area

Electrolysing water gives hydrogen gas and oxygen gas This is strange as water is a liquid

The Jurassic period is one of the periods of the geological time scale It is in the middle of the Mesozoic era from 200 to 145 million years ago The Triassic Jurassic and Cretaceous periods were the periods when dinosaurs lived on the Earth

Climatically the Jurassic had higher temperatures carbon dioxide levels and sea levels compared to today The Kimmeridge Clay of the Upper Jurassic was laid down in an environment which is not present on the earth today with much of Western Europe being covered by a high sea level which has been related to opening of the Atlantic The consequence of this is that the UK was covered by a shallow and largely anoxic sea perhaps less than 100m deep with occasional landmasses 

This was shallower water than the Blue Lias of the Lower Jurassic It was often low in oxygen which in turn led to only partially decomposition of its organic material The mudstones are organic rich and gave rise to most of the North Sea oil

There were forces of tension and rifting to make the supercontinents Laurasia and Gondwana This was the start of the break up of Pangaea a process which took a long time to complete

Floods of lava flowed from fissures and volcanos By the end of the Jurassic South America had begun to part from Africa In the western part of North America mountain ranges began to form This continued as the American tectonic plates gradually moved west The westward moving North American plates gradually rode over the Pacific Ocean plates to form the Rocky Mountains

On sea and land evolutionary trends which started in the Upper Triassic kept going through the Jurassic The land biota was dominated by Archosaurian reptiles In general the climate was hotter and wetter than today Reptile groups radiated and filled many niches Dinosaurs pterosaurs marine reptiles all flourished Amongst invertebrates there was much change Modern predators like starfish crabs and hole boring gastropods took over the sea floor eating the benthic fauna in huge numbers Brachiopods lost their grip on the in shore habitats molluscan bivalves took their place 

Early mammals existed but mostly as small creatures living in burrows on the margins of a reptilian world The first fossils which show small dinosaurs with feathers are found Anchiornis The first fossil bird Archaeopteryx is found in the Upper Jurassic The dominant land plants were the gymnosperms

The Triassic period is the first period of the Mesozoic era It lasted from about 250 to 200 million years ago Both the start and the end of the Triassic are marked by great extinction events The period began after the great extinction at the end of the Palaeozoic era the PTr extinction event Many new groups arose during its 50 million years including the dinosaurs

The causes of the PermianTriassic extinction has been widely discussed but no single cause has been identified The consensus is that several causes acting together produced the enent The Triassic had several more extinction events whose causes are also obscure The most significant of these took place at the end of the Triassic which was one of the big five Phanerozoic marine extinctions

The name Triassic comes from a rock sequence found widely in European Triassic the three distinct layers red beds capped by limestone followed by black shales

On average the Triassic was

During the Triassic almost all the Earths land mass was concentrated into a single supercontinent centered more or less on the equator called Pangaea All the deep ocean sediments laid down during the Triassic have disappeared through subduction of oceanic plates thus very little is known of the Triassic open ocean

The supercontinent Pangaea was rifting during the Triassicespecially late in the periodbut had not yet separated Because of the limited shoreline of one super continental mass Triassic marine deposits are globally relatively rare despite their prominence in Western Europe where the Triassic was first studied In North America for example marine deposits are limited to a few exposures in the west

The first part of the Triassic had much less variety than the Permian and showed signs of a deteriorated environment This situation lasted for about 5 million years then steadily improved Into the vacant ecological niches new forms evolved replacing old with new This rapid adaptive radiation happened to the reptiles on land and the fish in the seas and to a number of other groups such as the insects Diverse communities with complex ecology took 30 million years to reestablish

 Fish  The group of bony fish known as the teleosts first appeared in the Triassic The group now includes over 80 of all fish and 95 of all bony fish The only other common group of fish are the Chondrichthyes the sharks and rays and the rays are also a Triassic invention

Many reptile goups originated in the Triassic possibly because so many niches were vacant at the time Some of these new groups were caught in the end Triassic extinction but those that survived ruled the Earth for the rest of the Mesozoic examples are

This was an extaordinary turn around for in the middle Triassic the ancestors of mammals the Synapsids were still dominant All the same many reptile groups went extinct in the Triassicp41

And amongst the Synapsids the End Triassic extinction saw the last of the Dicynodonts Thus the Triassic is seen to be a period of great turnover in tetrapods many new and important groups but many extinctions The fossil record of the Triassic is the poorest in the Mesozoic which makes it difficult to explain these events

A chromatic scale is a musical scale which uses every note as it goes up or down ie it goes up and down in semitones To play a chromatic scale on the piano every note is played both white and black notes A chromatic scale can start on any note

The word chromatic comes from the Greek word chromos meaning color Organists in the 16th and 17th centuries such as Sweelinck liked to write Chromatic Fantasias These were pieces based on tunes which were chromatic In those days because of the tuning systems used not all the semitones were exactly the same size Going up a chromatic scale would have been like walking up a staircase with steps which were slightly larger or smaller in depth This made chromatic scales very interesting and colourful which is why they were called chromatic

Chromatic harmony means harmony which use notes which do not belong to the key the music is in Although Bach in the 18th century used chromatic harmony it was the 19th century composers who used it more and more Wagner wrote music which was very chromatic there were lots of sharps and flats and it kept modulating to different key areas The chord at the beginning of his opera Tristan and Isolde is so famous that it is known as the Tristan chord It is very chromatic The music is full of tension because it leaves us wondering which key the music is in

Corals are formed by small animals the polyps of the phylum Cnidaria They are marine either on continental shelves or round oceanic islands They live in colonies 

All the polyps in a colony are zooids they are all clones genetically identical Inside the colony they breed by asexual reproduction They also reproduce sexually Colonies of the same species release gametes together over one two or three nights around a full moon

Each coral animal is like a little bag The opening on top is the mouth Tentacles around the mouth carry stinging nematocysts which paralyse the small animals eaten by the coral polyps 

Coral usually grows in tropical oceans A few corals grow in cold water like the oceans around the British Isles and Norway

Most corals get energy and nutrients from symbiosis with photosynthetic unicellular algae called zooxanthellae Such corals need sunlight and grow in clear shallow water typically at depths less than 60 metres

Many corals live with zooxanthellae of the genus Symbiodinium which are dinoflagellates Usually each polyp harbours one species of algae By photosynthesis these provide energy for the coral and help calcification

The algae benefit from a safe place to live and consume the polyps carbon dioxide and nitrogenous waste Due to the strain the algae can put on the polyp the coral often ejects the algae Mass ejections are known as coral bleaching because the algae contribute to corals brown coloration Ejection increases the polyps chance of surviving short term stressthey can regain algae possibly of a different species at a later time If the stressful conditions persist the polyp eventually dies

A coral reef is a place where many corals grow The reef makes good places for many other animals such as fish crabs clams and sponges

Each coral animal secretes calcium carbonate around itself This makes the solid structure of the colony When the animal dies new polyps live on top of the older structure The rock they make is also called coral 

They are called coral skeletons Each different kind of coral colony builds a different kind of skeleton so that colonies can be shaped like a brain a mushroom a cabbage or many other things With all these corals gathered together building skeletons around themselves large coral formations are made Together all the coral formations in one place make up a coral reef

Coral can also be used as jewelry

During Chuns visit to Rangoon Burma in 1983 a bomb exploded at a mausoleum he was about to visit The bomb killed 21 people including South Korean Cabinet members Chun himself did not die because he got there two minutes late While no firm evidence of North Korean involvement has been found they are widely though to be responsible

In 1996 former presidents Chun and Roh were jailed on charges of corruption On December 16 they were also found guilty of treason and mutiny as part of their takeover of power Chun was sentenced to death That sentence was changed to a life sentence He and Roh were pardoned a year later

Choi Kyu hah was the President of South Korea between 1979 and 1980 He was born in the town of Wonju located in the Gangwon province He was foreign minister of South Korea from 1967 to 1971 and prime minister from 1975 to 1979 

After the broken wikt linkassassinationassassination of Park Chung Hee in 1979 Choi the prime minister of South Korea at the time took power Because of the unrest of Parks authoritarian rule Choi promised a new constitution and democratic elections He won a December election later that year to become the countrys fourth president

In December 1979 Major General Chun Doo hwan and close allies in the military staged a military coup against Chois government They quickly removed the army chief of staff and by early 1980 virtually controlled the government

In April 1980 because of increasing pressure from Chun and other politicians Choi appointed Chun as head of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency giving him enormous power In May Chun declared martial law and removed all trappings of civilian government becoming the de facto ruler of the country By then student protests were increasing in Seoul and Gwangju The protests in Gwangju continued resulting in the Gwangju Massacre where over 200 civilians were killed within five days by Chuns military

Choi resigned soon afterward Chun became president on September 1 1980 After his resignation Choi lived quietly out of the public eye He died on October 22 2006

Pak Chng Hi was the president of Republic of Korea from 1961 to 1979 He has been credited with the modernization of the Republic of Korea through export led growth and developmental dictatorship He was named one of the top 100 Asians of the Century by Time Magazine He has been severely criticized for his governments brutality especially after 1971

Pak was born in Seonsan a small town in Gumi si Gyeongsangbuk do near Daegu He was the seventh child from a family of modest means His father was Park Seong bin and his mother was Baek Nam hui 

Pak came from an undistinguished local branch of Goryeong Bak descent group 

Pak won admission to Daegu Teachers College through a competitive examination He entered on April 8 1932 and graduated on March 25 1937 after five years of study His formative years coincided with the Japanese invasion of China starting with the Manchurian incident in 1931 and culminating in all out war in 1937

He went on to teach for several years in Mungyeong where the school has been preserved as a museum

Pak won admission to a two year training program in Manchukuo the Japanese puppet state in Manchuria Under the Japanese policy of sshi kaimei he adopted the Japanese style name Takaki Masao He graduated from the Japanese Manchurian military academy at the top of his class in 1944 He then was selected for another two years of training at the Imperial Military Academy in Tokyo 

Pak had served as a lieutenant in the Kantogun part of the Imperial Japanese Army in Manchuria fighting Mao Zedongs Chinese Communist forces Although the Kantogun also carried out actions against Korean guerrillas its improbable that Pak participated in such action since there were no Korean guerrillas in the region at the time of his brief deployment

In the aftermath of Japans defeat in World War II under his communist elder brothers influence Pak joined a communist group the South Korean Workers Party in the American occupation zone which later became South Korea Pak was involved in a rebellion in Yeosu and Suncheon Jeollanam do led by units of the new American supported army Pak was arrested and sentenced to death but released soon after revealing the names of communist participants to the South Korean authorities He was then released and left the army in dishonor However the outbreak of the Korean War enabled him to be reinstated and he served the new country fighting against the communists

Syngman Rhee the first president of the Republic of Korea was forced out of office on April 26 1960 as an aftermath of the April 19 Movement a student led uprising A new government took office on August 13 This was a short lived period of parliamentary rule in South Korea with a figurehead president Yun Po son in response to the authoritarian excesses and corruption of the Rhee administration Real power rested with Prime Minister Chang Myon

Yun and Chang did not command the respect of the majority of the Democratic Party They could not agree on the composition of the cabinet and Chang attempted to hold the tenuous coalition together by reshuffling cabinet positions three times within five months

Meanwhile the new government was caught between an economy that was suffering from a decade of mismanagement and corruption by the Rhee presidency and the students who had led to Rhees ouster The students were regularly filling the streets making numerous and wide ranging demands for political and economic reforms Law and order could not be maintained because the police long an instrument of the Rhee government were demoralized and had been completely discredited by the public Continued factional wrangling caused the public to turn away from the party

Seizing the moment then Major General Pak Chng Hi led a bloodless military coup on May 16 1961 a coup largely welcomed by a general populace exhausted by political chaos Although Chang resisted the coup efforts President Yun sided with the junta and persuaded the United States Eighth Army and the commanders of various South Korean army units not to interfere with the new rulers

The Korean Central Intelligence Agency was created on June 19 1961 to prevent a countercoup and to suppress all potential enemies domestic and international It was to have not only investigative power but also the power to arrest and detain anyone suspected of wrongdoing or harboring anti junta sentiments The KCIA extended its power to economic and foreign affairs under its first director Colonel Kim Jong pil a relative of Pak and one of the original planners of the coup

Yun remained in office to provide legitimacy to the regime but resigned on March 22 1962 Pak Chng Hi was the real power as chairman of the Supreme Council for National Reconstruction Following pressure from the Kennedy administration in the United States a civilian government was restored with Pak narrowly winning the 1963 election as the candidate of the newly created Democratic Republican Party over Yun candidate of the Civil Rule Party He was re elected in 1967 again defeating Yun by a narrow margin

Pak is generally credited as playing a pivotal role in the development of South Koreas economy by shifting its focus to export oriented industrialization When he came to power in 1961 South Korean per capita income was only USD 72 and North Korea was regarded as the greater economic and military power on the peninsula because North Korea was industrialized under the Japanese rgime due to its geographical proximity to Manchuria and merit in terms of natural resources and managed to rebuild after heavy bombing by the Americans during the Korean War During Paks tenure per capita income increased twentyfold and South Koreas rural undeveloped economy was transformed into an industrial powerhouse Even Kim Tae Jung one of Paks most prominent opponents during his rule has retrospectively praised him for his role in creating the modern day South Korea 

The strength of Paks leadership was evidenced by the remarkable development of industries and rise in the standard of living of average South Korean citizens during his presidency Many still question Paks judgment however as his 1965 normalization of diplomatic relations with Japan had been extremely unpopular and resulted in widespread unrest as memories from Japans 35 year brutal colonization of Korea proved vivid However by normalizing relations with Japan Pak allowed Japanese capital to flow into the country These aids and loans  although criticized by many Koreans to be too meager for the 35 years of occupation by Imperial Japan  along with American aid helped to restore the depleted capital of South Korea Nonetheless it must be noted that with North Koreas economy at the time being bigger and more vibrant than that of South Korea Pak did not have many options or much time to negotiate for more fitting reparations and apologies This issue still plagues Japan and South Koreas relationship today

Pak was reelected in 1967 against Yun

The Constitution of 1963 barred a South Korean president from seeking a third consecutive term However with the assistance of the KCIA Paks allies in the legislature succeeded in amending the Constitution to allow the current president himself to run for three consecutive terms In 1971 Pak was victorious again this time over Kim Dae jung in the general election

Just after being sworn in for his third term Pak declared a state of emergency based on the dangerous realities of the international situation In October 1972 he dissolved Parliament and suspended the Constitution In December a new constitution the Yusin Constitution was approved easily by the general public The new document dramatically increased Paks power It transferred the election of the president to an electoral college the National Conference for Unification The presidential term was increased to six years with no limits on reelection In effect the constitution converted Paks presidency into a legal dictatorship Pak was re elected in 1972 and 1978 with no opposition

On January 21 1968 a team of about 10 15 North Korean spies was secretly sent to South Korea to kill Pak They crossed the border mountains and hijacked a bus in Seoul No civilians were in the bus The spies drove it towards the Blue House where Pak was at the time When the Korean military was informed of the presence of the North Koreans they hurriedly went to protect the president Armed with machine guns and grenades the spies drove almost to the Blue House until they met South Korean soldiers After a short grenade and gun battle all but one spy were killed Thirty seven South Koreans were also killed

On August 15 1974 a botched assassination attempt by North Korean agent Mun Se gwang claimed his wife Yuk Yeong su instead After this attack he finished the speech he had been giving His wife died later that day

On October 26 1979 Pak was gunned down by Kim Jae kyu the director of the KCIA Kim claimed that Pak was an obstacle to democracy and that his act was one of patriotism After Kim shot the president to death and the leader of his guards his agents quickly killed four more of the presidential bodyguards before the group was apprehended The entire episode is usually either considered a spontaneous act of passion by an individual and that the actions of the other agents only occurred because the men felt loyalty to Kim and naturally followed his lead or as part of a pre arranged attempted coup by the intelligence service with the latter being more widely believed

It is alleged by supporters that despite his dictatorial rule and the high growth that occurred during his years in power Pak did not engage in corruption and led a simple life Detractors allege he was simply a brutal dictator and only brought about high growth through military control over labour

Being a complex man as a policy maker many Koreans continue to hold Pak in high regard in great part due to the industrial and economic growth experienced by South Korea under his presidency But there are also many who condemn Pak for the brutality of his dictatorship and for his service to the Japanese army during World War II Today Paks critics deplore the widespread human rights abuses in South Korea during his rule However his supporters argue that the human rights abuse accusation is mostly fabricated or exaggerated One example of his many abuses was the kidnapping of opposition activist Kim Tae Jung Around noon of August 8 1973 Kim was attended a meeting with the leader of the Democratic Unification Party held in the Room 2212 of the Hotel Grand Palace in Tokyo At around 1319 Kim was abducted by a group of unidentified agents as he walked out of the room after the meeting He was then taken into the empty Room 2210 where he was drugged and became unconscious Later Kim was moved to Osaka and later to Seoul South Korea Kim was later quoted as saying that a weight had been attached to his feet aboard the boat heading toward Korea indicating that the kidnappers had intended to drown Kim by throwing him into the sea They were however forced to abandon this plan as the Japan Maritime Self Defense Force began a pursuit of the kidnappers boat Subsequently Kim was released in Busan He was found alive at his house in Seoul five days after the kidnapping According to some reports US Ambassador Philip Habib intervened with the South Korean government to save Kims life

Paks daughter Park Geun hye was elected the chairwoman of the conservative Grand National Party in 2004 She has resigned her post in order to prepare a presidential bid for the upcoming election 

Yun Bo seon was the President of South Korea from 1960 to 1962 nickname was Haewi newphew of Yun Chi ho

He was born in Asan South Chungcheong province Yun graduated from the University of Edinburgh in 1930 He entered politics after Japanese occupation ended in 1945 with Syngman Rhee being his mentor In 1948 Yun was made mayor of Seoul by Rhee A year later he was made the Minister of Commerce and Industry Soon he started to disagree with Rhees authoritarian policies He then served as president of the Red Cross Society before being elected to the National Assembly in 1954 A year later he founded the opposition Democratic Party along with several others

After Rhees government was ousted by a student led pro democracy uprising Yun was elected president on August 13 1960 He was merely a figurehead as South Korea had switched to a parliamentary system in response to the authoritarian excesses of Rhees regime After Park Chung Hees coup in 1961 he stayed on briefly to provide legitimacy to the regime but resigned on March 22 1962 He opposed Parks authoritarian rule and ran for president twice in 1963 and 1967 losing each time After receiving suspended sentences several times for anti government activities Yun retired from politics in 1980 and focused primarily on cultural activities until his death from diabetes and high blood pressure He died in 1990

Rhee was born in Whanghai Province to Rhee Kyong sun a member of the aristocratic Yangban family Rhee was descended from Prince Hyo nyong the second son of King Taejong of Joseon He soon became active in Koreas struggle against Japanese control He was arrested in 1897 for demonstrating against the monarchy After he was released in 1904 he went to the United States He obtained several degrees including a PhD from Princeton University He became so like an American that he began writing his name in the Western manner with the personal name before the family name

In 1910 he went back to Korea which had by this time been taken over by Japan His political actions got him into trouble with the Japanese army and so he left for China in 1912 In 1919 all of the major pro independence groups formed the Provisional Government in Shanghai Rhee was elected the president a post he held until 1925 when he was removed by the Provisional Assembly for the misuse of his authority

At the end of World War 2 Rhee returned to Seoul This was before the other independence leaders since he was the only one well known to the Allies In 1945 he was chosen as head of a provisional government With the unspoken agreement of the occupation authorities Rhee conducted a number of actions to remove Communism This was actually a hidden plan to remove all possible opposition to him

Rhee was elected the first president of South Korea on 10 May 1948 by a parliamentary vote He defeated Kim Koo the last president of the Provisional Government by 180 votes to 16 All the left wing parties refused to take part in the election On 15 August 1948 he formally took over from the US military and became the legal power over the Korean people 

As president Rhee took on dictatorial powers even before the Korean War started in 1950 He allowed the internal security force to put people in prison and torture them if they were thought to be Communists or North Korean agents His government also directed several massacres the most famous being on the island of Jeju This was after an uprising by left wing groups While massacres did occur under governments that came after Rhee there were not as many and less widespread factdateApril 2009

Rhee made himself unpopular by telling the people in Seoul to stay in the city when the Korean War started He had already left His decision to cut the bridges on the Han River stopped thousands of people from escaping from the Communists The UN and South Korean forces fought back and drove the North Koreans north towards the Yalu River After a Chinese counterattack they UN and South Korean were pushed back to the current DMZ Rhee became unpopular with the US and the UN for refusing to agree to a number of peace plans that would have left Korea divided He wanted to become the leader of a united Korea with UN assistance He tried to stop any peace plan that would not remove the northern government completely He also argued for stronger military action to be used against China He was annoyed because the US would not bomb China

On January 18 1952 Rhee declared South Korean rule over the waters around the Korean peninsula This was an idea the same as todays exclusive economic zones The new border which Rhee called the Peace Line included Tsushima Island and the uninhabited islands named Dokdo This led to protests from the Japanese government They claimed that the islands were Japanese territory Minor clashes followed but the islands have been under South Korean administration since then

Throughout his rule Rhee took extra steps to keep his control over the government In May 1952 Rhee pushed through constitutional changes which made the presidency a directly elected position So he could get this passed by parliament he declared martial law He jailed the members of parliament he thought would vote against it Rhee was subsequently elected by big majority He regained control of parliament in the 1954 elections He pushed through an amendment to exempt himself from the eight year limit on presidents

Rhees chances for reelection during the presidential campaign of 1956 seemed small People did not think he should be allowed to be President three times The main opposition candidate Shin Ik hee drew large crowds during his campaign Shins sudden death while on the campaign trail however allowed Rhee to win the presidency with ease The runner up of that election Cho Bong am of the Progressive Party was later charged with spying and executed in 1959

By 1960 Rhee had already served three terms in office His next victory was certain after the main opposition candidate Cho Byeong ok died shortly before the March 15 elections Rhee won with 90 of the vote The real contest was in the race for vice president This was held separately under the law of the time Yi Gi bung who Rhee thought should take over after him was declared the winner of an election that the opposition claimed was rigged This created anger among groups of the Korean people A student led April 19 Movement forced Rhee to resign on April 26 

On April 28 a DC 4 belonging to the CIA operated Civil Air Transport took Rhee out of South Korea This was to rescue him from the angry crowds Kim Yong Kap Rhees Deputy Minister of Finance revealed that President Rhee had taken 20 million in government money for himself Rhee his Austrian born wife Francisca Donner and adopted son lived in exile in Honolulu Hawaii On July 19 1965 Rhee died of a stroke His body was returned to Seoul and buried in the National Cemetery on July 27 1965

Rhees legacy has been in considerable dispute In general conservative circles regard Rhee as the patriarch of the nation while liberals tend to be critical of him

Rhees former residence in Seoul Ihwajang is currently used for the presidential memorial museum and Woo Nam Presidential Preservation Foundation has been set up to honour his legacy

Canonisation is a statement by a church saying that someone is a saint This process is used by some Christian churches most commonly in the Roman Catholic Church The person must be dead because living people cannot be canonised

The process of canonisation involves proving that the person lived in a way that justifies this decision They must have loved others and loved God In the Catholic Church at least two miracles by the saints intercession must be proven This means that because the person is believed to be in heaven someone must pray or ask for the saint to pray for them in heaven If the prayer is answered and a miracle happens then they know that the person is a saint The miracles prove that the saint must be in heaven with God and able to ask God for prayers to be answered

These people then enter into the canon or list of saints

It is not correct to say that the Church makes someone a saint The Catholic Church believes that anyone who is in heaven is already a saint The canonisation process just finds out for sure or without a doubt that someone is a saint

Dunstan was an Archbishop of Canterbury who was later canonized as a saint He became famous for the many stories told about his dealing with the Devil

An interval in music means the distance between two notes

Two notes on a keyboard which are next to one another are a semitone apart A tone is two semitones However an interval depends on how the notes are written eg whether the black note between D and E is written as D sharp or E flat

In a major scale there are eight notes eg a C major scale is C D E F G A B C and down again

Examples

It is important to realize that in order to work out what an interval is the lower note should be treated as the first note of the scale

Examples

Intervals can be inverted For example instead of going from a C up to an A we can go from C down to an A

Compound intervals are intervals bigger than an octave eg C to D an octave and one more note above it is a major 9th

Big intervals are called wide intervals The opposite is a narrow interval

Modes in music are a kind of scale

The Ancient Greeks used several modes in their music Medieval musicians borrowed the names of these modes to describe the scales used in their music Today we usually use two modes major and minor A mode can start on any note

Each mode has a different pattern of tones and semitones

tone tone semitone tone tone tone semitone

tone semitone tone tone semitone tone tone

The modes are easiest to see on a piano keyboard using the white notes only The Greeks had the following modes

It will be seen that 

Each mode also has a version called hypo For example A to A is Hypodorian It is the same as Aeolian but the D is treated as the final note

The names of the modes come from cities in Ancient Greece

In the Middle Ages these modes were widely used in church music

Some composers in recent centuries have enjoyed using the ancient modes from time to time in their music Folksongs are often modal Greensleeves is an example of a well known tune which is modal

Sharp means that something can cut easily Something that has a very narrow edge may be sharp A mountain may have a sharp peak A pointed nose is a sharp nose

Sharp can also mean quick thinking or clever eg He had a sharp mind

If a picture is sharp it is well in focus

If someone has Sharp hearing it means they can hear extremely well

In music sharp can have two meanings

During the time between the wars Suwaki ruled itself This led to another time of growth with the number of people in the city rising from 16780 in 1921 to almost 25000 in 1935 Most of the money in the city was made from trade during this time Also in 1931 the new water works and a power plant were built

When a person with Bipolar Disorder is manic they might not think as hard about the choices that they make and sometimes may do things like give things to people or spend lots of money This is because during a manic episode a lot of people start to believe things that are not really true or get confused about whats real and whats made up People can also become aggressive and possibly violent while manic but this only happens in very very bad cases so its not as common as some people think

People who are in a manic state are often over confident and very optimistic This can cause them to take large risks and do things which are not wise There are a few things that a lot of people start to believe when they have manic episodes Sometimes they might think they have lots and lots of money when they really do not Other times the person who has a manic episode might think that people they knew are alive even though the truth is that these people have died When a person is in a manic state they often speak quickly and or loudly Every person is different so it is important to remember that these things do not happen to all people with bipolar disorder

Like most mental illnesses there are ways to treat Bipolar Disorder Sometimes taking medicine or getting therapy can make it easier to control The same treatments and medicines do not work for everyone and it is not rare for people to have manic episodes when they stop taking their medicine because they feel like they can control their disorder Things like this can make Bipolar Disorder a difficult illness to live with but when people are educated about it it is not quite as hard
