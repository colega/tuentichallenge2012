April is the fourth month of the year It has 30 days The name April comes from that Latin word aperire which means to open This probably refers to growing plants in spring April begins on the same day of week as July in all years and also January in leap years

Aprils flower is the Sweet Pea Its birthstone is the diamond The meaning of the diamond is innocence

Poets use April to mean the end of winter For example April showers bring May flowers

August is the eighth month of the year It has 31 days 

This month was first called Sextilis in Latin because it was the sixth month in the old Roman calendar The Roman calendar began in March about 735 BC with Romulus It was the eighth month when January or February were added to the start of the year by King Numa Pompilius about 700 BC Or when those two months were moved from the end to the beginning of the year by the decemvirs about 450 BC

August is named for Augustus Caesar The month has 31 days because the Roman senate wanted as many days as Julius Caesars month July August is in summer after July and before September

An extra day was moved from February in order to make the month of August seem more important February gets its day back when the leap year adjustment is made 

Augusts flower is the Gladiolus with the birthstone being peridot 

The word art is used to describe some activities or creations of human beings that have importance to the human mind regarding an attraction to the human senses Therefore art is made when a human expresses himself or herself Some art is useful in a practical sense such as a sculptured clay bowl that one can put things in Many people disagree on how to define art Many people say people are driven to make art due to their inner creativity Art includes drawing painting sculpting photography performance art dance music poetry prose and theatre

Art is divided into the plastic arts where something is made and the performing arts where something is done by humans in action The other division is between pure arts done for themselves and practical arts done for a practical purpose but with artistic content

Some people say that art is a product or item that is made with the intention of stimulating the human senses as well as the human mind or spirit

An artwork is normally judged by how much impact it has on people the amount of people who can relate to it and how much people appreciate it 

The first and broadest sense of art means arrangement or to arrange In this sense art is created when someone arranges things found in the world into a new or different design or form or when someone arranges colors next to each other in a painting to make an image or just to make a pretty or interesting design

Art can also be a form of expression of emotion The artist may feel a certain emotion and feels there is no other way to express it than to create something that means something to them Most of the art created in this case is made for the artist rather than an audience Though if an audience is able to connect with the emotion as well then the art work will become publicly successful

There are sculptures cave paintings rock paintings and petroglyphs dating from the Upper Paleolithic era about thirty five thousand years ago 

All of the great ancient civilizations such as Ancient Egypt India China Greece Rome or Arabia had works and styles of art In the Middle Ages most of the art in Europe showed Biblical stories in paintings stained glass windows and mosaic tile floors and walls

Islamic art includes geometric patterns Islamic calligraphy and architecture In India and Tibet painted sculptures dance and religious painting were done In China arts included jade carving bronzework pottery poetry calligraphy music painting drama and fiction There are many Chinese artistic styles which are usually named after the ruling dynasty 

In Europe after the Middle Ages there was a Renaissance which means rebirth People rediscovered science and artists were allowed to paint subjects other than religious subjects People like Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci still painted religious pictures but they also now could paint mythological pictures too These artists also invented linear perspective where things in the distance look smaller than things close up in the picture This was new because in the Middle Ages people would paint all the figures close up and just overlapping each other 

In the late 1800s artists in Europe responding to Modernity created many new painting styles such as Classicism Romanticism Realism and Impressionism The history of twentieth century art includes Expressionism Fauvism Cubism Dadaism and Surrealism and Minimalism

In some societies people think that art belongs to the person who made it such as Indigenous Aboriginal Australian Art They think that the artist put his or her talent into the art In this view the art is the property of the artist 

In other societies people think that art belongs to no one They think that society has put its social capital into the artist and the artists work In this view society is a collective that has made the art through the artist

The functions of art include

1 cognitive function

2 aesthetic function

3 prognostic function

4 recreation function

5 value function

6 didactic function

A is the first letter of the English alphabet a is a usual symbol for a low central vowel as in father However the English long a is said as a diphthong of and y The same letter of the Greek alphabet is named alpha Alpha and omega the last letter of the Greek alphabet means the beginning and the end In musical notation the letter A is the symbol of a note in the scale below B and above G

The earliest the letter A has appeared was in the Phoenician alphabets aleph This symbol came from a simple picture of an ox head 

This Phoenician letter helped form the basic blocks of later forms of the letter 

The letter A has six different sounds It can sound like in the International Phonetic Alphabet such as the word pad Other sounds of this letter are in the words father which developed into another sound such as in the word ace 

Air means Earths atmosphere It is the clear gas we live in and breathe in It has an indefinite shape and volumeIt has no color or smell It has mass and weight It is a matter as it has mass and weight Air creates atmosphere pressure There is no air in the vacuum and cosmos 

Air is a mixture of 7803 nitrogen 2099 oxygen 094 argon 003 carbon dioxide 001 hydrogen 000123 Neon 00004 helium 000005 krypton 0000006 xenon

Humans need the oxygen in the air to live In the human body the lungs give oxygen to the blood and give back carbon dioxide to the air Plants and animals also need air to live it is very important to everyone

The wind is moving air Air can be polluted from some gases smoke and ash Some believe that this pollution may be one of the causes of global warming

Aircraft use propellers to move air over a wing which allows them to fly

Without air humans would be dead

Spain is divided in 17 parts called autonomous communities Autonomous means that each of these autonomous communities has its own Executive Power its own Legislative Power and its own Judicial Power These are similar but NOT the same to states in the United States of America for example

Spain has fifty smaller parts called provinces In 1978 these parts came together making the autonomous communities Before then some of these provinces were together but were broken The groups that were together once before are called historic communities Catalonia Basque Country Galicia and Andalusia

The Spanish language is official language in every autonomous commmunity but six autonomous communities have also other official languages

List of the autonomous communities with their Capital city

Spain also has two cities on the north coast of Africa Ceuta and Melilla They are called autonomous cities and have simultaneously the majority of the power of an autonomous community and also power of provinces and power of municipalities

Alan Mathison Turing was an English mathematician and computer scientist born in Maida Vale London

He was one of the first people to work with computers He was the first person to think of using a computer to do things that were too hard for a person to do He told people that computers could run programs and created the Turing machine in 1936 The machine was imaginary but it ran programs 

Turing was interested in artificial intelligence He proposed the Turing test to say when a machine could be called intelligent A computer could be said to think if a human interrogator could not tell it apart through conversation from a human being

During World War II Turing worked to break German ciphers Using cryptanalysis he helped to break the Enigma machine After that he solved other German signals

From 1945 to 1947 Turing worked on the design of the ACE at the National Physical Laboratory He presented a paper on 19 February 1946 which was the first detailed design of a stored program computer Although ACE was a feasible design the secrecy surrounding the wartime work at Bletchley Park led to delays in starting the project and he became disillusioned In late 1947 he returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year While he was at Cambridge the Pilot ACE was built in his absence It executed its first program on 10 May 1950

Turing was a gay man In 1952 Turing admitted having had sex with a man in England At that time it was a crime to take part in homosexual acts He was convicted and forced to make a choice He could choose between going to jail or take hormones like estrogen to lower his sex drive He decided to chose the hormones After his punishment he became impotent and could not get an erection He also grew breasts

In 1954 after suffering for two years he died after eating an apple which was poisoned with cyanide 

The treatment forced on him is now believed to be very wrong going against medical ethics and international laws of human rights In August 2009 a petition apologized to Turing for punishing him for being a homosexual The petition received thousands of signatures Prime Minister Gordon Brown acknowledged the petition and called Turings treatment as appalling Thousands of people have come together to demand justice for Alan Turing and recognition of the appalling way he was treated While Turing was dealt with under the law of the time and we cant put the clock back his treatment was of course utterly unfair and I am pleased to have the chance to say how deeply sorry I and we all are for what happened to him So on behalf of the British government and all those who live freely thanks to Alans work I am very proud to say were sorry you deserved so much better

Farming is growing crops or keeping animals by people for food and raw materials Farming is a part of agriculture

Agriculture is not only growing food for people and animals but also growing other things like flowers ornamental plants and nursery plants manure or dung animal hides leather industrial chemicals fibers fuels and drugs

Agriculture started at least about 10000 years ago but no one knows for sure how old it is Agriculture and domestication started in the Fertile Crescent in East Africa and in the Middle East The area called Fertile Crescent is now in the countries of Iraq Syria Turkey Jordan Lebanon Israel and Egypt Wheat and barley are some of the first crops people grew People probably started agriculture slowly by planting a few crops but still gathered many foods from the wild People may have started farming because the weather and soil began to change Farming can feed many more people than gathering on the same amount of land

Farming actually started with the first nations They might have originally kept tethered animals for extra food Farmers often help each other out whenever they canproofdateDecember 2011 Scientists have many theories about how farming started but most start with first nations around the end of the ice age

Many people live by doing what is called subsistence agriculture on a small farm Only the farmers family lives on the farm Subsistence agriculture is growing only enough food to feed the farmer his family and his animals Extra food or animals are sold for money or other things the farmer cannot grow The yield is the amount of food grown on a given amount of land and the yield is often low This is because subsistence farmers are generally less educated and they have less money to buy equipment When yields are low forests are sometimes cut to provide new land to grow more food This is good in the short term but can be bad for the country and the surrounding environment over many years

In rich countries farms are often much larger The yield on farms has gotten bigger in the last one hundred years because farmers are able to grow better varieties of plants use more fertilizer use more water and more easily control weeds and pests Many farms also use machines which cut down on the number of people needed to farm the land This results in fewer farmers in rich countries but the farmers are able to eat more This kind of intensive agriculture comes with its own set of problems Farmers use a lot of chemical fertilizers pesticides and herbicides These chemicals can pollute the soil or the water They can also create bugs and weeds that are more resistant to the chemicals causing outbreaks of these pests The soil can be damaged by erosion salt buildup or loss of structure Irrigation can pollute water and lower the water table Having fewer farmers also changes society and can make a country less able to feed itself in bad times

There are many ways to grow crops and animals Some of them are 

Farmers select plants with better yield taste and nutritional value They also choose plants that are more resistant to disease more tolerant to drought and easier to harvest Centuries of careful selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants The crops produce better yield with other techniques

Some companies have been searching for new plants in poor countries and genetically modify these plants to improve them They then try to patent the seeds and sell them back to the poor countries

New plants were created with genetic engineering One example of genetic engineering is modifying a plant to resist an herbicide

It is important for there to be enough food for everyone The food must also be safe and good They say it is sometimes not safe because it contains some chemicals Other people say intensive agriculture is damaging the environment For this reason there are several types of agriculture

Traditional agriculture is mostly done in poor countries

Intensive agriculture is mostly done in wealthier countries It uses pesticides machinery chemical fertilizers Organic farming is using only natural products Integrated farming is using local resources and trying to use the waste from one process as a resource in another process

Agricultural policy focuses on the goals and methods of agricultural production At the policy level common goals of agriculture include

There are some serious problems that face people trying to grow food today These include

The major crops produced in the world in 2002 are maize wheat rice and cotton

Arithmetic is what we call working with numbers It is a part of mathematics The four basic arithmetic operations are addition subtraction multiplication and division These are the the first two natural hyperoperations and their inverses

Harder arithmetic includes working with signed numbers fractions and decimals and taking powers and roots

Most people learn arithmetic in grade school but some people do not learn arithmetic and others forget the arithmetic they learned Many jobs require a knowledge of arithmetic and many employers complain that it is hard to find people who know enough arithmetic A few of the many jobs that require arithmetic include carpenters plumbers auto mechanics accountants architects doctors and nurses Arithmetic is needed in all areas of mathematics science and engineering 

A Calculator can be used to do arithmetic

Addition is the mathematical way of putting things together

In arithmetic addition is finding the total of two or more numbers The sign for addition is The name for the sign is plus 

For example there are objects in two groups The objects are small circles o One group has five of these objects The other group has 3 of these objects To find the total number of objects in both groups the objects can be counted Another way to find the number of objects in both groups is to add the numbers in each group 

Another method is to add the numbers of objects in group A and group B since they are already counted In symbols

There are rules for adding numbers that people learn There are also rules for adding numbers that are built into machines The rule says that

In another counting example Sally and Bill have 2 children Sally and Bill get 3 more children Sally and Bill have added three children to their two children and now have five children

Tom wants to know the distance between his house and Sallys house Bobs house is 300 meters east of Toms house Sallys house is 120 meters east of Bobs house

The distance from Toms house to Sallys house can be found by adding the distances already measured The distance from Toms house to Bobs house added to the distance from Bobs house to Sallys house is the same as the distance from Toms house to Sallys house That is three hundred meters plus 120 meters

Addition can also mean to make bigger

Australia is a country in the Southern Hemisphere between the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean Its official name is the Commonwealth of Australia Australia is the sixth biggest country in the world by landmass

22 million people live in Australia with around 80 living on the east coast About 60 live in and around the mainland state capitals of Sydney Melbourne Brisbane Perth and Adelaide Australias capital city is Canberra

Australia New Zealand New Guinea and other islands on the Australian tectonic plate are together called Australasia They form one of the worlds great ecozones When other Pacific islands are included the term is Oceania

Australias landmass of 7617930 square kilometers is on the Indo Australian plate The continent of Australia including the island of Tasmania was separated from the other continents of the world many millions of years ago Because of this many animals and plants live in Australia that do not live anywhere else These include animals like the kangaroo the koala the emu the kookaburra and the platypus

People first arrived in Australia more than 50000 years ago These native Australians are called the Australian Aborigines For the history of Australia see History of Australia

Most of the Australian colonies having been settled from Britain became mostly independent democratic states in the 1850s and all six combined as a federation on 1 January 1901 The first Prime Minister of Australia was Edmund Barton in 1901 Australia is a member of the United Nations and the Commonwealth of Nations It is a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy with Elizabeth II as Queen of Australia and Head of State and a Governor General who is chosen by the Prime Minister to carry out all the duties of the Queen in Australia

Australia has six states two major mainland territories and other minor territories The states are New South Wales Queensland South Australia Tasmania Victoria and Western Australia The two major mainland territories are the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory

In July 2007 Australia had just over 21 million people Most Australians live in cities along the coast such as Sydney Melbourne Brisbane Perth Darwin Hobart and Adelaide The largest inland city is Canberra which is also the nations capital The largest city is Sydney

Although Australia is a very big country a lot of the land is very dry The middle of the continent is mostly desert Only the areas around the east west and south coast have enough rain and a suitable climate for many farms and cities

The Australian Aboriginal people arrived in Australia more than 50000 years ago Until the arrival of British settlers in 1788 the Aboriginal people lived by hunting and gathering food from the land They lived in all sorts of climates and managed the land in different ways An example of Aboriginal land management was the Cumberland Plain where Sydney is now Every few years the Aboriginal people would burn the grass and small treescite This meant that a lot of grass grew back but not many big trees Kangaroos like to live on grassy plains but not in forests The kangaroos that lived on the plain were a good food supply for the Aboriginal people Sometimes Aborigines would name a person after an animal and they could not eat that animal to help level out the food population

Aboriginal people did not usually build houses except huts of grass leaves and bark They did not usually build walls or fences and there were no horses cows or sheep in Australia that needed to be kept in pens The only Aboriginal buildings that are known are fish traps made from stones piled up in the river and the remains of a few stone huts in Victoria and Tasmaniacite The Aboriginal people did not use metal or make pottery or use bows and arrows or weave cloth In some parts of Australia the people used sharp flaked stone spearheads but most Aboriginal spears were made of sharply pointed wood Australia has a lot of trees that have very hard wood that was good for spear making The boomerang was used in some areas for sport and for hunting

The Aboriginal people did not think that the land belonged to them They believed that they had grown from the land so it was like their mother and they belonged to the land

In the 1600s Dutch merchants traded with the islands of Batavia to the north of Australia and several different Dutch ships touched on the coast of Australia The Dutch Governor van Diemen sent Abel Tasman on a voyage of discovery and he found Tasmania which he named Van Diemens Land Its name was later changed to honour the man who discovered it

The British Government were sure that there must be a very large land in the south that had not been explored They sent Captain James Cook to the Pacific Ocean His ship HMS Endeavour carried the famous scientists Sir Joseph Banks and Dr Solander who were going to Tahiti where they would watch the planet Venus pass in front of the Sun Captain Cooks secret mission was to find Terra Australis

The voyage of discovery was very successful because they found New Zealand and sailed right around it Then they sailed westward At last a boy William Hicks who was up the mast spotted land on the horizon Captain Cook named that bit of land Point Hicks They sailed up the coast and Captain Cook named the land that he saw New South Wales At last they sailed into a large open bay which was full of fish and stingrays which the sailors speared for food Joseph Banks and Dr Solander went ashore and were astonished to find that they did not know what any of the plants or birds or animals that they saw were They collect hundreds of plants to take back to England

Captain Cook saw the Aboriginal people with their simple way of life He saw them fishing and hunting and collecting grass seeds and fruit But there were no houses and no fences In most parts of the world people put up a house and a fence or some marker to show that they own the land But the Aboriginal people did not own the land in that way They belonged to the land like a baby belongs to its mother Captain Cook went home to England and told the Government that no one owned the land This was to cause a terrible problem for the Aboriginal people

In the 1700s in England laws were tough many people were poor and gaols were full A person could be sentenced to death for stealing a loaf of bread Many people were hanged for small crimes But usually they were just thrown in gaol Often they were sent away to the British Colonies in America But in the 1770s the colonies in America became the United States They were free from British rule and would not take Englands convicts any more 

By the 1780s the gaols of England were so full that convicts were often chained up in rotting old ships The Government decided to make a settlement in New South Wales and send some of the convicts there In 1788 the First Fleet of eleven ships set sail from Portsmouth carrying convicts sailors marines a few free settlers and enough food to last for two years Their leader was Captain Arthur Phillip They were to make a new colony at the place that Captain Cook had discovered named Botany Bay because of the plants found there by the two scientists

Captain Phillip found that Botany Bay was flat and windy There was not much fresh water He went with two ships up the coast and sailed into a great harbour which he said was the finest harbour in the world There were many small bays on the harbour so he decided on one which had a good stream of fresh water and some flat shore to land on On the 26th January 1788 the flag was raised and New South Wales was claimed in the name of King George III of England and the new settlement was called Sydney 

For the first few years of the settlement things were very difficult No one in the British Government had thought very hard about what sort of convicts should be sent to make a new colony Nobody had chosen them carefully There was only one man who was a farmer There was no one among the convicts who was a builder a brickmaker or a blacksmith No one knew how to fix the tools when they broke The cattle all escaped There were no cooking pots All the plants were different so no one knew which ones could be eaten There was a grave danger that everyone in the new colony would die of starvation 

Somehow the little group of tents with a hut for the Governor Arthur Phillip and another hut for the supply of food grew into a small town with streets a bridge over the stream a windmill for grinding grain and wharves for ships By the 1820s there was a fine brick house for the Governor There was also a hospital and a convict barracks and a beautiful church which are still standing today Settlements had spread out from Sydney firstly to Norfolk Island and to Van Diemens Land and also up the coast to Newcastle where coal was discovered and inland where the missing cattle were found to have grown to a large herd Spanish Merino sheep had been brought to Sydney and by 1820 farmers were raising fat lambs for meat and also sending fine wool back to the factories of England 

While the settlement was growing in New South Wales it was also growing in Tasmania The climate in Tasmania was more like that of in England and farmers found it easy to grow crops there

Because Australia is such a very large land it was easy to think that it might be able to hold a very large number of people In the early days of the colony a great number of explorers went out searching for good land to settle on When the settlers looked west from Sydney they saw a range of mountains which they called the Blue Mountains They were not very high and did not look very rugged but for many years no one could find their way through them In 1813 Gregory Blaxland William Lawson and a 17 year old called William Charles Wentworth crossed the Blue Mountains and found land on the other side which was good for farming A road was built and the Governor Lachlan Macquarie founded the town of Bathurst on the other side 100 miles from Sydney

Some people like Captain Charles Sturt were sure that there must be a sea in the middle of Australia and set out to find it Many of the explorers did not prepare very well or else they went out to explore at the hottest time of year Some died like Burke and Wills Ludwig Leichhardt got lost twice The second time he was never seen again Major Thomas Mitchell was one of the most successful explorers He mapped the country as he went and his maps remained in use for more than 100 years He travelled all the way to what is now western Victoria and to his surprise and annoyance found that he was not the first white person there The Henty brothers had come from Tasmania had built themselves a house had a successful farm and fed the Major and his men on roast lamb and wine

The goldrushes of New South Wales and Victoria started in 1851 leading to large numbers of people arriving to search for gold The population grew across south east Australia and made great wealth and industry By 1853 the goldrushes had made some poor people very rich

Convict transportation ended in the 1840s and 1850s and more changes came The people in Australia wanted to run their own country and not be told what to do from London The first governments in the colonies were run by Governors chosen by London Soon the settlers wanted local government and more democracy William Wentworth started the Australian Patriotic Association in 1835 to demand democratic government In 1840 the some city councils started and some people could vot New South Wales Legislative Council had its first elections in 1843 again with some limits on who could vote In 1855 limited self government was given by London to New South Wales Victoria South Australia and Tasmania In 1855 the right to vote was given to all men over 21 in South Australia The other colonies soon followed Women were given the vote in the Parliament of South Australia in 1895 and they became the first women in the world allowed to stand in elections 

Australians had started parliamentary democracries all across the continent But voices were getting louder for all of them to come together as one country with a national parliament

Until 1901 Australia was not a nation it was six separate colonies governed by Britain They voted to join together to form one new country called the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901 Australia was still part of the British Empire and for at first wanted only British or Europeans to come to Australia But soon it had its own money and its own Army and Navy 

In Australia at this time the trade unions were very strong and they started a political party the Australian Labor Party Australia passed many laws to help the workers

In 1914 the First World War started in Europe Australia joined in on the side of Britain against Germany Austria Hungary and Turkey Australian soldiers were sent to Gallipoli in Turkey They fought bravely but were beaten by the Turks Today Australia remembers this battle every year on ANZAC Day They also fought on the Western Front More than 60000 Australians were killed 

Australia had a really hard time in the Great Depression of the 1930s and joined Britain in a war against Nazi Germany when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939 But in 1941 lots of Australian soldiers were captured in the Fall of Singapore by Japan Then Japan started attacking Australia and people worried about invasion But with help from the United States Navy the Japanese were stopped After the war Australia became a close friend of the United States

When the war ended Australia felt that it needed many more people to fill the country up and to work So the government said it would take in people in Europe who had lost their homes in the war It did things like build the Snowy Mountains Scheme Over the next 25 years millions of people came to Australia They came from espcially from Italy and Greece other countries in Europe Later they also came from countries like Turkey and Lebanon An important new party the Liberal Party of Australia was made by Robert Menzies in 1944 and it won lots of elections from 1949 until in 1972 then Gough Whitlam won for the Labor Party Whitlam made changes but he made the Senate unhappy and the Governor General sacked him and forced an election in 1975 Then Malcolm Fraser won a few elections for the Liberal Party

In the 1960s many people began coming to Australia from China Vietnam Malaysia and other countries in Asia Australian became more multicultural In the 1950s and 1960s Australia became one of the richest countries in the world helped by mining and wool Australia started trading more with America then Japan Australia supported the United States in wars against dictatorships in Korea and Vietnam and later Iraq Australian soldiers also helped the United Nations in countries like East Timor in 1999 

In 1973 the famous Sydney Opera House opened In the 1970s 80s and 90s lots of Australian movies actors and singers became famous around the world In the year 2000 Sydney had the Summer Olympics 

In the 1980s and 90s the Labor Party under Bob Hawke and Paul Keating then the Liberal Party under John Howard made lots of changes to the economy Australia had a bad recession in 1991 but but when other Western countries had trouble with their economies in 2008 Australia stayed strong 

Today Australia is a rich peaceful and democratic country But it still has problems Around 4 5 of Australians could not get a job in 2010 A lot of land in Australia has been returned to Aboriginal people but lots of Aborigines are still poorer than everybody else Every year the government chooses a big number of new people from all around the world to come as immigrants to live in Australia These people may come because they want to do business or to live in a democracy to join their family or because they are refugees Australia took 65 million immigrants in the 60 years after World War Two including around 660000 refugees 

Julia Gillard became the first woman Prime Minister of Australia in 2010 when she replaced her colleague Kevin Rudd of the Labor Party

Australia is made up of six states and three mainland territories Each of state and territory has its own Parliament and makes its own local laws The Parliament of Australia sits in Canberra and makes laws for the whole country also known as the Commonwealth or Federation 

The Federal government is led by the Prime Minister of Australia who is the member of Parliament chosen as leader The current Prime Minister is Julia Gillard who replaced Kevin Rudd elected in June 2010 She is the leader of a political party called the Australian Labor Party The other main party is the Liberal Party

The leader of Australia is the Prime Minister although the Governor General represents the Queen of Australia who is also the Queen of Great Britain as head of state The Governor General currently Her Excellency Ms Quentin Bryce is chosen by the Prime Minister

Australia was colonised by people from Britain but today people from all over the world live there English in the main spoken language and Christianity is the main religion though all religions are accepted and not everybody has a religion Australia is multicultural which means that all its people are helped to keep their different languages religions and ways of life while also learning English and joining in with other Australians 

Famous Australian writers include the bush balladeers Banjo Paterson and Henry Lawson who wrote about life in the Australian bush More modern famous writers include Peter Carey Thomas Keneally and Colleen McCullough In 1973 Patrick White won the Nobel Prize in Literature the only Australian to have achieved this he is seen as one of the great English language writers of the twentieth century

Australian music has had lots of world wide stars from the opera singers Nellie Melba and Joan Sutherland to the rock and roll bands Bee Gees ACDC and INXS the folk rocker Paul Kelly the pop singer Kylie Minogue and Australian country music stars Slim Dusty and John Williamson Australian Aboriginal music is very special and very ancient it has the famous digeridoo woodwind instrument

Australian TV has produced many successful programs for home and overseas  including Skippy the Bush Kangaroo Home and Away and Neighbours  and produced such well known TV stars as Barry Humphries Steve Irwin and The Wiggles

Australia has two public broadcasters three commercial television networks three pay TV services and numerous public non profit television and radio stations Each major city has daily newspapers and there are two national daily newspapers The Australian and The Australian Financial Review

Australian movies have a very long history The worlds first feature film was the Australian movie The Story of the Kelly Gang of 1906 In 1933 In the Wake of the Bounty directed by Charles Chauvel had Errol Flynn as the main actor Flynn went on to a celebrated career in Hollywood The first Australian Oscar was won by 1942s Kokoda Front Line directed by Ken G Hall In the 1970s and 1980s lots of big Australian movies and movie stars became world famous with films like Picnic at Hanging Rock Gallipoli The Man From Snowy River and Crocodile Dundee Russell Crowe Cate Blanchett and Heath Ledger became global stars during the 1990s and Australia starring Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman made a lot of money in 2008

Sport is an important part of Australian culture because the climate is good for outdoor activities 235 Australians over the age of 15 regularly take part in organised sporting activities In international sports Australia has very strong teams in cricket hockey netball rugby league rugby union and performs well in cycling rowing and swimming Local popular sports include Australian rules football horse racing soccer and motor racing Australia has participated in every summer Olympic Games since 1896 and every Commonwealth Games Australia has hosted the 1956 and 2000 Summer Olympics and has ranked in the top five medal winners since 2000 Australia has also hosted the 1938 1962 1982 and 2006 Commonwealth Games Other major international events held regularly in Australia include the Australian Open one of the four Grand Slam tennis tournaments annual international cricket matches and the Formula One Australian Grand Prix Corporate and government sponsorship of many sports and elite athletes is common in Australia Televised sport is popular some of the highest rated television programs include the Summer Olympic Games and the grand finals of local and international football competitions Australian Rules Football is also popular

The main sporting leagues for males are AFL NRL A League and NBL For women they are ANZ Netball Championships W League and WNBL

The famous sports players who are Australian include the cricketer Sir Donald Bradman the swimmer Ian Thorpe and the athlete Cathy Freeman

Just 50 years ago Australia had only one big Art festival Now Australia has hundreds of smaller community based festivals and national and regional festivals that focus on specific art forms

American English or US English is the dialect of English language spoken in the United States It is different in some ways from other variations of English such as British English Historically many types of American English can be found in old local dialects of England

Many people today know about American English even if they live in a country where another form of English is spoken This is partly because people hear and read American English via the media for example CNN television and the Internet where the most common form of English is American English

Because people all over the world hear and read American English as well as other versions of English we may find that the English language starts to take on new words English has been changing for centuries adding new words to its vocabulary For example the English language spoken in India which has more than one billion people will add more American English words to go along with its British English base and many other words adopted into English usage in India from from any of the 200 Indian languages

Sometimes people will learn American English as it is spoken in America  for example in telephone call centers in India and other places people often learn American English in order to sound more like their customers who call India from America These people often continue to use American English in everyday life

Many word definitions are different in American English Most changes in a language start with small things like this  for instance Italian Spanish French all came from Latin due to many small changes in use over centuries

There are many words that sound the same between the American English and British English but are spelled differently For example

Some more differences in American English

There are also some words in American English that are a bit different from British English eg

Aquaculture is the farming of fish shrimp and algae Aquaculture supplies fish Aquaculture was developed a long time ago in China and aquaculture supplies for over 20 of all the seafood harvested However aquaculture is quite a new activity in Canada as it only began in the 1879 It is in simpler terms the farming of seafood

An abbreviation is a shorter way to write a word or phrase People use abbreviations for words that they write a lot The English language occasionally uses the apostrophe mark to show that a word is written in a shorter way but some abbreviations do not use this mark More often they use periods especially the ones that come from the Latin language Common Latin abbreviations include ie id est that is eg exempli gratia for example and et al et alia and others

Some new abbreviations have been created by scientists by workers in companies and governments and by people using the Internet 

People often think words are abbreviations when in fact they are acronyms

Here are examples of common acronyms The word radar is an acronym for Radio Detection and Ranging The name of the large computer company IBM comes from the words International Business Machines The name of the part of the United States government that sends rockets into outer space is NASA from the words National Aeronautics and Space Administration When people using the Internet think that something is very funny they sometimes write LOL to mean Laughing Out Loud People sometimes write ASAP for As Soon As Possible

In many religions an angel is a good spirit The word angel comes from the Greek word angelos which means messenger Angels appear frequently in the Old Testament the New Testament and the Quran In all of these angels appear like humans In Christianity angels are helpers of god who are ministers to the faithful 

Angels do have the ability to sin Satan a third of the angels rebelled against God were cast out of heaven creating the demon world

In the Bible angels often punished peoples for their sins They tested peoples faith in God They are often depicted in art as having wings and a halo The wings represent their speed and the halo represents their holiness Angels named in the Bible are Michael and Gabriel and Raphael

Ad hominem is a Latin term It is used in rhetoric Rhetoric is the science of how to speak well and how to convince other people of your ideas 

Translated to English ad hominem means against the person 

The term is used to describe a rhetorical argument that is directed towards the person who says something not about the cause at hand It is a way to use reputation and rumour and hearsay to change minds

When a social network has already excluded or exiled one person or applied a label to them this works more often

Because it works and is also unfair to everyone who would benefit from what they say it is considered to be a weak or poor argument Formal disapproval of those who use it is common in a court or in diplomacy where danger is high

In logic a proof is something that starts with premises and goes through a few logical arguments to reach a conclusion

In this example it can be seen that the fact that person A is uneducated and poor is used to prove that abortion should not be illegal

Native Americans are the people who were in North America Central America South America and the Caribbean Islands when Europeans arrived Christopher Columbus was travelling west so he thought he was going to India This is why he called the people Indians There are more than three million Native Americans in Canada and the US combined

Sometimes these people are called Indians but this is confusing because it is the same word used for people from India The words aboriginal or first people or indigenous people are also used Other names for these for Native Americans are First Nations and Red Indians There are many different tribes of American Indian people with many different languages 

Many American Indians died after the Europeans came to the Americas from diseases that came with the Europeans that were new to the Indians in wars with the Europeans or because the Europeans made them work as slaves Most of the American Indians were hurt or killed by settlers who wanted to take their lands 

Most people think that the ancestors of American Indians came to the Americas from Asia Some of them may have come to America over 12000 years ago when Alaska was connected to Asia by land Some people think that they came to the Americas even before that Some of their ancestors may have come along the coastline in small boats or canoes because sometimes there were glaciers blocking the land between Alaska and Asia 

Some Indian tribes and languages of North America are Cherokee Maya or Yucatec Maya Aztecs Navajo and Sioux 

The apple is a fleshy fruit from the apple tree It is in the species Malus domestica in the rose family Rosaceae The apple is one of the most grown tree fruits

The apple tree came from Central Asia Its wild ancestor is still there today There are more than 7500 kinds of different apple trees

At least 55 million tons of apples were grown around in the world in 2005 All together they cost about 10 billion China produced about 35 of the worlds apples The United States produces more than 75 of the apples around the world This makes it the second greatest producer Iran is third after which comes Turkey Russia Italy and India

The apple has a small leaf shedding tree that grows up to 3 to 12 metres tall The apple tree has a broad crown with thick twigs The leaves are alternately arranged simple ovals They are 5 to 12 centimetres long and 36 centimetres wide It has a sharp top with a soft underside Blossoms come out in spring at the same time that the leaves begin to bud The flowers are white They also have a slightly pink color They are five petaled and 25 to 35 centimetres in diameter The fruit matures in autumn It is usually 5 to 9 centimetres in diameter There are five carpels arranged in a star in the middle of the fruit Every carpel has one to three seeds

The wild ancestors of Malus domestica are Malus sieversii They grow wild in the mountains of Central Asia in the south of Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan Tajikistan and Xinjiang China and possibly also Malus sylvestris Unlike domesticated apples their leaves become red in autumn They are being used recently to develop Malus domestica to grow in colder climates

The apple tree was possibly the earliest tree to be cultivated Its fruits have become better over thousands of years It is said that Alexander the Great discovered dwarfed apples in Asia Minor in 300 BCE Asia and Europe have used winter apples as an important food for thousands of years From when Europeans arrived Argentina and the United States have used apples as food as well Apples were brought to North America in the 1600s The first apple orchard on the North American continent was said to be near Boston in 1625 In the 1900s costly fruit industries where the apple was a very important species began developing

In Norse mythology the goddess Iunn gives apples to the gods in Prose Edda that makes them young forever English scholar H R Ellis Davidson suggests that apples were related to religious practices in Germanic paganism It was from there she claims that Norse paganism developed She points out that buckets of apples were discovered in the place of burial for the Oseberg ship in Norway She also remarks that fruit and nuts have been discovered in the early graves of the Germanic peoples in England They have also been discovered somewhere else on the continent of Europe She suggests that this may have had a symbolic meaning Nuts are still a symbol of fertility in Southwest England

Sometimes apples are eaten after they are cooked Often apples are eaten uncooked Apples can also be made into drinks Apple juice and apple cider are apple drinks 

The flesh of the fruit is firm with a taste anywhere from sour to sweet Apples used for cooking are sour and need to be cooked with sugar while other apples are sweet and do not need cooking There are some seeds at the core that can be removed with a tool that removes the core or by carefully using a knife

The scientific name of the apple tree genus in the Latin language is Malus Most apples that people grow are of the Malus domestica species

Most apples are good to eat raw and are also used in many kinds of baked foods such as apple pie Apples are cooked until they are soft to make apple sauce

Apples are also made into the drinks apple juice and cider Usually cider contains a little alcohol about as much as beer The regions of Brittany in France and Cornwall in England are known for their apple ciders

If one wants to grow a certain type of apple it is not possible to do this by planting a seed from the wanted type The seed will have DNA from the apple that the seeds came from but it will also have DNA from the apple flower that pollinated the seeds which may well be a different type This means that the tree which would grow from planting would be a mixture of two In order to grow a certain type of apple a small twig or scion is cut from the tree that grows the type of apple desired and then added on to a specially grown stump called a rootstock The tree that grows will only create apples of the type needed

There are more than 7500 known cultivars of apples Different cultivars are available for temperate and subtropical climates One large collection of over 2100 apple cultivars is at the National Fruit Collection in England Most of these cultivars are grown for eating fresh However some are grown simply for cooking or making cider Cider apples are usually too tart to eat immediately However they give cider a rich flavor that dessert apples cannot

Most popular apple cultivars are soft but crisp Colorful skin easy shipping disease resistance Red Delicious apple shape and popular flavor are also needed Modern apples are usually sweeter than older cultivars This is because popular tastes in apples have become different Most North Americans and Europeans enjoy sweet apples Extremely sweet apples with hardly any acid taste are popular in Asia and India

In the United Kingdom there are about 3000 different types of apples The most common apple type grown in England is the Bramley seedling which is a popular cooking apple

Apple orchards are not as common as they were in the early 1900s when apples were rarely brought in from other countries Organizations such as Common Ground teach people about the importance of rare and local varieties of fruit Apple Day is celebrated each October 21 in many countries

Many apples are grown in temperate parts of the United States and Canada In many areas where apple growing is important people have huge celebrations

There are lots of different varieties of apples including

Apples are in the group Maloideae It is a subfamily of the family Rosaceae They are in the same subfamily as pears Its family is the family of rose like plants and roses are in the family

People use the term Abrahamic religion for a number of religions that recognise Abraham as an important person The best known and probably most popular Abrahamic religions are Judaism Christianity and Islam Another world Abrahamic religion is the Bah Faith The Bah faith originated in the 19th century in what is known today as Iran

Even though these religions are quite different from each other in many ways they also agree in many other very important ways on the basic general nature of the one God whom they worship 

The word Abrahamic refers to the ancient prophet Abraham who is respected in Judaism Christianity and Islam as the first prophet of God

Another thing Abrahamic religions have in common is that they are Monotheistic meaning belief in just one God

They also all believe that people should pray to this God often

Algebra is a part of mathematics It is used to find values and variables that make equations and inequalities true It often needs knowledge of the rules of numbers and mathematics operations used on numbers Algebra uses letters and other symbols to represent numbers The letters and symbols in algebra are called variables We use variables because the numbers are unknown or can change

Algebra was first used to solve equations Two examples are linear equations and quadratic equations

The ways developed to solve equations frequently made use of the facts of the parts of an equation For example how to factorize polynomials or how to use a matrix to solve many linear equations at once Abstract algebra is the study of things that are found in equations For example polynomials and matrices These things are known as algebraic structures Understanding the properties of more complex algebraic structures can help us solve more complex equations

Of particular importance to the study of algebra is the study of functions since functions often appear in equations that we are trying to solve A function is like a box you can put a number or numbers into and get a certain number out When a function takes one variable in like f it is called a univariate function When a function takes many variables in like Q it is called a multivariate function 

The study of algebra is heavily concerned with the subject of graphing functions as graphs can be powerful tools in helping us to study the solutions to equations 

In some math problems one variable is changed The variable that is changed is called the independent variable After the variable is changed the math operations in the equation are performed to make a number The number that is made is called the dependent variable Most of the time the independent variable is written as x and the dependent variable is written as y for example in y 3x 1 This is because we do not know what number they are until we are told

Many math problems are about physics In many of these physics problems time is a variable Time is written t Using the basic ideas in algebra can help reduce a math problem to its simplest form making it easier to solve difficult problems Algebra is taught in school to help in harder mathematics science and engineering classes

Here is a simple example of an algebra problem

Here are steps you can use to solve the problem

This problem could be solved without algebra The purpose of simple story problems such as this one is to teach algebra Once a student is comfortable with simple problems like this it is easier to try harder ones With practice the students can use algebra when faced with a problem that is too hard to solve any other way Problems such as building a freeway designing a cell phone or finding the cure for a disease all require algebra

In addition to elementary algebra or basic algebra there are advanced forms of algebra taught in colleges and universities such as abstract algebra linear algebra and universal algebra With abstract algebra and universal algebra it is hard to see how studying them helps solve problems but with linear algebra it is much clearer

Algebra can be used to solve real problems because the rules of algebra work in real life and numbers can be used to represent the values of real things

In algebra adding z to y is written as y z Subtracting z from y is written as y z

In algebra multiplying y by z can be written in 4 ways y z yz yz or yz yz is the most usual form of writing the product of y and z in algebra

When we multiply a number and a letter in algebra we write the number in front of the letter 5 y 5y When the number is 1 then the 1 is not written because 1 times any number is that number and so is not needed

When we multiply two numbers in algebra the only way is usually 34 3 can also be used The symbol is not used because it looks too much like the letter x

In algebra dividing y by z is written as y z or yz yz is more commonly used

The word algebra is a Latin form of the Arabic word Al Jabr and comes from a mathematics book Al Maqala fi Hisab al Jabr wa al Muqabilah written in the 9th century by a famous Persian mathematician Muhammad ibn Ms al Khwrizm who was a Muslim born in Khwarizm in Uzbekistan He flourished under Al Mamoun in Baghdad Iraq through 813 833 CE and died around 840 CE The book was brought into Europe and translated into Latin in the 12th century The book was then given the name Algebra

As is a word used to compare the similarities of two ideas Like like it is a simile But as is more often used in idioms specific to English

Usually one idea is more abstract and the other is more concrete  and as is intended to be more general than just one situation 

In other words you can say more generally what an idiom or metaphor says for example battle of the sexes is both a metaphor and an idiom that suggests love as war

Because of this power you can state an idiom or metaphor in a way that makes it clear what it means and what it might assume

An atom is the basic unit that makes up all matter There are many different types of atoms each with its own name mass and size These different types of atoms are called chemical elements such as hydrogen or gold Atoms are very small but the exact size changes depending on the element Atoms range from 01 to 05 nanometers in width One nanometer is around a hundred times smaller than the width of a human hair This makes atoms almost impossible to see Equations must be used to see the way they work and how they interact with other atoms 

Atoms come together to make molecules or particles for example two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom combine to make a water molecule a form of a chemical reaction 

Atoms themselves are made up of three kinds of smaller particles called protons neutrons and electrons The protons and neutrons are in the middle of the atom They are called the nucleus The nucleus is surrounded by a cloud of electrons with a negative charge which are bound to the nucleus by an electromagnetic force 

Protons and neutrons are made up of even smaller particles called quarks Electrons are elementary or fundamental particles they cannot be split into smaller parts 

The number of protons neutrons and electrons an atom has determines what element it is Hydrogen for example has one proton no neutrons and one electron the element sulfur has 16 protons 16 neutrons and 16 electrons

Atoms move faster when in gas form than liquid and solid matter In solid materials the atoms are tightly next to each other so they broken wikt linkvibratevibrate but are not able to move as atoms in liquids do

The word atom comes from the Greek broken wikt linkindivisibleindivisible from  not and a cut The first historical mention of the word atom came from works by the Greek philosopher Democritus around 400BC Atomic theory stayed as a mostly philosophical subject with not much actual scientific investigation or study until the development of chemistry in the 1600s In 1777 French chemist Antoine Lavoisier defined the term element for the first time He said that an element was any basic substance that could not be broken down into other substances by the methods of chemistry Any substance that could be broken down was a compound

In 1803 English philosopher John Dalton suggested that elements were tiny solid spheres made of atoms Dalton believed that all atoms of the same element have the same mass He said that compounds are formed when atoms of more than one element combine According to Dalton in a compound atoms of different elements always combine the same way

In 1827 British scientist Robert Brown looked at pollen grains in water and used Daltons atomic theory to describe patterns in the way they moved This was called Brownian Motion In 1905 Albert Einstein used mathematics to prove that the seemingly random movements were down to the reactions of atoms and by doing so he conclusively proved the existence of the atom In 1869 scientist Dmitri Mendeleev published the first version of the periodic table The periodic table groups atoms by their atomic number Elements in the same column or period usually have similar properties For example helium neon argon krypton and xenon are all in the same column and have very similar properties All these elements are gases that have no colour and no smell Together they are known as the noble gases

The physicist JJ Thomson was the first man to discover electrons This happened while he was working with cathode rays in 1897 He realized they had a negative charge unlike protons and neutrons Thomson created the plum pudding model which stated that an atom was like plum pudding the dried fruit were stuck in a mass of pudding In 1909 a scientist named Ernest Rutherford used the GeigerMarsden experiment to prove that most of an atom is in a very small space called the atomic nucleus Rutherford took a photo plate and surrounded it with gold foil and then shot alpha particles at it Many of the particles went through the gold foil which proved that atoms are mostly empty space Electrons are so small they make up only 1 of an atoms mass 

In 1913 Niels Bohr introduced the Bohr model This model showed that electrons orbit the nucleus in fixed circular orbits This was more accurate than the Rutherford model However it was still not completely right Improvements to the Bohr model have been made since it was first introduced

In 1925 chemist Frederick Soddy found that some elements in the periodic table had more than one kind of atom For example any atom with 2 protons should be a helium atom Usually a helium nucleus also contains two neutrons However some helium atoms have only one neutron This means they are still helium as the element is defined by the number of protons but they are not normal helium either Soddy called an atom like this with a different number of neutrons an isotope To get the name of the isotope we look at how many protons and neutrons it has in its nucleus and add this to the name of the element So a helium atom with two protons and one neutron is called helium 3 and a carbon atom with six protons and six neutrons is called carbon 12 However when he developed his theory Soddy could not be certain neutrons actually existed To prove they were real physicist James Chadwick and a team of others created the mass spectrometer The mass spectrometer actually measures the mass and weight of individual atoms By doing this Chadwick proved that to account for all the weight of the atom neutrons must exist 

In 1937 German chemist Otto Hahn became the first person to create nuclear fission in a laboratory He discovered this by chance when he was shooting neutrons at a uranium atom hoping to create a new isotope However he noticed that instead of a new isotope the uranium simply changed into a barium atom This was the worlds first recorded nuclear fission reaction This discovery eventually led to the creation of the atomic bomb 

Further into the 20th century physicists went deeper into the mysteries of the atom Using particle accelerators they discovered that protons and neutrons were actually made of other particles called quarks

The most accurate model so far comes from the Schrdinger equation Schrdinger realized that the electrons exist in a cloud around the nucleus called the electron cloud In the electron cloud it is impossible to know exactly where electrons are The Schrdinger equation is used to find out where an electron is likely to be This area is called the electrons orbital

The atom is made up of three main particles the proton the neutron and the electron The isotope of Hydrogen Hydrogen 1 has no neutrons and a positive hydrogen ion has no electrons These are the only known exceptions all other atoms have at least one proton neutron and electron each 

Electrons are by far the smallest of the three their mass and size is too small to be measured using current technology They have a negative charge Protons and neutrons are similar sizes Protons are positively charged and neutrons have no charge Most atoms have a neutral charge because the number of protons and electrons are the same the charges balance out to zero However in ions this is not always the case and they can have a positive or a negative charge Protons and Neutrons are made out of quarks of two types up quarks and down quarks A proton is made of two up quarks and one down quark and a neutron is made of two down quarks and one up quark

The nucleus is in the middle of an atom It is made up of protons and neutrons Usually in nature two things with the same charge repel or shoot away from each other So for a long time it was a mystery to scientists how the positively charged protons in the nucleus stayed together They solved this by finding a particle called a Gluon Its name comes from the word glue as Gluons act like atomic glue sticking the protons together using the strong nuclear force It is this force which also holds the quarks together that make up the protons and neutrons

The number of neutrons in relation to protons defines whether the nucleus is stable or goes through radioactive decay When there are too many neutrons or protons the atom tries to make the numbers the same by getting rid of the extra particles It does this by emitting radiation in the form of alpha beta or gamma decay Nuclei can change through other means too Nuclear fission is when the Nucleus splits into two smaller nuclei releasing a lot of stored energy This release energy is what makes nuclear fission useful for making bombs and electricity in the form of nuclear power The other way nuclei can change is through nuclear fusion when two nuclei join together or fuse to make a heavier nucleus This process requires extreme amounts of energy in order to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between the protons as they have the same charge Such high energies are most common in stars like our Sun which fuses hydrogen for fuel

Electrons orbit or go around the nucleus They are called the atoms electron cloud They are attracted towards the nucleus because of the electromagnetic force Electrons have a negative charge and the nucleus always has a positive charge so they attract each other Around the nucleus some electrons are further out than others These are called electron shells In most atoms the first shell has two electrons and all after that have eight Exceptions are rare but they do happen and are difficult to predict The further away the electron is from the nucleus the weaker the pull of the nucleus on it This is why bigger atoms with more electrons react more easily with other atoms The electromagnetism of the nucleus is not enough to hold onto their electrons and they lose them to the strong attraction of smaller atoms 

Some elements and many isotopes have what is called an unstable nucleus This means the nucleus is either too big to hold itself together or has too many protons electrons or neutrons When this happens the nucleus has to get rid of the excess mass or particles It does this through radiation An atom that does this can be called radioactive Unstable atoms continue to be radioactive until they lose enough massparticles that they become stable All atoms above atomic number 82 are radioactive

There are three main types of radioactive decay alpha beta and gamma

Every radioactive element or isotope has something called a half life This is how long it takes half of any sample of atoms of that type to decay until they become a different stable isotope or element Large atoms or isotopes with a big difference between the number of protons and neutrons will therefore have a long half life

Astronomy is the study of outer space and everything in it This includes stars planets and galaxies as well as other things The word astronomy comes from the Greek words astron which means star and nomos which means law A person who studies astronomy is called an astronomer

Astronomy is one of the oldest sciences Ancient people used the positions of the stars to navigate and to find when was the best time to plant crops Astronomy is very similar to astrophysics Since the 20th century there have been two main types of astronomy Observational and Theoretical astronomy Observational astronomy uses telescopes and cameras to observe or look at stars galaxies and other astronomical objects Theoretical astronomy uses maths and computer models to predict what should happen The two often work together the theoretical predicts what should happen and the observational shows whether the prediction works 

Astronomy is not the same as astrology the belief that the patterns the stars and the planets make affect human lives 

Early astronomers used only their eyes to look at the stars They used maps of the stars for religious reasons and also to work out the time of year Early civilizations such as the Maya people and the Ancient Egyptians built simple observatories and drew maps of the stars positions They also began to think about the place of Earth in the universe For a long time people thought Earth was the center of the universe and that the planets the stars and the sun went around it This is known as the geocentric model of the Universe 

Arabic astronomers made many advancements during the Middle Ages including improved star maps and ways to estimate the size of the Earth

During the renaissance an astronomer named Nicolaus Copernicus thought of a new idea He thought from looking at the way the planets moved that the Earth was not the center of the Solar System He said and he was right that the Sun was at the centre of the Solar System and all the planets including Earth moved around it This is known as a Heliocentric model Another astronomer called Galileo Galilei built his own telescope and used it to look more closely at the stars and planets for the first time What he saw backed up Copernicus idea Their ideas were also improved by Johannes Kepler and Isaac Newton who came up with the theory of gravity At this time the Christian church decided that Galileo was wrong The Pope gave the order to lock Galileo up in his house and they did not let him write any more books until he died

After Galileo people used telescopes more often and began to see farther away objects such as the planets Uranus and Neptune They also saw how stars were similar to our Sun but in a range of colours and sizes They also saw thousands of other faraway objects such as galaxies and nebulae

The 20th century saw important changes in astronomy

In 1931 Karl Jansky discovered radio emission from outside the Earth when trying to isolate a source of noise in radio communications marking the birth of radio astronomy and the first attempts at using another part of the electromagnetic spectrum to observe the sky Those parts of the electromagnetic spectrum that the atmosphere did not block were now opened up to astronomy allowing more discoveries to be made

The opening of this new window on the Universe saw the discovery of entirely new things for example pulsars which sent regular pulses of radio waves out into space The waves were first thought to be alien in origin because the pulses were so regular that it implied an artificial source

The period after World War 2 saw the rise of dedicated observatories where large and accurate telescopes are built and operated at good observing sites normally by governments For example radio astronomy started out of leftover military equipment at Jodrell Bank after the war By 1957 the site had the largest steerable radio telescope in the world Similarly the end of the 1960s saw the start of the building of dedicated observatories at Mauna Kea in Hawaii a good site for visible and infra red telescopes thanks to its high altitude and clear skies Mauna Kea would eventually come to host very large and very accurate telescopes like the Keck Observatory with its 10 meter mirror 

The next great revolution in astronomy was thanks to the birth of rocketry This allowed telescopes to be placed in space on satellites

Satellite based telescopes opened up the Universe to human eyes Turbulence in the Earths atmosphere blurs images taken by ground based telescopes an effect known as seeing It is this effect that makes stars twinkle in the sky As a result the pictures taken by satellite telescopes in visible light are much clearer than Earth based telescopes even though Earth based telescopes are very large

By placing a telescope in orbit above the atmosphere astronomers had access for the first time in history to the entire electromagnetic spectrum including those that had been blocked by the atmosphere The X rays gamma rays ultraviolet light and parts of the infra red spectrum were all opened to astronomy as observing telescopes were launched As with other parts of the spectrum new discoveries were made

The period from 1970s onwards can be generalised that satellites were launched to be replaced with more accurate and better satellites causing the sky to be mapped in nearly all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum

Making new progress in Astronomy is becoming more limited by the observatories and facilities being used at this time To make up for these limitations astronomers have proposed larger and more ambitious projects These proposals some of which are being examined already by governments to see if they will be funded allow us to glimpse into what the astronomers are planning for the future of astronomy

This section summarises all the discoveries that Astronomy has made

Discoveries broadly come in two types bodies and phenomena Bodies are things in the Universe whether it is a planet like our Earth or a galaxy like our Milky Way Phenomena are events and happenings in the Universe 

For convenience this section has been divided by where these astronomical bodies may be found those found around stars are solar bodies those inside galaxies are galactic bodies and everything else larger are cosmic bodies

Stars

Diffuse Objects

Compact Stars

Phenomena are those discoveries related to events and happenings in the Universe

Broadly events and happenings in the Universe can be divided into three types burst periodic and noise

Burst events are those where there is a sudden change in the heavens that disappears quickly These are called bursts because they are normally associated with large explosions producing a burst of energy 

Periodic events are those that happen regularly in a repetitive way The name periodic comes from period which is the length of time required for a wave to complete one cycle 

Noise phenomena tend to relate to things that happened a long time ago The signal from these events bounces around the Universe until it seems to come from everyone and varies little in intensity In this way it resembles noise the background signal that pervades every instrument that tries to do astronomy The most common example of noise is static seen on analogue televisions

Cosmic background

This section tries to detail how astronomy is done 

Much of astronomy is done through observation of the heavens using instruments This section attempts to describe the various instruments used by astronomers how they work and how they are used 

These are a list of some of the common ways in which astronomers can use their equipment to get better pictures of the heavens 

Light from a distant source reaches a telescope or satellite and gets measured normally by a human eye or a camera For very dim sources there may not be enough light particles coming from the source for it to be seen One technique that astronomers have for making it visible is using integration

When a normal picture is taken with a camera the film or CCD plate is exposed to the light for a short amount of time which is normally useful because a short time means that whatever we are taking a picture of will not have moved much Astronomical sources do not move much the film or CCD plate can be left exposed for longer than an instant As light particles reach the camera over time they hit the same place making it brighter and more visible then the background until it can be seen 

Short exposures are easy However longer ones are affected by the Earths rotation causing a star wheel effect Telescopes at most observatories can normally track a source as it moves across the heavens making the star appear still to the telescope and allowing longer exposures Also images can be taken on different nights so exposures span hours days or even months

In the digital era digitised pictures of the sky can be added together by computer which overlays the images after correcting for movement

Smaller telescopes can be combined together to create a larger one which is effectively as large as the distance between the two smaller telescopes This technique was first pioneered in radio astronomy

Data analysis is the process of getting more information out of an astronomical observation than by simply looking at it 

The observation is first stored as data This data will then have various techniques applied to it out of which we may get an answer

Fourier analysis in astronomy uses the techniques of Fourier analysis in mathematics to see if an observation is changing periodically If so it can extract any and all frequencies and the type of wave pattern as well 

Astronomy is a very large subject with many different things to study and many astronomers specialise in particular areas of astronomy called fields Fields are often themselves further sub divided into sub fields and so on

Astronomers assign fields based on what they perceive to be the largest differences between different bodies and phenomena However as astronomers learn more about the Universe they often notice that things which they thought were different at first turn out to be similar and things which were similar turn out to be different As a result fields in astronomy are a constantly changing

A good example of changing fields comes from pulsars which are things which pulse regularly in radio waves These turned out to be similar to some of a type of bright source in X rays called a Low Mass X ray Binary It turned out that all pulsars and some LMXBs are neutron stars and that the differences were due to the environment in which the neutron star was found Those LMXBs that were not neutron stars turned out to be black holes

Because of its changing nature the organisation of astronomy is a very confusing thing even to astronomers and there are also many terms left over from previous fields that astronomers use which have both modern and older meanings 

This section attempts to provide an overview of the important fields of astronomy and the period they were important plus the terms used It should be noted that astronomy in the Modern Era has been divided mainly by electromagnetic spectrum although there is some evidence this is changing

For convenience the fields are grouped by the major difference that inspired them

Solar Astronomy is the study of the Sun The Sun is the closest star to Earth around 92 million miles away so it is the easiest to look at in detail Looking at the Sun can help us understand how other stars work and are formed Changes in the Sun can effect the weather and climate on Earth A stream of charged particles called the Solar wind is constantly being sent off from the Sun The Solar Wind hitting the Earths magnetic field causes the northern lights Studying the Sun helped people understand how nuclear fusion works

Planetary Astronomy is the study of planets moons dwarf planets comets and asteroids as well as other small objects that orbit stars The planets of our own Solar System have been studied in depth by many visiting spacecraft such as Cassini Huygens and the Voyager 1 and 2

Galactic Astronomy is the study of distant galaxies Studying distant galaxies is the best way of learning about our own as the gases and stars in our own galaxy make it hard for us to observe our own Galactic Astronomers attempt to understand the structure of galaxies and how they are formed and use different types of telescopes and computer simulations to do so

MagnetoHydroDynamics called MHD for short is Hydrodynamics done in the presence of magnetic fields where Hydrodynamics is the mathematical modelling of fluid flows Hydrodynamics is already useful in astronomy for mathematically modelling how gases behave However strong magnetic fields are found around many bodies and can drastically change how the gases around them behave affecting things from star formation to the flows of gases around compact stars which is why MHD is important

Gravitational Wave Astronomy is the study of the Universe in the gravitational wave spectrum So far all astronomy that has been done has used the electromagnetic spectrum Gravitational Waves are ripples in spacetime emitted by very dense objects changing shape which include white dwarves neutron stars and black holes Because no one has been able to detect gravitational waves directly the impact of Gravitational Wave Astronomy has been very limited

Architecture is a term that means either the science of the design of structures such as houses places of worship office buildings or the profession of an architect A person must study at an institution of higher education to become an architect Architecture can be about small designs such as a garage or large designs such as a whole city 

In the past people built huts and wood houses to protect themselves from the weather For safety they were often close together Great civilizations like the Ancient Egyptians built large temples and structures like the Great Pyramids of Giza The Ancient Greeks and Romans made what we now call Classical Architecture The Romans working over 2000 years ago copied the arch from the Etruscans who copied it from the Mesopotamians The stone columns which still hold up so many important buildings like the Parthenon in Athens were simply copied from the first wooden posts

Classical Architecture is very formal it always obeyed laws It used symmetry which really means balance and it used proportion which means keeping shapes in certain ways The Golden Mean was a rule which said if you are making a room or any other thing it will work best if you always make the long side 16 times longer than the short side There are many laws in Classical Architecture like how high the middle of an arched bridge needs to be These laws were learned from thousands of years of experience and they are as true today as they were 2000 years ago

In some parts of the world like India the architecture is famous for carving the stone on temples and palaces Different architectural styles were made in China Japan Southeast Asia Africa Mexico and Central and South America

Later people in Western Europe in the Middle Ages made Romanesque architecture then Gothic architecture Gothic buildings have tall pointed windows and arches Many churches have Gothic architecture Castles were also built at this time In the East of Europe churches usually had domes People were copying the Classical Architecture from the past but adding their own ideas and decoration

Then in the 18th Century the Industrial Revolution happened and people began to invent machines to make things quickly and cheaply Many factories and mills were built during or after this revolution 100 years later in the Victorian era architects like George Fowler Jones and Decimus Burton still followed the Gothic style to build new churches Up to this point buildings were limited in size and style by the strength of the wood and masonry used to construct them Gothic cathedrals were among the largest buildings because the gothic arch when combined with buttresses allowed stone buildings to be built taller For example the cathdral in Ulm Germany is over 500 feet tall However building with stone has its limits and building too tall could result in collapse an example of which is the Cathedral of Beauvais which was never completed Towards the end of the 19th Century architects began to use the newer cheaper materials like metal girders and reinforced concrete to build An example is the Eiffel Tower in Paris Buildings can now be built taller than ever before We call them skyscrapers This new technology has made us free from traditional limitations and because of the new possibilities presented by these materials many traditional methods of construction and ideas about style were reevaluated replaced or abandoned

Modernism is the name for the architectural style which developed because of these new building technologies and its beginnings can been seen as early as 1890 Modernism can also refer to a specific group of architects and buildings from the early to late 20th century and so may not be the proper term to use for many building built since then Many famous buildings existing today especially skyscrapers like the Chrysler Building in New York could not have been built using traditional methods

Anatomy is the study of the bodies of living beings It is like taking the body apart and looking at its parts People who study anatomy then look where a certain organ should be or where it normally is

The history of anatomy dates back to 1600 BCE when Egyptians began studying human anatomy They discovered the functions of many organs like the liver spleen kidneys heart etc and were the first to discover the structure and functions of the lymphatic system

Academic human anatomists are usually employed by universities medical schools or teaching hospitals They are often involved in teaching anatomy and research into certain systems organs tissues or cells

There are different systems such as the cardiovascular system the muscular system the nervous system and the skeleton Human anatomy physiology and biochemistry are similar basic medical sciences which are usually taught to medical students in their first year at medical school

An asteroid is a small object in the Solar System that travels around the Sun It is like a planet but smaller The name asteroid means like a star in the ancient Greek language Asteroids may look like small stars in the sky but they really do move around the Sun while stars only seem to move because the Earth spins Like planets asteroids do not make their own light Because of this some people think asteroids is not a good name and think that the name planetoid would be a better name

Most asteroids are made of rock but some are made of ice or metal Most asteroids in our Solar System are in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter

Asteroids are the leftover rock and other material from the formation of the Solar System These rocks were too small to make a planet and could not collide to form one The types of asteroids include Type M Type S and Type C

In the 1600s Gisuppe Piazzi found the first asteroid It was named Ceres and is the biggest object in the asteroid belt Other asteroids like Juno Pallas and Vesta were found later Today astronomers know of hundreds of thousands of asteroids which range from less than a mile to 600 miles across 

Afghanistn is a country in the Middle East It is bordered by Pakistan in the south and east Iran in the west Turkmenistan Uzbekistan and Tajikistan in the north and a narrow piece of land known as the Vakhan or Wakhan Corridor connects Afghanistan with China to the northeast

In ancient times it was crossed by trade routes connecting lands to the east and west More recently Afghanistan has been damaged by many years of war

Afghanistan is approximately 251826 square miles in area There are about 30 million people in Afghanistan though this number includes people called refugees who had fled to Pakistan and Iran Kabul the capital and largest city had about 2850000 people living in it in 2008

Afghanistan has many mountains that cover about four fifths of Afghanistan The main range is the Hindu Kush which stretches southwest from the Vakhan The Hindu Kush and the smaller ranges that cover most of central Afghanistan are part of the Himalayas The highest peak in the country is Mount Nowshak in the northeast which rises 24557 feet North of the central mountains are fertile plains and foothills The southwestern part of the country had many deserts the largest being the sandy Rigestan

Afghanistans rivers are fed by melting snow and glaciers in the mountains Northern streams flow toward the Amu Darya which forms part of the countrys northern border The Amu Darya is Afghanistans largest river but the Helmand River in the southwest is longer The Kabul River provides water for the fertile valleys and basins around Kabul and Jalalabad

Afghanistan has a dry climate with very cold winters and hot summers In the winter temperatures drop below 0F in the mountains Summer temperatures in the desert reach as high as 115F Drought sometimes causes problems for the countrys farmers Dust storms and sandstorms happen a lot in the desert

The country has a lot of a gemstone called lapis lazuli which was used to decorate the tomb of the Egyptian king Tutankhamun

Southern Afghanistan has few plants because of the dry climate There are more plants towards the north where there is more rain The high mountains have tall forests of pine and fir Cedar oak walnut alder and ash trees grow at lower places

Many of Afghanistans wild animals live the mountains These animals include wolves foxes hyenas jackals bears and wild goats Gazelles wild dogs and wild cats such as the snow leopard live all over the country The countrys birds include vultures and eagles The rhesus macaque and the red flying squirrel live in the warmer southern areas of the country

Many years of war hunting and years of drought have killed many wild animals in Afghanistan Tigers used to roam the hills but they are now extinct which means that there are no more tigers there Bears and wolves have been hunted nearly to extinction

Many different cultures have moved through or invaded the land that is now Afghanistan Today the people of Afghanistan known as Afghans have many traits passed down from these groups The largest ethnic group is the Pashtuns who make up about two fifths the Afghan people Tajiks are the second largest group making up about one third of the population Tajiks come from of the Iranian peoples Pashtuns are also related to the Iranian peoples The countrys other ethnic groups include the Hazaras Uzbeks Chahar Aimaks Turkmens Nuristani and Baloch The Hazaras live in the mountains of central Afghanistan Historians believe that the Hazras are related to the Mongols because their language has many Mongol words

The language of the Pashtuns called Pashto is an official language of Afghanistan The second official language is Dari Farsi is spoken by the Tajik Hazara and other groups Both Pashto and Dari belong to the Indo European languages but they are usually written with the Arabic alphabet Uzbek and Turkmen are widely spoken in the north and Nuristani and Pashai are spoken in the east Almost all Afghans follow the religion of Islam

Afghanistan is a largely rural country which means that there are few cities and much spaced apart land Only about one fifth of the population lives in cities Kabul the capital is the largest city It is along the Kabul River south of the Hindu Kush range Other cities in Afghanistan include Kandahar Hert Mazar e Sharif and Jalalabad The rural population is made up of farmers and nomads The farmers live mainly in small villages along the rivers The nomads live in tents while moving from place to place with their animals and belongings Few people live in the high central mountains or the deserts in the south and southwest Millions of people fled Afghanistan for Pakistan and Iran during the war that happened in the late 20th and early 21st centuries

Afghanistan is in the path of important trade routes connecting southern and eastern Asia to Europe and the Middle East Because of this many empire builders have taken over the area Signs that these emperors were near Afghanistan still exist in many parts of the country Afghanistan in near what used to be the Silk Roadso it has many cultures From up to 8000 years ago the peoples of Afghanistan helped develop world religions traded and exchanged many goods and sometimes controlled politics and culture in Asia

Archaeologists digging a cave in what is now northeastern Afghanistan discovered that people lived in the country as early as 100000 years ago They found the skull of a Neanderthal or early human as well as tools from about 30000 years ago In other parts of Afghanistan archaeologists uncovered pottery and tools that are 4000 to 11000 years oldevidence that Afghans were among the first people in the world to grow crops and raise animals 

Farmers and herders settled in the plains surrounding the Hindu Kush as early as 7000 BC These people may have grown wealthy off the lapis lazuli they found along riverbeds which they traded to early city sites to the west across the Iranian plateau and Mesopotamia As farms and villages grew and thrived in Afghanistan these ancient people eventually invented irrigation that allowed them to grow crops on the northern Afghanistan desert plains This civilization is today called BMAC or the Oxus civilization

The Oxus civilization expanded as far east as western edge of the Indus Valley during the period between 2200 and 1800 BC These people who were the ancestors of the Indo Iranians used the term Aryan to identify their ethnicity culture and religion Scholars know this when they read the ancient texts of these people the Avesta of Iranian people and the Vedas of Indo Aryans

According to the Avesta Aryans settled in sixteen districts in the area beginning with Airiana vaejo and following with Bx Bactria or Balkh Nisya a district between Margiana and Bactria Hariva Areia or Hert Vakrta Gandhra Urv Ghazni region Haraxait Arachosia or Kandahar Hatumant Helmand region Raa a district north of Haraxait and Hatumant axra arx between Ghazni and Kabul in the valley of Logar The old Greek writers knew them and called the land of these Aryan settlers Ariana 

Zoroaster the founder of the Zoroastrian religion the worlds earliest monotheistic religion lived in the area around 1000 BC

By the middle of the sixth century BC the Achaemenids conquered the land which was previously conquered by the Medes and made it part of the Persian empire Alexander the great defeated and conquered the Persian Empire in 330 BC He founded few cities in the area and Greek culture and language continued to influence the people for a long period right up to the Islamic conquest in the 7th century AD After Alexander the great Greco Bactrians Scythians Kushans Parthians and Sassanians took over

 Kushans spread Buddhism from India in the 1st century BC and Buddhism remained an important religion in the area until the 7th century The Buddhas of Bamyan were the remainder of Buddhism in Afghanistan Those giant statues were destroyed by the hard line ruling Taliban in 2001 despite international protests in defence of the priceless art The Taliban believed that those ancient statues were un Islamic

Arabs introduced Islam in the 7th century and slowly began spreading the new religion In the 9th and 10th centuries numerous local Islamic dynasties rose to power One of the earliest was the hirids of Khorsn whose kingdom included Balkh and Hert they established virtual independence from the Abbsid Caliphate in 820 The hirids were succeeded in 867869 by a native dynasty from Sstn the affrids Local princes in the north soon became feudatories of the powerful Smnids who ruled from Bukhara From 872 to 999 Bukhara Samarkand and Balkh enjoyed a golden age under Smnid rule

Turkish Ghaznavids took over in the 10th century and made Ghazni and Bust their capitals Mamd a great Ghaznavid sultan conquered the Punjab and Multan and carried his raids into the heart of India 

The north eastern parts of the Persian empire were locally recognized as Khorsn being literally the Land of the Sun which was a prosperous and important province of Persia as it was the seat of many rulers It remained the cultural capital of Persia until the devastating Mongol invasion of the thirteenth century Khorasan reached its peak of civilization in the twelfth century and cities like Hert Balkh and Ghazni were centres of science and culture The New Persian literature arose and flourished in Khorasan The early Persian poets such as Rudaki were from Khorasan Moreover Ferdowsi the author of Shahnameh the national epic of Iran and Rumi the famous Sufi poet were also from Khorasan It has produced scientists such as Avicenna Al Farabi Al Biruni Omar Khayym Al Khwarizmi and many others who are widely well known for their significant contributions in various domains such as mathematics astronomy medicine physics geography and geology

Mongols came in the 13th century and destroyed much of the Persian region Timur the Turkic conqueror took over a large part of the country in the end of 14th century Timurs successors the Timurids were great patrons of learning and the arts who enriched their capital city of Hert with fine buildings Under their rule Afghanistan enjoyed peace and prosperity

In the late middle ages there was a region in the south of Khorasan and along the Sulaiman mountains which was called Afghanistan and it was the homeland of Afghans or Pashtuns From the 16th to the early 18th century Afghanistan was controlled between the Safavids of Persia and Moghul rulers of India Safavids and Mughals sometimes occasionally oppressed the Afghans In 1709 the Hotaki tribe of Afghans revolted and fully defeated the Shia Safavid Persians and then the Mughals of India in 1747 

A great Pashtun leader named Ahmad Shah Durrani is considered the founder of Afghanistan as a united country After the Persian ruler of the region was killed in 1747 Durrani was crowned king During his rule he created a unified country out of lands that had been controlled by local rulers 

During the 1800s Afghanistan became involved in a rivalry between the British and Russian empires and served as a buffer zone between these two empires Russia was the great power to the north and Britain controlled India to the east As Russia expanded southward across central Asia Britain believed that its control over India was threatened To stop the Russian advance Britain tried to conquer Afghanistan Britain fought wars in Afghanistan from 1839 to 1842 and from 1878 to 1880 winning some control over the countrys affairs In a third war however Afghanistan won independence from Britain in 1919 when the king of Afghanistan Amanullah Khan declared independence from United Kingdom control over Afghan foreign affairs

After independence Afghanistan continued as a monarchy From the 1930s into the 1970s the country was ruled by stable governments with a king as head of state In 1973 however political crises led to the overthrow of the king The countrys new leaders ended the monarchy and made Afghanistan a republic

In 1978 a Communist political party supported by the Soviet Union seized control of Afghanistans government This move sparked rebellions throughout the country The government asked the Soviet Union for military assistance The Soviets took advantage of the situation and invaded Afghanistan in December 1979

Most of the people of Afghanistan opposed the Soviet presence For nearly a decade anti Communist Islamic forces known as mujahideen fought the invaders The United States and other anti Soviet countries supported the mujahideen The Soviet Army lost more than 10000 soldiers in Afghanistan and millions of Afghans left the country for Pakistan and Iran In 1989 the Soviet Army withdrew the last of its troops

After the Soviets left various Afghan groups began fighting for control of the country A very conservative Islamic group known as the Taliban emerged as the most powerful of these groups By the late 1990s the Taliban had gained control over most of Afghanistan Small groups continued to fight against the Taliban in the northern part of the country

The Taliban ruled Afghanistan according to their strict version of Islamic law People whom the Taliban believed violated these laws were given harsh public punishments In addition the Taliban severely restricted the rights of women Because of such policies most countries did not consider the Taliban to be the legitimate or lawful government of Afghanistan

The Taliban also angered other countries by allowing suspected terrorists to live in Afghanistan Among them were Osama bin Laden and members of his organization al Qaeda In September 2001 the United States blamed bin Laden for terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon outside Washington DC The Taliban refused to hand over bin Laden to the United States In response the United States and its allies launched a bombing campaign against the Taliban in October 2001 Within months the Taliban abandoned Kabul and a new government came to power but fighting continued 

In December 2004 Hamid Karzai became the first democratically elected president of Afghanistan

Afghanistan is a newly formed democracyfact Under the new constitution the president and two vice presidents are elected every five yearsfact The International Security Force Assistance helps the government maintain peace and rebuild the country 

The government still faces problems with the Taliban internal security and public services

Argentina is a country in south South America Argentina is the second largest country in South America and the eighth largest country in the world 

Spanish is the language most people speak and the official language but many other languages are spoken Some of these are Guarani Mapudungun and Quechua and even Welsh in Patagonia

The capital city of the Argentina is Buenos Aires one of the largest cities in the world in eastern Argentina In order by number of people the largest cities in Argentina are Buenos Aires Crdoba Rosario Mendoza La Plata Tucumn Mar del Plata Salta Santa Fe and Baha Blanca 

Argentina is located between the Andes mountain range in the west and the southern Atlantic Ocean in the east and south It is bordered by Paraguay and Bolivia in the north Brazil and Uruguay in the northeast and Chile in the west and south It also claims the Falkland Islands and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands 

The name Argentina comes from the Latin argentum as the Spanish conquistadors believed the area had silver In the Americas Canada US Brazil and Argentina are the largest countries

The oldest signs of people in Argentina are located in the Patagonia PiedraOther languages spoken are Italian English and German Lunfardo is Argentinean slang and is a mix of Spanish and Italian Argentineans are said to speak Spanish with an Italian accent

Argentina is a federal republic The people of Argentina vote for a President to rule them and Senators and Deputies to speak for them and make laws for them The President is Cristina Fernndez de Kirchner since December 2007

Argentina is divided into 23 provinces and 1 autonomous city

Argentina is almost 3700 km long from north to south and 1400 km from east to west It can be divided into three parts the Pampas in the central part of the country Patagonia in the southern part down to Tierra del Fuego and the Andes mountain range along the western border with Chile with the highest point located in the province of Mendoza Cerro Aconcagua at 6960 metres is the Americas highest mountain

The most important rivers include the River Plate Paraguay Bermejo Colorado Uruguay and the largest river the Paran River Plate was incorrectly translated though and should have been translated to English as River of Silver River Plate is also a famous Buenos Aires soccer team

The majority of the Argentineans are descendants of Europeans mainly from Spain Italy Germany Ireland France other Europeans countries and Mestizo representing more than 90 of the total population of the country

Football or soccer is the most popular sport although the national sport of the country is Pato Argentina has a number of highly ranked Polo players Field hockey rugby and golf are also favorites

Argentina is a Christian country Most of Argentinas people are Roman Catholic but it is not the state religion Argentina also has the largest population of Jewish community after Israel and US Many Middle Eastern immigrants who were Muslims converted to Catholicism but there are still Muslims as well

Medicine is socialized and so is education making Argentinas literacy rate about 98 State University is free as well

The people in Austria speak German a few also Hungarian Slovenian and Croatian The capital of Austria is Vienna 

Austria is more than a thousand years old Its history can be followed to the ninth century At that time the first people moved to the land now known as Austria The name Ostarrichi is first written in an official document from 996 Since then this word has developed into the Modern German word sterreich

Austria is a democratic state and has nine federal states Vorarlberg the Tyrol Salzburg Carinthia Styria Upper Austria Lower Austria Vienna and Burgenland It is a neutral state that means it does not take part in wars with other countries Austria is in the United Nations since 1955 and in the European Union since 1995

There has been human settlement in the area that is now Austria for a long time The first settlers go back to the Paleolithic age That was the time of the Neanderthals They left works of art such as the Venus of Willendorf In the Neolithic age people were living there to dig for mineral resources especially copper tzi a mummy found in a glacier between Austria and Italy is from that time In the Bronze Age people built bigger settlements and fortresses especially where there were mineral resources Salt mining began near Hallstatt At that time Celts began to form the first states

The Romans came 15 BC to Austria and made the celtic Regnum Noricum to a province Modern Austria was part of three provinces Raetia Noricum and Pannonia The border in the north was the Danube

Austria was an empire from about 800 to 1918 and was ruled by The House of Habsburg for most of that period Then it became a republic The First Republic was from 1918 to 1938 the Second Republic has been from 1945 From 1938 to 1945 Austria was part of Germany

Austria is a largely mountainous country since it is partially located in the Alps The high mountainous Alps in the west of Austria flatten somewhat into low lands and plains in the east of the country

Many famous composers were Austrians or born in Austria There are Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart Joseph Haydn Franz Schubert Anton Bruckner Johann Strauss Sr Johann Strauss Jr and Gustav Mahler In modern times there were Arnold Schoenberg Anton Webern and Alban Berg who belonged to the Second Viennese School 

Austria has many artists there are Gustav Klimt Oskar Kokoschka Egon Schiele or Friedensreich Hundertwasser Inge Morath or Otto Wagner and scienc

Famous Austrian dishes are Wiener Schnitzel Apfelstrudel Schweinsbraten Kaiserschmarren Kndel Sachertorte and Tafelspitz But you can also find a lot of local dishes like Krntner Reindling Tiroler Kndl or Salzburger Nockerl

Armenia is a country in Asia Its capital city is Yerevan Armenia received its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991

Armenia touches Turkey Georgia Azerbaijan and Iran

There are some minorities living in Armenia such as Greek Russian and other minorities and more than 90 of the people are ethnic Armenians Also the Armenian Apostolic Church is by far the largest religion in the country There are a small amount of other Christians Muslims and atheists

Armenia is the place that some Christians believe Noahs Ark landed and Noahs family settled The Armenian name for Armenia means Land of Haik Haik was the name of a great great grandson of Noah

Throughout history Armenias size has changed many times Today Armenia is much smaller than it was once In 80 BC the Kingdom of Armenia covered parts of what is today Turkey Syria Lebanon Iran Iraq Azerbaijan and of course Armenia

From 1920 to 1991 Armenia was a Communist country as a member of the Soviet Union

Today Armenias borders are locked with Turkey and Azerbaijan due to conflicts In 1992 Armenia and Azerbaijan had a war over the land of Nagorno Karabakh The fighting stopped in 1994 and Armenia has had control over this land but Azerbaijan still disputes about the land

Archaeology is the study of the past by looking for the remains and artifacts left by the people who lived long ago These remains can include old coins tools buildings and garbage Archaeologists the people who study archaeology use these remains to understand how people lived

Archaeologists think it is important to understand the past because so many people use the past to know where they come from 

When archaeologists do fieldwork they look for remains often by digging deep in the ground When things are found or even when nothing is found the results of the fieldwork are taken back to the place where the archaeologists base perhaps a university or museum They record every piece of information by writing down on paper or entering the information into a computer so that they can build a picture of everything that is found As settlements change and grow old buildings are often buried to make space for new buildings Ancient Rome for example is now up to 40 feet below the present city This is why archaeological fieldwork is expensive and why it takes a long time

Archaeologists do not all study the same civilizations but they specialize in different areas of interest Some fields of interest include Ancient Egypt Ancient Greece or the Vikings Archaeologists study every civilization that is known especially the ones where there is no written history They can study any time period For example one might study the beginning of human life in Africa or one might study World War II Some archaeologists study things that are now underwater They search for sunken ships or cities that have been lost under the sea

Stonehenge in England is a famous archaeological site or place Other famous sites include Angkor Wat Machu Picchu and Great Zimbabwe In many countries governments and other groups of people protect important sites so that they will not be destroyed and so that visitors can always come and see them

Sometimes archaeological sites are found when foundations are dug for new buildings Archaeologists have to work quickly when this happens because people building are always in a hurry Quite often as soon as the archaeologists have finished their work the remains that they have found will be covered over unless they are of very great importance

The word application has several uses

Animalia is the name of the animal kingdom It is a kingdom which contains all animals Animals are living things which do not make use of light to get energy and building materials as plants do They eat other organic things 

Animals can also move around which is another difference from plants Animals are divided into groups

When scientists look at animals they find things that certain animals have in common They can then group the animals according to some of these things

One classification is that some animals have a backbone and others do not The animals with a backbone are called vertebrates those without one are called invertebrates

Examples of invertebrates are bees dragonflies jellyfish etc

Some vertebrates are

Some invertebrates are

The categories above phylum level are not used by all biologists and are not part of the standard classification system

Animals are metazoan living things They do not make their own food by themselves Animals usually eat other living things to get energy to live Some are parasites and some have photosynthetic protists as symbionts 

There are millions of animal species Some are big and some are small some are fat and some are tall Some live in water others live on the ground and some animals can fly Being able to move from one place to another is a distinctive trait of an animal

Some animals eat only plants they are called herbivores Other animals eat only meat and are called carnivores Animals that eat both plants and meat are called omnivores Animals are divided into groups see animalia Their mode of nutrition is known as heterotrophic nutrition because they eat other living organisms as food in order to survive 

There are animals living in solitary and in groups Examples of animals living in solitary are tigers rhinoceros cheetahs and more Examples of animals living in groups are coyotes bees monkeys and more Animals living in solitary do not have to share food with each other Animals living in groups have better protection against becoming the prey of others Bees and ants are grouped in a special group called a colony In a colony the animals work together in a special way and usually have a leader The leader of the bees is called the Queen Bee 

The animal kingdom is varied There are many types of animals But the common animals you know are only about 3 of the animal kingdom There are many other animals such as insects and sponges Animals can mainly be divided into two main groups the invertebrates and the vertebrates The vertebrates are animals with a backbone or spine and the invertebrates without Invertebrates include insects crustaceans molluscs corals worms and much more The vertebrates are divided into 5 groups fish birds amphibians reptiles and mammals Animals breathe Oxygen to live Below are some common collective nouns for groups of animals

Acceleration has its own units of measurement For example if velocity is measured in meters per second and if time is measured in seconds then acceleration is measured in meters per second squared 

Acceleration can be positive or negative When the acceleration is negative it is sometimes called deceleration For example when a car brakes it decelerates Physicists usually only use the word acceleration 

This formula is very well known and it is very important in physics Newtons Second Law of Motion in short Newtons Second Law is often one of the first things that physics students learn

Deceleration is the opposite of acceleration This means that something slows down instead of speeding up For example when a car brakes it is decelerating

Black pudding is an English name for blood sausage It is food made by cooking down the blood of any mammal with meat fat or filler until it is thick enough to congeal when cooled

In England blood sausage is called Black Pudding The ingredients include pigs blood suet bread barley and oatmeal The most common kind of German blutwurst is made from fatty pork meat beef blood and filler such as barley Though already cooked and ready to eat it is usually served warm

Other kinds of blood sausage include boudin noir boudin rouge and morcilla

A legend says that blood sausage was invented in a bet between two Bavarian butchers drunk on the alcoholic drink absinthe during the 14th century Homers Odyssey from Ancient Greece says that As when a man besides a great fire has filled a sausage with fat and blood and turns it this way and that and is very eager to get it quickly roasted

A boot device is used to start a computer It is named after a boot which fits on the foot The word bootstrap is also closely related and means to use something simpler to get something more complex to make itself work better It comes from the English phrase pull yourself up by your own bootstraps

Before a computer can operate normally it must have operating system instructions that tell it how to perform basic functions A boot device loads the operating system into the memory of the computer 

Devices that can boot a computer are usually boot disks or boot drives Some network computers use boot chips that get the operating system over a network Web phones also use such chips to identify the user to the cell network Boot card standards may let many users boot kiosk computers with full privacy and access to all applications they own There are also boot boards or boot add in cards that are more permanent than boot cards

Some people refer to the boot device as just a boot and non boot devices as data devices although it is not the computer but the operating system that cares about the difference between these

The boot in boot device is the same as booting This is short for bootstrapping or to start with simple stuff and make complex stuff out of it

A boot is a type of footwear that protects the foot and ankle Boots are higher and larger than shoes and sandals Some boots are high enough to protect the calves as well Some boots are held on with bootstraps or bootlaces Some also have spats or gaiters to keep water out Most have a very strong boot sole the bottom part of a boot

People in English speaking countries refer to boots in a figurative or joking manner when they tell someone to lift yourself up by your own bootstraps This is a joke because it is impossible for someone to lift themselves up by their own bootstraps What the person is really saying is figure out your problem yourself or find your own way to better your situation

As well people sometimes use the term to bootstrap This is an idiom meaning to use something simpler to get something more complex to make itself work better The word boot is also used to describe how a computer starts up when a person presses the on button 

Bancruptcy is when someone or an organisation does not have enough money to pay all of its debt is insolvent If it applies for protection by law it may then be bankrupt 

In many countries a company or business can file for bankruptcy protection so that creditors cannot destroy all of the physical capital and goodwill by breaking it apart and moving it away All this provides is more time to work out a new deal between the owners and the people the business owes money

An individual person who owes debt and cannot pay it can also declare bankruptcy That person will lose all but some basic things they own but all the debt will go away Normally they cannot easily borrow money again for years

Very often a creditor threatens a debtor with debt slavery if the debtor does not know that they have a right to go bankrupt This is a human rights problem in very many countries Also some creditors continue to bother a debtor even though bankruptcy laws say they should not hoping that the debtor will pay them money they might not otherwise get

Breakfast sausage is a type of fresh pork sausage made from seasoned ground meat mixed with bread crumbs Breakfast sausage has a blander flavor than many other types of sausage such as Polish or Italian style sausages

Breakfast sausages are not cured or smoked like other types of sausages which means that they have to be cooked soon after they are purchased Uncooked sausages should be stored in the refrigerator or the freezer Individuals handling them should wash their hands in hot soapy water because uncooked pork is unhealthy for humans Pork sausages have to be heated until all of the meat inside is cooked 

They are usually fried or grilled in a pan until they are browned and served at breakfast often with cooked eggs pancakes and toasted bread Breakfast sausages are also used in other dishes such as toads in the hole a cooked egg dish

Different types made from pork and beef mixtures as well as poultry can now be found There are also vegetarian types that use textured vegetable protein in place of meat Breakfast sausages are available in patties or slices from a large roll or in weiner like links of different lengths and thickness

A browser is an animal usually a herbivorous mammal which eats leaves and shrubs rather than grass It is contrasted with grazers which eat grass

Beekeeping or apiculture is the farming of honeybees

The keeping of bees is usually and has been in the past for honey That is becoming less true Instead it is more used for crop pollination and other products These are wax and propolis 

There is only one queen bee in each hive and she is bigger than the rest She lays all the eggs which makes all the other bees in the hive her daughters and sons However they do not control the hive

British English is the kind of English language which is used in the United Kingdom and countries that used to be in the British Empire

In the United Kingdom many different people say words in different ways For example a man from a place near London may not say his rs the same as a man from Scotland or a man from Northern Ireland In fact peoples languages are different across the UK depending on the area you are in For example in Wales one might speak Welsh or in Ireland Irish Across the country the accent is different For instance in Liverpool one speaks with a scouse accent or in London one speaks with a cockney accent Different variations on all of British English exist from the manner in which words are pronounced to the manner in which they are spelt One place people speak English in a different way is Cornwall where the Cornish dialect is spoken

 Spelling in British English  British English often keeps more traditional ways of spelling words than American English 

In British English dock refers to the water in the space between two piers or wharfs In American English the pier or wharf could be called a dock and the water between would be a slip

Some simpler differences

British  American

The word being means the same as person Men women and children are human beings

Some people write stories or make movies about beings from other planets Most religions talk about supernatural beings for example spirits angels devils gods or God

Being is something THAT IS

Beijing is the capital of the Peoples Republic of China The city used to be known as Peking It is located in the northern and eastern parts of the country

The city of Beijing has played a very important role in the development of China Many people from different cities and countries come to Beijing to look for better chances to find work Nearly 15 million people live there In 2008 Beijing hosted the Olympic Games

Beijing is well known for its ancient history Since the Jin dynasty Beijing has been the capital of several dynasties including the Yuan Ming Qing and others There are many places of historic interest in Beijing These places include the Summer Palace the Temple of Heaven and the Great Wall of China

Beijing means the northern capital in the Chinese language It was once a counterpart of Nanjing the southern capital during the Ming Dynasty This dynasty gave Beijing its name When the city does not serve as the capital city the city reverts to its original name of Beiping northern peace this occurred between 1928 and 1949 when Nanjing was the capital of the Republic of China

The center of Beijing was settled in the 1st millennium BC In those days the Kingdom of Yan set up their capital where Beijing is today They called it Ji After the Kingdom of Yan was destroyed the city became smaller although it was still an important place

Beijing became more important again in the 10th century when the Jin dynasty set its capital there This city was destroyed by Mongol forces in 1215 Then in 1267 Mongols built a new city on the north side of the Jin capital and called it Great Capital which was the beginning of modern Beijing When Kublai Khan the Mongolian monarch set up the Yuan dynasty this city became his capital

The Yuan Ming and Qing dynasties all made Beijing their capitals When the Qing dynasty lost power and the Republic of China was set up the new Republic moved its capital from Beijing to Nanjing When the Peoples Republic of China seized power Beijing became the capital of China again    

Beijing is the education center of Peoples Republic of China More 500 famous universities of China are located in Beijing They also include 5 of the top universities Peking University Tsinghua University China People University Beijing Normal University and Beihang University Beijing is also education center of China for teaching Chinese as a foreign language The standard Chinese pronunciation is based on Beijing dialect so over 70 foreigners who want to study Chinese go to Beijing for their studies

A bottle is a small container used to carry liquids Bottles can be many different sizes Bottles are usually made of glass or plastic Usually Beer bottles are made of glass and soft drinks are made of plastic

Milk wine lemonade and water are often put into bottles

Filetrueberriesjpg300pxthumbrightFour fruits that are true berries shown larger than they are Clockwise from right

 The word berry is used for many different kinds of small fruits that have many seeds and can be used as food Some examples are strawberry raspberry blueberry and lingonberry A berry can be either one fruit or many fruits joined together like raspberry

When botanists talk about berries they mean a simple fruit produced from a single ovary They sometimes call this true berry to distinguish it from false berries By that statement of how words are used grapes or tomatoes are true berries

The berry is the most common type of soft fruit in which the entire ovary wall gets to the right stage of development of an pericarp which can be taken as food The flowers of these plants have a upper ovary formed by the fusion of two or more carpels The seeds are inside the soft body of the ovary

Berries are small sweet liquid bright colored fruits Due to this they are able to bring more animals towards them and spread their seeds

Some fruits that are called berries in English are not true berries by the use of words above These include strawberries blackberries raspberries and boysenberries Some true berries do not have berry in their name These include tomatoes eggplants cranberries guavas pomegranates and chillies Pumpkins cucumbers melons oranges and lemons are differently made berries

To boil water is to make it hot so that it begins to make bubbles and turns into steam Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius At high altitudes in the mountains water boils at a lower temperature because of the lower atmospheric pressure in high places 

To boil food is to cook it in boiling water

The word boil also has a different meaning A boil can also be an infection of the skin A boil of the skin is a red place on the skin that is very painful The person also may have a fever The infection is caused by the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus

A beard is the hair growing on the lower part of a mans face

The hair that grows on the upper lip of some men is a mustache When a man has hair only below the lower lip and above the chin it is called a soul patch Some men have a lot of hair and a big beard and some have very little In the modern world many men shave part or all of their beards or cut their beard so it does not get very long 

In light black is lack of all color In painting however the black pigment is the combination of all colors In heraldry black is called sable

The word black comes from Old English blc from Proto Germanic blakkaz and from Proto Indo European bhleg In many languages black has the same meaning as ink

In science an object that is black absorbs the light that hits it Because these objects do not reflect any light the human eye cant see any color coming from that object The brain then sees these objects as black

A way to create black objects is to mix pigments A pigment works by reflecting only the color of the pigment For example a blue pigment absorbs all colors except blue By mixing pigments in the right quantities black can be made

Because black bodies absorb light they become hotter faster

Black is associated with power elegance formality anarchy death evil and mystery Black is a dark color the darkest color there is Black along with gray and white is a neutral color This means that it is not a hot color or a cool color

Black is a color seen with fear and the unknown It can have a bad meaning or a good meaning Black can stand for strength and power It can be a formal elegant and high class color Black clothing is common in emo and goth subculture

Bubonic plague is the best known form of the disease plague which is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis The name bubonic plague is specific for this form of the disease which enters through the skin and travels through the lymphatic system 

If the disease is left untreated it kills about half its victims in between three and seven days This disease may have been the Black Death a disease which killed tens of millions of people in Europe in the Middle Ages

Symptoms of this disease include coughing fever and black spots on the skin 

There are different kinds of Bubonic plague The most common form of the disease is spread by a certain kind of flea that lives on rats Then there is an incubation period which can last from a few hours to about seven days 

A Sepsis happens when the bacterium enters the bloodstream 

This happens when the bacterium can enter the lungs About 95 of all people with this form will die Incubation period is only one to two days

This is the most harmless form It will result in a little fever After that there are antibodies that protect against all forms for a long time

During the 1300s this epidemic struck parts of Asia North Africa and Europe Almost a third of the people in Europe died of it Unlike catastrophes that pull communities together this epidemic was so terrifying that it broke peoples trust in one another Giovanni Boccaccio an Italian writer of the time described it This scourge had implanted so great a terror in the hearts of men and women that brothers abandoned brothers uncles their nephews sisters their brothers and in many cases wives deserted their husbands But even worse fathers and mothers refused to nurse and assist their own children

The plague was not just carried by rats as some people assume The fleas also carried it It came abroad from Kaffa by the Black Sea From there the disease started to go new places in 1347 It went to England in 1349 There it killed half of the people in England 70 of people who got plague died Pigs are also to blame for the transmission as the bacteria stayed in their blood system and when eaten people caught the plague This is a reason why so few Jews caught the disease

In the 20th century some countries did research on the bacteria that causes bubonic plague They did research to use it for biological warfare

Samples of this bacteria are carefully controlled There is much paranoia about it Dr Thomas C Butler a US expert in this organism was charged in October 2003 by the FBI with various crimes This happened after he said he lost samples of Yersinia pestis This is the bacteria that causes bubonic plague The FBI did not find the samples They do not know what happened to them

Biology is the science of life and living things and their evolution Living things include plants animals fungi and microorganisms such as bacteria and archaea 

People who study biology are called biologists Biology looks at how animals and other organisms behave and work and what they are like Biology also studies how organisms react with each other and the environment It has existed as a science for about 200 years and was preceded by natural history Biology has many research fields and branches Like all sciences biology uses the scientific method This means that biologists must be able to show evidence for their ideas and that other biologists must be able to test the ideas for themselves 

Biology attempts to answer questions like these What are the characteristics of this living thing How do the parts work How should we group living things What does this living thing do How does inheritance work What has been the history of life How do organisms relate to their environment All modern biology is influenced by evolution which answers the question How has the living world come to be as it is

Botany is the study of plants It is a science It is a branch of biology and is also called plant biology It is sometimes called phytology Scientists who study botany are called botanists They want to learn about how plants work

Belgium is a country in Western Europe It is next to France Luxembourg Germany and the Netherlands The name Belgium comes from Gallia Belgica a Roman region in the northernmost part of Gaul where the Belgae lived a combination of Celtic and Germanic peoples

The capital city of Belgium is Brussels

There are three regions in Belgium Flanders in the northern half of Belgium Wallonia in the southern half and the Brussels Capital Region in the middle 

Inside Wallonia is the area of the German speaking Community of Belgium The community has its own parliament and government but they are not yet as powerful as the Flemish and Walloon bodies 

Belgium is next to France Germany Luxembourg and the Netherlands Its total area with surface water area is 33990 square kilometers the land area alone is 30528 km Belgium has three main geographical regions the coastal plain in the north west and the central plateau are part of the Anglo Belgian Basin the Ardennes uplands in the south east are part of the Hercynian orogenic belt The Paris Basin reaches a small fourth area at Belgiums southernmost tip Belgian Lorraine The coastal plain is made up of mainly of sand dunes and polders Further inland lies a smooth slowly rising landscape watered by many waterways with fertile valleys and the northeastern sandy plain of the Campine The hills with many forests and plateaus of the Ardennes are more rough and rocky with caves and small narrow valleys Extending to the west into France this area is eastwardly linked to the Eifel in Germany by the High Fens plateau on which the Signal de Botrange forms the countrys highest point at 694 metres

Belgium is a federal country There are three regions the Dutch speaking Flemish Region the French speaking Walloon Region and the Brussels capital region Although Brussels is surrounded by the Flemish Region its importance as the national capital means it is a special bilingual zone There is a fourth language group the German speaking community of the Walloon Region with an elected assembly and its own Minister President 

The regions are divided into ten provinces

The provinces are divided into 589 communes

Brazil is a country in South America It is the worlds fifth largest country The country has a population of 201103330 people People in Brazil speak Portuguese and it is the only country in Latin America that speaks Portuguese some people in Brazil speak German dialects and Indigenous Brazilian languages Italian dialects Japanese dialects French dialects and as the result of recent immigration South American Spanish dialects Guaran and Aymar are also present and spoken as mother tongue of a minority of Brazilians The capital of Brazil is Braslia a city planned and built from 1957 to 1960

Brazil has the worlds largest rain forest the Amazon Rainforest It makes up 40 of the countrys land area Brazil also has other types of land there is a type of savanna called cerrado there is also a dry plant region named caatinga Caatinga means white vegetation in Tupi a native language of Brazil

Brazil is known for soccer but it also has many other things a varied culture and a growing economy Brazil is the largest country in South America and the largest economy in Latin America Its people include people of Portuguese or other European descent African descent and native Amerindians as well as many people of mixed origins Brazil also has the biggest number of Japanese descendents outside Japan The country is the fifth largest in the world by area It is known for its numerous rainforests and jungles It neighbours Guyana Suriname French Guiana Venezuela Colombia Peru Bolivia Paraguay Argentina and Uruguay therefore it borders every country in South America with the exception of two Chile and Ecuador

The most important cities are So Paulo Rio de Janeiro Salvador Braslia Curitiba Belo Horizonte Porto Alegre Recife Fortaleza Manaus Goinia and Vitria

People from Brazil are called Brazilians

Chemistry is the science of chemical elements and compounds and how these things work together It is the study of the materials that make up our bodies and everything in the world around us

Before 1600 people studied substances to figure out how to do things such as turn lead into gold but no one managed to do that This was called alchemy Alchemists did discover some useful things though Sulphuric acid and nitric acid were two substances that they discovered Only a few elements were known Some of them are mercury silver gold and carbon Chemistry began as a true science during the 1600s This is when chemists discovered the simplest substances that make up all other substances These simple substances are called elements One of the things that they learned is that gold and lead are made of two different elements so you can not change one into the other by a chemical reaction The first element discovered after 1600 was phosphorus a strange white glowing solid Elements were discovered more and more rapidly People separated the air into many parts and isolated the noble gases from it They also processed special minerals from a mine in Sweden to get rare earth metals Radioactivity was also discovered Today chemists have discovered 118 different elements Some are very common like oxygen Many are very rare and expensive like platinum Some cannot be found on earth and can only be made in labs like rutherfordium Since the 1920s the increased understanding of physics has changed chemists theories about chemical reactions With smaller and faster computers chemists have build better tools for analyzing substances These tools have been sent to study chemicals on Mars Police also use those tools to study evidence from crime scenes

Only a few elements were known Some of them are mercury silver gold and carbon

Chemistry began as a true science during the 1600s This is when chemists discovered the simplest substances that make up all other substances These simple substances are called elements One of the things that they learned is that gold and lead are made of two different elements so you can not change one into the other by a chemical reaction The first element discovered after 1600 was phosphorus a strange white glowing solid

Elements were discovered more and more rapidly People separated the air into many parts and isolated the noble gases from it They also processed special minerals from a mine in Sweden to get rare earth metals Radioactivity was also discovered Today chemists have discovered 118 different elements Some are very common like oxygen Many are very rare and expensive like platinum Some cannot be found on earth and can only be made in labs like rutherfordium

Since the 1920s the increased understanding of physics has changed chemists theories about chemical reactions With smaller and faster computers chemists have build better tools for analyzing substances These tools have been sent to study chemicals on Mars Police also use those tools to study evidence from crime scenes

There are several types of chemistry Analytical chemistry sees what chemicals are in things A sample job would be to see how much arsenic is in food Organic chemistry looks at things that have carbon in them A sample job would be making acetylene Inorganic chemistry looks at things that do not have carbon in them A sample job would be making an integrated circuit

A large area of chemistry is polymer chemistry It looks at plastics A sample job would be making nylon Because plastics are made of carbon polymer chemistry is part of organic chemistry Then there is biochemistry It looks at the chemistry of living things A sample job would be seeing how arsenic poisons people Biochemistry is also part of organic chemistry There are many other small branches of chemistry

The basic unit of an element is called an atom An atom is the smallest thing that you can cut an element into without the element breaking down A chemical compound is a substance made up of two or more elements In a compound the atoms of each element are joined together to form a molecule The tiniest speck of dust or drop of liquid that one can see is made up of many millions or billions of these molecules Mixtures are substances where chemicals are mixed but not reacted An example would be mixing sand and salt It is just a mixture If it is put in water the salt will dissolve leaving the sand behind Chemical compounds are changed by a chemical reaction An example would be heating sodium bicarbonate common baking soda It will make water carbon dioxide and sodium carbonate

A mole is a very large amount of atoms The atomic mass of an element can be used to see how much of the element makes a mole For example the atomic mass of copper is about 6355 That means about 6355 grams of copper metal has a mole of atoms The atomic mass of chlorine is about 3545 That means 3545 grams of chlorine has a mole of atoms in it

Moles can be used to see how many molecules are in chemical compounds too Copper chloride is an example CuCl2 is its chemical formula There is one copper atom and two chlorine atoms Add all the molar masses of the elements together and the molar mass of the chemical compound is gotten That means in 13445 grams of copper chloride there is one mole of copper chloride molecules This concept is used to calculate how much chemicals are needed in a chemical reaction if no reactants should be left If too much reactant is used there will be some reactants left in the chemical reaction

Acids and bases are common chemicals Acids release H ions when in water and bases release OH ions when in water Acids can react with bases The H ion is taken from the acid by the base This makes water H2O A salt is also made when an acid and a base react together An example would be reacting hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide Hydrochloric acid releases H and Cl ions in water The base releases Na and OH ions The H and the OH react to make water There is a solution of sodium chloride left Sodium chloride is a salt 

Chemistry is very common in normal life and makes up the foundation of much of science Most objects are made by chemists Chemists are constantly working to find new and useful substances Chemists make new drugs and materials like paints that we all use every day

Although there are some chemicals that are harmless many chemicals are dangerous For example mercury chloride is very toxic Chromates can cause cancer Tin chloride pollutes water easily Hydrochloric acid can cause bad burns Some chemicals like hydrogen can explode or catch fire To stay safe chemists experiment with chemicals in a chemical lab They use special equipment and clothing to do reactions and keep the chemicals contained The chemicals used in drugs and in things like bleach have been tested to make sure they are safe if used correctly

Computer science is the science of how to treat information There are many different areas in computer science Some of the areas consider problems in a more abstract way Some areas need special machines called computers A person who works with computers will often need mathematics science and logic in order to make and use computers

 Common tasks for a computer scientist 

This is so that they can find new and easier ways to do things

Computers can do some things easily Computers cannot do some things though Computers cannot answer questions when there is not enough information or when there is no real answer Also computers may take too much time to finish long tasks For example it may take too long to find the shortest way through all of the towns in the USA  so instead a computer will try to make a close guess A computer will answer these simpler questions much faster

Algorithms are ways to solve problems or do things Think about playing cards for example A computer scientist wants to sort the cards First he wants to sort them out by color Then he wants to order them by number The computer scientist may see different ways to sort the playing cards He must now think about of how he will do it When he decides he has created an algorithm After making the algorithm the scientist needs to test whether the algorithm always does what it should Then the scientist can see how well his program sorts the cards

A simple but very slow algorithm could be drop the cards pick them up and check whether they are sorted If they are not do it again This method will work but it will often take a very long time The name of this sorting algorithm is Bogosort

A person may do this better by looking through all the cards finding the first card and putting it at the start After this he looks for the second card and so on This works much faster and does not need much space The name of this sorting algorithm is selection sort

Computer science began during World War II and separated from the other sciences during the 1960s and 1970s Now computer science uses special methods of doing things and has its own special words It is related to electrical engineering mathematics and language science

Computer science looks at the theoretical parts of computers Computer engineering looks at the physical parts of computers and software engineering looks at the use of computer programs and how to make them

A computer is a machine that changes information according to well defined rules Computers have existed for much of human history Examples of early computers are the astrolabe and the abacus Modern computers have changed very much They are able to control traffic lights cars locks coffee makers or anything else electronic Most modern computers can be used to play music or video The basic principle is still the same though the computer has a set of rules usually called an algorithm The computer changes information based on these rules

A person uses a computer by telling it to do things like playing movies or going to Wikipedia Computers do not know English so people must tell their computers to do things by speaking the computers language The computers language is called machine code Programmers can know this computers language but they would rather use a programming language Programmers use it to write programs that tell the computer what to do Normal people use the programs that a programmer wrote to tell the computer what to do 

Computers can do anything that someone can tell them to do Computers are able to solve mathematical problems because a programmer has told them how to solve math problems Because computers are very fast modern computers can solve billions of math problems per second Computers are used to control factories which in the past were controlled by humans They are also in homes where they are used for things such as listening to music reading the news and writing

Nobody knows who built the first computer This is because the word computer used to mean a person who did math as their job Because of this some people say that humans were the first computers Human computers got bored doing the same math over and over again and made tools to help them get the answers to their problems It is said that the inventor of the modern computer was Charles Babbage

Humans have a problem with math To show this try doing 584 x 3220 in your head It is hard to remember all the steps People made tools to help them remember where they were in a math problem The other problem people have is that they have to do the same problem over and over and over again A cashier used to make change every day in her head or with a piece of paper That took a lot of time and people made mistakes So people made machines that did those same things over and over This part of computer history is called the history of automated calculation which is a fancy phrase for the history of machines that make it easy for me to do this same math problem over and over without making mistakes

The abacus the slide rule the astrolabe and the Antikythera mechanism are examples of automated calculation machines

Some people did not want a machine that would do the same thing over and over again For example a music box is a machine that plays the same music over and over again Some people wanted to be able to tell their machine to do different things For example they wanted to tell the music box to play different music every time They wanted to be able to program the music box to order the music box to play different music This part of computer history is called the history of programmable machines which is a fancy phrase for The history of machines that I can order to do different things if I know how to speak their language

One of the first examples of this was built by Hero of Alexandria He built a mechanical theater which performed a play lasting 10 minutes and was operated by a complex system of ropes and drums These ropes and drums were the language of the machine they told what the machine did and when Some people argue that this is the first programmable machine

Most historians agree that the castle clock an astronomical clock invented by Al Jazari in 1206 is the first known programmable analog computer It showed the zodiac the solar and lunar orbits a crescent moon shaped pointer travelling across a gateway that made some doors to open every hour and five robotic musicians who play music when levers hit them The length of day and night could be changed every day in order to account for the changing lengths of day and night throughout the year Some peoplewho consider Ada Lovelace to be the first programmerfactdateJune 2010

At the end of the Middle Ages people in Europe thought math and engineering were more important In 1623 Wilhelm Schickard made a mechanical calculator Other Europeans made more calculators after him They were not modern computers because they could only add subtract and multiply you could not change what they did to make them do something like play tetris Because of this we say they were not programmable 

In 1801 Joseph Marie Jacquard used punched paper cards to tell his textile loom what kind of pattern to weave He could use punch cards to tell the loom what to do and he could change the punch cards which means he could program the loom to weave the pattern he wanted This means the loom was programmable 

Modern computers were made when someone had an idea He wanted to make a machine that could do all the boring parts of math and could be told to do them different ways Charles Babbage was the first to make a design of a fully programmable mechanical computer He called it the The Analytical Engine Because Babbage did not have enough money and always changed his design when he had a better idea he never built his Analytical Engine

As time went on computers got more and more popular And that stands out at the beginning This is because people get bored easily doing the same thing over and over Imagine spending your life writing things down on index cards storing them and then having to go find them again The US Census Bureau in 1890 had hundreds of people doing just that People got very bored and very frustrated and would say There HAS to be an easier way to do this Then a clever person worked out how to make machines do a lot of the work Herman Hollerith figured out how to make a machine that would automatically add up information that the Census bureau collected The Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation made his machines and everyone was happy At least they were happy until their machines broke down got jammed and had to be repaired This is when the Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation invented tech support 

Because of machines like this new ways of talking to these machines were invented and new types of machines were invented and eventually the computer that we all know and love today was born

In the first half of the 20th century scientists started using computers mostly because scientists had a lot of math to figure out and wanted to spend more of their time thinking about the secrets of the universe instead of spending hours adding numbers together If you remember getting bored doing your times tables you will know exactly how they felt 

So they put together computers These computers used analog circuits which made them very hard to program Then in the 1930s they invented digital computers which made them easier to program 

Scientists figured out how to make and use digital computers in the 1930s and 1940s Scientists made a lot of digital computers and as they did they figured out how to ask them the right sorts of questions to get the most out of them Here are a few of the computers they built 

Several developers of ENIAC saw its problems They invented a way to for a computer to remember what they had told it and a way to change what it remembered This is known as stored program architecture or von Neumann architecture John von Neumann talked about this design in the paper First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC distributed in 1945 A number of projects to develop computers based on the stored program architecture started around this time The first of these was completed in Great Britain The first to be demonstrated working was the Manchester Small Scale Experimental Machine while the EDSAC completed a year after SSEM was the first really useful computer that used the stored program design Shortly afterwards the machine originally described by von Neumanns paperEDVACwas completed but was not ready for two years

Nearly all modern computers use the stored program architecture in some form It has become the main concept which defines a modern computer Most of the technologies used to build computers have changed since the 1940s but many current computers still use the von Neumann architecture

In the 1950s computers were built out of mostly vacuum tubes Transistors replaced vacuum tubes in the 1960s because they were smaller and cheaper  They also need less power and do not break down as much as vacuum tubes In the 1970s technologies were based on integrated circuits Microprocessors such as the Intel 4004 made computers smaller and cheaper They also made computers faster and more reliable By the 1980s computers became small and cheap enough to replace mechanical controls in things like washing machines The 1980s also saw home computers and personal computer With the evolution of the Internet personal computers are becoming as common as the television and the telephone in the household

In 2005 Nokia started to call some of its mobile phones multimedia computers and after the launch of the Apple iPhone in 2007 many are now starting to add the smartphone category among real computers In 2008 if the category of smartphones are included in the numbers of computers in the world the biggest computer maker by units sold is no longer Hewlett Packard but rather NokiafactdateDecember 2008

There are three types of computers desktop computers mainframes and embedded computers 

A desktop computer is a small machine that has a screen Most people keep them on top of a desk which is why they are called desktop computers Laptop computers are computers small enough to fit on your lap This makes them easy to carry around Both laptops and desktops are called personal computers because one person at a time uses them for things like playing music surfing the web or playing video games 

There are bigger computers that many people at a time can use These are called Mainframes and these computers do all the things that make things like the internet work You can think of a personal computer like this the personal computer is like your skin you can see it other people can see it and through your skin you feel wind water air and the rest of the world A mainframe is more like your internal organs you never see them and you barely even think about them but if they suddenly went missing you would have some very big problems 

There is another type of computer called an embedded computer An embedded computer is a computer that does one thing and one thing only and usually does it very well For example an alarm clock is a embedded computer it tells the time Unlike your personal computer you cannot use your clock to play Tetris Because of this we say that embedded computers cannot be programmed because you cannot install programs like Tetris on your clock Some mobile phones automatic teller machines microwave ovens CD players and cars are examples of embedded computers

Computers store data and the instructions telling them what to do with the data as numbers because computers can do things with numbers very quickly These data are stored as binary symbols A 1 or a 0 symbol stored by a computer is called a bit which comes from the words binary digit Computers can use many bits together to represent instructions and the data that these instructions use A list of these instructions is called a program and stored on the computers hard disk Computers use memory called RAM as a space to carry out the instructions and store data while it is doing these instructions When the computer wants to store the results of the instructions for later it uses the hard disk

An operating system tells the computer how to understand what jobs it has to do how to do these jobs and how to tell people the results It tells the electronics inside the computer or hardware how to work to get the results it needs This lets most computers have the same operating system or list of orders to tell it how to talk to the user while each computer can have its own computer programs or list of jobs to do what its user needs Having different programs and operating systems makes it easy to learn how to use computers for new things When a user needs to use a computer for something different the user can learn how to use a new program

One of the most important jobs that computers do for people is helping with communication Communication is how people share information Computers have helped people move forward in science medicine business and learning because they let experts from anywhere in the world work with each other and share information They also let other people communicate with each other do their jobs almost anywhere learn about almost anything or share their opinions with each other The Internet is the thing that lets people communicate between their computers

A computer is now almost always an electronic device It usually contains materials that will become toxic waste when disposed of When a new computer is bought in some places laws require that the cost of its waste management must also be paid for This is called product stewardship

Computers can become obsolete quickly depending on what programs the user runs Very often they are thrown away within two or three years because newer programs require a more powerful computer This makes the problem worse so computer recycling happens a lot Many projects try to send working computers to developing nations so they can be re used and will not become waste as quickly as most people do not need to run new programs

Computers come in different forms but most of them have a common design

A computer has several main parts When comparing a computer to a human body the CPU is like a brain It does most of the thinking and tells the rest of the computer how to work The CPU is on the Motherboard which is like the skeleton It provides the basis for where the other parts go and carries the nerves that connect them to each other and the CPU The motherboard is connected to a power supply which provides electricity to the entire computer The various drives act like eyes ears and fingers and allow the computer to read different types of storage in the same way that a human can read different types of books The hard drive is like a humans memory and keeps track of all the data stored on the computer Most computers have a sound card or another method of making sound which is like vocal cords or a voice box Connected to the sound card are speakers which are like a mouth and are where the sound comes out Computers might also have a graphics card which helps the computer to create visual effects such as 3D environments or more realistic colors and more powerful graphics cards can make more realistic or more advanced images in the same way a well trained artist can

Chinese means from or about the country of China especially a person from China or one of the languages of China

Chinese Writing does not use letters It has 50000 different characters each one made of different lines called strokes There are many different Chinese dialects but they all write using the same characters 

Each line of Chinese is written starting at the top of the page and working downwards The lines are written working from the right to the left of the page However some countries like Singapore writes Chinese the same way as writing English

There are two types of Chinese writing Traditional and Simplified

In modern China most Chinese people do not write the traditional way The government made a simpler way of writing known as Simplified Chinese Many people also use a computer The most popular way to use a computer keyboard to type Chinese is called Pinyin People in Taiwan continue to write with Traditional Chinese

Chinese writing is often written as a type of art called calligraphy which means making art from writing

The following lists the different ISO 639 1 language codes for the different Chinese related languages

Overseas Chinese are a group of people who are Chinese but are not living in or under the government of the Republic of China and the Peoples Republic of China About 78 of the overseas Chinese live in Asia

A continent is a large area of the land on Earth that is joined together In general it is agreed there are seven continents Africa Antarctica Asia Europe North America Australia and South America

Most sources say that Australia is one of the seven continents Others believe that Australia is part of another continent called Oceania They believe that Oceania is a region which includes Australia New Zealand and the Pacific Islands 

Some say that North America and South America are one continent Some say that Europe and Asia are only parts of a continent called Eurasia Some even say that Eurasia and Africa are one continent called Eurafrasia

When British people talk about the Continent they mean the European mainland This meaning is not used as much as it used to be but is still seen in phrases like Continental breakfast

Continents not only move but also sometimes crash into each other The Indian subcontinent has been colliding with the Eurasian continent for a while now As these continents push against each other they buckle and bend Because of this the Himalaya Mountains where Mount Everest is are still being made today

The Greek classical elements are fire air water and earth In Greek philosophy science and medicine these make up a whole

The image below has two squares on top of each other The corners of one are the classical elements The corners of the other are the properties

Galen said these elements were used by Hippocrates to describe the human body The elements are linked to the four humours phlegm yellow bile black bile and blood

The last Chinese Civil War has resulted in two nations

China has one of the worlds oldest civilizations and has the oldest continuous civilization It has archaeological evidence over 5000 years old It also has one of the worlds oldest writing systems and is viewed as the source of many major inventions

The first recorded use of the word China is dated 1555 It is derived from Cin a Persian name for China popularized in Europe by Marco Polo

Ancient China was one of the first civilizations Chinese civilization was also one of the few to invent writing the others being Mesopotamia the Indus Valley civilization the Maya civilization the Minoan civilization of ancient Greece and Ancient Egypt It reached its golden age during the Tang Dynasty China is home to some of the oldest artwork in the world Statues and pottery as well as decorations made of jade are some classic examples

Chinas economy and military weakened during the Qing Dynasty and the country was oppressed by foreign nations In 1911 a country the Republic of China was founded by Sun Yat sen But its government was very weak Army leaders in different area controlled the local governments and later fell into the dictatorship of Chiang Kai shek

In 1931 Japan invaded Manchuria a place in the northeastern part of China On July 7 1937 the Japanese attacked the rest of the country starting what was named the Sino Japanese War The war later became part of World War II The war was fought for eight years and millions of Chinese people were killed In 1945 after the United States dropped two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan surrendered unconditionally to the Allied Powers

However the Chinese Civil War later started between the Kuomintang of the Republic of China and the Communists of the Peoples Republic of ChinaOne side wanted to make China like Soviet Union whereas the other side wanted to keep China in its current state at the time which caused chaos and lots of people died in the Chinese Civil War The Chinese Civil War was going on throughout World War II The Communists led by Mao Zedong Liu Shaoqi and others Later Shaoqi lost influence on Mao and his death to this day remains unresolved Communists eventually won the war The Nationalists fled to the island of Taiwan and set up their new capital city in TaipeiAfter the Chinese Civil War the Communist leader Mao Zedong declared a new country the Peoples Republic of China in Beijing on October 1 1949

Under Mao the country experienced great social upheaval during the Cultural Revolution and suffered famines during his attempt at industrialization in the Great Leap Forward Following his death in 1976 China underwent open market reforms under Deng Xiaoping and experienced rapid economic growth China is now one of the largest economies in the world relying mainly on exports

In recent history China has had problems with protests blocking of information on the Internet and censorship in the news 1989 was notable for the government killing thousands of protesters with tanks in Beijing

China is the original birth place of Eastern martial arts called Kung Fu or its first name Wushu China is also the home of the well respected Spa Monastery and Wudang Mountains The first generation of martial art started more for the purpose of survival and warfare than art Over time some art forms have branched off while others have retained their distinct Chinese flavor Regardless China has brewed some of the most renowned artists including Wong Fei Hung and many others Art has also co existed with a variety of paints including the more standard 18 colors Legendary and controversial moves like Big Mak are also praised and talked about within the culture

China has many traditional festivals such as Spring Festival Dragon Boat Festival Mid autumn Festival and so on The most significant is Chinese New Year People in China will have holidays to celebrate these festivals 

Spring Festival is the Chinese New Year It lasts fifteen days It starts with the first day of the Chinese lunar year and ends with the full moon fifteen days later On the first day of the Spring Festival people call on friends and relatives Because most of people watch the Spring Festival Celebrations on CCTV all the night on New Years Eve and dont go to bed until 1200 AM they usually get up later in the next day The fifth day of the Spring Festival is the day to welcome the God of Wealth many people make and eat dumplings they believe that dumplings can hold the God of Wealth and bring luck to their selves The last day of the Spring Festival is the Lantern Festival On this day the moon becomes the full moon People go out and watch the lantern festivals everywhere After that they eat sweet dumpling a kind of dumpling which looks like the moon

Dragon Boat Festival is celebrated to commemorate the death of Qu Yuan a patriotic poet of the State of Chu during the Warring States period He persuaded his emperor not to accept Qins diplomats offers several times but his emperor did not listen to him He was very sad and ended up jumping into the river to end his life The people loved him so much that they did not want the fish to eat his corpse They made and threw rice dumplings into the river They hope the fish eat these dumplings instead of the poets corpse They also rowed dragon boats in the river to get rid of the fish Such practices eating rice dumplings and holding dragon boat races become what Chinese do in this festival nowadays

In geography a country is a political division It is often a sovereign territory The term is most commonly associated with both state and nation and also with government For example the United States of America is a country

Colchester is a town in the northern part of the English county of Essex It has a population of 104000 people People believe that Colchester is the oldest Roman town in England

Before Roman times Colchester was Camulodunon This is a Celtic name that came from Camulos Camulos was the Celtic god of war The Romans called Colchester Camulodunum Colchester was attacked and burnt by Boudicca in 61 AD

The church at the Benedictine abbey of Saint John the Baptist was destroyed in 1539 This was when King Henry VIII took the property of the Roman Catholic institutions in England The only part left is a gate that people still go to visit

King Cunobelinus was from Colchester

Colchester is twinned with the following cities

Cartography is making maps Cartography is part of geography How people make maps is always changing In the past maps were drawn by hand but today most printed maps are made using computers Someone who makes maps is called a cartographer

Making a map can be as simple as drawing a direction on a napkin or as complicated as showing a census of a whole country Anyone can make a map but there are people who spend their lives learning how to make complicated maps

A Creator is a person who creates something

In some religions God is the most important and original Creator of the whole Universe  including Man who is made in his image to observe it and control it like God The idea that anything that a person is creating like an idea can be owned as property comes from the ethical traditions and legal codes that came from these religions

In other traditions anyone has this potential for creating and can become part of the greater creating of the universe Stewardship of home land and all of Earth is a test for participating in this or just good sense Sometimes this belief is not well understood and poorly translated by those who only understand the Man in Gods image view This view has often been projected onto people who do not believe in it along with concepts of intellectual rights inappropriate for those peoples

A contact network is a group of people who can all quickly get in touch with each other It does not guarantee any kind of help or access to knowledge other than that

A creative network social network and power network are also contact networks These include some kind of guarantee or expectation of help Thus they involve more investment per person

Chorizo is a pork sausage which people first made in the Iberian Peninsula It is made with large pieces of fatty pork chili pepper and paprika The special taste of this sausage comes from the mild Spanish paprika in it

In the western hemisphere the Mexican and Caribbean types are better known These types of chorizo are much with smaller pieces of pork and different seasonings and peppers are used

Cured smoked chorizo can be eaten without cooking Fresh chorizo must be cooked before eating It can be eaten by its self or as part of meal It can also be used in place of ground beef or pork

Creativity is the ability of a person or group to make something new and useful or valuable or the process of making something new and useful or valuable It happens in all areas of life  science art literature and music As a personal ability it is very difficult to measure The reason is that we dont understand the mental processes that help some people be more creative than others Judging what is creative is also controversial Some people say only things which are historically new are creative while other people say that if it is new for the creator and the people around them then it is also creativity

Some think creativity is an important thing that makes humans different from apes Others recognize that even apes other primates other mammals and some birds adapt to survive by being creative Liane Gabora believes that all culture comes from creativity not imitation Therefore these people say human science should focus on it Ethics for example would focus on finding creative solutions to ethical dilemmas Politics would focus on the political virtues that need some creativity Imitation would not be the focus of education Linguistics might be more interested in how new words are created by culture rather than in how existing ones are used in grammar

Intellectual interests are a way to reward creativity in law but they do not always work very well A good example is copyright which is supposed to pay authors and artists but may only pay lawyers to make arguments in court

Creativity is a central question in economics where it is known as ingenuity or individual capital  capacities that individuals have that do not arise from simple imitation of what is known already This is separate from the instructional capital that might try to capture some of that in a patent or training system that helps others do what the individual leader or founder of the system can do In urban economics there are various ways to measure creativity  the Bohemian Index and Gay Index are two attempts to do this accurately and predict the economic growth of cities based on creativity For information on creativity see practical creative ideas and tools

The Cathar faith was a version of Christianity They were usually considered Gnostics The word Cathar comes the Greek word katharos meaning unpolluted or the pure ones

The Cathars believed that the world had been made by a bad god They believed that this bad god had taken them from the good god and put them in the world but inside their bodies there was a spirit and that spirit needed to return to the good god They were famous for a belief in a form of reincarnation and believed that when someone died the bad god would put that persons spirit in a new body They believed this cycle of coming back to life could be escaped by a ritual cleansing They were opposed to the doctrine of sin 

Women were prominent in the faith They were pacifists They were vegans 

They preached tolerance of other faiths They rejected the usual Christian doctrine of marriage and only believed in the New Testament An earlier 10th century Bulgarian heresy Bogomilism and also Manichaeism started some of these trends 

They used a bible in the language people spoke Many other Christians used a Bible in Latin Latin was spoken only by the priests

In 1145 open challenge to Catholic dominance began In about 1165 the first Cathars said that the Church was full of ravening wolves and hypocrites and worshipping the wrong God right in front of the most powerful Catholics In 1166 the Council of Oxford in England wiped out the English Cathars It was also suppressed in Northern France In 1167 Cathar bishops met to discuss organizing a counter Church  in the South of France the Langedoc nobles protected it and many noble women became Perfects Parish clergy had low morale

The Catholic Church was against Catharism seeing it as a heresy

In the South of France there was tremendous religious fervor and an economy that was starting to grow and a social class of merchants and peasants was starting to grow Peasants owned their own land Meanwhile in other parts of Europe peasants were forced to give up their land to nobles and become serfs or slaves  the system of feudalism There was a strong central absolute monarchy that did not exist in the South of France The burghers and bankers had more power in this looser system R I Moore is a historian who believes that it was desire to crush this system and take over the land that drove the attack

However there was real cultural and religious difference to cause problems Troubadors who combined some of the traditions of the Bards of the Celts and Jews were both part of the multicultural society in the South of France Their influences were not appreciated by local or Roman Church figures The 12th century Roman Catholic Monks were founding their monasteries outside the towns drawing the best people there

The Cathars thus had little competition The Cathar Perfects the so called Good Men or Good Women lived austere lives and spread their faith in towns  where the Catholics in general did not have their best agents Also Cathars preached that only these Good leaders had to follow the regimens their whole lives  lay people could repent only on their deathbeds Many 20th century Christian sects have similar beliefs

The Pope ordered a crusade against the Cathars in southern France He said any crusader who answered the call would be given the same rewards as a crusader who went to the Holy Land This was an absolution of all sin

In the Launguedoc on the 22nd of July 1209 a force of about 30000 Crusaders arrived at the walls of Beziers bearing the cross pattee so as to mislead and create ease amongst the Cathars thinking they we are friend not foe and demanded that about 200 Cathars be surrendered The people of the town who were mostly Catholic said that rather than turn over their friends and kin we would rather be flayed alive 

A mistake by the defenders of Beziers let thousands of attackers inArnauld Amaury made famous the quote Kill them allgod knows his ownduring the assault on being asked how to tell who were CatharsEveryone in the town was massacred some while taking refuge in the church It is guessed that 20000 were killed many of whom were Catholics and not Cathars at all The crusade became known as the Albigensian crusade after the town of Albi It was to wipe out the Cathars almost entirely over forty or so years The Crusaders wanted to go home but were ordered by the Pope to continue until the whole South of France was controlled and all Cathars were dead In1210 they attacked the fortress at Minerv and built the first great bonfire of heretics  beginning the practice of burning at the stake that would continue in the Inquisition of the Counter Reformation It is interesting to note that at the siege of Montsegur when the fires were lit the Cathars ran down the hill and threw themselves onso devout was their belief

After decades of harassment and re conversions and killing of Cathars the religion was broken Catharism disappeared from the northern Italian cities after the 1260s pressured by the Inquisition The last known Cathar perfectus in the Languedoc Guillaume Blibaste was killed in 1321

Cosmology is the branch of astronomy that deals with the origin structure and space time relationships of the universe NASA defines cosmology as The study of the structure and changes in the present universe Another definition of cosmology is the study of the universe and humanitys place in it

Modern cosmology is dominated by the Big Bang theory which brings together observational astronomy and particle physics 

Though the word cosmology is recent the study of the universe has a long history

Comparing various creation myths and world views from all over the world is part of anthropology This is today done separately from astrophysics and astronomy

Until recently people thought that the universe was the Milky Way They thought this because they could only see the planets up to Saturn and stars With the invention of the telescope our universe got bigger Even in the 20th century people thought that the Milky Way was the universe With the Hubble Space Telescope people could see things far away

A church is a building that was constructed to allow people to meet to worship together These people are usually Christians or influenced by Christianity Other religious groups also have such buildings but they have different names Jews pray in synagogues Muslims pray in mosques Hindus and Buddhists pray in temples

Depending on the number of people that are in a community the churches come in different sizes Small churches are called chapels The churches in a particular geographical area form a group called the diocese Each diocese has a cathedral In most cases the cathedral is a very big church Cathedrals are the seat of bishops

In the early days of Christianity people had to worship in secret Christian worship was not allowed in the Roman empire so Christians had to meet in a secret place Sometimes they met in peoples houses or barns sometimes they met underground The first places that were built for Christian worship were small chapels that were cut into a rock where people could worship without being discovered

After the death of the Roman emperor Constantine in 337 AD Christians were allowed to have buildings to worship in These first churches were built on a similar plan to Roman basilicas This plan was later used for the fine Gothic cathedrals and churches that were built at the end of the Middle Ages

There are several parts in the architecture of a church Not all churches will have all these parts

In Roman Catholic churches there is always a stoup of holy water near the entrance of the church This tradition comes from the fact that Roman basilicas had a fountain for washing in front of the entrance The font is a bowl where people are baptized This is also near the entrance of the church This is a symbol of the fact that it is welcoming the people into the Christian church

Traditionally the nave has long benches for the congregation to sit on These are called pews Some churches may now have replaced their pews with chairs so that they can be moved about for different occasions At the front of the nave is the pulpit where the priest preaches There is also a lectern from where the lessons are read

If there are aisles along the side of the nave there will be pillars which hold up the roof In large churches or cathedrals there may be a row of little arches along the top of these pillars This is called the triforium Over the triforium is the clerestory which is a row of small windows high up in the church wall

The chancel is the most holy part of the church and this is why it is often separated from the nave by a screen which can be made of wood or stone or occasionally iron The congregation can see through the screen On the top of the screen there may be a cross This is called a rood screen Priests used to climb up a staircase to the top of the rood screen to read the epistle and the gospel Sometimes people sung from there

Inside the chancel are the benches where the choir sit These are called choir stalls They are on both sides The two sides of the choir sit facing one another The choir members who sit on the left are called cantoris and those on the right are called decani In some large churches or cathedrals the seats for the priests tip up The top of these seats when they are tipped up are called misericords This is because the priests or monks were able to lean against them when they got tired if they had to stand up for a long time

Sometimes there are holes in the walls of the screen so that the congregation can see through These are called squints If there is a recess in the wall it is called an aumbry It is a cupboard for communion wine that has been blessed by a priest

The altar may be right at the east end of the church but in larger churches or cathedrals it is often much farther forward In that case the very east end is called an apse Sometimes it is a separate chapel called the Lady Chapel

The design of churches changed a lot during the course of history Often churches were made bigger When this happened there may be a mixture of architectural styles These styles vary a lot in different countries

In English churches there were several different periods of architecture

In the 1600s churches were built in a variety of styles Often they copied some of the older styles After the Great Fire of London many new churches were built by the architect Sir Christopher Wren They were built in the classical style Churches continued to be built in later centuries like this but also the Gothic style continued to be used

Modern churches often do not have the traditional cross shape It is difficult for the congregation to see and hear what is happening in the chancel Modern churches bring the congregation choir and priests in closer touch An example is the round design for the Church of Christ the Cornerstone in Milton Keynes Modern churches are often simpler but with a warmer character than the Gothic churches Many have beautiful mosaic glass windows Coventry Cathedral is a famous example of a modern church building

A city pronunciation is a place where many people live together A city has many buildings and streets It has houses or apartments for many people to live shops where they may buy things places for people to work and a government organisation to run the city and to keep law and order in the city Many people live in cities because it is easy for them to find and do the things they want there A city usually has a city centre where government and business take place and places called suburbs where people live around the outside of the centre 

There is no rule that is used all over the world to decide why some places are called city and other places are called town 

Some things that make a city are 

In American English people often call all places cities

The sizes of cities can be very different This depends on the type of city that it is Cities that were built hundreds of years ago and which have not changed much are very much smaller than modern cities There are two main reasons One reason is that old cities often have a city wall and most of the city is inside it Another important reason is that the streets in old cities are often narrow If the city got too big it was hard for a cart carrying food to get to the market place People in cities need food and the food always has to come from outside the city Cities that were on a river like London could grow much bigger than cities that were on a mountain like Siena in Italy because the river made a transport route for carrying food and other goods as well as for transporting people London has been changing continually for hundreds of years while Siena which was a very important city in the 1300s has changed very little in 700 years Modern cities with modern transport systems can grow very large because the streets are wide enough for cars buses and trucks and there are often railway lines as well

In the US the word city is often used for towns that are not very big When the first European people went to America they gave the name city to new places They hoped the places would be great cities in the future For example Salt Lake City was the name given to a village of 148 people When they started building the town they made street plans and called it Great Salt Lake City Now 150 years later it really is a big city 

In modern times many cities have grown bigger and bigger The whole area is often called a metropolis and can sometimes includes several small ancient towns and villages The metropolis of London includes the City of London the City of Westminster and many old villages such as Notting Hill Southwark Richmond Greenwich and etc The part that is officially known as the City of London only takes up one square mile The rest is known as Greater London Many other cities have grown in the same way 

These giant cities can be exciting places to live and many people can find good jobs there but modern cities also have many problems Many people cannot find jobs in the cities and have to get money by begging or by crime Cars factories and garbage create a lot of pollution that makes people sick

Urban history 

Urban History is history of civilization The first cities were made in ancient times as soon as people began to create civilization Famous ancient cities which fell to ruins included Babylon Troy Mycenae and Mohenjo Daro

Benares in northern India is one among the ancient cities which has a history of more 3000 years Other cities that have existed since ancient times are Athens in Greece Rome and Volterra in Italy Alexandria in Egypt and York in England

In Europe in the Middle Ages being a city was a special privilege granted by nobility Cities that fall into this category usually had city walls The people who lived in the city were privileged over those who did not Medieval cities that still have walls include Carcassonne in France Tehran in Iran Toledo in Spain and Canterbury in England 

In the United Kingdom a city is a town which people have always called a city or which has got the name city status by royal charter Cities usually get this because they have a special number of people or are important In the past cities got that name if they had a cathedral or a university Some cathedral cities for example St Davids are small and people do not normally think of them as cities Cities that became cities because of their university generally grow because more people move there to be educated at the university colleges The university cities of Oxford and Cambridge are famous throughout the world 

In modern Europe any town with at least 10000 people in it can call itself city Many cities that have their status from the Middle Ages are actually smaller than 10000 people

In the world today there are twenty cities with more than 10 million people

Cooking is a process to make food ready to eat by heating it People can cook food with fire using wood or charcoal with a stove that uses propane or natural gas or with a stove that uses electricity An oven is a part of a stove that is like a box People also build ovens out of clay or bricks

There are several different ways to cook food We boil food by cooking it in water We fry food by cooking it in hot butter or vegetable oil We bake food by keeping it hot in an oven We roast or grill food by holding it over a hot fire

People often cook meat by boiling roasting or grilling it People bake bread Some breads are fried

Usually we cook the food in some kind of pot or pan Sometimes people cook food by putting it directly into the fire by wrapping the food in leaves before they put it into the fire or holding it over a fire with a stick

Before foods are cooked we say they are raw Some foods are good to eat raw Other foods are not good for the body when they are raw so they must be cooked Some foods are good to eat either raw or cooked and can be used in different recipes

A person whose job it is to cook food may be called a cook or a chef However the word cooker means a machine or tool that a cook might use to cook food such as a rice cooker

To many people cooking is an art To many other people it is a job Cooking as an art is preparing the food so it tastes and looks really good

There is a large economy for cooking in the world Restaurants hire skilled cooks for amounts of money and customers pay for meals

To chat is to talk about ordinary things that are not very important You can chat to one person or to many people People also use this word now for parts of the Internet where we can talk with many different people at the same time Usually you chat on the Internet in a chat room or messaging service like AOL Instant Messenger Yahoo Messenger Windows Live Messenger or Tencent QQ There are also programs which let you use different messaging services from one program such as Pidgin humiliated by those who do

A cup is a container that can hold a liquid so we can drink it Sometimes a cup has a handle on the side Most cups for drinking hot drinks for example coffee or tea have handles Types of cups include

Some are expensive maybe old mostly painted by hand a few people collect such cups and do not use them Teacups have a special small plate to sit on called a saucer   

A cup is also a unit of liquid measurement in some countries

  

A cup can also be an award

A crime is an act that a person does which is against the laws of a country or region A person who does this is called a criminal

The basic idea of what things are called crimes is that they are thought to be things that might cause a problem for another person Things like killing another person injuring another person or stealing from another person are crimes in most countries Also it can be a crime to eat some types of food such as meat of rare exotic animals marijuana leaves or mushrooms that contain psychedelic drugs

When some criminals make money from crime they try to stop the police finding out where the money came from by money laundering

There are various levels of crimes

Different countries have many different ideas of what things are crimes and which are severe enough to be treated as felonies Some things that are crimes in one country are not crimes in other countries Many countries get their ideas of what things are crimes from religions or controversial events which cause a law to be quickly created For example a religion might consider eating a particular food to be a crime Another example is the ban in some regions on texting while driving an automobile as new laws created after people died from wrecks when they were distracted by mobile phone messages

In many countries if people say they made or wrote a book movie song or Web page that they did not really write or make it is a crime against the laws of copyright In many countries helping to grow make move or sell illegal drugs is a crime 

In most countries police try to stop crimes and to find criminals When the police find someone who they think might be a criminal they usually hold the person in a jail Then usually a court or a judge decides if the person really did a crime If the court or judge decides that the person really did it then he or she might have to pay a fine or go to prison Sometimes the judge might decide that the criminal should be executed This is called Capital punishment There are countries in the world who execute criminals and others who do not

Time Cube is a website created by Gene Ray On that website Dr Ray explains his Time Cube theory which describes the planet Earth as having a cubic symmetry and time as rotating four corners He also says that all of modern physics is wrong Many scientists reject these ideas saying that they make no sense and cannot be tested

The Time Cube website is written in an angry and hateful voice On his site Ray says that anyone who does not believe in Time Cube is stupid and evil Some of the comments are racist especially against black people and Jews There are also many comments against gay people Many people find the site to be difficult to understand 

Ray has spoken about Time Cube at two universities in the United States MIT and Georgia Tech At MIT a professor tried to cancel the lecture before it took place Ray believes this is proof of a conspiracy to keep information about Time Cube hidden

The Census of Marine Life is a ten year survey of life in the oceans starting in 2000 Its head is Ron ODor of Dalhousie University in Halifax Nova Scotia Canada It uses data from researchers all over the world More than 70 nations are involved and over a billion US dollars will be spent on it 

It is a major work of marine ecology

It is trying to do what the World Wide Fund for Nature and National Geographic Society did for terrestrial ecoregions  say exactly what is alive on the planet

In this case in the seas

Maize is a member of the grass family Poaceae It is a cereal grain that was first grown by people in ancient Central America It is now the third most important cereal crop in the world It is used as a food staple by many people in Mexico Central and South America and parts of Africa In Europe and the rest of North America maize is grown mostly for use as animal feed In Canada and the United States maize is commonly referred to as corn

Maize has been a fruitful model organism for genetic research over many years see Barbara McClintock

Civics is the study of government It most often refers to studying government in high school to prepare to be a good citizen In college civics is usually called political science Since a city has the most unsimple government problems the word for this study is like that for city

Theories of civics can be grouped as

Calculus is a branch of mathematics which looks at things that change over time It tries to say what type of change it is and how big it is using functions at the exact moment at which the change is taking place There are two different types of calculus Differential calculus divides things into small pieces and tells us how they change from one moment to the next while integral calculus joins the small pieces together and tells us how much of something is made by a change It is used in many different areas of study such as physics astronomy biology engineering economics medicine and sociology

The word Calculus comes from the Latin language meaning small stone

In the 1670s and 1680s Sir Isaac Newton in England and Gottfried Leibniz in Germany figured out calculus at the same time working separately from each other Newton wanted to make new math to predict where to see planets in the sky because astronomy has always been a popular and useful form of science and knowing more about the motions of the objects in the night sky was important for navigation of ships Leibniz wanted to work out the space under a curve Many years later the two men argued over who discovered it first Scientists from England supported Newton but scientists from the rest of Europe supported Leibniz Most mathematicians today agree that both men share the credit equally Some parts of modern calculus come from Newton such as its uses in physics Other parts come from Leibniz such as the symbols used to write it

They were not the first people to use mathematics to describe the physical worldAristotle and Pythagoras came earlier as did Galileo who said that mathematics was the language of science But they were the first to design a system that describes how things change over time and can predict how they will change in the future

The name calculus was the Latin word for a small stone the ancient Romans used in counting and gambling The English word calculate comes from the same Latin word

Differential calculus is the process of finding out the rate of change of a variable compared to another variable It can be used to find the speed of a moving object or the slope of a curve figure out the maximum or minimum points of a curve or find answers to problems in the electricity and magnetism areas of physics among many other uses

Many amounts can be variables which can change their value unlike numbers such as 5 or 200 Some examples of variables are distance and time The speed of an object is how far it travels in a particular time So if a town is 80 kilometres away and a person in a car gets there in one hour they have traveled at an average speed of 80 kilometres per hour But this is only an averagethey may have been traveling faster at some times and slower at others Imagine a driver trying to figure out a cars speed using only its odometer and clock without a speedometer

Until calculus was invented the only way to work this out was to cut the time into smaller and smaller pieces so the average speed over the smaller time would get closer and closer to the actual speed at a point in time This was a very long and hard process and had to be done each time people wanted to work something out

A very similar problem is to find the slope at any point on a curve The slope of a straight line is easy to work outit is simply how much it goes up divided by how much it goes across On a curve though the slope is a variable because the line bends But if the curve was to be cut into very very small pieces the curve at the point would look almost like a very short straight line So to work out its slope a straight line can be drawn through the point with the same slope as the curve at that point If it is done exactly right the straight line will have the same slope as the curve and is called a tangent But there is no way to know whether the tangent is exactly right and our eyes are not accurate enough to be certain whether it is exact or simply very close

What Newton and Leibniz found was a way to work out the slope exactly using simple and logical rules They divided the curve into an infinite number of very small pieces They then chose points on either side of the range they were interested in and worked out tangents at each As the points moved closer together towards the point they were interested in the slope approached a particular value as the tangents approached the real slope of the curve They said that this particular value it approached was the actual slope

If we use y x the derivative produced using this method is 2x or 2 multiplied by x So we know without having to draw any tangent lines that at any point on the curve f x the derivative f will be 2x at any point This process of working out a slope using limits is called differentiation or finding the derivative

Mathematicians have grown this basic theory to make simple algebra rules which can be used to find the derivative of almost any function

The main idea in calculus is called the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus This main idea says that the two calculus processes differential and integral calculus are opposites That is a person can use differential calculus to undo an integral calculus process Also a person can use integral calculus to undo a differential calculus method This is just like using division to undo multiplication or addition to undo subtraction

In a single sentence the Fundamental Theorem runs something like this The integral of the derivative of a function f is the function itself

The method integral calculus uses to find areas of shapes is to break the shape up into many small boxes and add up the area of each of the boxes This gives an approximation to the area If the boxes are made narrower and narrower then there are more and more of them and the area of all the boxes becomes very close to the area of the shape One of the main ideas of calculus is that we can imagine having an infinite number of these boxes each infinitely narrow and then we would have the exact area of the shape

Calculus is used to describe things that change like things in nature It can be used for showing and learning all of these

A coin is normally a round piece of metal that is used as currency or money Coins have been made for about 2600 years the first place to make coins was Lydia

Many coins have unique or complicated decorations one side often has the picture of a famous or important persons head on it Most people use coins as currency 

The different decorations on each side of a coin might be used to decide things randomly This is called tossing a coin A person can throw the coin into the air and catch it You then look at which side is facing up If the head is facing up it is called heads if the other side is facing up it is called tails Before tossing the coin someone has to decide what each side means 

Tossing a coin can be a type of gambling which is illegal in some countries However it is fine if something is gambled upon without a price someone risks If its merely to decide something that is alright

Some people see coins as a sign of greed such as some Communists and Puritans who sometimes condemn over hoarding of coins and ascetics who often keep little in the ways of money leading a poor lifestyle

Because coins have been made for a very long time some people collect old coins They can be much cheaper than other old things especially if they are made of cheap metals like copper Older coins normally cost more than newer ones but rarity matters more some coins from the 1920s cost vast sums while some Roman coins cost very little

A conceptual metaphor or cognitive metaphor is a metaphor which refers to one domain in terms of another For example treating quantity in terms of direction

However conceptual metaphor is more an investigation into how metaphors work than a particular kind of metaphor

The crust of a piece of bread is the edge where it is harder and darker

Crust can also mean

There are different definitions of the word comedy

Comedies may also show people telling jokes and funny stories People who are known for acting in comedies are comedians or comedic actors

Comedy plays have been around for thousands of years The ancient Greeks had comedy plays One of the best known comedy authors of the time was Arisophanes One of his works The Clouds was performed 425 BC The work did not survive It contains some of the accusations that were used against Socrates at his trial twenty years later The Clouds is an Old Comedy Typical for this genre are that the author criticzes society and living people New Comedy is not about critizising people or ideas but rather about showing characters in funny situations The most important Greek playwright of this type was probably Menander The best known Roman comedy writer was Plautus He often used Greek comedies for his plays 

Many comedy plays were written in the 1500s by the British writer William Shakespeare Shakespeares comedy plays include Alls Well That Ends Well The Comedy of Errors A Midsummer Nights Dream and Twelfth Night In Shakespeares day a comedy did not mean a play that would make people laugh or that had a lot of jokes Instead it was a play in which all the problems work out all right in the end This was unlike a tragedy where the problems do not work out usually resulting in someones death The two masks one was smiling the other crying often associated with theatre represent comedy and tragedy

There are different types of comedy One type of comedy is called slap stick comedy In slap stick comedy people just do silly things such as tripping falling over or embarrassing themselves just to make people laugh Slap stick comedy can be used in comedy movies or comedy television shows

Slap stick comedy was used a lot in silent movies from the 1920s A comedian who acted in the silent movies who used a lot of slapstick comedy was Charlie Chaplin In the 1950s and 1960s comedian Jerry Lewis also used silly slap stick comedy in his comedy movies

A comedy is a very popular type of movie Some comedy movies have slapstick comedy in which people just do silly things such as tripping falling over or embarrassing themselves just to make people laugh Other comedy movies show funny stories or situations in which people are behaving in a silly manner Some comedies make the audience laugh by showing strange or unusual images or situations that do not make sense

A parody or spoof movie makes another movie series or person look silly to make people laugh Imitating and exaggerating one movie in a funny manner to make people laugh 

Some types of comedy movies mix comedy with other types of movies There is a type of movie called a dramedy which is a mix of a drama movie and a comedy movie 

Comedy shows are very popular on television Comedy shows on television are often called sitcoms The word sitcom is a shortened way of saying situational comedy Television situational comedies usually show characters who do silly or funny things which make the audience laugh

A comet is a ball of mostly ice that moves around in outer space They are often described as dirty snowballs They are very different from asteroids In the solar system the orbits of comets go further than Pluto Most are very far away from the Sun but some come near enough to Earth for us to see at night They have long tails because the Sun melts the ice A comets tail does not trail behind it but points directly away from the Sun because it is blown by the solar wind

The hard centre of the comet is the nucleus It is one of the blackest things in the solar system When light shone on the nucleus of Halleys Comet the comet reflected only 4 of the light back to us

Periodic comets visit again and again Non periodic or single apparition comets visit only once

People have seen some comets when they broke into pieces Comet Biela was one example Another comet was seen when it hit a planet Comet Shoemaker Levy 9 hit Jupiter in 1994 Some comets orbit together in groups Astronomers think these comets are broken pieces that used to be one object

In old times people used to be scared of comets They did not know what they were or where they came from Some thought that they were fireballs sent from demons or gods to destroy the earth They said that each time a comet appeared it would bring bad luck with it Whenever a comet appeared a king would die One of these examples is shown in the Bayeux Tapestry when Halleys Comet returned Comets were also known to end wars and thought to bring famine It was not until the Renaissance when scientists started to look at comets with less superstition and base their observations on science Tycho Brahe reasoned that comets did not come from the earth and his calculations showed that comets must be six times farther than the earth is from the moon

Edmond Halley reasoned that comets are periodic that is they appear once every several hundreds of years This led to the first prediction of a comets return Halleys Comet 

Isaac Newton also studied comets He realised that comets make U turns around the sun He asked Edmond Halley to publish this in his book Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica Before Newton said this people believed that comets go in to the sun then another comes out from behind the sun

All this new information and research gave people confidence but some still thought that comets were messengers from the gods One 18th century vision said that comets were the places that hell was where souls would ride being burned up by the heat of the sun and frozen by the cold of space

Although today we know a lot about comets there will always be people who will be afraid when a comet returns

Cytology is the study of the cells especially their appearance and structure Cells are the small parts that make up all living things and their effects on each other and their environment

There are two types of cells Prokaryotic cells do not have a clear and easy to see nucleus and do not have a membrane or wall around them Eukaryotic cells have an easy to see nucleus where all of the cells functions take place and a membrane around them The main organelles of a cell and their uses are 

A Christian En us Christianogg is a person who believes in Christianity a monotheistic religion Christianity is mostly about the life and teachings of Jesus Christ in the New Testament and interpreted of prophesied in the Hebrew BibleOld Testament Christianity is the worlds largest religion with 21 billion followers around the world

Christians consider the Holy Bible to be a sacred book inspired by God The Holy Bible is a combination of the Hebrew Bible or Torah and a collection of writings called the New Testament Views on the importance of these writings vary Some Christian groups prefer to favor the New Testament while others believe the entire Bible is equally important Also while many Christians prefer to consider the Bible as true inspired by God not all groups believe that it is completely accurate Some of these groups may think that the Bible is a collection of stories meant to show who God is or even just the opinions of humans that reveal some commonly believed truthfactFebruary 2010

The issue of who is a Christian can be very controversial Christians often disagree over this issue due to their differences in opinion on spiritual matters It is not possible to provide a statement that all readers may agree with therefore a definition will not be provided Even very traditional doctrines such as the belief that Jesus Christ is God or that God consists of the Father Son and Spirit are not common to people who claim Christianity as their religion

Many Christians choose to go to church Most Christians believe this to be a sign of their religious devotion to God and an act of worship However some Christian groups think that one can be a Christian without ever going to a church Though there are many different viewpoints on the issue most Protestants believe all Christians are part of the spiritual church of Christ whether or not those Christians go to an actual church each week On the other hand Catholics believe that the Holy Catholic Church is the only true church

Cheese is a soft solid food made from milk It can be soft or softer It is made by softly removing water from milk People may store cheese in a refrigerator to make sure it does not go bad Its color varies but often it is white or yellow

There are many types of cheese Their different styles and flavors depend on the origin of the milk and whether it has been pasteurized It also depends on the butterfat content the species of bacteria and mold and the processing including the length of aging The different colors of cheese are made by adding annatto Cheeses are eaten both on their own and cooked in various dishes Most cheeses melt when heated

For a few cheeses the milk is curdled by adding acids such as vinegar or lemon juice Most cheeses are acidified to a lesser degree by bacteria which turn milk sugars into lactic acid then the addition of rennet completes the curdling Vegetarian alternatives to rennet are available Most of these are produced by fermentation of the fungus called Mucor miehei However others have been extracted from various species of the Cynara thistle family 

Cheese is important for its long life and high content of fat protein calcium and phosphorus

The word cheese can be used in hockey The term Top Cheese refers to the upper section of the goal net where the puck can be shot Example You snipped that top cheese

Cheese is usually made using milk Cheese makers usually cook the milk in large pots and add salt and a substance from the stomach of young cows called rennet This curdles the cheese it makes it solid There are special pots for making cheesefactdateNovember 2010 Often these pots are called vats Some makers do not add rennet and curdle it in other ways One way which factories use is using bacteria Other ingredients are added and the cheese is usually aged for a short time

There are many different ways to classify cheeses Some ways include

There are also man made foods that some people use instead of cheese These are called Cheese analogues

Different types of cheese include

This page is about constitutions in general If you are looking for the article on the US Constitution see United States Constitution

The constitution of a country is a special type of law document that tells how its government is supposed to work It tells how the countrys leaders are to be chosen and how long they get to stay in office how new laws are made and old laws are to be changed or removed based on law what kind of people are allowed to vote and what other rights they are guaranteed and how the constitution can be changed

Limits are put on the Government in how much power they have within the Constitution On the other hand countries with repressive or corrupt governments frequently do not stick to their constitutions or have bad constitutions without giving freedom to citizens and others This can be known as dictatorship or simply bending the rules A Constitution is often a way of a uniting within a Federation

The UK Constitution

Scholars do not agree whether the UK has a Constitution or not There is a debate because the UK has parts of its Constitution codified and uncodified If the constitution is uncodified then sources for the agreement are still accessible they are just written in different various political books or tradition instead of written all in one place like a codified Constitution

The Magna Carta of England written in 1215 was an early type of constitution The first modern constitution in the world was that of the United States in 1787 but some Native American tribes had similar charters before that

The US has one of the oldest constitutions that people are still using and it has been changed many times over the years It was made after the colonists won their independence from Britain At first they had the Articles of Confederation but the Articles seemed too weak so they were replaced with todays Constitution

The US Constitution in basic English

A circle is a round two dimensional shape shaped like the letter o

The centre of a circle is the point in the very middle

The radius of a circle is a line from the centre of the circle to a point on the side 

All points on the edge of the circle are at the same distance from the centre In other words the radius is the same length all the way around the circle Mathematicians use the letter r for the length of a circles radius

The diameter of a circle is a straight line that goes from one side to the opposite and right through the centre of the circle Mathematicians use the letter d for the length of this line

The circumference of a circle is the line that goes around the centre of the circle Mathematicians use the letter C for the length of this line

The number is a very useful number It is the length of the circumference divided by the length of the diameter As a fraction the number is equal to about frac227 and as a number it is approximately 314

Capitalise or capitalize means to make one or more characters upper case The first letter of a sentence is capitalised in many languages as are the first letters of proper nouns such as names of people and places In German however all nouns are capitalized It is the only language to do that

The homonym capitalize is a different word and means to fully fund as an investment

Cuba is a country in the Caribbean Sea The country is made up of one big island and many smaller islands It is near the United States Mexico Haiti Jamaica and the Bahamas People from Cuba are called Cubans and they speak Spanish Cuba has a warm climate but has many hurricanes every year The capital city of Cuba is Havana In Spanish the capital is called La Habana

Cuba is famous for many types of music especially dance music such as the Salsa and Mambo Because Cubans come from Spain Africa South America and North America Cuban music is special and different

Before Cuba was conquered by the Spaniardsthree tribes lived on the island were the Tanos the Ciboneys and the Guanajatabeyes The Tanos were the largest and most common of the three tribes They farmed crops such as beans corn squash and yams The Tanos also slept in hammocks which the Spaniards would introduce to the rest of the world Then in 1492 Christopher Columbus arrived in Cuba on his first trip to the Americas Three years later he claimed the islands for the Spanish The Spanish began to rule Cuba afterwards The Spanish brought thousands of slaves from Africa to Cuba to work for them Most of the native Cubans died because of the new diseases brought by the Spanish and Africans The Spanish also treated the native Cubans very cruelly and massacred many of them 

The Spanish ruled for many years Cuba became the most important producer of sugar In the 19th century Cubans rebelled against the Spanish rulers but failed until 1898 when the United States went to war with the Spanish and defeated them Cuba became American for four years afterwards before it became an independent republic in 1902 Even though Cuba was independent the Americans still controlled the island by a law called the Platt Amendment In 1933 the Cubans stopped the Platt Amendment but the Americans still had a big say in Cuban politics Americans owned most of Cubas businesses The Americans supported the leader Fulgencio Batista who was seen by many Cubans as corrupt

In 1959 Fidel Castro led a revolution against Fulgencio Batista Castro took power of Cuba with Che Guevara from Argentina his brother Raul and others who fought against Batista Castro made many changes to Cuba and ended American ownership of Cuban businesses This made Castro unpopular in America and the United States banned all contact with Cuba Many Cubans also went to America because of this In 1961 the Americans helped some of these Cubans to attack Cuba and remove Castro but they failed Castro then asked the Soviet Union to help defend them from the Americans which they did The Soviet Union put nuclear weapons in Cuba and aimed them at America American President Kennedy demanded that they be removed or a new war would begin This was known as the Cuban Missile Crisis The Soviet Union then removed the missiles

Cuba became a communist led country like the Soviet Union after this The Soviet Union bought most of Cubas sugar for expensive prices Cuba spent this money on health education and the army This made Cubas schools and hospitals some of the best in the world and the army fought in Africa to support black Africans against the white South African army Cuba also supported groups in South America fighting against the dictators of those countries 

However the Cuban government began to control most of life in Cuba under the communist system Disagreeing with the Cuban government and Fidel Castro in public was not allowed Some Cubans did not like this and tried to leave Cuba Most Cubans who left went to America Some Cubans who did not like the government and stayed were put in jail Many groups from around the world protested against Cuba because of this and demanded that Fidel Castro give up power 

In 1991 the Soviet Union collapsed This meant that Cuba which had sold most of its products to the Soviet Union had no money coming into the country The Americans made the restrictions against contact with Cuba tighter America said the restrictions on contact would continue unless Fidel Castro gave up power Cuba became very poor in the 1990s This became known in Cuba as The Special Period Because of the disaster Cuba changed to allow less control by the government more discussion amongst the people and private shops and businesses Cuba also tried to get tourists to visit the island 

In the 2000s tourism to Cuba began to make money for the island again Though Fidel Castro had remained in power he had passed all duties to his brother Raul after an illness Fidel Castro is 80 years old and was one of the longest serving heads of state In 2008 Ral Castro became the official president of Cuba

For military service men from the age of 16 to 49 years old must go to the army

The population of Cuba is close to 13 million The ethnic groups of Cuba is 48 White 30 Black 22 Mixed race 1 Amerindian and 1 other

Cuba is the largest island in the West Indies It has many resources Only about one fourth of the land is mountains or hills Much of the land is gentle hills or plains which are good for farming or raising cattle Cuba has fertile soil and a warm climate that makes it great for growing crops

Sugar is the most important crop of Cuba and they may get it from the sugar cane Sugar cane is the largest cash crop growin in Cuba and it brings in most of the money After that the second is Tobacco Tobacco is made into cigars by hand A hand made cigar is considered by many people to be the finest in the world Other important crops are rice coffee and fruit Cuba also has many minerals Cobalt nickel iron copper and manganese are all on the island Salt petroleum and natural gas are there too The coast of Cuba has many bays and a few good harbors Havana which is the capital is also a port Other harbors have port cities Nuevitas is a port city on the north coast Cienfuegos Guantnamo and Santiago de Cubaare some of the port cities on the south coast

Cuba has a semi tropical climate That means that the cool ocean winds keep it becoming hot despite its being in the tropiocal zone Cuba has a wet season and a dry season The dry season is from November to April and the wet season is from May to October August to October is also the hurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean Because of this most of Cubas port cities can be flooded along the coast

The people of Cuba come from three different groups The largest group is the descendants of the Spanish settlers who came to Cuba The smallest group is the descendants of the black African slaves who were brought in to do the work The middle sized group is a mix of African and Spanish The government succeeded in seeing that the three different groups were treated the same The communist government gives the people a basic education All the children are required to go to school from six to twelve years old and nearly everybody is able to read and write at least

Reading is very popular in Cuba Many people especially enjoy reading books or things that came from outside the country The government does not approve of this because it may reveal the lies that the government told the people in Cuba about how wonderful this life is The government does not want the people to read the truth in books and magazines from outside the country The people in Cuba still know that their government is lying However they do not try to say so or change things because then they might even be put in jail So most of the people do not speak about it and pretend to agree with the government Every year though the few who are brave enough to ask for changes are killed or prisoned

Communism claims to make everyone equal But this is different in Cuba The people who are important in the government get special treatment and better houses and food They also go to different shops at special stores If normal Cuban people try to shop at those stores they may get into big trouble Because of this Cuban people must stand in long lines to buy everything at their own stores They are only able to buy rationed foods or goods Stores may run out of food or shoes before all the people have bought what they needed

In spite of all of this Cuban people still love their country because it is their home They also love music and sports Cuban music is very lively This is because a lot of it comes from African and Spanish rhythms Baseball basketball and track and field events are loved by many Cuban people

Fidel Castro is the most important man in Cuba Like many dictators he created a personality cult about himself This means that he wants the Cuban people to worship him and think him as a god The newspapers have pictures of him all over the country and his speeches are always printed in the newspapers and broadcast on television or radio But if people do not like Castro they might be sent to jail Because of this everybody cheers for him when he comes out and speaks Because of Castro many times soldiers have been sent to other countries to help fight with communist rebels Cuban soldiers have fought against non communist groups in Angola Ethiopia and Nicaragua But after the fall of communism in Europe Russia has stopped paying for these soldiers and almost all of them came home

A cube is a block with all right angles and whose height width and depth are all the same 

A cube is one of the simplest mathematical shapes in space Something that is shaped like a cube is sometimes referred to as cubic

The basic difference in cube and a square is cube is 3d figurehaving 3 dimensions ielengthbreadth and height while square have only 2 dimensions ie length and breadth The 2 dimensional shape that a cube is made of is squares The sides of a cube are squares The edges are straight lines The corners are at right angles A cube has 8 corners 12 edges and 6 sidesexample dice having six number denotes 6 faces

Cost of Living is the amount of money it costs just to live in a certain place It includes food housing etc

December is the twelfth and last month of the year with 31 days From the Latin decem for ten It was the tenth month of the year before January and February were added to the Roman calendar

December begins on the same day of the week as September every year

Decembers flower is the Narcissus Its birthstone is the turquoise The meaning of the turquoise is prosperity

Some of the holidays celebrated in December are Christmas New Years Eve Kwanzaa and Hanukkah

Dublin is the capital city of the Republic of Ireland The Greater Dublin Area has a population of 1187176 people Dublin is also the biggest city on the island of Ireland

Dublin was built by the Vikings and is built upon the river Liffey The river divides the city into two parts North Dublin and South Dublin

Many famous writers lived in Dublin Oscar Wilde and George Bernard Shaw were born in Dublin James Joyce is probably Dublins best known and most international writer

Dublin is home to Irelands largest stadium Croke Park It can hold up to 85000 people Croke Park is the usual venue for all Ireland hurling and football finals

Dance is when people move to a musical rhythm They may be alone or in a group The dance may be informal play part of a ritual or part of a professional performance There are many kinds of dance and every human society has its dances

Dancing is not a sport Dance is an art Some people dance to express their feelings and emotions Other people dance to feel better Dance can be used to tell a story In some societies dance goes with song as well as music People who want to learn to dance can go to dance schools It may take years of practice to become an experienced and flexible dancer

To plan a dance is called choreography done by a choreographer Often this goes with music and fits into a certain style Dances may be planned in detail or they may be whatever dancers feel like doing However most dancing does follow some general style or pattern One style is the couple dance where a man and a woman dance together Other dances need a whole group of people together to make it work

People have always danced Every society has its own dances We have pictures on pottery and stone which show dances from several thousand years ago in Egypt and GreeceChapter 5

Sachs divides early dances into Imageless dances and Image dances By imageless dances he meant dances which have no set form but aim at getting the dancers into a state of ecstasy In this state the dancer seem changed in a trance and are often thought of as being possessed by spirits These dances are done on certain occasions marriage war famine illness or death and so on They are found in all early societiesp49 62

The image dances according to Sachs are to do with the world outside the dancer By imitating an animal or object the dancer believes he can capture a power and make it useful To dance in imitation of the animal which is going to be hunted is to become one with them To imitate the act of sex is to achieve fertility This is the kind of thinking behind an image dance Sachs points out that societies of this kind do not really understand the connection between cause and effect They really believe the image dances work The dance type which is used in image dances is mimep49 77

The two styles of dance may be joined together Fertility dances may involve both ecstatic states and mime The great dancer Nijinsky used some of these ideas in his choreography for the ballet Le Sacre du Printemps a ballet about the sacrifice of a girl during a primitive celebration of Spring

Coming to more recent times the first dance school we know about was opened in 1661 in Paris France Only men were accepted until 1681 After 1681 women were accepted too Ballroom dances are forms of modern dance Ballroom dances such as the waltz are done by couples

Until the 20th century most ballroom dances were sequence dances The way people moved was planned in set formation These formations were usually lines or squares Everyone moved at the same time and finished at the same time The music played for a set time and then stopped After the invention of the waltz around 1800 another style of dancing developed In the waltz and later dances people danced in couples but they did so separately They did not dance in formation but moved round the room as they pleased Now once again new dance styles have arrived Some people dance as individuals separately as they please Street dance is like that But all these types of dance have music

At the same time round the world there are many traditional dances Some of them have been going for hundreds of years We call them folkloric dances

There are many different styles of dance which fall into these general types

The Dissolution of the monasteries was an event that happened from 1536 to 1540 when English King Henry VIII took away the land and money that the nuns and monks of the Roman Catholic church owned Henry VIII then gave this land and money to people that supported him

This was also when Henry VIII made himself the new head of the Church of England

A deadline is a time by which some task must be completed

Very often it means a time limit that is set in place by an authority  for example a teacher tells students that they must turn in their homework in by a certain time This is so the teacher is able to report fairly to his or her principal that every student had the same chance to do the work

Deadlines may also be set by a time horizon that comes from something that is not a human authority but part of nature For example by sunset one must do those tasks requiring daylight However a human must watch the sun and decide what light is strong enough to still be daylight so time limits will still be involved even if one observes a horizon and sets a deadline oneself

A way to remember this is that a time horizon is like the physical horizon where sunset happens and a time limit is a thing people set up to deal with this A deadline is a thing powerful people set up to ensure less powerful people comply with their way of doing things

Dutton Speedwords is a made up language written by Reginald John Garfield Dutton The idea of Dutton Speedwords is to make frequent words short and very frequent words very short Dutton Speedwords can be used as a second language for international communications Dutton Speedwords is also a shorthand writing system this means you can use it to write quickly 

The method was made up by Reginald John Garfield Dutton in 1922 It was first published in 1935 It was called International Symbolic Script A year later it was called Speedwords It was changed in 1946 and 1951

It has two uses to be a language and to be used for writing quickly Dutton hoped that this would mean more people would learn it because they could use it for two reasons

The books that Dutton wrote about Speedwords are not printed anymore But Speedwords is now being used by more people because they find it is good for working online For example it makes it faster to type an email

Another way of writing quickly is Pitmans shorthand This uses special symbols instead of letters Speedwords uses Roman letters This makes it easier to learn It also means it can be typed using a normal keyboard Each word means only one thing This means you do not need to use different forms of the same word

The words used in Speedwords are the same as the words used in many other languages The words are like short versions of the writers own language

In some religions a devil is a bad spirit that tries to create problems for people Some people also use the words the Devil or Satan for the most powerful devil The word devil comes from the Greek word diabolos which means someone who tells lies to hurt you The Christian New Testament uses diabolos as a title for Satan and so The Devil became another name for Satan in English

In the Old Testament there is the serpent and the shaitan who may be two different characters Shaitan in Hebrew means adversary an enemy or opponent Shaitan is also the word used for the devil in the Koran who often appears as an animal and tries to get people to do the wrong thing

In the Christian religion the Devil was originally an angel in heaven But he wanted to be the ruler of heaven and so he revolted against God After a hard fight he was defeated and thrown out of heaven Some other angels who helped him were also thrown out

After the Devil was thrown out of heaven he started doing bad things on the earth He wants people to worship him instead of God Sometimes he tries to trick people by giving them false promises

The other angels who were thrown out of heaven became evil spirits called demons They obey the Devil and help him do evil things

The bible says that God will punish the Devil and his demons by throwing them into a Lake of Fire that burns in Hell This will happen in the future

Artists draw pictures of the Devil that show him as ugly and evil But nobody knows what he really looks like Usually he is a spirit that nobody can see but he can make himself look like a real person in order to trick people Many modern depictions of the devil portray him as a red human like being with horns carrying a red pitchfork

Diarrhea also spelled diarrhoea happens when you produce more watery feces than you normally do In a baby it is the most common symptom of malnutrition This means not eating enough or well enough

There are many other diseases that cause it Most are temporary and related to diet  the food you eat Food safety and hand washing can lower the risk of getting diarrhea Stress and drinking too much alcohol can also cause diarrhea

In developing nations malnutrition is a common cause of child death Diarrhea is often treated with aspirin or glucose  these reduce pain and may stop some symptoms for a while However if it was because of malnutrition it will not save the childs life Spending money on rehydrating salts clean water and more food is wiser as the first step

The opposite of diarrhea firm feces are a sign of good digestive health Many people adopt vegetarian diets with high dietary fibre to prevent diarrhea and other digestive problems

A dimension is a measure of the size of something 

For example the three dimensions that give the size of an object in the world are

Dimensions can be used to measure position too The distance to a position from a starting place can be measured in the length width and height directions These distances are a measure of the position 

Sometimes a fourth dimension time is used to show the position of an event in time and space

In modern science people use other dimensions 

Dimensions like temperature and weight can be used to show the position of something in less simple spaces 

Mathematicians also use dimensions In mathematics dimensions are more general Dimensions in mathematics might not measure things in the world The rules for doing arithmetic with dimensions in mathematics might be different than usual arithmetic rules

Vectors are used to show distances and directions Vectors are often used in engineering and science and sometimes in mathematics 

A vector is a list of numbers There is one number for each dimension There are arithmetic rules for vectors 

For example if Jane wants to know the position of Sally Sally can give Jane a vector to show the position If Jane and Sally are in the world there are three dimensions Therefore Sally gives Jane a list of three numbers to show her position The three numbers in the vector Sally gives Jane might be

Distance is how far one thing is from another thing Distance is a measure of the space between two things

Distance is different from displacement Displacement is the difference between a starting point and a finishing point 

A and B are 1 metre apart Tom walks from A to B Then Tom walks from B back to A The distance Tom walked is 2 metres Toms displacement is 0 metres because Tom started at A and finished at A 

In math the distance between the nearest end and farthest end of an object is its depth

For example Jane measures a box When she measures the distance between the end of the box closest to her and the end of the box farthest away Jane measures the boxs depth

See

For liquids the distance between the top or surface of the liquid and the bottom of the liquid is the liquids depth

For example water is a liquid If you fill a container with water the distance between the top of the water and the bottom of the container is the waters depth If the depth is big we say the water is deep 

A dictionary is a book which explains the meanings of words or more precisely lexemes The words are arranged in alphabetical order so that they can be found quickly The word dictionary comes from the Latin diction

There are several types of dictionaries dictionaries which explain words and how they are used dictionaries which translate words from one language to another dictionaries that can define multiple words at one time dictionaries of biography which tell about famous people technical dictionaries which explain the meanings of technical words or words connected to a particular subject Some of these come close to being an encyclopedia but an encyclopedia gives a lot of extra information about things and does not explain the use of the language

Dictionaries which explain what words mean will give a clear definition of the word 

Good dictionaries will also give more information about the word It will explain how it is pronounced Usually the International Phonetic Alphabet is used for this It will explain how the word is used This is not a problem for a word like hippopotamus but a word like put has so many different meanings that a large dictionary may have a whole page or more to explain how it can be used It will also explain what language the word comes from

A dictionary may also give the form of the word in different tenses plural form etc

Multi word Dictionaries are dictionaries which offer the user the ability to define more than one word at a time These dictionaries perform the same task as Dictionaries which explain the meaning of words but make the process more efficient

There are also dictionaries which translate words into foreign languages Very often one volume will translate both ways so half the book will be translating from English to Dutch and the other half from Dutch to English

When using a dictionary to find out how to say something in another language one has to be careful to choose the right word A word like right has two basic meanings in English 1 correct and 2 the opposite of left Other languages are not like English they will have different words for these different meanings A word like put has many meanings A good dictionary will have a large list of these meanings to help people find the word they want In many languages for example the word put will be different according to whether something is being put onto something or into something

Dictionaries need to be updated frequently because of the way language changes New words are often brought into a language or words change their meanings The most famous English Dictionary is the Oxford English Dictionary Words are always being added to the OED they are never taken out even if they are obsolete The OED can be accessed online

A definition is an exact word or phrase of the meaning nature or limits of something A definition usually answers the question what Defining means giving a definition Other words with this meaning are description and explanation It describes what a word means and explains to the person when and where it can be used

In mathematics a definition is an exact way of saying what something is It might not be the easiest way to say what it is but it is used because it is exact It can be used in a mathematical proof about the thing

Denmark is a Nordic country in Northern Europe It is the southernmost of the Scandinavian countries south of Norway and south west of Sweden and bordered to the south by Germany It borders both the Baltic and the North Sea Denmark is a very developed country with a large welfare state In 2006 and 2007 surveys ranked Denmark as the happiest place in the world based on standards of health welfare and education

The capital city of Denmark is Copenhagen on the island of Sealand Denmark is a constitutional monarchy with a queen Margrethe II Denmark is a parliamentary state meaning the people appoint a parliament to make decisions for them and it has a democratic government headed by an elected Prime Minister who currently is Helle Thorning Schmidt

In geography Denmark is the land in northern Europe where the Danes live In the political sense the Kingdom of Denmark also includes the Faroe Islands in the Atlantic Ocean and Greenland in North America All three parts of the country have different languages and culture 

Denmark was first united in the 10th century during the Viking period by the king Harald Bluetooth who first converted Denmark to Christianity The Vikings are well known for invading countries In the 11th century the Danish Vikings controlled England for a while In 1397 Denmark Sweden and Norway became a single country with one queen Sweden become a separate country again in 1523 Denmark and Norway called Denmark Norway stayed united until 1814 Denmark Norway controlled many islands in the Atlantic Ocean including the Faroe Islands Iceland and Greenland Iceland became independent from Denmark in 1944

Denmark became a constitutional monarchy in June 5 1849 when it adopted a constitution which took away powers from the King and gave rights to ordinary Danish people June 5 is now a holiday in Denmark called Constitution Day

Over the years Denmark lost many of lands that it controlled in battle Denmarks biggest war defeat was the Second Schleswig War when the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein was conquered by the Kingdom Prussia This was a big loss for Denmark and consequently it began a policy of neutrality after the loss meaning it would no longer take part in any wars or support other countries Denmark did not take part in the First World War 

On April 9 1940 Denmark was invaded by Nazi Germany and the Nazis stayed in Denmark throughout World War II During the war in 1943 Danes helped over 8000 Jews to escape from Denmark into Sweden after the Nazis tried to arrest them 

After the liberation of Denmark one part of the country was not That was the island of Bornholm The German Commandant von Kamptz who was stationed there refused to surrender to the Soviets as the German were fleeing to Bornholm and further to Sweden The Soviets then bombed the two biggest towns Rnne and Nex After the Germans were captured on may 9 1945 the Soviet Army occupied the island until April 6 1946

After World War Two Denmark became a member of NATO and the European Union Greenland and the Faroe Islands are now part of the Kingdom of Denmark and have their own governments and limited power

 Government and politics 

Denmark has three branches of power the judiciary the executive and the legislature The current Prime Minister of Denmark is Helle Thorning Schmidt who was elected in September 2011 She is the first woman prime minister of Denmark

Denmark is a Kingdom which means it has a monarch The current monarch is Queen Margrethe II Margrethe II does not have a lot of power and has a symbolic role Denmark became a constitutional monarchy in 1849

Elections to the parliament are held every four years and the winner of the election is the party or coalition which gets the most votes and seats in the parliament After the elections are done several parties who are in agreement will group together to form a coalition government and the leader of the largest party becomes the prime minister

Here is a short summary of the biggest political parties in Denmark from left to right on the political axis

Denmark like the other Nordic countries is well known for being a large welfare state The government provides many services to the public such as free health care free education and free housing for the poor Danes pay high taxes to fund welfare

Denmark is the smallest of the Scandinavian countries The neighbours are Germany Sweden Norway and the United Kingdom The country is surrounded by the sea except for Jutland the largest part of Denmark It is connected to Germany by land To the south east there is the Baltic Sea to the west the North Sea to the north the Skagerrak and to the north east the Kattegat

The western part of Denmark is the peninsula of Jutland bordering Germany This is the only part of Denmark that is not an island The rest of Denmark includes 76 islands people live on and many tiny islands The largest islands are Zealand and Funen To the east is the island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea the only place in Denmark where the bedrock can be seen

The country is quite flat The highest hill or mountain is Mllehj which is 17086 metres tall There are many small hills lakes creeks forests and farmland Denmarks shore line covers 7314 km Nobody in Denmark lives more than 60 km from the coast

The weather in Denmark is quite windy and rainy In the winter it does not get very cold in most years there are only a few weeks of snow Every ten years or so the sea around the islands freezes over but in most winters it does not The climate and topography are not good for winter sports

Most summers are not very hot People always dress to be ready for rain or wind There are also very sunny times but nobody can know ahead of time when these will be The best time of the year for outdoor activities is the months of May and June until midsummer

Denmark is divided into five regions The regions replaced the former counties in January 2007 The regions are in charge of hospitals and health care

The regions are then subdivided into municipalities There are currently 98 municipalities but before January 2007 there were 275 The number of municipalities was decreased when it was decided that to become more efficient each should have a population of at least 20000 

The biggest part of Denmarks population of just under 54 million is of Danish descent according to 2009 statistics Of the rest 89 who are immigrants or descendent from recent immigrants many come from South Asia or the Middle East There are also small groups of Inuit from Greenland and Faroese

The Danes speak the national language Danish which is very similar to the other Scandinavian languages Swedish and Norwegian are so close to Danish that most Danes understand them 

As well as Danish most Danes speak a foreign language too such as English which is popular as an international language or German In the southern part of Jutland a German minority speaks German On the Faroe Islands Faroese is spoken and people living in Greenland speak Inuit 

Religion does not play a large part in the life of most Danes and church attendance is very low However even though many Danes are atheist 804 are members of the protestant Church of Denmark Folkekirke which is the official state church of Denmark The National Church is Lutheran which means it separated from the Roman Catholic Church in the 16th Century Other important faiths include Judaism Islam other protestant groups and Catholicism

Because of the many islands Denmark has many bridges The main parts of the country and most of the bigger islands are connected by roads and railroads One of the worlds longest bridges connects the eastern and the western parts of the country and there is a large bridge to Sweden also There is still no bridge across the Baltic Sea to Germany but it will most likely be built in a few years The bridge to Sweden was expensive took a long time to build and required much planning by engineers

There are still many islands with no bridges to the mainland People have to go by boat or airplane to reach these islands Many islands will never be reached by bridges because they are too small or too far away If the island has too few people bridges are often not built because it is expensive to build Somebody has to pay for it nothing is free

Cycling is very popular in Denmark because the ground is so flat Copenhagen is a city that is very bicycle friendly with bicycle lanes extending over 12000 km

The people of Denmark have always depended on the sea In earlier days people could not travel anywhere unless they went by boat Many Danes were fishermen or merchants Even today many Danes spend much time near or at the sea

Farming has always been one of the main occupations Because of the climate and the soil Denmark is a good place for agriculture Export of food to the neighbouring countries is one of the most important sources of income for the country Danish hams and cookies are exported throughout the world

Perhaps the most famous Dane is actually Hamlet the title character of William Shakespeares famous play which was set in the real castle of Kronborg in Helsingr north of Copenhagen The play was based on an old Danish myth of the Viking Prince Amled of Jutland and his quest for revenge against his fathers killer Another widely known Dane is Hans Christian Andersen an author mostly famous for such fairy tales as The Little Mermaid and The Ugly Duckling Also Karen Blixen Tycho Brahe and the philosopher Sren Kierkegaard are well known world wide There are many famous Danish scientists including Niels Bohr the famous physicist who developed the first working model for the atom and Ole Rmer who discovered the speed of light Hans Kirk although less well known outside of Denmark is the author of the best selling Danish novel of all time The Fishermen

Danes enjoy many different types of music including ballets jazz music pop and rock Denmarks most famous classical composer is probably Carl Nielsen Famous Danish bands include Aqua a pop band and The Raveonettes an indie rock band The most famous Danish rock star is Lars Ulrich of the band Metallica 

The cuisine of Denmark is like the other Nordic countries as well as that of northern Germany consists mainly pork meat and fish Traditional Danish food includes frikadeller Fish is also widely eaten especially on the west coast of Jutland

Christmas is the main feast of the year Christmas is traditionally celebrated on the eve December 24 and this is when the main Christmas meal is eaten and presents are unwrapped

In midwinter a fast is celebrated Children are dressed up and go from house to house begging for money A barrel filled with candy is smashed with clubs The person who makes the candy fall out is appointed queen of cats and the person who hits the last stick is appointed king of cats

Midsummer is celebrated with a huge bonfire in the evening of June 23 Most Danes have a three week summer holiday in July or August

The most popular sport in Denmark is football Sailing swimming and other water sports are very popular because of the long coastline Another common sport is cycling which has become popular in Denmark partly because of the flat land all over the country Indoor sports such as badminton and handball are also popular during the long winters

Monarch is a word that means king or queen Denmark is the oldest monarchy in Europe The current monarch is Queen Margrethe II who has been the queen since 1972 Denmark does not currently have a King Margrethes husband is called a prince because he is the son in law not the son of the previous King The royal couple have two children

In 2008 Prince Joachim married for the second time His new wife is from France and is called Marie with whom he had one son

Death is the end of life in an organism Death can happen in many ways About 150000 people die every day around the world About two thirds of these people die because of reasons related with age death is generally the cause of funerals which are gatherings to respect recently dead humans

Living things which have died are normally described as being dead Human death is very carefully tracked in case of a killing or something that may continue to kill other humans Death is usually followed by rituals like the funeral which have been developed by a religion or the state When people talk about things or events that lead to the death of a plant or animal those things or events are usually described as being deadly or fatal In the case of diseases they are described as terminal There are many slang terms for dying A few examples are to pass away to go to a better place to buy the farm and to kick the bucket

In ordinary life death is when the heart stops beating and the lungs stop breathing for more than several minutes There are special times in which people recover even though the heart has stopped for 30 minutes such as near drowning in very cold water If machines are used to help the heart and lungs work then the moment of death is more difficult to know

For a long time many people have been afraid of death and a lot of people have wondered about what may happen to people after they die This is one of the largest questions of philosophy and religion

A diesel electric engine burns diesel or biodiesel fuel However rather than use this energy directly to run gears it charges a battery which more efficiently turns wheels

Some designs also store braking energy in a flywheel which can also charge a battery However these make the engine even more complex and add weight to the vehicle so are more appropriate for city driving where service stations are always available and there is much stop and go driving

Because they do not require any change or investment in stations nor much in vehicle design diesel electric vehicles are believed to be the most likely replacement for todays internal combustion engine When properly tuned they have low emissions and they use only about one third of the fossil fuel of most gasoline engines powering similar vehicles

Honda and Toyota are presently delivering consumer priced diesel electric cars By contrast hydrogen infrastructure is thought to be decades off and is not fully implemented even in Iceland where there is abundant free geothermal electricity

Many activists feel that promoting hydrogen is a stall a way to avoid forcing the shift to diesel electric vehicles in the nearer term

Europe is a continent the western part of Eurasia It is separated from Asia by a traditional eastern boundary that includes the Ural Mountains in Russia and the Bosporus in Turkey and from Africa by the Mediterranean Sea to Balkans The Atlantic Ocean is to the west of Europe There are over 50 countries in Europe The European Union is made up of most of the countries in Europe

Europe is named after a person in Greek mythology called Europa She was said to have been abducted to Crete by Zeus The name was later used for Greece Then as the rest of the area we call Europe started to have cities and empires the whole area West of the Ural Mountains became known by the same name

In Europe there are different climates in different places for example in the north like Finland it stays snowy in the winter for 56 months and is about 30 degrees Celsius However during winter in Spain it is warmer and hardly snows except on high mountains

At this time much of the continent shares some rulership in a body that is above any country called the European Union

The history of Europe is long and has many turns Individual specific eras  this is the term meaning long amounts of specific time  can be mentioned

An encyclopedia is a collection of information about things humans know Whether published on paper or online an encyclopedia is a collection of essays each on a different subject The first encyclopedias may have begun as lecture notes by and for the teachers of ancient schools such as Aristotles school Each volume in the encyclopedia was for a different subject or course of study The word encyclopedia at first meant the teachings of the school After the printing press was invented dictionaries with long definitions began to be called encyclopedias For example a dictionary of science if it included essays was thought of as an encyclopedia or knowledgeable book on the subject of science Some encyclopedias then put essays on more than one subject in alphabetical order instead of grouping them together by subject The word encyclopedia was put in the title of some encyclopedias Companies were started for the purpose of publishing encyclopedias for the public use in libraries which is different from when an encyclopedia was the curriculum of a private school Like dictionaries these publishers hired hundreds of experts to write articles and read and choose articles Some internet encyclopedias allowed their paying customers to submit articles Other internet encyclopedias accepted writing from non paying users of the encyclopedia Encyclopedias are a great source of knowledge They are included with many different topics 

The word encyclopedia is Latin and comes from Greek The words  enkyklios paideia mean in a circle of teaching It is from in a circle from circle and meaning teaching

The word can also mean general perhaps the people who made the Latin name encyclopedia did not understand the Greek word well Perhaps the name should mean general teaching In Canada and the UK and some other countries affected by the British Empire encyclopedia is spelt mostly as encyclopdia

People have made encyclopedias for hundreds of years but the name encyclopedia is from the 16th century

There are different types of encyclopedia Some are general and have pages on lots of topics The English language Encyclopdia Britannica and German Brockhaus are general encyclopedias Some are about specific topics For example there are encyclopedias of medicine or philosophy There are also some encyclopedias that have lots of topics with one point of view or one cultural bias The Great Soviet Encyclopedia is one of these

Many dictionaries have a different sort of information to encyclopedias Examples are the Dictionary of National Biography the Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships and Blacks Law Dictionary

There are two main ways of organizing encyclopedias from A to Z or by categories Most encyclopedias go from A to Z

There are also printed encyclopedias and encyclopedias in the computer such as Wikipedia Wikipedia is the largest computer encyclopedia

The largest online encyclopedia in English language is Wikipedia in English which has more than 3 million articles now The second largest is the Encyclopaedia Britannica which is the largest one that is printed Stacy Schiff a writer says that Wikipedia is not as good as other encyclopedias because anyone can change it so some people may write things that are wrong Also the way that Wikipedia works means that there is likely to be bias On the other hand Tyler Cowen an Economist says that other non fiction writing may also have the same problems

Earth science is an all embracing term for the sciences related to the planet Earth Earth science may also be called geoscience 

It is a broader term than geology because it includes aspects of planetary science which is part of astronomy The Earth sciences include the study of the atmosphere oceans and biosphere as well as the solid earth Typically Earth scientists will use tools from physics chemistry biology chronology and mathematics to understand the Earth and how it evolved to its current state

If there is one fact which underlies all Earth science it is this the Earth is an ancient planet which has been changing the whole time since its formation The extent of the changes is much greater than people used to think

The following disciplines are generally recognised as being within the geosciences

The Earth is the third planet from the Sun 

It is one of the four terrestrial planets in our Solar System This means most of its mass is solid The other three are Mercury Venus and Mars 

The Earth is also called the Blue Planet Planet Earth and Terra

The Earth is home to millions of species of plants and animals including humans Earth is the only place in the universe where life has been confirmed to exist 

Science shows that the Earth formed around 45 billion years ago The things that live on Earth have had a great impact on many aspects of the planet For example early lifeforms completely changed its air This ability to impact the planet means that life is considered an important force in shaping the Earth Because of this life is called a biosphere

About 71 of Earths surface is covered in salt water oceans Earth is the only place in the universe where liquid water is known to exist at present 

The other 29 is made of rocky land in the shape of continents and islands Earth interacts with other objects in the Solar System particularly the Sun and the Moon The Earth orbits or circles the Sun roughly once every 36525 days One spin of the Earth is called a day and one orbit around the Sun is called a year This is why there are 365 days in a year Earth has only one moon known as the Moon

The Earth and the other planets formed about 46  48 billion years ago They were made of the leftover gas from the nebula that made the Sun The Moon may have been formed after a collision between Earth and a smaller planet Scientists believe that parts of both planets broke off becoming the Moon 

Condensing water vapour comets and asteroids hitting the Earth made the oceans Within a billion years the first life evolved in the Archaean era Some bacteria developed photosynthesis which lets plants make food from the Suns light and water This released a lot of oxygen into the atmosphere or air making the Earths surface suitable for life This oxygen also formed the ozone layer which protects the Earth from bad ultraviolet radiation from the Sun This protection made it possible for things to move from the deep ocean to the surface Long ago almost all land was in one place This is called a supercontinent The earliest known supercontinent was called Rodina Scientists think that soon after this there was a time when the Earth was almost entirely covered by thick ice sheets This is called the Snowball Earth theory

Earth is a terrestrial planet This means it is made up of solid rock unlike a gas giant such as Jupiter It is the largest out of the four terrestrial planets in mass and diameter

The Earths shape is an oblate spheroid This means it is basically a sphere but it bulges around the middle The circumference of the Earth is about 40000 kilometers the average width of the Earth is about 12700 km The highest point on Earth is the peak of Mount Everest at 8848 m above sea level The lowest natural point is the bottom of the Mariana Trench at 10911 meters below sea level Because of the bulge at the middle or the equator the farthest point from the Earths center is the top of Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador

Inside the Earth is similar to the other terrestrial planets It has an outer solid rock layer called the crust Everything that lives on Earth is on top of the crust Below that is a layer of thick semi liquid rock called the mantle Under that is a thin liquid layer called the outer core and then the solid iron inner core The thickness of the crust changes On land the average is between 3050 kilometers thick Under the oceans in some places it is only 6 kilometers thick The inside of the Earth is very hot the temperature of the outer core may be as high as convert7000CF

The Earth is the only terrestrial planet with active plate tectonics Due to plate tectonics the Earths crust basically floats on the thick liquid rock of the mantle below The crust is split up into parts called plates These plates interact as they move about causing earthquakes and creating volcanoes and mountain ranges The place where plates meet are called plate boundaries There are three types of plate boundary constructive destructive and transform

The Earth changes greatly from place to place Over 70 of the Earth surface is covered by water The underwater surface has many of the same features as the above sea with volcanos mountains and trenches or canyons The 30 not covered by water is mostly forests deserts plains mountains and plateaux Human civilisation has led to increasing urbanisation the growth of cities 

Many things can change the surface of the Earth Plate tectonics is main cause of change but there are others such as erosion from wind and rain erosion by the oceans or meteorite impacts There are three main types of rock that make up the Earths surface 

All the water on Earth on land or in the atmosphere is part of the hydrosphere About 975 of all water is salt water About half the fresh water is currently ice The oceans absorb or soak up carbon dioxide a gas that adds to the greenhouse effect and global warming

A planets atmosphere is a layer of different gases surrounding it It is kept there by gravity The Earths atmosphere is made of about 78 nitrogen 21 oxygen and small amounts of other gases This mixture is often called air Further up there is a layer of ozone gas called the Ozone layer Ozone absorbs ultraviolet radiation from the Sun Ultraviolet radiation is dangerous to people so without the Ozone layer life would not be possible The atmosphere also protects the earth from crashes with meteors and small asteroids This is because they burn up due to all the friction as they fly through it It also helps to keep Earth warm Some gases including carbon dioxide and methane act like a blanket around the Earth they trap heat under them keeping the Earth warm This is called the natural greenhouse effect When humans build factories and power plants to make electricity combustion is involved Combustion lets out a lot of carbon dioxide This carbon dioxide goes up into the atmosphere and traps more heat This is called global warming

Hot air rises As it rises it gets colder again and falls This is called convection currents When hot air meets cold air different weather effects happen Convection currents are the cause of almost all weather on Earth When it gets hot on the surface water evaporates and becomes steam or water vapour This hot water vapour rises As it rises it gets colder When it gets cold enough it turns back into water again This causes the clouds and rain It is called the water cycle

The Earth takes about 24 hours to complete one day and about 365 days to complete a year Actually the Earth takes 36524 days to revolve around the Sun To make up this quarter day every year an extra day is added every four years making the year 366 days This is a leap year The Earth is on average 150 million kilometers away from the Sun and moving at an average speed of almost 30 kilometers a second

The Moon orbits the Earth at an average distance of 250000 miles It is tidally locked to Earth which means it always has the same side facing the Earth It takes roughly one month to complete one orbit

The Earth is part of the Solar System and orbits the Sun along with thousands of small objects and seven other planets The Sun and therefore the Solar System are currently traveling through the Orion Arm of the Milky Way Galaxy and will be for approximately the next 10000 years

Et cetera means and the rest in Latin It is often used in English to continue a list that is longer than what can be normally written People most often write et cetera as etc Very rarely it is also written c because the ampersand or the is the same as et It is also the symbol for and Some people write it as ect but that is wrong

An experiment is a test of an idea invented by someone usually a scientist An experiment is used to test a theoryto see how well the real world matches the theory Experiments have been used for many years to help people understand the world around them

One important observation about experiments is that they can tell us if a theory is false They cannot tell us if a theory is true For example if we invent a theory that says All houses are made of wood we cannot say that it is true because all the houses we have seen are made of wood But if we find a house that is not made of wood we know that our theory is false

Benjamin Franklin did a well known experiment by flying a kite during a thunderstorm He did the experiment to see if lightning was made of electricity

Experiments are not the same as faith or other ways to find truth because experiments must have proof They begin by testing falsehood to find out truth

The universe does not tell us when we are right only when we are wrong Karl Popper

Ethics is the part of philosophy that talks about good and evil Ethics tries to answer questions like

Some philosophers call ethics the science of morality Morality is what someone thinks or feels is good or bad There are many different moralities but they share some things For example most people think that murder is wrong Some philosophers have hope to find more things that moralities share They think that ethics should use the scientific method to study things that people think are good or bad Their work can be used to test the fairness of a situation such as how people should treat each other An example of this kind of thinking is the categorical imperative Many countries have laws based on this idea of fairness

Other philosophers think that ethics is separate from morality They do not think that ethics can be studied using the scientific method and they think it is closer to metaphysics Some of them think like platonists about what is good and bad

Another group of philosophers believe that ethics is subjective This means that they think that what is right for me is whatever I say is right This means that ethics is just a persons own morality These philosophers do not think that ethics is the same for all people

Understanding ethics can help people decide what to do when they have choices Many philosophers think that doing anything or making any choice is a part of ethics

Ethics is part of other fields of study in many ways Here are some ways

Along with Aesthetics ethics forms part of axiology the philosophy of what people like

E Prime is a way of speaking English without using the verb to be in any way Instead an E Prime speaker or writer uses different verbs like to become to remain and to equal or they might choose to rearrange the sentence to show that the thing does not actually act For example in E Prime a writer would change the statement Mistakes were made to Joe made mistakes This change in wording reveals an actor where the previous form concealed the actor Users of E Prime would consider the changed sentence more accurate

D David Bourland Jr first suggested E Prime in 1965 Bourland had studied the discipline of General Semantics The main idea of General Semantics is that people can only know what they observe and experience when they see hear touch taste smell think and feel and furthermore that what they observe and experience can affect how they observe and experience in the future Because each person has different experiences throughout their lives they interpret their experiences differently 

Students of General Semantics and users of E Prime contend that to say This cat is soft leaves out many other attributes and implies that the outside object of the cat is the same as the inside experience of softness Instead E Prime users say This cat feels soft TO ME to remind themselves of the following

1 That their experience of softness involves both the outside object called cat and the eyes hands brain and nervous system of the observer

2 That someone else might experience different aspects of the cat

3 That they themselves might experience something different at a different time or in different circumstances

Although languages like Arabic Turkish and Cantonese do not have a separate verb for to be they do have the idea of being For example an English speaker might say This apple is red An Arabic speaker might say This apple red Most languages can be used to express the idea of a red apple An E Prime user chooses to only say that This apple looks red to me to remind themselves that seeing red involves both the apple and the eye and brain of the person looking at the apple

Many teachers of English encourage students to use verbs other than to be To them using more active verbs makes writing clearer and more interesting These teachers want to improve their students writing and may not agree with the ideas of General Semantics or E Prime

Einstein on the Beach is an opera written by the minimalist composer Philip Glass and theater director and designer Robert Wilson It was first acted for an audience in Avignon France in 1976 It is a single act opera approximately five hours long with no intermission Given the minimalist nature of the music audience members are free to enter and leave the opera as they wish

The word English can mean

An ethnic group is a group of people who are considered to be the same in some way They may all have the same ancestors speak the same language or have the same religion 

Sometimes almost all of the people in one country are of the same ethnic group but not always Often one country may have several different ethnic groups or the people of one ethnic group may live in several different countries

International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ensures the right of ethnic group by the Article 27 and also right to use their own language

Ebola pronounced E Bo la is a hemorrhagic fever virus It is a very deadly disease Out of every 10 people who get Ebola on average five to nine die People who get infected with Ebola virus get the disease Ebola hemorrhagic fever

In people transmission happens when someone comes in contact with fluids from someone who has been infected with the virus Ebola cannot be caught through the air People with Ebola hemorrhagic fever bleed a lot They have blood in their diarrhea and vomit They bleed from their noses mouths and genitals These liquids are very infectious

When people get Ebola the first symptoms look like some other diseases People get a fever feel very tired have headaches pain in the stomach pain in their joints and pain in the throat Sometimes people think they have other diseases like malaria or typhoid fever

Later people get much more sick They have very bad bleeding They get shock low blood pressure fast pulse and low blood circulation to the body This causes their organs to get very sick The organs stop working This is called organ failure Ebola also causes stiffness throughout the body which leaves victims bedridden Even if they make it to a hospital most die

Because Ebola is caused by a virus there is no cure But if people get care from doctors and nurses more of them live People with ebola need a lot of fluids to replace fluids lost from diarrhea vomitting and blood loss Supportive care could be replacing fluids blood and giving medicines to the infected to treat their blood pressure and blood circulation

When people get Ebola it is called an outbreak If doctors see that an outbreak is happening they try to stop it They stop it by isolating people infected with the disease or placing them in quarantine This means keeping the blood and fluids from people with Ebola from touching other people Then other people do not get the virus

When an outbreak happens many people come to try and help stop it The World Health Organization is the most important group that tries to stop Ebola outbreaks

Scientists are trying to find a vaccine for Ebola

Ecology is the science which studies the biota and the environment and their interactions It comes from the Greek oikos house logos study Ecology is the study of ecosystems Ecosystems describe the web or network of relations among organisms at different scales of organization Since ecology refers to any form of biodiversity ecologists research everything from tiny bacteria in nutrient recycling to the effects of tropical rain forests on the Earths atmosphere Scientists who study these interactions are called ecologists 

Terrestrial ecoregion and climate change research are two areas where ecologists now focus

There are many practical applications of ecology in conservation biology wetland management natural resource management city planning community health economics and applied science It provides a framework for understanding and researching human social interaction

Ecology starts many powerful philosophical and political movements  including the conservation movement wellness movement environmental movement and ecology movement we know today When these are combined with peace movements and the Six Principles they are called green movements In general these put ecosystem health first on a list of human moral and political priorities as the way to achieve better human health and social harmony and better economics 

People with these beliefs are called political ecologists Some have organized into the Green Parties but there are actually political ecologists in most political parties They very often use arguments from ecology to advance policy especially forest policy and energy policy

Also ecology means that it is the branch of biology dealing with the relations and interactions between organisms and their environment including other organisms

Many ecologists also deal with human economics

Ecological economics and human development theory try to separate the economic questions from others but it is difficult Many people think economics is just part of ecology now and that economics that ignores it is wrong Natural capital is an example of one theory combining both

Sometimes ecology is compared to anthropology because both use a lot of methods to study one thing we cannot live without Anthropology is about how our bodies and minds are affected by our environment while ecology is about how our environment is affected by our bodies and minds There is even a type of anthropology called ecological anthropology which studies how people interact with the environment 

Antoine de Saint Exupery stated The earth teaches us more about ourselves than all the books Because it resists us Man discovers himself when he measures himself against the obstacle

Economics is the study of how people make choices to get what they want when they cannot get everything they want The word comes from Ancient Greek and relates to okos house and nomos custom or law The models used in economics today were mostly started in the 19th century People took ideas from the field of political economy because they wanted to use an empirical approach similar to the one used in the natural sciences

The subjects in economic study are households business companies the government and foreign countries Households offer their factors of production to companies This includes work land capital and information They get income which they use to buy or consume goods Business companies produce and sell goods and buy factors of production from households and from other companies The state includes institutions and organisations The state takes some of the earnings from the business companies and households and uses it to pay for public goods like streets or university education to be available for everyone The last subject is foreign countries this includes all households business companies and state institutions which are not based in ones own country They demand and supply goods from abroad

The objects in economic study are consumer goods capital goods and factors of production Consumer goods are classified as usage goods as purpose goods and as services Capital goods are goods which are necessary for producing other goods Examples of these are buildings equipment and machines Factors of production are work ground capital information and environment

Economists are strongly influenced by the times they live in For example Karl Marx lived in a time where workers conditions were very poor and John Maynard Keynes lived through the Great Depression of the 1930s Todays economists can look back and understand why they made their judgements and try to make better ones

The two main branches of economics are microeconomics and macroeconomics 

Macroeconomics is about the economy in general For example if a countrys wealth goes up or if millions of people become unemployed those are things that macroeconomists study Microeconomics is about smaller and more specific things such as how families and households spend their money

There are a number of other branches of economics

Famous economists in history include

Famous economists in our current society include N Gregory Mankiw and Paul Krugman

A chemical element is a substance that contains only one type of atom If a substance contains more than one type of atom it is a compound An element can be a solid liquid or gas The smallest particle of such an element is an atom Atoms are made up of protons neutrons and electrons 

Element contains only one kind of atom The number of protons in the atoms of an element is known as that elements atomic number For example all atoms with 6 protons in their nuclei are of the chemical element carbon and all atoms with 92 protons in their nuclei are of the element uranium 

118 different chemical elements are known to modern chemistry 92 of these elements can be found in nature and the human body is made up of 26 elements The others can only be made in laboratories The last natural element discovered was uranium in 1789 The first man made element was Technetium in 1937 All man made elements are radioactive and unstable

Chemical elements are commonly arranged in the periodic table Where the elemnts are in the table tells us about their properties relative to the other elements 

Chemical elements are also given a unique chemical symbol Chemical symbols are used all over the world This means that no matter which language is spoken there is no confusion about what the symbol means Chemical symbols of elements come from their English or Latin names For example carbon has the chemical symbol C and sodium has chemical symbol Na after the Latin natrium Tungsten is called W after its German name wolfram Au is the symbol for gold and it comes from the Latin word for gold aurum Another symbol which comes from Latin is Ag This is the element silver and it comes from the Latin argentum Leads symbol Pb comes from the Latin plumbum and the English word plumber derives from this as pipes used to be made out of lead Others were named after famous people like einsteinium was named after Albert Einstein

Elements can join to form pure compounds In many cases these compounds have a fixed composition and their own structure and properties The properties of the compound may be very different from the elements it is made from Sodium is a metal that burns when put into water and chlorine is a poisonous gas When they react together they make sodium chloride which is harmless and edible

Some elements particularly metal elements mix together in any proportion to form new structures Such new structures are not compounds They are called mixtures

Atoms of the same element whose nuclei contain a different number of neutrons are said to be different isotopes of the element

Elements can be classified based on physical states At room temperature and pressure most elements are solids only 11 are gases and 2 are liquids

Elements can also be classified into metals and non metals There are many more metals than non metals 

However a few elements have properties in between those of metals and non metals These elements are called semimetals

Egypt is a country in northeast Africa Its capital city is Cairo Egypt is famous for its very old monuments such as the Pyramids and the Sphinx

Egypt has been an independent country since 1922 It is a member of the United Nations and the Arab League It was a republic from 1952 after the revolution of 1952 by the leader Gamal Abd Alnaasar

Egypt is a large country but a large portion of it is desert Most people live in areas around the coast of the Mediterranean Sea and along the Nile River This includes the cities of Cairo Alexandria Aswan and Port Said Not many people live in the desert Today Egypt has about 80 million people

Egypt is divided into 29 areas called Governorates of Egypt The Egyptian Parliament sits in Cairo and makes laws for the whole country As of February 11 2011 the country is being run by the military

In January 2011 thousands of protesters gathered in Cairo They wanted Hosni Mubarak to leave office He had been the President for last 30 years On February 11 Vice President Omar Suleiman made an announcement He said that Mubarak agreed to leave office Suleiman also said that Mubarak directed the Supreme Council of the armed forces would run the country

Today the people of Egypt are mostly Sunni Muslims There are still some Christians in Egypt today Many of these belong to the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria

Many famous people are from Egypt Some of these include Omar Sharif who was an international actor Boutros Boutros Ghali who was the first person from Africa to lead the United Nations and four Nobel Prize winners Anwar Sadat who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1978 Naguib Mahfouz who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1988 Ahmed Zewail who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1999 and Mohamed ElBaradei who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2005 Egypts climate is good in winter and very hot in summer depending on the time

Everything2 or E2 is a website It lets people make pages about many different things and some people use it as a diary

E2 users create pages called nodes and add stuff in writeups Only logged in users can create writeups Only the person who created the writeup or someone who the website owners choose can edit the writeup On the other hand on Wikipedia anyone can edit pages but on Everything2 only those who can edit the writeup can edit pages

Everything2 does not require a neutral point of view like Wikipedia does So it is possible to have more than one article under the same title each by different authors and presenting different points of view

To edit a document means to change the order of words or pictures or add new words or pictures usually so that the edited product better represents what the editor the person doing the editing meant to show

The word editor can also mean

Ecological yield is the harvestable growth of an ecosystem It is most commonly measured in forestry  in fact sustainable forestry is defined as that which does not harvest more wood in a year than has grown in that year within a given patch of forest

However the concept is also applicable to water and soil and any other aspect of an ecosystem which can be both harvested and renewed  the so called renewable resources The carrying capacity of an ecosystem is reduced over time if more than the amount which is renewed

Natures services analysis calculates the global yield of the Earths biosphere to humans as a whole This is said to be greater in size than the entire human economy However it is more than just yield but also the natural processes that increase biodiversity and conserve habitat which result in the total value of these services Yield of ecological commodities like wood or water useful to humans is only a part of it

Very often an ecological yield in one place offsets an ecological load in another Greenhouse gas released in one place for instance is fairly evenly distributed in the atmosphere and so greenhouse gas control can be achieved by creating a carbon sink literally anywhere else 

Ecocide is thought by some green economists to be accelerated by debt instruments which demand a yield greater than the ecological capacity to renew This is a major question in monetary reform

The experience economy is the intangible service economy that customers experience directly In moral purchasing Natural Capitalism and other theories of how consumers make choices they are actually choosing experiences or comprehensive outcomes of their choices For instance to buy local is to choose a whole experience of local suppliers such as in a farmers market or Slow Food that is quite different than the experience associated with factory food or fast food

Executionstate authorities kill someone for having committed an extremely serious crime usually treason or especially terrible murders In most countries where the death penalty is still provided for by law using it is an option available to the sentencing judge even if the jury or judicial panel recommends the death penalty the presiding judge still has the option to lock the convicted person in a prison for the rest of their life

Centuries ago many countries used beheading as an execution for important people including England In England some kings and queens have been beheaded There the prisoner would be led up the scaffold and usually say a speech Then heshe would be blindfolded and put hisher neck onto a block Then the executioner would lift up his axe and swing it down onto the victims neck If the executioner was skilled and the axe was sharp then the axe would usually cut through the bone and organs of the victim in one stroke But if the executioner was inexperienced then it may take many strokes before the head would be cut off

Many countries do not allow executions as punishment any more because it is too violent However many states of the United States and some other foreign countries allow it Even in the United States less violent ways of execution have had to be used Here are some other ways of execution other than hanging

The Flesch Reading Ease measures textual difficulty which indicates how easy a text is to read

Tools to calculate the Flesch Reading Ease include

The Flesch Reading Ease Scale measures readability as follows 

100 Very easy to read Average sentence length is 12 words or fewer No words of more than two syllables 

65 Plain English Average sentence is 15 to 20 words long Average word has two syllables 

30 A little hard to read Sentences will have mostly 25 words Two syllables usually

0 Very hard to read Average sentence is 37 words long Average word has more than two syllables 

The higher the rating the easier the text is to understand By the very nature of technical subject matter the Flesch score is usually relatively low for technical documentation If the Flesch test is used regularly one may develop a sense of what a reasonable score is for the type of documentation one is working on and aim to maximize this score The approach to calculating the Flesch score is as follows 

February is the second month of the year with 28 days in most years In leap years February has 29 days In Sweden in 1732 the month had 30 days This was to make the calendar match the rest of the world In 1930 and 1931 February had 30 days in the Soviet Union because the government changed all the months to be 30 days long The name comes either from the Roman god Februus or else from februa the festivals of purification celebrated in Rome every fifteenth of this month

February is one of the last two months to be added to the calendar This is because in the original Roman calendar the two months of winter when not much would happen in agriculture did not have names

From circa 700 BC when Numa Pompilius the second king of Rome added it to the calendar February had 23 days and 24 days on some of every second year until 46 BC when Julius Caesar assigned it 29 days on every fourth year and 28 days otherwise

Februarys flower is the violet and its birthstone is the amethyst The meaning of the amethyst is sincerity

This is a list of annual events or festivals

FAQ is an abbreviation for Frequently Asked Question The term is used for a list questions and answers All of the questions are supposed to be asked often and they all are about the same thing Since the acronym was first used in written form there are different ways it is said both fak and FAQ are commonly used 

Flame can be any of the following

Freedom Free from being owned by other People Companies Corporations or Government It is as the opposite of slavery

Freedom does not give you permission to Injure others OR endanger other Lifes with reckless actions that have high probability to Injure others in the future

Kids running into the roads Hands free Driving Speeding Drinking Driving and Spousal Abuse is an example of a reckless actions that endangers the Life of other People Which is why it is against the Natural Laws of physics and may lead to death on a hard impact

As a Parent you need to constantly teach your children these rules so when they are mature enough to go out of the home they do NOT injure others from reckless actions

Today freedom is considered by many to be something that all human beings have from birth and it is a natural legal right This means that one is free by the fact that they are a human being As humans everyone has dignity that must be respected

Some of the main types of human freedom are freedom to life freedom of association freedom of belief freedom to express oneself freedom to choose ones state in life However the civil constitutions of each country have different definitions of the freedoms allowed to the citizens It has been argued that any law limits freedom since it sets limits on what people may do

Financial capital is a form of capital It is things that have value but do not do anything by themselves They are only valuable because people value them For example money is a form of financial capital You cannot do anything with money but it still has value

Financial capital is used to pay for things this is because there is always more of it and people always want it This means that financial capital has a stable value and can be traded in most places and with most people

Some forms of financial capital such as stocks gold or bonds are not wanted by everybody However they can be traded with people for money or another type of financial capital Because of this these forms of financial capital do not have a stable price This means that some people try to make a profit by buying and selling these types of financial capital in a market

Some things are treated as financial capital even though they do have a use For example some people buy and sell land but are not interested in doing anything with it Some people think this sort of trade is bad because the land should be used and not just treated like money Other types of capital such as social capital and human capital are rarely treated like financial capital This may be because they involve people Treating useful capital like financial capital is called comodification

In politics a common question is how often the government should use financial capital In particular should the government use financial capital to make a profit Traditionally liberal politicians do not mind this kind of trading for profit but socialist or conservative politicians are against it

Fecund universes is a multiverse theory of Lee Smolin It relies on models of our universe and statistics from astrophysics but is more correctly a theory of cosmology

In this theory collapsing stars or black holes are always creating new universes with slightly different laws of physics Because these laws are only slightly different each is assumed to be like a mutation of the original universe as if each universe was a kind of single celled organism It would reproduce by splitting in some sense

This theory relies on many models of our universe to model these mutated alternative universes the ones that Smolin supposes are generated or spun off by black holes 

No human can ever be part of any of these other universes Observations from astrophysics can only say if the black holes exist or are common and give some idea of how much the laws of physics can vary and still let the new universes produce new black holes 

Smolin predicts that there would be many black holes in the universe humans can see since they are likely in a very late born universe by simple probability If there are many black holes that is evidence for his theory 

As this shows cosmology has a very different standard of evidence and burden of proof than is required for models of our universe only which humans can observe and exchange knowledge on

It is hard to separate science from religion on such questions It may be a simple matter of preference whether one wants to see ones universe as part of a system like biology or like mechanics  clockwork Smolins theory is important mostly because it challenges the mechanistic paradigm 

Even if it is wrong it raises the idea that living beings might have to see their universe as also living to be able to understand or care about it at all Some compare Smolins theory to Gaia philosophy which combines biology geology and ecology to explain the Earth our planet as a living thing If both are right humans are on a living planet in a living universe This idea is very appealing  which does not mean it is really right Some think both are a kind of religion

Food is material that comes from animals or plants eaten by living things to provide energy and nutrition Food contains the nutrition that people need to be healthy People need to eat protein fat carbohydrates vitamins and minerals to be healthy Liquids used for energy and nutrition are often called drinks

Food for humans is mostly made through farming or gardening and includes animal and vegetable sources Some people refuse to eat food from animal origin like meat eggs and products with milk in them Not eating meat is called vegetarianism Not eating or using any animal products is called veganism 

Food produced by farmers or gardeners can be transformed by industrial processes Processed food usually contains several natural ingredients and food additives

At home food is prepared in the kitchen by the cook The cook sometimes uses a cookbook Examples of cooking utensils are pressure cooker pot and pan

Food can also be prepared and served in restaurants or refectory

The utensils used may be a plate knife fork chopsticks spoon bowl or spork

Most people do not grow their own food so they have to buy food that was grown by someone else People buy most of their food in stores shops or markets But some people still grow most or all of their own food

People may buy food and take it home to cook it or buy food that is ready to eat from a street vendor or in a restaurant 

Food shortage is still a big problem in the world today Many people do not have enough money to buy the food that they need Bad weather or other problems sometimes destroy the growing food in one part of the world When people do not have enough food we say that they are hungry If they do not eat enough food for a long time they will become sick and die from starvation In areas where many people do not have enough food we say that there is famine there 

Food can make people sick if it is contaminated by micro organisms heavy metals or chemicals

If people do not eat the right foods they can become sick If people do not eat enough protein they get the disease called kwashiorkor If they do not eat enough vitamin B1 they get the disease called beriberi If people eat too much food they can become overweight or obese This is also bad for peoples health

Many cultures or religions have food taboos That means they have rules what people should not eat or how the food has to be prepared Examples of religious food rules are the Kashrut of Judaism and the Halal of Islam that say that pig meat cannot be eaten In Hinduism beef is not allowed to be eaten

The word fine is used in English with more than one meaning

Sometimes we often use the word fine in the same way for businesses instead of governments For example there are some businesses that will let us take books or videos to use in our homes for a few days But if we keep the book or video for too long we might have to pay a fine to that business

To fry food is to cook it in hot butter or vegetable oil We can fry food in a small amount of butter or oil in a pan or in a lot of oil in a pot Some restaurants also have large deep fryers to fry a lot of food at once

A fish is any gill bearing aquatic vertebrate that lacks limbs with digits It is a paraphyletic term a typological but not a phylogenetic classification 

Fish used to be a class of vertebrates that live in water Now the term covers several classes of animals

Fish are usually covered with scales and have two sets of paired fins and several unpaired fins They are usually cold blooded A fish takes in the oxygen from the water using gills There are many different kinds of fish They live in fresh water in lakes and rivers and in salt water in the ocean Some fish are less than one centimeter long The largest fish is the whale shark which can be almost 15 meters long and weigh 15 tons Most fish live in the water A group of fish called the Lungfish have developed lungs because they live in rivers and pools that dry up certain parts of the year

Certain animals that have the word fish in their name are not really fish Crayfish are crustaceans and jellyfish are Cnidarians Hagfish and Lampreys do not have a jawbone Hagfish are craniata Lampreys are Hyperoartia Certain animals look like fish but are not Whales and dolphins are mammals for example

Though often used interchangeably these words have different meanings Fish is used either as singular noun or to describe a group of specimens from a single species Fishes describes a group of different species

Fish the oldest vertebrate group includes a huge range of types from the Middle Ordovician about 490 million years ago to the present day These are the main groups

Most kinds of fish have bones Some kinds of fish such as sharks and rays do not have real bones they are known as cartilaginous fish

All fish are covered with overlapping scales and each major group of fish has its own special type of scale Teleosts have what are called leptoid scales These grow in concentric circles and overlap in a head to tail direction like roof tiles Sharks and other chondrichthyes have placoid scales made of denticles like small versions of their teeth These also overlap in a head to tail direction producing a tough outer layer Shark skin is available for purchase as shagreen a leather which as original is smooth in one direction and rough in the other direction It may be polished for use but is always rough in texture and resistant to slipping

The scales are usually covered with a layer of slime which improves passage through the water and makes the fish more slippery to a predator

Fish swim by exerting force against the surrounding water There are exceptions but this is usually done by the fish contracting muscles on either side of its body in order to generate waves of flexion that travel the length of the body from nose to tail generally getting larger as they go along Most fishes generate thrust using lateral movements of their body tail fin However there are also species which move mainly using their median and paired fins The latter group profits from the gained manoeuvrability that is needed when living in coral reefs for example But they can not swim as fast as fish using their bodies caudal fins

The shape of the body of a fish is important to its swimming This is because streamlined body shapes makes the water drag less Here are some common fish shapes

The picture on the left shows a shark This sharks shape is called fusiform and it is an ovoid shape where both ends of the fish are pointy This is the best shape for going through water quickly Fishes with fusiform shapes can chase prey and escape predators quickly Many live in the open ocean and swim constantly like marlins swordfish and tuna Ichthyosaurs porpoises dolphins killer whales all have similar shapes This is an example of convergent evolution

The long ribbon like shape of an eels body shows another shape This enables them to hide in cracks springing out quickly to capture prey then returning quickly to their hiding spot 

Flatfish live on the bottom of the ocean or lake Most use camouflage they change colors to match the ocean floor

Fish with compressed shapes have flat vertical bodies with one eye on each side They swim upright and can be very thin They usually live in reefs where their flat bodies can slip in and out among the corals sponges and rocks keeping hidden from predators Angelfish surgeonfish and butterflyfish are all compressed fish

Many fish swim in groups a lot of the time Schools of fish can swim together for long distances and may be chased by predators which also swim in schools Casual groups are called shoals This is discussed in shoaling and schooling

People eat many kinds of fish The fish that people eat most include carp cod herring perch sardines sturgeon tilapia trout tuna and many others A person who buys and sells fish for eating is called a fishmonger

Some people keep fish as pets Goldfish and Siamese Fighting Fish are popular types of pet fish They are often kept by groups of people in public ponds for their beauty and calming nature

See also Fishing

The word to fish is also used for the activity of catching fish People catch fish with small nets from the side of the water or from small boats or with big nets from big boats People can also catch fish with fishing poles and fishhooks with bait This is often called fishing There is also different types of lures that can be used One is a crank bait Others are plastic worms and rat l traps These are lots of different ways of catching fish

A foot is a body part on the end of a leg We use it when walking and it is important for balance it helps us stand straight We also use it to kick in both fighting and sports football being an example

Peoples hands and feet have the same shape they both have five digits Many other animals with backbones also have five digits The part of the foot which joins it to the leg is called the heel The bottom of the foot is called the sole Half the bones in our body are in the foot Doctors who work with peoples feet are podiatrists or chiropodists

Animals often have feet and there are a lot of different sorts of foot When an animal has soft feet or feet with soft parts on the underside we often call it a paw 

In many societies people like to cover the foot when they are with others especially outside In many cultures people wear clothing over the foot to keep it safe This footwear has special names for example sandals shoes and boots When people always wear footwear especially in hot places or when they are very active their feet can smell badly If footwear is too big or small it can be bad for the feet when the person wears the shoe because it can cause long term damage People who have foot leg and back problems can also get help from special shoes 

People have different traditions in different parts of the world for when to wear footwear For example in much of Europe and Canada people usually do not wear their shoes or boots in a home or visiting In the United States people often wear shoes inside a home In Japan people do not wear shoes in homes and floors are often made of very soft materials too soft for shoes In cultures where people always wear shoes people sometimes think it is bad not to wear them Not wearing shoes can be good for the feet especially for childrens feet

Conditions like Athletes foot affect the feet causing the feet to feel dry and cracked

The country has been one of the world powers since the end of the 17th century In the 18th and 19th centuries it built a big colonial empire across West Africa and Southeast Asia Nowadays this does not exist It is the most visited country in the world About 82 million foreign tourists visit it every year France is a founding member of the European Union It has the largest land area of any member France is also a founding member of the United Nations and a member of the G8 and NATO It is one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council It has nuclear weapons including active warheads and also has nuclear power plants

Some well known cities in France include Nice Nancy Marseille Bordeaux Lille Lyon Toulouse Strasbourg Rennes Nantes and Paris

France is in Western Europe France has borders with Belgium Luxembourg Germany Switzerland Italy Monaco Andorra and Spain France has two mountain ranges near its borders the Alps in the east and the Pyrenees in the south There are many rivers in France including the Seine and the Loire In the north and the west of France there are low hills and river valleys 

In France there are many different climates The Atlantic has a major effect on the weather in the north and west This means the temperature is about the same most of the year It is in the marine west coast climate region In the east winters are cold and the weather is good Summers are hot and stormy In the south winters are cool and wet Summers are hot and dry

France has the second largest Exclusive Economic Zone in the world It covers 11035000 km2 Only the United States has a larger one

The name France comes from the Latin word Francia which literally means land of the Franks or Frankland

The borders of modern France are about the same as those of ancient Gaul Celtic Gauls inhabited Ancient Gaul Julius Caesar conquered Gaul for Rome in the 1st century BC Eventually the Gauls adopted Roman speech and Roman culture Christianity first appeared in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD It became firmly established by the fourth and fifth centuries

In the 4th century AD the Germanic tribes principally the Franks invaded the Gauls This is how the name Francie appeared The modern name France comes from the name of the Capetian Kings of France around Paris The Franks were the first tribe of Europe after the fall of the Roman Empire to convert to Christianity rather than Arianism The French called themselves the most Christian Kingdom of France

The Treaty of Verdun divided Charlemagnes Empire into three parts The biggest area was Western Francia It is similar to modern France

The Carolingian dynasty ruled France until 987 when Hugh Capet became King of France His descendants the Direct Capetians the House of Valois and the House of Bourbon unified the country with many wars and dynastic inheritance The monarchy was the most powerful during the 17th century and the reign of Louis XIV of France At that time France had the largest population in Europe The country had a big influence over European politics economy and culture French became the common language of diplomacy in international affairs Much of the Enlightenment happened in France French scientists made big scientific discoveries in the 18th century France also conquered many overseas possessions in the Americas Africa and Asia

France had a monarchy until the French Revolution in 1789 King Louis XVI and his wife Marie Antoinette were executed in 1793 Thousands of other French citizens were also killed Napoleon Bonaparte took control of the Republic in 1799 He later made himself Emperor of the First Empire His armies conquered most of continental Europe

After Napoleons final defeat in 1815 at the Battle of Waterloo another monarchy arose Later Louis Napolon Bonaparte created the Second Empire in 1852 Louis Napolon was removed after the defeat in the Franco Prussian war of 1870 The Third Republic replaced his regime

France built a large colonial empire in the 18th and 19th centuries The empire included parts of West Africa and Southeast Asia The culture and politics of these regions were influenced by France Many ex colonies officially speak the French language

The country was where both the First and Second World Wars took place During the First World War millions were killed in the trenches including over a million in the Battle of the Somme The conditions were very poor The last surviving veteran was Pierre Picault who died on 20 November 2008 at the age of 109 During the Second World War Nazis occupied France The Allies landed in Normandy on June 6 1944 They invaded Normandy and began the Battle of Normandy German forces lost France in just a few months

FileFrance departements regions narrowjpgthumbThe 22 regions The 22 regions and 96 departments of metropolitan France includes Corsica The Paris area is expanded France is divided into regions 22 of them are in Metropolitan France

Corsica has a different status than the other 21 metropolitan regions It is called collectivit territoriale

France also has four overseas regions

Then France is divided into 100 departments The departments are divided into 342 arrondissements The arrondissements are re divided into 4032 cantons The smallest subdivision is the commune On January 1 2008 INSEE counted 36781 communes in France 36569 of them are in metropolitan France and 212 of them are in overseas France

The government of France is a semi presidential system determined by the French Constitution of the French Fifth Republic The constitution declares the nation to be an indivisible secular democratic and social Republic It provides for a separation of powers

The French armed forces are divided into four branches

France has about 359000 military personnel France spends 26 of its gross domestic product on defence This is the highest in the European Union France and the UK spend 40 of the EU defence budget About 10 of Frances defence budget is for its nuclear weapons force

France is a member of the United Nations It is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and has veto rights It is also a member of the World Trade Organisation It hosts the headquarters of the OECD UNESCO and Interpol In 1953 the United Nations asked France to choose a coat of arms to represent them internationally The French emblem is now on their passports

France was a founding member of the European Union In the 1960s France wanted to exclude the United Kingdom from the organisation It wanted to build its own economic power in continental Europe Since the 1990s France and Germany got closer after WWII had slowed any type of relations This was to try to become the most influential country in the EU It created rivalry with the UK and limited the influence of the new Eastern European members France is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation However under President de Gaulle it left the joint military command In the early 1990s France received criticism for its underground nuclear tests in French Polynesia France vigorously opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq France retains strong political and economic influence in its former African colonies For instance it has supplied economic aid and troops for peace keeping missions in the Ivory Coast and Chad

France is a member of the G8 group of leading industrialised countries France has the eighth largest economy in the world by Gross domestic product France and 11 other European Union members jointly launched the euro on 1 January 1999 and started using it in 2002

Frances economy has nearly 29 million registered companies The government has a considerable influence over railway electricity aircraft and telecommunications firms France has an important aerospace industry led by Airbus It can also launch rockets from French Guiana

 Cuisine 

French cuisine has influenced the style of cooking throughout Europe and its chefs work in restaurants throughout the world

The roots of modern haute cuisine lie in chefs like La Varenne and the notable chef of Napoleon Marie Antoine Carme These chefs developed a lighter style of food compared to the food of the middle ages They used fewer spices and more herbs and creamy ingredients 

Typical ingredients like roux and fish stock and techniques such as marinading and dishes such as ragout were invented Carme was an expert ptissier and this is still a mark of French cooking He developed basic sauces his mother sauces he had over a hundred sauces in his repertoire based on the half dozen mother sauces

French cuisine was introduced in the 20th century by Georges Auguste Escoffier He was a genius at organisation He worked out how to run large restaurants as in a big hotel or a palace how the staff should be organised how the menu was prepared He had methods for everything Escoffiers largest contribution was the publication of Le Guide Culinaire in 1903 which established the fundamentals of French cookery Escoffier managed the restaurants and cuisine at the Savoy Hotel and Carlton Hotel in London the Htel Ritz Paris and some of the greatest cruise ships

Escoffier however left out much of the culinary character to be found in the regions of France 

Gastro tourism and the Guide Michelin helped to acquaint people with the rich bourgeois and peasant cuisine of the French countryside in the 20th century Gascon cuisine has also had great influence over the cuisine in the southwest of France Many dishes that were once regional have proliferated in variations across the country Cheese and wine are a major part of the cuisine playing different roles regionally and nationally In the north of France people often prefer to use butter to cook In the south they prefer olive oil and garlic In France each region has its own special dish choucroute in Alsace quiche in Lorraine cassoulet in the Languedoc Roussillon and tapenade in Provence Alpes Cte dAzur

In November 2010 French gastronomy was added by UNESCO to its lists of the worlds intangible cultural heritage

France is the number one tourist destination in the world In 2007 819 million foreign tourists visited France Spain comes second and the United States come third Some of the most famous attractions in Paris are the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe Another one is Mont Saint Michel in Normandy

The most popular sports in Finland are ice hockeyskiing track and field and association football Recently Finns have also won many events in swimming and motor sports and gymnastics

There is a very small group of a few thousand Samis in the most northern part of Finland called Lapland Most of the Samis live in Norway and Sweden Many Sami people farm reindeers Originally Samis were hunter gatherers In the past the Sami were nomads but nowadays they live in regular houses

Very few people in Finland are from other countries only about one percent The number of foreigners in Finland has recently been growing rapidly

Most of Finland is covered by pine forest The swan is the national bird of Finland The swan was a holy animal long ago Wood is the most important natural resource of Finland It is estimated that up to one third of all wood resources of the European Union are in Finland

The national animal of Finland is the brown bear And the largest animal is the elk

There are also hundreds of rivers and thousands of lakes with fresh water Fishing is a popular sport It is estimated there are almost 180000 lakes in Finland

The weather in Finland varies a lot by the season The summer lasts usually from May to early September and temperatures can reach up to 35 C Autumns are dark and rainy Permanent snow falls in Helsinki in early December and in the winter the temperature can be 30 C The winter usually lasts to mid March when the snow melts away in Helsinki and spring to late May Springs are vigorous and the weather can vary from frost to sunshine in a matter of days Northern lights are common in Lapland

People first came to Finland 10000 years ago That was just after an ice age after a very thick layer of ice that was covering the ground had melted away

Some think the first people in Finland already spoke a language that is related to Finnish that is spoken today It is known for sure that an early form of the Finnish language was spoken in Finland in the Iron Age

The first residents in Finland hunted animals instead of farming their food Those kind of people are called hunter gatherers Some people started the farm to farm some food 5200 years ago Farming slowly became more and more popular and became the major way of life until the modern age 

The religion of the Finnish people was paganism The biggest god of the Finns was Ukko He was a god of sky and thunder About a thousand years ago some Finns changed their religion to Christianity and slowly Christianity became more and more popular Some pagan beliefs still remained amongst the Christian beliefs During the Reformation of Christianity most Finnish people became protestants

From the Middle Ages Finland was a part of Sweden Then in the year 1809 AD Russia took Finland from Sweden Finland was a part of Russia but after a short period of time it became autonomous which means that the Finns essentially controlled Finland though the Tsar was in control officially Finns could create their own laws and had their own currency their own stamps and own customs However Finland did not have its own army

On 6 December 1917 Finland became independent which meant that it no longer was a part of Russia There was a communist revolution in Russia and after 1922 Russia was a part of the Soviet Union There were communists in Finland too who tried to create a revolution in Finland This attempt at revolution caused the Finnish civil war The communists lost the civil war and Finland did not change its old capitalist system

Stalin who was the leader of the Soviet Union did not like having a capitalist country as its neighbour Stalin wanted Finland to become a communist state and be a part of the Soviet Union The leaders of Finland refused they wanted to stay independent The Soviet Union sent many troops across the eastern border of Finland to try to make Finland join them which resulted in the Winter War There were many battles that eventually resulted in Finland losing areas along its eastern border to the Soviet Union

Adolf Hitler was the dictator of Germany and wanted to invade the Soviet Union Finland wanted to retrieve the areas that it had lost so they joined the German invasion which started in 1941 This part of the Second World War is called the Continuation War in Finland However Finland was not a fascist or an antisemitic country Finns were interested in freedom rather than dictatorship

While Germany was losing the war Finland had already progressed into the Soviet Union in order to regain the areas lost in the previous peace Finland wanted to end the war with the Soviet Union which resulted in peace but once again Finland had to relinquish the areas that they had conquered This time the peace with the Soviet Union made Finland and Germany enemies Finns fought Germans and Germans retreated to Norway burning down the whole of Lapland behind them This is called War of Lapland Finland remained independent

After the war many factories were built in Finland Many people moved from farms to cities At that time big factories manufactured products like paper and steel More and more people worked in more advanced jobs like high technology Also many people went to universities to get a good education Finland was one of the first countries where most people had Internet connections and mobile phones A well known company that makes mobile phones Nokia is from Finland

Finland joined the European Union in 1995 The finnish currency the markka was changed to the European Unions currency the euro in 2002

In a shop a fruit is any fleshy sweet plant growth In botany a fruit is a plant structure that contains its seeds The word fruit is used only if it comes from the part of the flower which was an ovary It is an extra layer round the seeds which may or may not be fleshy However even in botany there is no general agreement on how fruits should be classified Many do have extra layers from other parts of the flower 

Since fruits are produced from fertilised ovaries in flowers only flowering plants produce fruits Fruits are an evolutionary invention which help seeds get dispersed by animals

The botanical term includes many that are not fruits in the common sense of the term such as the vegetables squash pumpkins cucumbers tomato peas beans corn eggplant and sweet pepper and some spices such as allspice and chillies

An accessory fruit or false fruit is a fruit in which some of the flesh is derived not from the ovary but from some adjacent tissue

A fig is a type of accessory fruit called a syconium Pomes such as apples and pears are also accessory fruits the core is the true fruit

Strictly speaking these are not botanical fruits 

These are fruits which you can buy in shops and which are also acceptable as botanical fruits

Many fruits come from trees or bushes For plants fruits are a means of dispersal usually by animals When the fruit breaks apart the seeds can go into the ground and begin to grow Most fruits we eat contain a lot of water and natural sugars and many are high in Vitamin C They have a large amount of dietary fibre Fruits are usually low in protein and fat content but avocados and some nuts are exceptions to this Not only humans but our closest living relatives are keen fruit eaters So are many other groups of herbivorous mammals and many birds

Seedlessness is an important feature of some fruits of commerce Commercial bananas and pineapple are examples of seedless fruits Some citrus fruits especially oranges satsumas mandarin oranges table grapes grapefruit and watermelons are valued for their seedlessness 

Seedless bananas and grapes are triploids and seedlessness results from the abortion of the embryonic plant which is produced by fertilisation The method requires normal pollination and fertilisation

A farm is a piece of land used to grow plants andor raise animals for food

People who grow these plants or raise these animals are called farmers This type of work is called farming 

Land that is used to grow plants for food or could be used to grow plants for food is called arable land A life raising animals for food is called a pastoral life 

Many farms in richer countries are very large and can cause damage to the world we live in

There are many types of farming Some people farm to eat the food they produce Opposite that some companies have very large farms to sell the food they produce Usually subsistence farming is prevalent in poorer countries while industrial farming is prevalent in richer countries

Geography is the study of the Earth and its features its inhabitants and its phenomena The word geography comes from the Greek words g and graphein It means to write about the Earth The word was first used by a scientist called Eratosthenes 

Its features are things like continents seas rivers and mountains Its inhabitants are all the people and animals that live on it Its phenomena are the things that happen like tides winds and earthquakes 

A person who is an expert in geography is a geographer A geographer tries to understand the world and the things that are in it how they started and how they have changed 

Geography is divided into two main parts called physical geography and human geography Physical geography studies the natural environment and human geography studies the human environment The human environmental studies would include things such as the population in a country how a countrys economy is doing and more 

Geographers need to know a lot about maps because maps are very important for understanding geography Geographers use maps a lot and often make them Making maps is called cartography and similarly people who make maps are cartographers

Geographers studying the natural environment may look at 

Geographers studying the Human environment may look at

The word good can be an adjective that means something that is wanted Something that is good is not bad See good in the dictionary

Good can also mean

Goodness can mean that something is good or it can mean the amount that something is good

What goodness is has been talked about by philosophers who try to explain what goodness is

In food goodness is the part that is beneficial

Grammar means the rules about how to speak and write in a language The Ancient Greeks used to call it grammatik tkhn the craft of letters It can have any of these meanings

When we speak we use the native persons grammar or as near as we can When we write we try to write with correct usage grammar So speaking and writing a language each have their own style

All languages have their own grammar Most European languages are rather similar whereas for example Chinese and Japanese are very different from all European languages Nevertheless English has its own quite special characteristics 

English makes few changes to its word endings In the Italic or Romance languages word endings carry a lot of meaning In English we have just a few plurals and posessives are the most common In our verbs we have dropped most endings except one I love you love but she loves That final s is a remnant of Anglo Saxon which had more suffixes Verbs do have endings which show changes in tense walked walking

Word order is the other big difference All Romance languages normally put their adjectives in front of the nouns For example in English a person may say I like fast cars but in Spanish it is Me gustan los coches rpidos The order of the words has changed if just the words without the grammar are translated into English it would mean to me they please the cars fast This is because Spanish and English have different rules about word order In German main verbs often come near the end of sentences whereas in English we usually put them between subject and object as the cat sat on the mat

Written grammar changes slowly but spoken grammar is more fluid Sentences English speakers find normal today might have seemed strange to people 100 years ago And they might not because many of our favourite sayings come from the Authorized King James Version of the Bible and from Shakespeare

Some people use grammar that is different from other people when speaking For example people who use what is called General American English or BBC English might say I didnt do anything while someone who speaks what is called African American Vernacular English or AAVE might say I didnt do nothing London working class version I aint done nuffink These are called double negatives and are found almost entirely in spoken language not written language

These differences are called dialects The dialect a person uses is usually decided by where they live Even though the dialects of English use different words or word order they still have grammar rules However when writing in American English grammar uses the rules of General American English When people talk about using proper English they usually mean using the grammar of general British English as described in standard reference works The models for spoken English in Britain are often called Received Pronunciation or BBC English

Grammar studies syntax as well as the different parts of language These are called parts of speech They fit together according to rules and create sentences Sentences fit together and create paragraphs

Grammar studies nouns pronouns verbs adjectives adverbs prepositions conjunctions sentences phrases clauses 

Nouns are thing words like table and chair They are objects things you see in everyday life Proper nouns are places peoples names or other things like days of the week The name James is a proper noun as is Wednesday and London

The basic verb form is called the infinitive The infinitive for existence is to be A famous example is the speech of Hamlet to be or not to be Variations of the infinitive create verb tenses The past tense of to be in English is was The future tense is will be

The Great Lakes are five large lakes in east central North America They hold 21 of the worlds surface fresh water 

The lakes are

Four of the Great Lakes are on the border between Canada and the United States of America The other Lake Michigan is entirely inside the United States

All together by volume they are the largest group of fresh water lakes in the world though the somewhat salty Caspian Sea is much larger The Caspian is enclosed by land and therefore a lake Individually none of the lakes are larger than Lake Baikal or Lake Tanganyika Lake Baikal is commonly seen as the biggest freshwater reservoir and the oldest freshwater lake that still exists Lake Tanganyika is the second deepest freshwater lake and one of the biggest lakes in Africa

The great cities of Chicago Illinois Toronto Ontario Detroit Michigan Montreal Quebec Cleveland Ohio and Ottawa have positions on the Great Lakes or their rivers

Though the five lakes have separate basins they form a single connected body of freshwater The lakes form a chain connecting the east central interior of North America to the Atlantic Ocean Water flows from Lake Superior and Lake Michigan into Lake Huron then through the Detroit River into Lake Erie then through Niagara Falls into Lake Ontario and then through the Saint Lawrence River to the Atlantic Ocean

The lakes drain a large watershed via many rivers and have about 35000 islands The Great Lakes region contains not only the five themselves but also many thousands of smaller lakes often called inland lakes Water drains from the Lakes through the Saint Lawrence River on the east and the Chicago River on the south

The unusual shape of the Great Lakes has created the possibility of tidal waves If a storm front causes a strong rapid increase in air pressure on one side of a lake the water level on that side of the lake will drop and suddenly push up the water level on the opposite side of the lake A 10 foot tall wave in Chicago caused several deaths in 1954

The Great Lakes are home to a variety of species of fish and other organisms In recent years overfishing caused a decline in lake trout The drop in lake trout increased the alewife population In response the government introduced salmon as a predator to decrease the alewife population This program was so successful that the salmon population rose rapidly and the states surrounding Lake Michigan promoted salmon snagging This has been made illegal in all of the Great Lakes states except for a limited season in Illinois Lake Michigan is now being stocked with several species of fish However several invader species such as lampreys round goby and zebra mussels threaten the native fish populations

Accidentally introduced species are a big problem Since the 19th century about 160 species have invaded the Great Lakes ecosystem causing severe economic and ecological impacts According to the Inland Seas Education Association they deprive fish of food cause blooms of toxic algae and foul boats spawning areas and drinking water intakes On average a new invasive species enters the Great Lakes every eight months

Two important infestations in the Great Lakes are the zebra mussel first discovered in 1988 and the quagga mussel in 1989 These molluscs are efficient filter feeders They compete with native mussels and also reduce available food and spawning grounds for fish 

Also the mussels hurt utility and manufacturing industries by clogging or blocking pipes The US Fish and Wildlife Service estimates that the economic impact of the zebra mussel will be about 5 billion over the next decade Because the quagga mussel is good at filtering plankton from the lake water sunlight reaches deeper into the lake This increases the growth of algae

Chemicals from industrial plants run off the land into rivers and arrive in the lakes Some of these chemicals are highly toxic such as mercury Contaminated water from sewer overflows also reaches the lakes and beaches get closed because of the threat of pathogenic bacteria

The GNU Free Documentation License is a copyleft license for open content It was made up by the Free Software Foundation for the GNU project It was initially created for use with software documentation but can be applied to other types of works as well such as Wikipedia 

As a copyright license the GFDL is a type of contract between the creator of a copyrightable work and anyone else who might want to use it The GFDL is considered copyleft because the license is meant to make it easier to use and re use the copyrighted work not to restrict its use 

If a copyrightable work is released under the GFDL the creator of the work is saying that anyone else may reproduce distribute or modify the work as long as they follow a set of requirements specified in the GFDL Among the requirements of the GFDL are that any new work created from the original work is also licensed under the GFDLthat is once something is licensed as GFDL it will always stay licensed as GFDL and anything which uses it also is licensed as GFDL

The GFDL also says that in order to distribute or modify a work licensed with the GFDL the re user must give credit to any previous authors of the work and include a list of changes they made to the work 

Finally any work licensed with the GFDL must contain somewhere the entire text of the license This provision has been criticized because it is not always easy to include an entire long license with a copyrighted work In a book for example it is easy to include one extra page with the license but if the work is something like a song or a photograph it is not easy 

The GFDL has other requirements that are more complicated For example if part of the work is labeled as an invariant section it cannot ever be removed or changed by someone using the work 

Works licensed under the GFDL may be included in with non GFDL licensed works only if it is clear which parts of the work are licensed as the GFDL For example in a book of poetry it would be easy to label some poems as licensed under the GFDL and some not licensed under it But it would not be easy to label if part of a song was licensed as GFDL and the rest was not so this would not be allowed 

Any use of GFDL material which violates the terms of the GFDL is potentially copyright infringement

A number of online projects use the GFDL The largest online project to license its content under the GFDL is WikipediafactdateApril 2009

The GFDL has been criticized by many people who wish that it made it even easier for content to be re used Among the criticisms are that it is very hard to combine GFDL material with other copyleft licenses that it is not always clear and easy to understand and that some of its requirements such as the invariant sections are not free at all 

Glass is a hard material that can be made in many shapes It is usually transparent but it can also be made in colours Glass is made of sand that is heated until it is liquid When it is liquid it is shaped and left to cool

Glass is often used to make windows and bottles Many churches have windows made of colored glass

The word glass can also refer to a drink container It does not have to be made of glass but can be made of any material for example plastic 

Glass is used to make lenses The word glasses is often used to mean eyeglasses

The myth that glass is actually a liquid comes from the fact that old windows in houses and churches are sometimes a little out of shape thicker at the bottom than the top This phenomenon is actually due to the process of glass manufacture in the past which led to the glass pane being thicker at one edge than the other It was sensible to install the windows with the thick edge at the bottom Sometimes a window can be found with the thick edge at the top of the window

Some religions say that there is a supernatural being called God Other religions say there is more than one god A supernatural being is also sometimes called a deity Many religions believe that a deity created everything that exists In most religions a god is believed to be immortal and to have powers to control nature far beyond the powers of humans

The belief that there is at least one god is usually called theism People who reject belief that any deities exist are called atheists Agnostics think we cannot know for sure whether any deities exist but still might believe at least one deity exists

In some religions there are many gods which is called polytheism In other religions there is only one which is called monotheism In polytheism the word gods is usually written in lowercase letters God is usually written with an uppercase letter when only one god is believed to exist Some polytheists also use uppercase when talking about their most important god

Many people have asked themselves if God exists Philosophers theologians and others have tried to prove that it exists others have tried to show that it does not exist In philosophical terminology such arguments are about the epistemology of the ontology of God Science has found no evidence that indicates the existence of God or of anything supernatural The debate exists mainly in philosophy since scientists cannot really prove whether or not supernatural things like gods exist

There are many philosophical issues with the existence of God Some definitions of God are not specific others sometimes contradict themselves Arguments for the existence of God typically include metaphysical empirical inductive and subjective types Some theories are built around holes in evolutionary theory as well as order and complexity in the world Arguments against the existence of God typically include empirical deductive and inductive arguments Conclusions sometimes include God does not exist God almost certainly does not exist no one knows whether God exists God exists but this cannot be proven or disproven and God exists and this can be proven There are many variations on these positions and sometimes different names for some of them For example the position God exists and this can be proven is sometimes called gnostic theism or strong theism

In the year 2000 approximately 53 of the worlds population felt part of one of the three main Abrahamic religions 6 with Buddhism 13 with Hinduism 6 with traditional Chinese religion 7 with various other religions and less than 15 as non religious Most of these religious beliefs involve a god or gods

Abrahamic religions are very popular monotheistic ones Well known Abrahamic religions include Judaism Christianity and Islam Monotheistic means the people in these religions believe there is only one god The name of God is usually not allowed to be said in Judaism but some Jews today call him YHWH or Jehovah Muslims say the word Allah which is the Arabic word for The God 

Believers in the Abrahamic religions believe that God has created human beings in his image but this idea is rarely taken literally The idea of an old man with a beard has been used in art since the Renaissance but is not what most monotheists actually believe he looks like

The Christian Bible talks about God in different ways Christians say that the Old Testament talks about God the Father The New Testament is about Jesus or God the Son Many Christians also believe that Jesus was Gods incarnation on earth Christians consider the Holy Spirit to be God as well

In early times Christians tried to solve this problem In the New Testament there are three beings who are said to be God in different forms the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit This is called the Holy Trinity by most people who believe in it although the word Trinity is not in the Bible Another word that most Christians believe means the same thing as Trinity is Godhead 

Some Christians do not believe in the Trinity Some believe that Jesus was just a man that talked about God and taught people about God Members of the Unitarian Church have these beliefs

Christians believe that God turned into a man named Jesus and came to Earth to save everyone from sin When Jesus prayed and talked to God he called him Father and taught others to do the same

In Hinduism there is only one God named Brahman but Brahman is said to have taken on many different incarnations Some of these are Rama Krishna Buddha Shiva Kali Parvati and Durga To many outsiders the worship of Gods different incarnations is considered to be the worship of many gods However it is really only the worship of one God in different ways

Some Hindus also believe that the spirit of God lives in everyone This idea is called Advaita Vedanta which is the Hindu term for Monism

Religions like Buddhism and Confucianism involve the worship of many gods or sometimes no gods at all

Philosophers can talk about God or god sometimes they talk about a specific god but other times they are just talking about the idea of god

One of the earliest Western philosophers to write about God in a monotheistic way was the Greek Aristotle who describes god as the Supreme Cause Aristotle saw God as a being that makes everything happen but is not influenced by anything else

There are also some philosophical problems with God One of them is called God paradox It is a question about whether God can make a mountain that is so heavy he cannot lift it

A ghost is considered to be the spirit of a dead person Scientists say that there are no real ghosts but many people believe that there are

There are many stories about ghosts in books and movies Sometimes the ghost is the spirit of a person who was killed by enemies or who died in a scary way The ghost may stay on Earth because he or she is angry due to some problem in life and wants to scare people or to harm his or her enemies Sometimes ghosts are said to live in a particular locality for example an abandoned house and when occupants come they tease them to drive away or cause serious damage to the occupants

Sometimes the ghosts in these stories exist because of some problem the person had during life that was not solved before he or she died The ghost stays on the Earth trying to fix the problem If the problem is fixed the ghost can leave the Earth Many ghosts stay on Earth also because they have died younger or have had sudden or abrupt deaths Many people claim to have seen or heard ghosts People who try to talk to ghosts as their job are called Mediums

Many people believe they have seen ghosts Others believe they have felt ghosts near them Often the ghost is said to appear as a feeling of cold and a light or a misty cloud but sometimes people say they have seen ghosts that look more like people Sometimes ghosts are said to come in human form that is in the body of a person Some ghosts might cause fear in the person who sees them by being seen suddenly Some ghosts are said to be friendly and help people who are in problems The ghost might also appear as they did at the time of their death including any blood or injuries Ghosts can also appear and disappear as they wish Many ghosts haunt the place they have died or a living loved one Some may seek revenge or stay simply because they are confused

Ghosts can form right after they die or even centuries later Many people make up stories or urban legends many try to prove the existence of these paranormal creatures with special technology such as heat sensors They also make TV shows dedicated to proving the existence of ghosts often investigating cases where a person has seen one or visiting a place of sighting

Green is a color It is one of the colors of the rainbow Green is between the yellow and blue colors in a rainbow Green paint can be made by mixing yellow paint and blue paint together 

Green light like all light is formed from waves In its wave the distance between the smallest repeating parts is about 550 nanometers

Most leaves of growing plants such as trees and bushes are green This is because there is a chemical in leaves called chlorophyll which is colored green

Gods eye view is a name for a point of view where the speaker or writer assumes they have knowledge only God would have It appears several ways

A special case of the last is in a wiki with a GodKing Often this person can get others to believe what they say about what is right without making any special effort to be fair to other views

Many people think Rene Descartes took a Gods eye view when he said cogito ergo sum George Berkeley argued that optics from Isaac Newton and Johannes Kepler also had this problem

Google is one of the biggest and most famous websites for finding things on the World Wide Web Search engines also do other things than searching Other search engines use its software and information too That makes it the most used search engine on the web Every day 200 million people use it Googles main office is in Mountain View California USA

With Google people can also search for pictures Usenet newsgroups news and things to buy online By June 2004 Google had 428 billion web pages on its database 880 million pictures and 845 million Usenet messages six billion things 

To google as an action word means to search for something on Google Because Google is so popular it has been used to mean to search the web Google dislikes this use since the name of the company is a trademark Google can lose that trademark if people use it too much

Google was started in early 1996 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin two students at Stanford University USA It used to be called Backrub Later they made it into a company Google Inc on September 7 1998 at a friends garage in Menlo Park California In February 1999 the company moved to 165 University Ave Palo Alto California Then later that year it moved to another place now called the Googleplex

In September 2001 Googles rating system got a US Patent The patent was to Stanford University with Lawrence Page as the inventor

Google makes an important though shrinking percentage of its money through its friends like America Online and InterActiveCorp It has a special group known as the Partner Solutions Organization which helps make contracts helps making accounts better and gives engineering help

The name for Googles main office the Googleplex is a play on a different even bigger number the googolplex which is 1 followed by one googol of zeroes

A gallon is a unit of measurement used to measure volume People have used many different gallons throughout history There are three types of gallon still in use

A government is a group of people that has the power to rule in a territory according to the law This territory may be a country a state or province within a country or a region 

Minarchy also called small government is a form of government in which only people who use force or fraud are prosecuted Many libertarians support this form of government

The simplest idea of government is those who rule over people and land This may be as small as a community with some sort of board that looks after the goings on of those who live within it or something a little larger like a village or as big as a continent 

Those people who rule the land can allow others to own it It is a deed by government that gives this right in the way that laws describe Some think they have the right to hold land without government permission This view is called libertarianism Others think they can do so together as a group with others if they live in peace without government This view is called anarchism 

Almost every place on Earth is connected to one and only one government Places without government are where people follow traditions instead of government rules small border disputed areas and the continent of Antarctica because almost no people live there For every other place on Earth there is a government that claims sovereign control over it The word sovereign is old and means control by a King Governments of villages cities counties and other communities are also subordinate to the government of the state or province where they exist and then to that of the country

It is from Kings and feudalism that modern governments and nation states came The capital of a country for instance is where the King kept his assets From this we get the modern idea of capital in economics A government is said to regulate trade as well as to rule over land

Governments also control people and decide things about what morality to accept or punish In very many countries there are strict rules about sexual intercourse and drugs that are part of law and offenders are punished for disobeying them

Tax is how government is paid for in most countries People who buy sell import invest own a house or land or earn money are made to pay some of the money to a government

There are many theories of how to organize government better These are called theories of civics Because government is run by people who can be greedy many people think leaders must be elected by some kind of democracy That way if government does not act nice they can be replaced in the next election Still many countries governments are not a democracy but other forms in which only a few people have power

There are many theories of how to run a government better and keep people from hurting each other These theories are part of politics No matter how a government is chosen it must do politics to keep power

A galaxy is a group of many stars along with gas dust and dark matter Gravity holds galaxies together Everything in a galaxy moves around a centre The name galaxy is taken from the Greek word Galaxia meaning milky a reference to our own galaxy the Milky Way 

There are three main types of galaxies ellipticals spirals and irregulars All galaxies exist inside the universe There are probably over 170 billion galaxies within distance we can see or the observable universe 

There are galaxies of different sizes Typical galaxies range from dwarfs with as few as ten million stars up to giants with a hundred trillion stars all orbiting the galaxys center of mass Galaxies may contain many multiple star systems star clusters and various interstellar clouds The Sun is one of the stars in the Milky Way galaxy the Solar System includes the Earth and all the other objects that orbit the Sun

Star clusters are not galaxies they are inside galaxies Globular clusters are spherical tightly knit balls of stars which are part of the outer halo of the Milky Way One of the largest known star clusters Messier 15 has several million stars packed closely together with a black hole at its centre The stars are too closely packed to get an accurate count but it certainly has more stars than some of the smaller galaxies 

In addition to the overall expansion of the universe galaxies move relative to other galaxies They can and do collide When this happens the stars generally move past each other but gas clouds and dust interact and can form a burst of new stars Gravity pulls both galaxies into somewhat new shapes formng bars rings or tail like structures

Many galaxies also continue to form new generations of stars The Milky Way and all spiral shaped galaxies like it produce new stars at a rate of one or two stars per year These stars are formed in the vast interstellar clouds that account for about 1 to 10 of the mass of these galaxies Globular star clusters on the other hand are not currently forming stars because this activity happened billions of years ago and then stopped once all of the gas and dust clouds were used up 

In the astronomical literature the word Galaxy with a capital G is used for our galaxy the Milky Way The billions of other galaxies are just written as galaxy with a lowercase g The term Milky Way first came out in the English language in a poem by Chaucer

When William Herschel wrote his catalog of deep sky objects he used the name spiral nebula for objects like the Andromeda Galaxy but nebula is now only used for diffuse structures within a galaxy

In Greek mythology Zeus places his son whose mother was a mortal woman on Heras breast while she is sleeping so that the baby will drink her divine milk and become immortal However Hera wakes up while she is breastfeeding the baby and realizes she is nursing a baby she does not know According to Greek mythology she then pushes the baby away and a stream of her milk sprays the night sky making a faint band of light known as the Milky Way

Geometry is a kind of mathematics that studies the size shapes and positions of things There are flat shapes and solid shapes in geometry Squares circles and triangles are some of the simplest shapes in flat geometry Cubes cylinders cones and spheres are simple shapes in solid geometry Geometry can be used to measure the area and perimeter of a flat shape It can also be used to measure a solid shapes volume and surface area

Geometry can be used to measure many things by seeing them as made of geometrical shapes For example geometry can help people find 

Geometry began as the art of measuring the shape of land so that it could be shared fairly between people It means to measure the land It has grown from this to become one of the most important parts of mathematics The Greek mathematician Euclid wrote the first book about geometry

Geometry starts with a few simple ideas that are thought to be true called axioms Such as

Graph theory is a field of mathematics about graphs A graph is an abstract representation of A number of points are connected by lines Each point is usually called a vertex and the lines are called edges Graphs are a tool for modelling relationships They are used to find answers to a number of problems

Some of these questions are

Leonhard Euler used to live in a city that was called Knigberg for some time The city is situated on the river Pregel There is an island in the river and there are a number of bridges across the river Euler loved to go for walks so he asked himself whether it was possible to do a walk use each of the bridges once and come back to the point where he started In 1736 he published a scientific article where he showed that this was not possible Today this problem is known as the Seven Bridges of Knigsberg The article is seen as the first paper in the history of graph theory 

This article as well as the one written by Vandermonde on the knight problem carried on with the analysis situs initiated by Leibniz Eulers formula was about the number of edges vertices and faces of a convex polyhedron was studied and generalized by Cauchy and LHuillier and is at the origin of topology

Over a century after Euler Cayley studied a special class of graphs called the trees A tree is a graph where there is only one path between two vertices Cayley tried to solve a problem from differential calculus His solution influenced the development of theoretical chemistry The technique he used mainly focused on listing all graphs which had certain properties Today this is called Enumerative graph theory It developed from Cayleys results a scientific publication done by Plya between 1935 and 1937 and the generalization of these by De Bruijn in 1959 Cayley linked his results on trees with the contemporary studies of chemical composition

The fusion of the ideas coming from mathematics with those coming from chemistry is at the origin of a part of the standard terminology of graph theory In particular the term graph was introduced by Sylvester in an article published in 1878 in Nature

One of the most famous and productive problems of graph theory is the four color problem Is it true that any map drawn in the plane may have its regions colored with four colors in such a way that any two regions having a common border have different colors This problem was first posed by Francis Guthrie in 1852 and its first written record is in a letter of De Morgan addressed to Hamilton the same year Many incorrect proofs have been proposed including those by Cayley Kempe and others The study and the generalization of this problem by Tait Heawood Ramsey and Hadwiger led to the study of the colorings of the graphs embedded on surfaces with arbitrary genus Taits reformulation generated a new class of problems the factorization problems particularly studied by Petersen and Knig The works of Ramsey on colorations and more specially the results obtained by Turn in 1941 was at the origin of another branch of graph theory extremal graph theory

The four color problem remained unsolved for more than a century A proof produced in 1976 by Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken which involved checking the properties of 1936 configurations by computer was not fully accepted at the time due to its complexity A simpler proof considering only 633 configurations was given twenty years later by Robertson Seymour Sanders and Thomas

The autonomous development of topology from 1860 and 1930 fertilized graph theory back through the works of Jordan Kuratowski and Whitney Another important factor of common development of graph theory and topology came from the use of the techniques of modern algebra The first example of such a use comes from the work of the physicist Gustav Kirchhoff who published in 1845 his Kirchhoffs circuit laws for calculating the voltage and current in electric circuits

Graph theory is an important part of mathematics and computer science To many such problems exact solutions do exist Many times however they are very hard to calculate Therefore very often approximations are used There are two kinds of such approximations Monte Carlo algorithms and Las Vegas algorithms

Graphs are normally represented by two different sets typically set a graph G would be represented as the collection of the sets V and E The set V is a discrete set containing all vertices of the graph The set E is a binary set whose pairwise elements are elements of set V Each pair in set E represents an edge connecting two vertices

If any two nodes have an edge between them then the graph is called the complete graph

History is the study of past events People know what happened in the past by looking at things from the past including records and artifacts Libraries archives and museums collect and keep these things for people to study history A person who studies history is called a historian A person who studies pre history and history through things left behind by ancient cultures is called an archaeologist A person who studies mankind and society is called an anthropologist The study of the sources and methods used to study and write history is called historiography

People can learn about the past by talking to people who remember things that happened in the past This is called oral history When people who had been slaves and American Civil War survivors got old some historians recorded everything that they said so that history would not be lost 

In old times people in different parts of the world kept separate histories because they did not meet each other very often Some groups of people never met each other Medieval Europe Ancient Rome and Ancient China each thought that they ruled the only important parts of the world and that other parts were barbarian

Current events modern economic history modern social history and modern intellectual history take very different views of the way history has affected the way that we think today

Health is a state of complete physical mental and social well being and not broken wikt linkmerelymerely the absence of disease or broken wikt linkinfirmityinfirmity according to the World Health Organization Physical is about the body Mental is about how people think and feel Social talks about how people live with other people It is about family work school and friends

Physical fitness refers to good body health and is the result of regular exercise proper diet and nutrition and proper rest for physical recovery A person who is physically fit will be able to walk or run without getting breathless and they will be able to carry out the activities of everyday living and not need help How much each person can do will depend on their age and whether they are a man or woman A physically fit person usually has a normal weight for their height The relation between their height and weight is called their Body Mass Index A taller person can be heavier and still be fit If a person is too heavy or too thin for their height it may affect their health 

Mental health refers to a persons emotional and psychological well being A state of emotional and psychological well being in which an individual is able to use his or her thinking and emotional abilities function in society and meet the ordinary demands of everyday life

One way to think about mental health is by looking at how well a person functions Feeling capable and efficient being able to handle normal levels of stress have good friends and family and lead an independent life and being able to bounce back or recover from hardships are all signs of mental health

Public Health refers to trying to stop a disease that is unhealthy to the community and does not help in long life or promote your health This is fixed by organized efforts and choices of society public and private clubs communities and individuals

It is about the health of many people or everybody rather than one person Public health stops instead of encouraging a disease through surveillance of cases To prevent being sick it is good to do healthy behaviors such as hand washing vaccination programs and using condoms When infectious diseases break out washing hands may be especially important

Harbour means to shelter or keep safe A harbor is a place where ships may shelter A port is also a harbour but is usually bigger The port will often contain a water space with wave breakers around the edge a number of quays or piers where the ships may be moored or tied up and a transport system for taking goods inland Often railway and road transport will be used Other ways that goods can be moved are pipeline transport and by using smaller ships on rivers

During the D Day operations of 1944 two broken wikt linkartificalartificial harbours were built just off the beaches where the invasion was going to happen

Hawaii is a US state of the United States It is the last state which joined the United States Hawaii became a state on August 21 1959 It is the only state made only of islands Hawaii is also the name of the largest island The capital and largest city of Hawaii is Honolulu on the island named Oahu

Hawaii is known as the Aloha State Aloha is a Hawaiian word that has many meanings like welcome hello and goodbye Aloha also means love and care The different meanings are brought together in the term Aloha Spirit to describe the friendly people of Hawaii

The state flower is the yellow hibiscus The state bird is the Hawaiian goose The state fish is the reef triggerfish also called the humu humu nuku nuku apuaa The state tree is the candlenut also called kukui The state song is Hawaii Ponoi The state motto is Ua mau ke ea o ka aina i ka pono In English it says The life of the land is perpetuated in righteousness

The first people of Hawaii were Polynesians They came to the islands sometime between 200 and 600 AD Captain James Cook is given credit for discovering the islands for the Europeans in 1778 Others may have been there before him Captain Cook named the islands the Sandwich Islands for the fourth Earl of Sandwich John Montague

Kamehameha I was the first king of Hawaii He united the separate small Hawaiian kingdoms into one large kingdom in 1795 In 1893 American soldiers stopped Queen Liliuokalani from leading Hawaii when American business people took over the government and made their own laws She was the last monarch of Hawaii She also wrote the original words of the song called Aloha Oe

The American business people made Hawaii into a republic for a short time The new leader Sanford Dole was called the President of Hawaii In 1898 the United States of America took over the government and made Hawaii into a territory In 1959 Hawaii became the fiftieth American state

Hawaii is an archipelago a long chain of islands There are eight main islands and many small islands and atolls They are the tops of underwater volcanos The main islands are Niihau Kauai Oahu Molokai Lanai Kahoolawe Maui and Hawaii

The biggest industry of Hawaii is tourism Almost 7 million people visited in 2000 Important exports are sugar pineapple macadamia nuts and coffee

Popular tourist sites include Waikiki Beach Hawaii Volcanoes National Park Polynesian Cultural Center and the USS Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor

 Honolulu is the capital city of the US state of Hawaii It is also the largest city in Hawaii and it has the most important harbor It is on the south east shore of the island of Oahu

Honolulu means sheltered harbor in the Hawaiian language No one knows for sure when Honolulu was first settled or when the name was first used 

Honolulu harbor was called Kulolia before foreigners came The first foreigner was Captain William Brown of the English ship Butterworth in 1794 He named the harbor Fair Haven Other foreign captains started calling it Browns Harbor The name Honolulu was used some time after that

Honolulu quickly became the most important harbor of Hawaii At that time sandalwood was a big export Honolulu was also an important supply point for whalers

Kamehameha III made Honolulu the capital city of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1850 It was also the capital of the Republic of Hawaii and the Territory of Hawaii It stayed the capital when Hawaii became a state in 1959

The Island of Hawaii is the largest of the US Hawaiian Islands and the southern The island is built from seven separate shield volcanoes that erupted more or less one at a time one partly covering the other The later volcanoes mostly buried two of the earlier ones These are Kohala Ninole Mauna Kea Hualalai Mauna Loa Kulani and Kilauea

The largest city on the island is Hilo Hilo is filled with historic buildings interesting shops parks and has a constant stream of performances festivals and events It is on the rainy east side of the island The city of Kailua Kona is on the dry west side of Hawaii and is popular with tourists

Called locally the Big Island its area is 4038 sq miles The widest part of the island is 93 miles across   

The Big Island makes up more than half of the total land area of the State of Hawaii and is governed under the County of Hawaii  

Hawaii Ponoi is the state song of Hawaii The words were written by King David Kalakaua the music by Prof Henry Berger the Royal Bandmaster Hawaii Ponoi was also the anthem of the Kingdom of Hawaii and the Territory of Hawaii

Most healing processes combine both ways of healing

The history of Australia begins with Aboriginal Australians who arrived here 60000 years ago The British came to Sydney in 1788 and started prison colonies Later those colonies became self governing democracies After a vote the colonies joined to become one nation called the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901

People have lived in Australia for about 40000 60000 years The first people who arrived in what is now Australia are called Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders We think Aboriginals came by boat from the islands of what is now Indonesia They lived in all parts of Australia Their lives were simple they had very few needs They lived by hunting fishing and gathering food They lived in bands and they spoke many different languages 

Aborigals invented tools like the boomerang and spear but did not farm Tradition was very important in their lives Their religion is called the Dreaming which has lots of stories about the creation of the world by spirits Aboriginal art started at least 30000 years ago and there are lots of Dreaming stories painted on walls and cut in rocks all around Australia Aboriginal music has songs about the Dreamtime sometimes with special instruments like the didgeridoo

In 1606 the first European Dutch explorer Willem Janszoon visited the west coast of Cape York Peninsula in Queensland A Spanish explorer Luis Vaez de Torres sailed through the water between Australia and Papua New Guinea later that year Other Europeans then began to map or visit the north and west coast  which they called New Holland This was dry and apparently uninhabitable land and they found no economic reasons to stay In 1642 Abel Tasman working for the Dutch East India Company reached Tasmania In 1688 William Dampier became the first Englishman to reach Australia But in 1770 a British sailor Captain James Cook found the fertile east coast of Australia He called it New South Wales and claimed it for Britain

The British decided to use the land visited by Captain Cook as a prison colony Britain needed a place to send its convicts because its gaols were full and it had just lost its American colonies in the American War of Independence In 1788 the British First Fleet of 11 ships carrying about 1500 people arrived at Sydney Arthur Phillip led them as the first Governor of New South Wales About 160 000 convicts were brought to Australia from 1788 until 1868 Free immigrants began arriving in the 1790s 

For the first few years they did not have much food and life was very hard But soon they began to farm and more people came Sydney grew and new towns were started Wool brought good money By 1822 many towns had been set up and people from the towns often visited Sydney for additional economic resources

Soon people from Sydney found other parts of Australia George Bass and Matthew Flinders sailed south to Tasmania and a colony was started at Hobart in 1803 Hamilton Hume and William Hovell went south from Sydney by land They found the Murray River and good land in Victoria Thomas Mitchell went inland and found more rivers In 1826 the first British military outpost was set up at King George Sound in Western Australia The Swan River Colony was started in 1829 with townsites at Fremantle and Perth In 1836 a free settler colony was started in South Australia where no convicts were ever sent Queensland became a separate colony in 1859 As the towns and farms spread across Australia the Aboriginal people were pushed off their land Some were killed and many died from illness and hunger Soon Australias Aborigines were outnumbered by Europeans and many were made to live on reserves

The goldrushes of New South Wales and Victoria started in 1851 leading to large numbers of people arriving to search for gold The population grew across south east Australia and made great wealth and industry By 1853 the goldrushes had made some poor people very rich

Convict transportation ended in the 1840s and 1850s and more changes came The people in Australia wanted to run their own country and not be told what to do from London The first governments in the colonies were run by Governors chosen by London Soon the settlers wanted local government and more democracy The New South Wales Legislative Council was created in 1825 to advise the Governor of New South Wales but it was not chosen by voters William Wentworth established the Australian Patriotic Association in 1835 to demand democratic government for New South Wales In 1840 the Adelaide City Council and the Sydney City Council were started and some people could vote for them Then Australias first parliamentary elections were held for the New South Wales Legislative Council in 1843 again with some limits on who could vote The Australian Colonies Government Act 1850 allowed constitutions for New South Wales Victoria South Australia and Tasmania In 1850 elections for legislative councils were also held in the colonies of Victoria South Australia and Tasmania 

In 1855 limited self government was granted by London to New South Wales Victoria South Australia and Tasmania An new secret ballot was introduced in Victoria Tasmania and South Australia in 1856 allowing people to vote in private This system was copied around the world In 1855 the right to vote was given to all men over 21 in South Australia The other colonies soon followed Women were given the vote in the Parliament of South Australia in 1895 and they became the first women in the world allowed to stand in elections In 1897 Catherine Helen Spence became the first female political candidate 

Australians had started parliamentary democracries all across the continent But voices were getting louder for all of them to come together as one country with a national parliament

Until 1901 Australia was not a nation it was six separate colonies governed by Britain This worked well when everybody was British and there were only a few people But now there were thousands of people and many of them had never been to Britain an eight month journey away by sea If people in one colony wanted to buy or sell things to people in another colony they had to ask permission 

They decided to join together to form one new country the Commonwealth of Australia This was called Federation and happened in 1901 But Australia was still part of the British Empire and still felt very close to Britain and the British Kings and Queens Australia soon had its own money and its own Army and Navy 

Because Australia was a very big country and was so close to Asia the Australians feared that people from Asia might take the country over So they passed a law that only people from Britain or other European countries could come to Australia This was called the White Australia policy It lasted for more than 60 years

In Australia at this time the trade unions were very strong and they started a political party the Australian Labor Party Australia passed many laws to help the workers but they only wanted British workers in Australia Australia was also one of the first places in the world where women could vote

In 1914 the First World War started in Europe Australia joined in on the side of Britain France and Russia against Germany Austria Hungary and Turkey Australian soldiers were sent to Gallipoli in Turkey They fought bravely but were beaten by the Turks Today Australia remembers this battle every year on ANZAC Day They also fought on the Western Front in France and Belgium Australia and its Allies won the war but more than 60000 Australians were killed 

Australia had a really hard time in the Great Depression of the 1930s then got worried about the coming Second World War In 1939 the war started when Nazi Germany invaded Poland Again Australia joined in to help Britain But in 1941 lots of Australian soldiers were captured in the Fall of Singapore when Japan attacked Then Japan started attacking Australia and Australians had to fight close to home for the first time Many people feared that Japan would invade Australia But with help from the United States the Japanese were stopped After the war Australia became a close friend of the United States

When the war ended Australia felt that it needed many more people to fill the country up and to work So the government said it would take in people in Europe who had lost their homes in the war It did things like build the Snowy Mountains Scheme Over the next 25 years millions of people came to Australia They came from Italy Greece Yugoslavia Poland and other countries in Europe Later they also came from countries like Turkey and Lebanon An important new party the Liberal Party of Australia was made by Robert Menzies in 1944 and it won lots of elections from 1949 until in 1972 then Gough Whitlam won for the Labor Party Whitlam made changes but he made the Senate unhappy and the Governor General sacked him and forced an election in 1975 Then Malcolm Fraser won a few elections for the Liberal Party

In the 1960s the White Australia Policy was ended Many people came to Australia from China Vietnam Malaysia and other countries in Asia Some Australians began to think of their country as being a part of Asia for the first time But other Australians did not like this and said that Australia should keep its European character Others thought Australian could be multicultural and accept all cultures

In the 1960s and 1970s Australia became one of the richest countries in the world because it could mine a lot of iron and other things from the ground and products like wool that other countries wanted to buy Australian traded with Britain then more and more with the United States and Japan Australia also supported the United States in wars against dictatorships in Korea and Vietnam and later Iraq Some Australians protested against these wars Australias democracy meant that both sides could say what they thought and did not have to fight if they did not want to Australian soldiers also helped the United Nations in countries like Cambodia Rwanda and East Timor 

In 1973 the famous Sydney Opera House opened In the 1970s 80s and 90s lots of Australian movies actors and singers became really famous around the world In the year 2000 Sydney had the Summer Olympics Australians like sports and have won lots of world cups in things like rugby union rugby league netball and cricket 

In the 1980s and 90s the Labor Party under Bob Hawke and Paul Keating then the Liberal Party under John Howard made lots of changes to the economy Australia had a bad recession in 1991 but but when other Western countries had trouble with their economies in 2008 Australia stayed pretty strong 

Today Australia is a rich peaceful and democratic country But it still has problems Some people are still poor mainly those who do not have jobs or whose farms do not make enough money A lot of land in Australia has been returned to Aboriginal people but in some places Aboriginal people want to get back control of land where other Australians are living which is hard to deal with Australians do not always agree about what to do about this But most Australian live in cities where this is not a problem 

Every year the government chooses a big number of new people from all around the world to come as immigrants to live in Australia These people may come because they want to do business or to live in a democracy to join their family or because they are refugees All the main leaders think this is a good idea and so Australia took 65 million immigrants in the 60 years after World War Two including around 660000 refugees But  some people who say they are refugees want to come to Australia by boat without asking the government first They travel in very dangerous boats organised by people smugglers and lots of people have drowned on the way Many Australians disagree on what to do with these types of immigrants  some want to let them stay and live in Australia others do not want to let them in and others are worried that more people will drown if the government just lets smugglers organise things

Julia Gillard became the first woman Prime Minister of Australia in 2010 when she replaced her colleague Kevin Rudd of the Australian Labor Party

Spain is a country in Europe 

People have lived on the Iberian Peninsula for about 500000 years Neanderthal man came about 200000 years ago Modern humans first came about 40000 years 

The Roman Empire controlled Spain for three hundred years then people from Eastern Europe called Visigoths fought for Spain and won it from the Romans They were Christians and they controlled Spain for over two hundred years

9th century The Visigoths converted from Arian Christianity to Roman Catholics The land was won after a war by Muslims who were Arab and Berber Roman Catholics from Europe eventually decided to fight to take Spain from the Muslims They fought wars for many hundreds of years some of which were Crusades against other Christians like the Cathars These were very cruel wars 

In the year 1492 they took the last part of Spain that had belonged to the Moors Boabdil the last Moorish Leader of Granada gave the city to King Ferdinand of Aragon on 2 January 1492 and Christians now ruled all of Spain

Before this several different kings had ruled different countries in what is now called Spain Two of these countries Castile and Aragon came together when the king of Aragon Ferdinand II married the queen of Castile Isabella

In the same year 1492 they decided to send Christopher Columbus to explore the Atlantic Ocean Columbus found a land there that the people of Europe did not yet know These were the islands of the Caribbean Sea

Columbus and other sailors explored more and found that there were two continents there  North America and South America Spain sent many soldiers and businessmen to North and South America and they took over very large parts of those two continents Owning this empire made Spain very rich But when they conquered that empire they killed millions of the Native Americans who had lived there before Spain owned this empire for more than three hundred years

Meanwhile at home the Muslim manuscripts had been either burnt or spread to other countries Jews had been expelled from Spain The multicultural society was destroyed and so was the learning Among the few things kept and respected in Spain were in music harmony and stringed instruments and of course the buildings many of which became churches by adding crosses

The Spanish Empire was the strongest in the world through most of the next two centuries thanks to gold from the Americas This new gold made rulers and colonial governors rich Meanwhile others savings became worth less due to inflation Spain became a society of very rich and very poor Some of the poorest went to the new colonies in the Caribbean Central America and South America mostly to find gold

Native American peoples were killed by diseases brought by the Spaniards but most Spaniards did not know this They found damaged and dying societies with people who had lost some of their most important leaders and thinkers The Spaniards thought this meant they were inferior and used this as an excuse to enslave the natives Millions of natives died mining gold for the Spanish

The Spanish Empire also at this time funded the Spanish Inquisition which tortured and killed anyone who disagreed with the Roman Catholic Church The Reformation which created Protestant sects in Europe was not allowed into Spain it was kept out and as with Jews or Muslims its believers were killed

The nobles of Spain no longer had to fight anyone since the internal feuds were over No one could challenge their power In many ways it was held together as a reign of terror People who challenged them were often called heretics so that the Inquisition could torture them and then nobles take the property

For ordinary people on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean life got worse A few rulers got rich Today we would say that these people were guilty of war crimes genocide and crimes against humanity Many Church people who had the power to speak out at that time did so and they said many of the same things as we would say today But none of this mattered much to the rulers

The great satire Don Quixote was written about this time

In the 18th century there was doubt over who should become king of Spain this doubt led many of the kings of Europe to fight to become king of Spain This was called the War of the Spanish Succession 

France occupied Spain for a long time This made Spain very weak It also made Spain lose its empire in North and South America all of the parts of that empire became their own countries or were taken over by other countries such as the United States of America

There was not much peace in Spain during the first part of the 20th century Some Spaniards tried to set up a government chosen by the people and they made the King of Spain leave the country However in 1936 two different groups of Spaniards went to war over whether the government should be a democracy or take orders from one person In 1939 those who wanted democracy were defeated and a dictator named Francisco Franco took over the government

Height is the distance between the lowest end and highest end of an object

For example people consider the bottom of the foot a persons lowest end and the top of the head a persons highest end The distance between my lowest end the bottom of my foot and my highest end the top of my head measures out to 64 inches so my height measures out to 64 inches too My height is 64 inches

A historian is someone who studies history Historians study the passage of time and the events that happen within that passage

Human death is the end of the life of a person All biological functions stop The usual signal for the end of life is that the heart stops beating and cannot be restarted There may be many reasons which cause this A person close to death is said to be dying

Finding the cause of death is a medical speciality called pathology Explaining death is in one sense simple All living things have a limited lifespan Humans are no different from any other lifeform Our bodies have an ability for self repair but that ability is limited

About 150000 people die every day around the world About two thirds of these people die because of reasons related with age

Death happens to every known life form and is defined as the cessation of the mind senses and biological function of the living thing In addition to the physical body some believe humans also have a soul and believe that the soul can continue without a body move into another body or cease to exist Annihilationism Religions have different beliefs about this issue

The medical view of the body is that it is an animal body and in some ways like a machine This is a powerful way to think because it lets it be diagnosed and sometimes cured

When human killing is the cause of a human death usually family members or friends or the state seek what can be called revenge or harms reduction by locking up or killing the human killer Also when animals kill humans they too are almost always caught and killed It is considered a very bad thing to let animals taste human flesh or to have the experience of killing one

In any society human death is surrounded by ritual  a wake or funeral is normal In some places it was common to eat the dead in a form of ritual cannibalism But this is no longer common in part because disease like kuru can be passed this way Human dead bodies are taboo in most societies and must be handled in special ways  for a combination of religious and hygiene reasons A human dead body must always be reported in law to be sure it is disposed of properly

There are always some consequences or requirements for dealing with a human death

Hiding a human death is considered very bad  almost as bad as homicide itself One of the reasons Slobodan Milosevic and Saddam Hussein are said to have committed crimes against humanity is mass graves that were found in Bosnia and Iraq which contained many people who opposed them Today some people continue to deny that Adolf Hitler killed millions of Jews gypsies homosexuals and political opponents in his death camps during World War II  this phenomenon is called Holocaust denial Cover ups are frequent in the mafia and other organized crime

Probably the worst cases of mass death in living memory are the Rwanda genocide and The Killing Fields of Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge each of killed approximately half of the population

Finding the cause of any human death and stopping a similar death from happening to someone else are the main reasons people look into human morbidity or let dead bodies be cut open and looked at in an autopsy Some religions do not allow autopsies because they feel the body is holy Autopsies are usually required by the state if someone dies and people do not know why The autopsy helps find out if someone killed the person on purpose or tried to hurt them or if they died from a sickness

To prepare for their own death humans can write a last will and testament to be clear about who gets their property A person will sometimes also volunteer to be an organ donor This might mean giving the whole body to medical research It can also save the lives of others by making organ transplants possible

Ancient rulers sometimes did insist not only that their own bodies and much property but even their servants and relatives be destroyed at their funeral In India this ritual still does sometimes occur Old women sometimes carry guns in case their husbands relatives come to throw them on the funeral fire

Christianity has a special focus on death because of the state killing of Jesus Christ by the Romans In Islam this is thought to demonstrate the injustice of human systems of dealing out death and the ability of the best people to overcome it and even forgive it In Christianity itself it is thought to prove that Jesus himself was really God and so could lose his body to show something and still have power In Buddhism every being is thought to have this power and reincarnation will occur until the being reaches enlightenment and can escape the wheel of life to reach Nirvana Reincarnation is an idea taken from Hinduism

Confucianism advises filial piety and forms of ancestor worship to respect both dead and living ancestors who created your body and taught you ethics

Every ethical tradition including the medical view of the body has some ritual surrounding death Often these excuse behaviours that might be hated if they did not have the ritual For instance one may say that organ transplant is like cannibalism

Very much of what happens at a human death is ritual People who wish theirs to be dealt with a certain way and who wish a particular treatment like cremation of their body should decide in advance and set up the necessary payments and agreements This makes it much easier for their family after they die since there is no longer the ability to clearly communicate the wish

For the same reason saying goodbye is important Most of the stress of death seems to come for loved ones who did not have a chance to say goodbye

Maybe it is to relieve this stress that rituals are created and to bring together those that knew someone so that the personal experience a person can no longer communicate for themselves can be exchanged by others

Some ritual such as seances claim to allow people to speak to the dead This is not claimed to be very reliable both by scientists and even by those who do them very often

Aside from wills goodbyes organ donations and funerals there is important personal experience to decide to pass on or not when someone knows they may soon die Palliative care focuses on basic decisions people make when they are very close to the end of their lives and it ensures someone is always available to talk to them It is a replacement for heroic medical intervention that may keep them physically alive but with no quality of life Human psychology must prepare for death if it is anything other than a quick surprise

Elizabeth Kubler Ross wrote that there were several stages in dying of which denial was the first and acceptance was the last Recording ones life is often something people with acceptance will do to leave a memoir or a full autobiography

Because events leave living memory and may only be part of oral tradition there are projects to record everything that people remember about World War I and the Shoah The first of these was to record everything remembered about the US Civil War This discipline has changed history since we have so many more first person accounts of the times and made social history much more standard

The human body is the body of a person It is the physical structure of a person 

The body is a thing that can be hurt or killed Its functions are stopped by death

Some people study the human body They look at where it is different from or the same as other animals bodies These animals can be alive today Or they can be extinct animals like other hominids Some people study how the human body works and lives in its environment Some people study what people think about their body Artists study how to draw or paint the human bodyit has many senses which can let him feel pain or other things

Many different fields of study look at the human

Scientists think that the human body is very much like other animals They see that some human behaviors are like animal behaviors They know that 98 of the DNA in humans is the same as other primates

The animal that is alive now that is closest to humans is the chimpanzee 984 of the DNA is the same between humans and chimpanzees However this applies only to single nucleotide polymorphisms that is changes in single base pairs only The full picture is rather different

The draft sequence of the common chimpanzee genome was published in 2005 It showed that the regions which are similar enough to be aligned with one another account for 2400 million of the human genomes 31647 million bases that is 758 of the genome 

This 758 of the human genome is 123 different from the chimpanzee genome in single nucleotide polymorphisms Another type of difference called indels account for another 3 difference between the alignable sequences In addition variation in copy number of large segments of similar DNA sequence provides a further 27 difference between the two species Hence the total similarity of the genomes could be as low as about 70

Hydrogen is a chemical element Its atomic number is 1 which makes it the simplest known element in the entire universe 

In its pure form on Earth hydrogen is usually a gas Hydrogen is also a part of water However a water molecule is actually made of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom connected together Hydrogen is important because it is the fuel that powers the Sun and other stars Hydrogen takes up about 75 of the entire Universe Hydrogens symbol on the Periodic Table of Elements is H

Pure hydrogen is normally made of two hydrogen atoms connected together Scientists call these diatomic molecules Hydrogen will have a chemical reaction when mixed with most other elements It has no color or smell 

Pure hydrogen is very uncommon in the Earths atmosphere In nature it is usually in water Hydrogen is also in all living things as a part of the organic compounds that living things are made of In addition hydrogen atoms can combine with carbon atoms to form hydrocarbons Petroleum and other fossil fuels are made of these hydrocarbons and commonly used to create energy for human use

Hydrogen has two different isotopes which are heavier types of the Hydrogen atom they are called deuterium and tritium These other types of Hydrogen are important in nuclear energy

Some other facts about hydrogen

The name hydrogen comes from the Greek word for water 

Hydrogen was discovered in 1671 by Robert Boyle even though many people think it was discovered by Henry Cavendish in 1776

Scientists believe atoms are made of protons neutrons and electrons From a physics point of view hydrogen has one proton and its variants deuterium and tritium also have neutrons

Nuclear fusion is a very powerful source of energy It relies on forcing atoms together to make helium and energy exactly as happens in a star like the Sun or in a hydrogen bomb This needs a large amount of energy to get started and is not easy to do yet A big advantage over nuclear fission which is used in nuclear power stations is that no waste is produced and no toxic fuel like uranium is needed There is a lot of deuterium in seawater There is more than 600 million tons of hydrogen undergoing fusion every second on the sun

1 Water can be easily broken down into hydrogen and oxygen with electricity but it takes a lot of electricity to get a usable amount of hydrogen

2 Burning hydrogen combines with oxygen molecules to make steam

3 A fuel cell combines hydrogen with an oxygen molecule releasing an electron as electricity

For these reasons many people believe hydrogen power will eventually replace technologies such as diesel electric engines and biodiesel fuel

But it is not correct to see hydrogen as a fuel if it is used in a fuel cell It is more of a replacement for the power grid Such a grid and infrastructure with new vehicles might be first made in Iceland a country that has much free geothermal energy and is quite small Because it imports all fossil fuel it would help Iceland to completely stop using it The huge advantage of hydrogen is that when burnt in an engine or in a fuel cell there is no pollution  just a small amount of water 

If we did move to a hydrogen economy where could the hydrogen come from Well there are many places  it can be extracted from water It can be extracted from various types of plant material  corn is possible though pretty inefficient Generally it is probably better to refine such material into a more conventional fuel like ethanol

Helium is a chemical element It has the chemical symbol He and atomic number 2 

Helium is called a noble gas because it does not regularly mix with other chemicals and form new compounds It has the lowest boiling point of all the elements It is the second most common element in the universe after hydrogen and has no color or smell However Helium has a blue ish neon color when being burnt with fire Helium does not usually react with anything else However it can react with tungsten iodine fluorine sulfur and phosphorus under very special conditions Astronomers found helium in 1868 They found that it was in the Sun before it was found on Earth Because of where it was found its name comes from the Greek word for Sun helios

It is used to fill balloons and airships because it is lighter than air and does not burn or react meaning it is normally safe for using it in that way It is also used in some kinds of light bulbs People also breathe it in to make their voices sound higher than they normally do as a joke but this is extremely dangerous if they breathe in too much since it can kill them because they are not breathing normal air Breathing too much helium can also cause long term effects to vocal cords

It can be created through the process of nuclear fusion in the sun During this process four Hydrogen atoms are fused together to form one Helium atom

The home page of a web site is the document that a web server sends to another computers web browser application when it has been contacted without a request for specific information That is when you enter only a domain name in the Address box without specifying a directory or a file the home page is usually the first part of the web site you will be taken to The Home Page is also called the Main Page 

A properly written home page will tell a user about the information available in the web site and how to view different parts of the web site

The home page of simplewikipediaorg can be found at this link 

Home Page was a popular computer application used for composing web pages

In Linux based servers the homepage usually is indexhtml indexphp indexcgi etc Unless the website administrator has created a redirect to a specific webpage

However in Windows based servers the homepage is defaulthtml defaultphp etc This is a problem for website administrators to install website applications like MediaWiki Mainly because most website applications are created with the homepage as indexphp

Humans and some other animals have lost much of their hair through evolution and some other mammals such as the elephant and the whale have almost none at all

Hair can have different functions

Some animals for example certain insects and spiders also have hairs However these are not hair in the biological sense but are actually bristles The hairs found on certain plants are also not true hair but Trichomes

In humans hair grows mostly on the head and the amount of body hair is different from race to race Asians and native North Americans have the least amount of body hair while Caucasians tend to have the most 

Hair color is passed down by parents only Natural hair color can be given only by genes It is impossible to have a hair color that is not passed down genetically by both mother and father This relies on dominant and recessive genes carried by a parent These genes may not be the color of their hair however many people carry genes that are recessive and do not show in their traits or features

Dyeing hair is to change the color of hair It consists of a chemical mixture which can change the color of hair by a chemical reaction Many people dye their hair to hide gray or white hairs This is because most people gain white or gray hairs as they grow older

Two types of melanin pigment give hair its color eumelanin and pheomelanin Pheomelanin colors hair red Eumelanin determines the darkness of the hair color A low concentration of brown eumelanin results in blond hair but more brown eumelanin will color the hair brown High amounts of black eumelanin result in black hair while low concentrations give gray hair All humans have some pheomelanin in their hair

The genetics of hair colors are not yet firmly established According to one theory at least two gene pairs control human hair color

One phenotype has a dominant brown allele and a recessive blond allele A person with a brown allele will have brown hair a person with no brown alleles will be blond This explains why two brown haired parents can produce a blond haired child

The other gene pair is a non redred pair where the not red allele is dominant and the allele for red hair is recessive A person with two copies of the red haired allele will have red hair but it will be either auburn or bright reddish orange depending on whether the first gene pair gives brown or blond hair respectively

The two gene model does not account for all possible shades of brown blond or red nor does it explain why hair color sometimes darkens as a person ages Several other gene pairs control the light versus dark hair color in a cumulative effect

Hair texture is also inherited genetically The thickness of hair its color and its tendency to curl are all inherited There are also genetic differences between men and women Body hair is limited in women and thicker in men 

Men often lose some of their hair as they grow older This is known as baldness Doctors call it male pattern baldness because hairs often fall out in similar places It often begins by hair falling out first from the front of the head and then from the top of the head After a while all that may be left is a some hair running above the ears and around the lower back of the head Even though it is unusual for women to go bald many women suffer from thinning hair over the top of their head as they grow old

People have tried to find cures for hair loss for thousands of years In an effort to get their hair back men have tried cures like applying strange lotions or even having their heads packed in chicken manurefactdateApril 2009 Many unproven cures are still marketed today It is only in the last decade or so that treatments have been developed which do sometimes work Some doctors do hair transplants where they take tiny plugs of hair from areas like the back of the neck and plant them in the bald spots on the head Some drugs have been tested and approved for sale as hair loss treatments They encourage hair regrowth and thickening but work better if applied before hair loss turns to baldness

This article is about the island of Ireland For the country of Ireland see Republic of Ireland For other uses see Ireland

Ireland is an island in Europe To the west of Ireland is the Atlantic Ocean to the east of Ireland across the Irish Sea is the island of Great Britain

The island of Ireland also called ire when speaking in the Irish language is about 302 miles long and about 179 mi wide About 65 million people live on the island Around four and a half million live in the Republic and the remaining two million in the North

The River Shannon which runs from north to south is the longest river on the island Ireland has many lakes Lough Neagh in Northern Ireland is the largest lake in Ireland Ireland is known for its beautiful landscapes music history and mythology 

Today the island of Ireland is split between two European countries

More than one million people live in Dublin 16 of Irelands population lives there Many people live in the eastern coast of both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland as well because of better agricultural land and trade links with Great Britain and the rest of Europe

The city of Belfast is the capital of Northern Ireland It has 483000 in the Belfast urban area and 267000 in the Belfast city itself Shipbuilding has long been a major industry here

All of Ireland was ruled by Britain starting in the 1600s Because the British ruled the island the English language became known throughout the island In the 1921 the south and west of Ireland became semi independent of the United Kingdom and was called the Irish Free State but Northern Ireland remained part of Britain In 1937 the Irish people changed the name of their country from the Irish Free State to just Ireland In 1948 Ireland decided that it would become a republic and not a part of the the United Kingdom

Many Irish people have left Ireland and moved to the United States Canada Australia and South America major The famine in the 1840s was an early reason to leave Most people depended on potatoes for food because cattle and sheep were sent to England to pay rents When a fungus disease killed most of the potato crop British Corn Laws meant that cheap cereals could not be imported to replace it It is estimated almost a million people died of starvation

Today 6 million people live in Ireland and almost 80 million people around the world are descended from Irish immigrants 

The Internet is a large group of computers that are connected to each other The Internet is used to send information quickly between computers around the world It has millions of smaller domestic academic business and government networks and websites which together carry many different kinds of information and services So in other words the Internet is a network of networks

The Internet was created in the United States by the United States Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency It was first connected in October 1969 The World Wide Web was created at CERN in Switzerland in 1989 by a British man named Tim Berners Lee

Today people can pay money to access the Internet from Internet Service Providers Some services on the Internet cost nothing to use Sometimes the people who offer these free services use advertising to make money from them The alternative name Net came from Inter

The Internet is used for many things such as electronic mail online chat file transfer and the interlinked web pages and other documents of the World Wide Web

The most used service on the Internet is the World Wide Web The Web contains websites blogs and also wikis like Wikipedia Webpages on the Web can be seen and read by anyone

The second major use of the Internet is to send and receive e mail E mail is private and goes from one user to another Instant messaging is similar to email but allows two or more people to chat to each other much faster

Some governments think the Internet is a bad thing and block all or part of it For example the Chinese government thinks that Wikipedia is bad Many times no one in China can read it or add to it Some parents block parts of the Internet they think are bad for children to see Well known examples of the whole Internet being blocked are in North Korea and Myanmar

The Internet can also be a dangerous place Information people put on the Internet is not always checked and some may be not true Some may even be harmful Also if someone sends information through the internet sometimes other people can read it even when they are not supposed to For example Facebook has had some problems with privacy settings A person can post information on a website but this is often a bad idea unless the person is very sure what you are doing A good way to check for a secure website is to make sure the url starts with https instead of http this means it is a secure site

Italy is a country in Southern Europe and a member of the European Union Its official name is Repubblica Italiana Italy is a democratic republic and is a founding member of the European Union

Italy is also a member of the G8 as it has the 8th largest Gross Domestic Product in the world Its President is Giorgio Napolitano and its Prime Minister is Mario Monti Before 1861 it was made up of smaller kingdoms and city states

Italy is a peninsula meaning it is surrounded by the sea on all sides apart from one Northern Italy is separated from France Switzerland and Austria by the Alps a chain of mountains Mont Blanc the highest mountain in western Europe belongs to this chain The second important chain of mountains in Italy is the Apennines which are in central and southern Italy

The capital of Italy is Rome Other cities in Italy are Milan Turin Florence Naples and Venice The country has a number of islands the biggest of which are Sicily and Sardinia which are reached by ship or aircraft

The Po River is the longest river in Italy The Tiber River runs through the city of Rome

Northern Italy has some of the biggest lakes in the country such as Lake Garda Lake Como Lake Maggiore and Lake Iseo Because it is surrounded by the sea Italy has many kilometers of coast which brings tourists from all over the world Tourists also come to see Italys many historical places

Two very small countries are located within Italy They are San Marino which is surrounded by part of Northern Italy and the Vatican City which is inside Rome

People from Italy are called Italians Nearly all the Italians are Christian and most of these are Roman Catholics

The population of Italy is a little over 60 million About 27 million of them live in Rome and 13 million in Milan

The official language of Italy is Italian and in some small areas German Slovenian or French People also speak languages such as Sicilian and Sardinian which are very similar to Italian but are different dialects of Italian

The people of Italy are partly descendant of the ancient Romans

Italy is home to more World Heritage Sites than any other nation in the world These sites are culturally important and value according to UNESCO About 60 of the works of art of the world are in Italy Italy is also a big wine producer In 2005 it made over 5 million tonnes

The Italy has an top modern social welfare but it has been created by loaned money The labor market enjoys relative strong labor force and the labor market is filled of foreigners coming from especially Romania to work in Italy where the wages are much higher But it could have been much more workers on the labor market because men and women already retires in the age of 57 and the unemployment rate is relative hight by 82 per cent And the Italys modern society has been built up by loans and now the country has an catastrophic high debt of 1900 or 120 per cent of the countrys total GDP And the government cant pay back the loans during the time period the EU wish

Religion is a very big part of life in Italy

Most people in Italy are Roman Catholics but the Catholic Church is no longer officially the state religion 878 of the people said they were Roman Catholic Only about a third said they were active members There are also other Christian groups in Italy more than 700000 Eastern Orthodox Christians 180000 of them belong to the Greek Orthodox Church

550000 are Pentecostals and Evangelicals 235685 Jehovahs Witnesses 30000 Waldensians 25000 Seventh day Adventists 22000 Mormons 20000 Baptists 7000 Lutherans 4000 Methodists The countrys oldest religious minority is the Jewish community It has roughly 45000 people It is no longer the largest non Christian group About 825000 Muslims live in Italy Most of them immigrated Only 50000 are Italian citizens In addition there are 50000 Buddhists 70000 Sikh and 70000 Hindus in Italy

Italy is divided into 20 Regions and every Region is divided into Provinces

There are 20 Regions 5 of them have a special status they are called autonomous This means that they can make certain local laws more easily These regions are marked with an asterisk below 

The Head of State is Giorgio Napolitano whose task began in May 2006 and will end in May 2013 Napolitano is the eleventh President of the Italian Republic and he was preceded by Carlo Azeglio Ciampi The first president was Enrico De Nicola

The Head of Government is Mario Monti leader of a right wing coalition since 2008 when he won against the left wing coalition of Walter Veltroni

Italy was one of the first members of the European Union and in 2002 along with 11 other European countries it changed to using the euro as its official currency Before this the Italian lira had been used from 1861

Anyone who wants to be President of Italy must have Italian citizenship be at least 50 years old and must be able to hold political and civil rights

Before 1861 Italy was not a state The area was made of a group of independent states ruled by other countries In the 1850s the Earl of Cavour was the Head of Government of the State of Sardinia He talked to the Austrians in Lombardy and Veneto and said they should create a Northern Italian state This happened but other Central and Southern Italian states also joined Piedmont to create a bigger state

In 1860 Giuseppe Garibaldi took control of Sicily creating the Kingdom of Italy in 1861 Vittorio Emanuele II was made the King But in 1861 Latium and Veneto were still not part of Italy because they were ruled by the Pope and Austrian Empire

Veneto was made part of Italy in 1866 after a war with Austria and Italian soldiers won Latium in 1870 That was when they took away the Popes power The Pope who was angry said that he was a prisoner to keep Catholic people from being active in politics That year Italy finally came back together

Italy participated in World War I as an ally of Great Britain France and Russia against the Central Powers Almost all of Italys fighting was on the Eastern border near Austria After the Caporetto defeat Italy thought they would lose the war But in 1918 the Central Powers surrendered and Italy gained the Trentino South Tyrol which once was owned by Austria

In 1922 a new Italian government started and it was ruled by Benito Mussolini the leader of Fascism in Italy He became Head of Government and dictator calling himself duce  which means leader in Italian He became friends with German dictator Hitler and Mussolini followed him into World War II Italy entered the war in 1940 as an ally of Germany and Japan against France Great Britain and Russia During the war Italy controlled most of the Mediterranean Sea

On July 25 1943 Mussolini was removed by the Great Council of Fascism and on September 8 1943 Badoglio said that the war as an ally of Germany was ended Italy started fighting as an ally of France and the UK but Italian soldiers did not know who to shoot In Northern Italy a movement called Resistenza started to fight against the German invaders 

Mussolini tried to make another Northern Italian fascist state the Republic of Sal but it failed On April 25 1945 Italy became free The state became a republic on June 2 1946 and for the first time women were able to vote Italian people ended the Savoia dynasty and adopted a republic government

In February 1947 Italy signed a peace treaty with the Allies losing all the colonies and some territorial areas

Since then Italy has joined NATO and the European Community becoming one of the seven biggest industrial economies in the world

The railway network in Italy totals 16627 kilometres the 17th longest in the world High speed trains include ETR class trains which travel at 300 kmh

If is a word to describe a statement where one thing depends on something else 

For example

   If is a poem written by Rudyard Kipling It appeared in the Brother Square Toes chapter of Kiplings book Rewards and Fairies In a 1995 BBC opinion poll it was voted Britains favourite poem It is arguably Kiplings most famous poem

An island is a piece of ground that is surrounded by water Water is all around an island Islands are smaller than continents

The largest island in the world is Greenland unless Australia is believed to be an island 

Some islands are their own countries Examples of islands that are their own countries include Cuba Iceland and Madagascar There are many others Other islands have more than one country such as Borneo and Hispaniola

Interim means in between or transitional or temporary

An idiom is a word or phrase which means something different from what it says  it is usually a metaphor Idioms are common phrases or terms whose meanings are not literal but are figurative and only known through their common uses

Because idioms can mean something different from what the words mean it is difficult for someone not very good at speaking the language to use them properly Some idioms are only used by some groups of people or at certain times The idiom shape up or ship out which is like saying improve your behavior or leave if you dont might be said by an employer or supervisor to an employee but not to other people

Idioms are not the same thing as slang Idioms are made of normal words that have a special meaning known by almost everyone Slang is usually special words that are known only by a particular group

To learn a language a person needs to learn the words in that language and how and when to use them But people also need to learn idioms separately because certain words together or at certain times can have different meanings In order to understand an idiom one sometimes needs to know the culture the idiom comes from

To know the history of an idiom can be useful and interesting but is not necessary to be able to use the idiom properly For example most native British English speakers know that No room to swing a cat means there was not a lot of space and can use the idiom properly but few know it is because 200 years ago sailors were punished by being whipped with a whip called a cat onine tails A big space was cleared on the ship so that the person doing the whipping had a lot of room to swing the cat

A better understanding of an idiom is that it is a phrase whose meaning cannot be understood from the dictionary definitions of each word taken separately In this case a metaphor is not an idiom The meaning of the saying run like the wind can be understood by looking the words up in a dictionary and using some common sense and imagination and the context of the phrase 

The International English Language Testing System tests how good you are at the English language People who take the test take the Academic Module or the General Training Module The academic one is for people who want to go to university The general one is for people who want to do other training or want to get work experience People who want to emigrate to a country that uses English also take the general one

Most universities in Australia Britain Canada New Zealand and the United States accept the IELTS Many professional companies do as well

Ink is a liquid that we use to write draw print or make marks The word ink is from Latin and means colored water Ink is used in pens in some computer printers and in printing presses In some countries people write by using ink and brushes People usually write or print using black ink but ink can be any color The first ink was used in Egypt about 2600 BC

A disadvantage of many kinds of ink is that they may smudge when wet spoiling the picture or writing 

The first inks were carbon inks made from soot which is 80 carbon Later in Europe people used iron gall ink This is the kind of ink Johann Sebastian Bach and Leonardo da Vinci used

Ink in a ball point pen is held in a thin long cylinder inside the pen The ink does not fall out of the cylinder as it sticks to the sides of the tube

The word Indian means from or about the country of the modern Republic of India or Bharat It refers to a person from India Many different languages are used in India so there is no language called Indian Some languages of India are Gujarati Hindi Urdu Sanskrit Bengali Kannada Tamil and Telugu

The word Indian is also sometimes used for the people who were in North America Central America South America and the islands of the Caribbean Sea when the Europeans first came there The Europeans made a mistake and thought they were going to India so they called the people Indians 

Other names for these people are American Indians First Nations and Native Americans

The inch is the basic unit of length or distance in the English system A mans thumb is about an inch wide

The abbreviation for inch is in or 

In Britain and the United States people use inches more than they use millimetres or centimetres Also road signs for speed limits are in miles per hour other US customary units or Imperial units of measurement are also in common use

In the rest of the world metric units are almost always used The inch is not used by scientists

The pint is the name of a unit of liquid measurement in some countries The pint is the same as frac8 of a gallon Because the imperial system and the American system use different gallons their pints are different also

The imperial pint is still used to measure amounts of beer in the countries of the old British Empire and milk for the United Kingdom It is usually not used today for anything else It is divided into 20 fluid ounces 

The United States is the only other country to use pints In the American system there are two different pints There is a wet pint and a dry pint Six US wet pints are about five imperial pints The US wet pint is divided into 16 fluid ounces

The word Italian may mean

Many dynasties ruled India around the year 1000 Some of these were the Mughal Vijayanagara and the Maratha empires In the 1600s European countries invaded India and the British controlled most of India by 1856

In the early 1900s millions of people peacefully started to protest One of the people who were leading the freedom movement was Mahatma Gandhi who only used peaceful tactics including a way called ahimsa which means non violence On 15 August 1947 India peacefully became free and independent from the British Empire Indias constitution was founded on 26 January 1950 The first official leader of India was Jawaharlal Nehru

After 1947 India has become a powerful country It is one of the nations that founded the Non Aligned Movement and the United Nations It has fought many wars since independence from Britain including the ones in 1947 1962 1965 1971 1984 and 1999 with Pakistan It also fought a war to capture Goa a Portuguese built port and city which was not a part of India until 1962 India fought a famous battle with the Portuguese who were ruling over a small part of Indian region and were not ready to hand over that part to India India first told Portugal which was ruled by a dictator that time to peacefully hand over the Indian region that it was holding But the Portuguese refused and so India had to use force and the Portuguese were defeated India has also done nuclear tests in 1974 and 1998 and it is one of the few countries that has nuclear bombs Since 1991 India has been one of the fastest growing economies in the world

India is the largest democracy in the world Its government is divided into three branches the Legislative the Executive and the Judiciary

The Legislative branch is made up of the Parliament of India which is located in New Delhi the capital of India The Parliament of India is divided into two groups the upper house Rajya Sabha and the lower house Lok Sabha The Rajya Sabha has 250 members and the Lok Sabha has 545 members

The Executive branch is made up of the President Vice President Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers The President of India is elected for five years The President can choose the Prime Minister who has most of the power The Council of Ministers such as the Minister of Defence help the Prime Minister

The Judicial branch is made up of the courts of India including the Supreme Court The Chief Justice of India is the head of the Supreme Court Supreme Court members have the power to stop a law being passed by Parliament if they think that the law is illegal and contradicts the Constitution of India In India there are also 21 High Courts

India is the seventh largest country in the world It is the main part of the Indian subcontinent The countries next to India are Pakistan Bangladesh Myanmar China Bhutan and Nepal It is also near Sri Lanka an island country 

India is a peninsula which means that it is surrounded on three sides by water In the west is the Arabian Sea in the south is the Indian Ocean and in the east is the Bay of Bengal The northern part of India has many mountains The most famous mountain range in India is the Himalayas which have some of the tallest mountains in the world There are many rivers in India The main rivers are the Ganges the Brahmaputra the Yamuna the Godavari the Kaveri the Narmada and the Krishna 

India has different climates In the South the climate is mainly tropical which means it can get very hot in summer and cool in winter The northern part though has a cooler climate called sub tropical and even alpine in mountainous regions The Himalayas in the alpine climate region can get extremely cold There is very heavy rainfall along the west coast and in the Eastern Himalayan foothills The west though is drier Because of some of the deserts of India all of India gets rain for four months of the year That time is called the monsoon That is so because the deserts attract water filled winds from the Indian Ocean which give rain when they come into India When the monsoon rains come late or not so heavily droughts are possible

For administration purposes India has been divided into smaller pieces Most of these pieces are called states some are called union territories States and union territories are different in the way they are represented Most union territories are ruled by administrators sent by the central government All the states and the territories of Dehli and Puducherry elect their local government themselves In total there are twenty eight states and seven union territories

States

Union territories  Andaman and Nicobar Islands Chandigarh Dadra and Nagar Haveli Daman and Diu Lakshadweep National Capital Territory of Delhi Puducherry 

There are disputes about certain parts of the Indian borders Countries do not agree on where the borders are Pakistan and China do not recognise the disputed territory of Occupied Kashmir The Indian government calls it Jammu and Kashmir and believes it is an Indian state Similarly the Republic of India does not recognise the Pakistani and Chinese parts of Kashmir

In 1914 British India and Tibet agreed on the McMahon Line as part of the Simla Accord Indians and Tibetans see this line as the official border China does not agree and both mainland China and Taiwan do not recognize that Arunachal Pradesh belongs to India According to them it is a part of South Tibet which belongs to China

The economy of the country is growing The economy of India is the 11th largest in the world with a GDP of 568 billion In terms of PPP the economy is fourth largest The growth rate is 825 for fiscal 2010 However that is still only 3100 per person per year

Indias economy is diverse Major industries include automobiles cement chemicals consumer electronics food processing machinery mining petroleum pharmaceuticals steel transportation equipment and textiles 

However despite economic growth India suffers from poverty 275 of the population was living in poverty in 20042005 In addition 804 of the population live on less than USD2 a day

There are 112 billion people living in India India is the second largest country by the number of people living in it with China being the first Experts think that by the year 2030 India will be the first About 70 of Indians live on farms The largest cities in India are Mumbai Kolkata Delhi Chennai Bangalore Hyderabad and Ahmedabad India has 23 official languages Altogether 1625 languages are spoken in India

There are many different languages and cultures in India The only geographical place with more different languages and cultures is the African continent There are two main language families in India the Indo Aryan and the Dravidian languages About 69 of Indians speak an Indo Arayan language about 26 speak a Dravidian language Other languages spoken in India come from the Austro Asiatic group Around 5 of the people speak a Tibeto Burman language

Hindi is the official language in India with the largest number of speakers It is the official language of the union Native speakers of Hindi represent about 41 of the Indian population English is also used mostly for business and in the administration It has the status of a subsidiary official language The constitution also recognises 21 other languages Either many people speak those languages or they have been recognised to be very important for Indian culture The number of dialects in India is as high as 1652

In the south of India many people speak Kannada Telugu Tamil and Malayalam In the north many people speak Chhattisgarhi Punjabi Bengali Gujarati and Marathi Oriya and Bihari

India has 23 official languages Its constitution lists the name of the country in each of the languages Hindi and English are the official languages of the union Tamil and Sanskrit kannadaare officially the classical languages of India

Several modern religions are linked to India namely modern Hinduism Jainism Buddhism Ayyavazhi and Sikhism All of these religions have different schools and traditions that are related As a group they are called the Eastern religions The Indian religions are similar to one another in many ways The basic beliefs the way worship is done and several religious practices are very similar These similarities mainly come from the fact that these religions have a common history and common origins They also influenced each other

The religion of Hinduism is the main faith followed by 810 of people in the Republic of India Islam 128 Christianity 29 Sikhism 19 Buddhism 08 and Jainism 04 

Indias official national sport is field hockey which is controlled by the Indian Hockey Federation The Indian field hockey team won the 1975 Mens Hockey World Cup They have also won eight gold one silver and two bronze medals at the Olympic games However cricket is the most popular sport in India The India cricket team won the 1983 and 2011 Cricket World Cup and the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 They shared the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy with Sri Lanka Cricket in India is controlled by the Board of Control for Cricket in India or BCCI Domestic tournaments are the Ranji Trophy the Duleep Trophy the Deodhar Trophy the Irani Trophy and the Challenger Series There is also the Indian cricket league and Indian premier league Twenty20 competitions

Tennis has become popular due to the victories of the India Davis Cup team Association football is also a popular sport in northeast India West Bengal Goa and Kerala The Indian national football team has won the South Asian Football Federation Cup many times Chess which comes from India is also becoming popular This is with the increase in the number of Indian Grandmasters Traditional sports include kabaddi kho kho and gilli danda which are played throughout India

An insult is a description of someone that will offend them It may or may not be true but it is called derogatory language Terms like foolish stupid idiot and moron are insults because they suggest that a persons mind is not quick or smart 

Insulting someones mother directly is a serious insult in many cultures

Ritual insults are part of many cultures mainly in sports and military training They are also very common in jargons  for example most references to newbies in net jargon are insults

One should be very careful when using unfamiliar terms for others

Usually to make the insulter feel like they are superior to the insulted because they feel inferior for some reason

When someone is being insulted the persons pride would usually be hurt They tend to fight back by insulting the other person back

Immunology is the study of the immune system Immune systems are parts of living things They stop invasion and parasitism by other living things The simplest form of it is the DNA restriction system in bacteria that prevents infection by bacteriophages

Usually Immunology means the study of immune systems in mammals These systems are more complex than in other living things and also have more errors

There are two broad artificial subdivisions of mammalian immune systems the innate and the acquired 

The innate immune system is usually means all of the cells and systems that does not have to be exposed to a particular pathogen before they can work 

Innate immunity starts with the skin which is an excellent barrier to infection

The adaptive immune system includes cells and systems that do require previous exposure to a pathogen It explains the unique ability of the mammalian immune system to remember previous infections and mount a rapid and robust reaction to secondary infections This immunological memory is due to the biology of T cells and B cells

Herd immunity for instance is acquired by organisms living close together sharing minor infections often

Vaccines boost the acquired immune system by offering weak forms of infection that the body can fight off The system remembers how to do it again when a stronger infection happens If the vaccine works the body can then fight off a serious infection

The distribution of vaccines and other immune system affecting cures can be considered another level of acquired immune system one governed by access to vaccination and medicine in general The intersection of this with the spread of disease is part of the field of public health

Errors of the immune system often cause more damage than what they are detecting and reacting to In autoimmune diseases the body attacks parts of itself because the system mistakes some parts of the body as foreign Some kinds of arthritis are caused this way

Sometimes serious pathogens slip in because their surface is disguised as something the host cell walls can accept That is how viruses work Once inside a cell their genetic material controls the cell Infections like HIV get in this way and then attack cells which are the basis of the immune system Artificial means are often used to restore immune system function in an HIV challenged body and prevent the onset of AIDS This is one of the most complex issues in immunology as it involves literally every level of that system This research during the 1980s and 1990s radically changed the view of the human immune system and its functions and integration in the human body

The natural or innate immune system of the human body is linked very deeply and directly to the nervous system and sensory system a link first explored by studies on epilepsy An epileptic attack is actually an immune system reaction triggered by a purely sensory or nervous input like a strobe light There are also studies of long term HIV survivors which suggest very strongly that psychology is a key healing factor and that it is quite possible to survive long term with very low immune system function if one avoids major psychological stress and stays quite calm and optimistic regardless of news This might be because of the immune systems tendency to panic under conditions of high stress to the detriment of the organism sometimes attacking it from the inside

Infinity is really not an ordinary number but it is sometimes used as one 

There are two kinds of infinity potential infinity and actual infinity Potential infinity is a process that never stops For example adding 10 to a number No matter how many times 10 is added 10 more can still be added Actual infinity is a more abstract idea For example there are infinitely many numbers as it is impossible to write them all down 

Infinity has various properties that are not normally found in numbers

January is named for Janus the Roman god of doors and gateways

January and February were put on the calendar after all the other months This is because in the original Roman calendar winter did not have months Although March was originally the first month January became the new first month because that was when people chose the new consuls

Januarys flower is the carnation with its birthstone being the garnet The meaning of the garnet is constancy

The first day of January is called New Years Day In some countries it has the name of Saint Sylvester

June is the sixth month of the year It has 30 days June is named for the Roman goddess Juno the wife of Jupiter She is goddess of marriage Because of this getting married in June was thought to be lucky June begins on a different day of the week each year

Junes flower is the Rose Its birthstone is the pearl The meaning for the birthstone pearl is health

July is the seventh month of the year It has 31 days July was named after Julius Caesar The month begins on the same day of the week as April every year and also January in leap years

Julys flower is the water lily Its birthstone is the ruby The meaning for the birthstone ruby is contented mind

Independence Day in the United States or Fourth of July is on July 4

Japan is a country in Asia It has many islands Four of them are big and the biggest is one of the largest islands in the world This island is called Honshu The islands are near the east Asian coast in the western part of the Pacific Ocean

Japanese people call their country Nihon or Nippon which means the origin of the sun in Japanese

The Japanese began to write their own history after the 5th and 6th centuries when people from Korea and China taught Japan about the Chinese writing system Japans neighbours also showed them the ways of Buddhism The Japanese changed Buddhism in many ways for example by building strongly on ideas such as Zen which came from mainland Asia

In the ancient and the Middle Ages China gave Japan many of new cultural ideas but their friendship became weaker later In the late 13th century Mongolians from China tried to invade Japan twice but they could not The samurai and shogun of Medieval Japan are similar to knights and lords in Medieval Europe

Japan had some contact with the Europeans in the 16th century The Portuguese were the first Europeans to visit Japan Later the Spanish English and Dutch came to Japan to trade Also they brought Christianity Japans leaders welcomed them at first but because Europeans had conquered many places in the world the Japanese were scared they would conquer Japan too So the Japanese did not let the Europeans come into Japan anymore except in a small area in Nagasaki city Only Chinese Korean and Dutch people were allowed to visit Japan in the end and they were under careful control of the Japanese government Japan was opened again in 1854 by Commodore Matthew Perry when the Americans wanted to use Japanese ports for American whale boats Perry brought steamships with guns which scared the Japanese into making an agreement with him

This new contact with Europeans and Americans changed the Japanese culture The Meiji Restoration of 1868 stopped some old ways and added many new ones The Empire of Japan was created and it became a very powerful nation and tried to invade the countries next to it It invaded and annexed Ryukyu Kingdom Taiwan and Korea It had wars with China and Russia the First Sino Japanese War the Boxer Rebellion the Russo Japanese War and the Second Sino Japanese War which grew to become a part of World War 2

In 1941 Japan hit Pearl Harbor in Hawaii a water base of the United States and destroyed or damaged many ships and airplanes This started the United States involvement in World War 2 American and Japanese forces fought each other in the Pacific Once airbases were established within range of the Japanese mainland America began to win and started dropping bombs on Japanese cities America was able to bomb most of the important cities and quickly brought Japan close to defeat To make Japan surrender the United States dropped two atomic bombs on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki killing 150000 Japanese citizens Soon after this the Soviet Union began to fight against Japan and the Japanese army in Manchuria lost Japan surrendered and gave up all the places it took from other countries accepting the Potsdam Proclamation The United States occupied Japan and forced it to write a new constitution in which it promised to never go to war again

Japan was hurt very much after the widespread bombing hits and the big bombs but soon it grew strong again They did not try to make a strong army but a lot of money Because of this they became very wealthy The United States put their army bases in Japan including Okinawa Although America helps protect Japan some people living near the bases do not like the soldiers there because of serious problems the soldiers sometimes make

Japan is a group of islands in the Western Pacific off the coast of China The four biggest islands are Honshu Hokkaido Shikoku and Kyushu and there are about 6000 smaller islands there Japan is separated from the Asian continent by the Sea of Japan and the East China Sea Honshu which means Mainland in Japanese language is the biggest island Hokkaido is the island north of Honshu Kyushu is the island west of Honshu Shikoku is the island to the south west of Honshu

In the middle of Japan there are mountains Most of the mountains are volcanoes Japan has many earthquakes The recent big earthquake was in 1995 near Kobe It killed many people 90 of the people living in Japan only live in 10 of the land near the coast The other 10 of the people in Japan live away from the coast

Over 10 cities have over a million people in them The biggest city in Japan is Tokyo which is the capital

The biggest cities in Japan are

In Japan there are eight regions or areas

Japan has 4 problems about territory

There are several important international airports in Japan Narita is the major international airport in the Tokyo area Kansai International Airport serves as the main airport for Osaka Kobe and Kyoto Chbu Centrair International Airport near Nagoya is the newest of the three Haneda Airport is close to central Tokyo and is the largest domestic airport in the country

The Shinkansen is one of the fastest trains in the world and connects cities in Honshu and Kyushu Networks of public and private railways cover almost all of the country Travel between cities by bus is also popular

In Japan Sumo Wresling is an important traditional sport and it is their national sport Other martial arts such as judo karate and kendo are also very popular but baseball has the most fans in Japan Soccer also called football is popular too It is popular to play and watch golf

Jargon is a special way to use words that are shared only by a certain group of people They do not mean what the dictionary says they mean They have different meanings to the people using them than their everyday meaning

For example the ordinary words boot net and web also have special meanings for users of computers the Internet and the World Wide Web These and to flame to ping and many acronyms are part of net jargon

An acronym means that only some of the letters in the word or phrase are used Often this is the first letter of each word Other acronyms found online are simply common shorthand See list of slang words

Usually more jargon is created over time 

Jargon is also common in the military It includes phrases like SNAFU

Jargon can be used by a clique to prevent others from joining or understanding but it also is often just used because it is shorter

Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System It is the fifth planet from the Sun Jupiter is classified as a gas giant because it is so large and is made up mostly of gas The other gas giants are Saturn Uranus and Neptune 

Jupiter has a mass of 189861027 kg or about 31783 Earths This is twice the mass of all the other planets in the Solar System put together

Jupiter can be seen with the naked eye without any special equipment It was known to the ancient Romans who named it after their god Jupiter Jupiter is the third brightest object in the night sky Only the Earths moon and Venus are brighter 

Jupiter has at least 63 moons Of these 55 are very small and less than five km wide The four largest moons of Jupiter are Io Europa Ganymede and Callisto They are called the Galilean moons because they were discovered by the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei Ganymede is the largest moon in the Solar System

Jupiter is the biggest planet in the Solar System with a diameter of 142984 km This is eleven times bigger than the diameter of Earth

The atmosphere near the surface of Jupiter is made of about 88 to 92 hydrogen 8 to 12 helium and 1 other gases 

Further into the planet it is so hot and the pressure so high that helium becomes a liquid and precipitates or rains further down into the planet Based on spectroscopy Jupiter seems to be made of similar gases to Saturn It is not as similar to Neptune or Uranus These two planets have much less hydrogen and helium gas

The very high temperatures and pressures in Jupiters core mean scientists cannot tell what materials would be there This cannot be found out because it is not possible to create the same amount of pressure on Earth 

Above the unknown inner core is an outer core The outer core of Jupiter is thick liquid hydrogen The pressure is high enough to make the hydrogen solid but then it melts because of the heat

Jupiter is twice as massive as all the other planets in the Solar System put together It gives off more heat than it gets from the sun Jupiter is 11 times the width of Earth and 318 times as massive The volume of Jupiter is 1317 times the volume of Earth In other words 1317 Earth sized objects could fit inside it

Jupiter has many bands of clouds going horizontally across its surface The light parts are called zones and the darker are called belts The zones and belts often interact with each other This causes huge storms Wind speeds of 360 kilometres per hour are common on Jupiter To show the difference the strongest tropical storms on Earth are about 100 kmh

Most of the clouds on Jupiter are made of ammonia There may also be clouds of water vapour similar to clouds on Earth Spacecrafts such as Voyager 1 have seen lightning on the surface of the planet Scientists think it was water vapour because lightning needs water vapour These lightning bolts have been measured as up 1000 times as powerful as those on Earth The brown and orange colours are caused when sunlight passes through or refracts with the many gases in the atmosphere

One of the biggest features in Jupiters atmosphere is the Great Red Spot It is a huge storm which is bigger than the entire Earth It has been known about for just under 200 years and possibly even longer Storms can last for hours or as long as hundreds of years in the case of the Great Red Spot

Jupiter has a magnetic field similar to Earths but 10 times stronger It is also has what is known as a magnetosphere The strength of the field is enough to be a serious danger to any spacecraft travelling past or to Jupiter The magnetic field is probably caused by the large amounts of liquid metallic hydrogen in the core of Jupiter The four largest moons of Jupiter orbit or go around the planet within the magnetic field This protects them from the solar wind Jupiters magnetic field is so large it reaches the orbit of Saturn 77 million miles away The Earths magnetosphere does not even cover its moon less than a million miles away

Jupiter also has a thin planetary ring system These rings are very difficult to see and so they were not discovered until NASAs Voyager 1 probe went to Jupiter in 1979 There are four parts to Jupiters rings The closest ring to Jupiter is called the Halo Ring The next ring is called the Main Ring It is about convert6440kmmi0lkoffabbron wide and only convert30kmmi0lkoffabbron thick The Main and Halo rings of Jupiter are made of small dark particles The third and fourth rings called the Gossamer Rings are transparent and are made from microscopic debris and dust This dust probably comes from small meteors striking the surface of Jupiters moons The third ring is called the Amalthea Gossamer Ring named after moon Amalthea The outer ring the Thebe Gossamer Ring is named after the moon Thebe The outer edge of this ring is about convert220000kmmi0lkoffabbron from Jupiter

The orbit of a planet is the time and path it takes to go around the Sun In the amount of time it takes for Jupiter to orbit the Sun one time the Earth orbits the Sun 1186 times One year on Jupiter is equal to 1186 years on Earth The average distance between Jupiter and the Sun is 778 million kilometres This is five times the distance between Earth and the Sun Jupiter is not tilted on its axis as much as the Earth or Mars This causes it to have no seasons for example Summer or Winter Jupiter rotates or spins around very quickly This causes the planet to bulge in the middle Jupiter is the fastest spinning planet in the Solar System It completes one rotation or spin in 10 hours Because of the bulge the length of the equator of Jupiter is much longer than the length from pole to pole

Jupiter is the third brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus Because of that people have always been able to see it from Earth The first person known to really study the planet was Galileo Galilei in 1610 He was the first person to see Jupiters moons Io Europa Ganymede and Callisto This was because he used a telescope unlike anyone before him

No new moons were discovered for more than two hundred years In 1892 an astronomer called EE Barnard found a new moon using his observatory in California He called the moon Amalthea It was the last of Jupiters 63 moons to be discovered by human observation through a telescope In 1994 bits of the comet Shoemaker Levy 9 hit Jupiter It was the first time a collision or crash between two Solar System objects had been directly seen by people

Eight spacecraft have either flown past or visited Jupiter since 1973 These were Pioneer 10 Pioneer 11 Voyagers 1 and 2 Ulysses Cassini and New Horizons in 2007 

The Pioneer missions were the first spacecraft to take close up pictures of Jupiter and its moons Five years later the two Voyager spacecraft discovered over 20 new moons They captured photo evidence of lightning on the night side of Jupiter

The Ulysses probe was sent to study the Sun It only went to Jupiter after it had finished its main mission Ulysses had no cameras so it took no photographs In 2006 the Cassini spacecraft on its way to Saturn took some very good very clear pictures of the planet Cassini also found a moon and took a picture of it but it was too far away to show the details

The Galileo mission in 1995 was the only spacecraft to go into orbit around Jupiter It flew around the planet for seven years and studied all of the four biggest moons It launched a probe into the planet to get information about Jupiters atmosphere The probe travelled to a depth of about 150 km before it was crushed by the weight of all the gas above it This is called pressure The Galileo spacecraft was also crushed in 2003 when NASA steered the craft into the planet on purpose They did this so that the craft could not crash into Europa a moon which scientists think might have life

NASA have sent another spacecraft to Jupiter called Juno It was launched on August 5 2011 The spacecraft will go into orbit around the planet in July 2016 Several missions have been planned to send spacecraft to Jupiters moons Europa and Callisto One called JIMO was cancelled in 2006 because it cost too much money

Jupiter has 63 known moons Only 13 of these were first seen from Earth because the rest are too small The rest of the moons have since been seen by spacecraft The smallest moon is only 1 kilometre across The biggest Ganymede has a diameter of 5262 kilometres It is bigger than the planet Mercury However from Jupiter it looks only half as big as Io because its farther away Along with Io Europa and Callisto Ganymede is one of the Galilean moons the four biggest moons of Jupiter Because of the way they orbit Jupiter gravity affects three of these moons greatly The friction caused by the gravity of Europa and Ganymede pulling on Io makes it the most volcanic object in the Solar System It has over 400 volcanoes more than three times as many as Earth

Jupiters large gravity has had a big effect on the Solar System Jupiter protects the inner planets from comets by pulling them towards itself Because of this Jupiter has the most comet impacts in the Solar System 

Two groups of asteroids called the Trojan asteroids have settled into Jupiters orbit round the Sun One group is called the Trojans and the other group is called the Greeks They go round the Sun in the same time as Jupiter

A king is a man who rules a country because of inheritance A king usually comes to power when one of his parents dies For much of history most countries were ruled in this way especially in Europe In some countries people chose a new king from other people to decide from 

The wife of a king is called a queen A woman who becomes a ruler because of inheritance is also called a queen

If a country has a king or a queen that means it is a monarchy A country which a king or queen rules is called a kingdom

Knowledge means the things which are true as opposed to opinion Information which is correct is knowledge Knowledge can always be supported by evidence That makes it justified it is not an opinion or a guess

If someone understands an idea or is aware of something then he or she has knowledge of it When it makes sense to someone this knowledge becomes understanding A knowledgeable person is someone who knows a lot If someone has know how it means that they can put knowledge to work in doing or building something

Knowledge comes from being in an environment having some experience there and then sharing what was learned That way others may gain from what someone else knows

When doing science it may be necessary to set up a strict experiment Then the experience is repeatable and others may repeat it afterwards 

Other types of knowledge can be for a more specific purpose for example learning a language In business computers help to record and share what employees know

Knowledge in religion is different in that it depends on faith belief and the authority of religious leaders not on evidence of a scientific or legal kind There are differing views on whether religious statements should be regarded as knowledge

In many expressions of Christianity such as Catholicism and Anglicanism knowledge is one of the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit

In Islam knowledge is given great significance The All Knowing is one of the Names of God reflecting distinct properties of God in Islam The Quran asserts that knowledge comes from God and various hadith encourage getting knowledge Muhammad is reported to have said Seek knowledge from the cradle to the grave and Verily the men of knowledge are the inheritors of the prophets Islamic scholars theologians and jurists are often given the title alim meaning knowledgeable

Kauai is the oldest and fourth largest of the main Hawaiian Islands in the United States Known also as the Garden Isle Kauai lies 105 miles across the Kauai Channel northwest of Honolulu on Oahu It is of volcanic origin The highest point is Mount Waialeale at the center of the island 5148 feet above sea level The wettest spot on Earth with average rainfall of 460 inches a year is just east of Mount Waialeale The high yearly rainfall has eroded deep valleys in the central mountain It has made canyons with many scenic waterfalls

The city of Lihue on the islands southeast side is the seat of Kauai County It is the main city on the island Waimea on the islands southwest side and once the capital of Kauai was the first place visited by explorer Captain James Cook in 1778 The city is at the head of one of the most beautiful canyons in the world Waimea Canyon whose gorge is 900 meters deep

The island of Kauai was featured in Disneys 2002 animated feature film Lilo Stitch

Kahookinaolawe is the smallest of the 8 main volcanic islands in the Hawaiian Islands in the United States It is west of Maui and south of Lanaokinai and is 11 miles long by 6 miles across The highest point Lua Makika is 1477 feet above sea level The island is rather dry because its low height does not cause much rain to fall from the northeastern trade winds

Kahookinaolawe was used as a gunfire and bombing target by the United States military because of World War II and a defense training area by the United States Navy from around 1941 until May 1994 Popular feeling in Hawaiokinai against this practice finally won and the Navy has been trying to finish a cleanup of unexploded ordnance from the island Ordnance is still buried or lying on the ground Other items have washed down gullies and still other unexploded ordnance is underwater offshore In 1981 the entire island was included on the National Register of Historic Places

The island is planned to be given back to the Hawaiian people In 1993 the US Congress passed a law that recognized the cultural importance of the island required the Navy to return the island to the State and directed the Navy to do an unexploded ordnance cleanup and environmental restoration The turnover officially occurred on November 11 2003 but the cleanup has not yet been completed The US Navy was given 400 million and 10 years to complete the large cleanup task but this work has gone much slower than planned

In 1993 the Hawaii State Legislature established the Kahookinaolawe Island Reserve It is made up of the whole island and waters out to two miles from shore By State Law Kahookinaolawe and its waters can only be used for Native Hawaiian cultural spiritual and subsistence purposes fishing environmental restoration historic preservation and education Commercial uses are not allowed The Legislature also created the Kahookinaolawe Island Reserve Commission to manage the Reserve while it is held in trust for a future Native Hawaiian Sovereignty entity 

After the cleanup is finished the restoration of Kahookinaolawe will need ways to control erosion restore the plant life recharge the water table and slowly replace alien plants with native ones Plans will include methods for damming gullies and reducing rainwater runoff Non natives will temporarily stabilize some areas before the permanent planting of native plants

The act of killing a living thing can be said to have happened when an outside force usually another life form has done something to cause it to die

When a human being is killed by the action or fault of another human being this event is called a homicide When a human being is killed by the action of himself it is called a suicide

A kill is also the act of shooting down a fighter aircraft Also the word kill is very serious it means that someone might soon meet his death if he is not careful People who kill others are called murderers 

The kilometre is the common unit of longer distances on Earth The SI unit is the metre and a kilometre is 1000 metres It is now used more often than miles for measuring road distance It is also more used more often than the nautical mile for sea distances and air distances However in the UK and the USA the mile is used more than kilometres

It is often used to measure the speed of cars planes and boats by saying how many kilometres it can travel in an hour This is shown as kmh

It is also spelled kilometer This spelling is used in American English

One kilometre is 06214 miles This means that one mile is 16093 kilometres

Language is the normal way humans communicate Looking at all animals only humans use language though many other animals communicate in different ways An important difference is that human language has syntax which is a set of rules for connecting words together to make statements and questions some other animals use syntax but it is not as complicated as human syntax Language can also be changed by adding new words for example to describe new things This is very uncommon in other animals Language may be done by speech or by writing or by moving the hands to make signs It follows that language is not just any way of communicating Even some human communication is not language Humans also use language for thinking

Language is a word that may be used by extension 

All languages share certain things which separate them from all other kinds of communication

There are many more things in common between languages

The capacity to learn and use language is inherited Normally all humans are born with this capability Which language is learned by a child depends on which language is spoken by the childs community The capacity is inherited but the particular language is learned

Children have a special period from about 18 months to about four years which is critical for learning the language If this is seriously disrupted then their language skills will be damaged Adults do not learn languages the same way they did when they were young So if they learn a second language it is difficult and they have little chance of speaking it as well as their native language

Some children have more than one native language like when they live in a foreign country or when their father speaks a different language from their mother

Mathematics and computer science use created languages called formal languages but these may or may not be true languages Mathematics itself is seen as a language by many Some people consider musical notation to be a way of writing the musical language

Chinese is the language with the most native speakers in the world but Chinese is not really a language It is a close family of dialects some of which are as different as Romance languages are from one another

English is often called the international language It is the main second language of the world and the language of science business and entertainment

Some languages are made up so that a lot of people around the world can learn them without the new languages being tied to any specific country or place One of the most popular of these languages is Esperanto which is sometimes called La Internacia Lingvo or The International Language Another of these languages is called Volapuk which was popular about a hundred years ago but is much less popular now It has mostly been replaced by languages like Esperanto Interlingua and Ido

Part of the reason that Volapuk became unpopular is that some sounds are hard to say for people who speak Spanish or English two of the most widely spoken languages in the world

Leisure is when a person can choose what to do During a persons leisure time they do not have an obligation to be at school or work at a job During leisure time people can do fun activities family activities or other non work activity such as hobbies 

Common forms of recreation or leisure are

A vacation or holiday is the setting aside of time specifically for leisure During their vacation some people travel to a different region or country and stay at a hotel so that they can do things they could not do near home Other people prefer to spend their vacation time at home in their own community

In wealthy industrialized countries such as the US and Canada as well as in most European countries workers are allowed to stay home on the weekend and use it as leisure time People in poorer developing countries usually have less leisure time as they have to work longer hours and more days per year

Live can be a verb It rhymes with give To live means to be alive If you live then you have life

It can be used in a general way 

Live can be an adjective It rhymes with five

Life is easy to recognise but hard to define The study of life is called biology and people who study life are biologists A lifespan is the average length of life in a species All life is directly or indirectly powered by solar energy Without energy from the sun no life could exist

All known life on Earth is based on the chemistry of carbon compounds In particular all life uses long chain molecules such as proteins and nucleic acid With water which is essential the long molecules are wrapped inside membranes to form cells This may or may not be true of all possible forms of life in the Universe it is true of all life on Earth today

Living organisms are open systems They are always changing because they exchange materials and information with their environment They undergo metabolism maintain homeostasis possess a capacity to grow respond to stimuli and reproduce

Through natural selection they adapt to their environment in successive generations More complex living organisms can communicate through various means Many life forms can be found on Earth and the properties common to these organismsplants animals fungi protists archaea and bacteriaare a carbon and water based cellular form with complex organization and heritable genetic information

At present the Earth is the only planet we have detailed information about The question of whether life exists elsewhere in the Universe is open There have been a number of claims of life elsewhere in the Universe but none of these have so far been confirmed The best evidence of life outside of Earth is fossil evidence of possible bacterial life on Mars

One explanation of life is called the cell theory The cell theory has three basic points All living things are made of cells The cell is the smallest living thing that can do all the things needed for life All cells must come from preexisting cells

Something is often said to be alive if it

However not all living things fit every point on this list 

They do however fit the biochemical definitions they are made of the same kind of chemicals

The thermodynamic definition of life is any system which can keep its entropy levels below maximum

The law is a set of rules that people should follow in a society or a country The courts and police enforce this system of rules and punish people who break the laws such as by making them pay a fine or other penalty or sending them to jail In ancient societies laws were written by leaders to set out rules on how people can live work and do business with each other Today in most countries laws are written and voted on by groups of elected politicians in a legislature such as a parliament or congress To follow the laws of a society is to do legal things An activity is illegal if it breaks a law or does not follow the laws

A legal code is a written code of laws that are enforced This may deal with things like police courts or punishments A lawyer jurist or attorney is a professional who studies and argues the rules of law In the United States there are two kinds of attorneys  transactional attorneys who write contracts and litigators who go to court In the United Kingdom these professionals are called solicitors and barristers respectively 

The Rule of Law is the law which says that government can only legally use its power in a way the government and the people agree on It limits the powers a government has as agreed in a countrys constitution The Rule of Law prevents dictatorship and protects the rights of the people When leaders enforce the legal code honestly even on themselves and their friends this is an example of the rule of law being followed The rule of law wrote the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle in 350 BC is better than the rule of any individual

Culture is usually a major source of the principles behind many laws as people tend to trust the ideas based on family and social habits In many countries throughout history religion and religious books like the Vedas Bible or the Koran have been a major source of law

Civil law is the legal system used in most countries around the world today Civil law is based on legislation that is found in constitutions or statutes passed by government The secondary part of civil law is the legal approaches that are part of custom In civil law governments judges do not generally have much power and most of the laws and legal precedent are created by members of parliament

Common law is based on the decisions made by judges in past court cases It comes from England and it became part of almost every country that once belonged to the British Empire except Scotland and the Canadian province of Quebec It is also the predominant form of law in the United States where many laws called statutes are written by Congress but many more legal rules exist from the decisions of the courts Common law had its beginnings in the Middle Ages when King John was forced by his barons to sign a document called the Magna Carta

Religious law is law based on religious beliefs or books Examples include the Jewish Halakha Islamic Sharia and Christian Canon law Until the 1700s Sharia law was the main legal system throughout the Muslim world In some Muslim countries such as Saudi Arabia and Iran the whole legal systems still base their law in Sharia law Religious law is often criticized by countries that are not ruled by a religious government because it often has very harsh penalties for very minor crimes and often results in the mistreatment of women and minorities 

The history of law is closely connected to the development of human civilisations Ancient Egyptian law developed in 3000 BC In 1760 BC King Hammurabi took ancient Babylonian law and organized it and then had it chiseled in stone for the public to see in the marketplace These laws became known as the Code of Hammurabi 

The Torah from the Old Testament is probably the oldest body of law It was written around 1280 BC It has moral rules such as the Ten Commandments which tell people what things are not permitted

The judiciary is a group of judges who resolve peoples disputes and determine whether people who are charged with crimes are guilty Most countries of common law and civil law systems have a system of appeals courts up to a supreme authority such as the Supreme Court or the High Court The highest courts usually have the power to remove laws that are unconstitutional

In democracies the people in a country usually choose people called politicians to represent them in a legislature Examples of legislatures include the Houses of Parliament in London the Congress in Washington DC the Bundestag in Berlin the Duma in Moscow and the Assemble nationale in Paris Most legislatures have two chambers or houses a lower house and an upper house To pass legislation a majority of Members of Parliament must vote for a bill in each house The legislature is the branch of government that writes laws and votes on whether they will be approved

The executive is the governing center of political authority In most democratic countries the executive is elected from people who are in the legislature This group of elected people is called the cabinet In France the US and Russia the executive branch has a President which exists separately from the legislature 

The executive suggests new laws and deals with other countries As well the executive usually controls the military the police and the bureaucracy The executive selects ministers or secretaries of state to control departments such as the health department or the department of justice 

The police enforce the criminal laws by arresting people suspected of breaking the law Bureaucrats are the government workers and government organizations that do work for the government Bureaucrats work within a system of rules and they make their decisions in writing 

Lawyers are people who have learned about laws Lawyers give people advice about their legal rights and duties and represent people in court To become a lawyer a person has to complete a two or three year university program at a law school and pass an entrance examination Lawyers work in a law firms for the government for companies or by themselves 

Civil society is the people and groups that are not part of government that try to protect people against human rights abuses and try to protect freedom of speech and other individual rights Organizations that are part of civil society include political parties debating clubs trade unions human rights organizations newspapers and charities

Ludovic Lazarus Zamenhof was a Jewish Polish eye doctor and scholar who created the international language Esperanto 

Zamenhof was born in 1859 in the town of Biaystok Poland At the time Poland was a part of the Russian Empire Bialystok contained three major groups Poles Belorussians and Yiddish speaking Jews Zamenhof thought that one common language would join these groups and stop fights between them

His first language was said to be Polish His parents spoke Russian and Yiddish in the home His father was a German teacher so Zamenhof learned that language from an early age Later he learned French Latin Greek Hebrew and English He also had an interest in Italian Spanish and Lithuanian

Zamenhof decided that the international language must have a simple grammar and be easier to learn than Volapuk an earlier international language The basics of Esperanto were published in 1887

Canadas land is composed of thirteen parts ten provinces and three territories Canada is governed on the principles of a federation the Provinces governments share power with the Government of Canada The territories governments have a more limited set of powers versus the federal government than that of the provinces

The provinces are located in the south of Canada and the territories are in the north where fewer people live

Here is a list of the provinces and their standard abbreviations with their capitals Canadas capital city is Ottawa

Las Vegas is a city in the American state of Nevada The city has a population of 567641 people in 2009 It is the biggest city in Nevada Las Vegas is also the county seat of Clark County in Nevada 

Mormon farmers first lived there in 1854 It was called Las Vegas by Spanish people The name means The Meadows in the Spanish language It had a lot of these in 1854 The city is known for its dry climate as is the rest of Southern Nevada It is surrounded by deserts

The US Army built Fort Baker there in 1864 Las Vegas has springs so people used to stop there for water when they were going to Los Angeles or other places in California

In 1905 110 acres owned by William A Clark on which he built a railroad to Southern California were auctioned and Las Vegas was founded as a railroad town Las Vegas officially became a city in 1911

Las Vegas also known by a shorter name Vegas is notable for its liberal policies on activities such as drinking and gambling Gambling was made legal in the state of Nevada in 1931 In 1941 many hotels were built in Las Vegas with casinos in them Las Vegas is sometimes called Sin City because so many people come to the city for gambling and drinking alcohol two common sins

People come to Las Vegas for vacation many hotels have different themes and have shows and events to get people to come there Because of this Las Vegas is called The Entertainment Capital of the World

Las Vegas is also known for its many casinos decorated with various bright colours Some of these casinos include Circus Circus a circus themed casino and The Venetian an Italian themed casino

Lanai is sixth largest of the Hawaiian Islands in the United States It is also known as the Pineapple Island The island is almost a circle in shape and is 18 miles wide in the longest direction The land area is 140 sq miles It is separated from the island of Molokai by the Kalohi Channel to the north

Lanai was first seen by Europeans on 25 February 1779 by Captain Clerke with HMS Resolution on the James Cook Pacific Ocean trip Clerke took command of the ship after Capt Cook was killed at Kealakekua Bay on February 14 and was leaving the islands for the North Pacific 

In 1922 Jim Dole the president of Dole Pineapple Company bought the island of Lanai He made a large part of it into the worlds largest pineapple plantation 

Tourism on Lanai started not long ago That was when the growing of pineapple was slowly coming to an end in the Islands On Lanai you can be with nature and feel the mood of the Hawaiian countryside Not like nearby Oahu the only town is small It has no traffic or shopping centers Tourists come mainly to relax

There are three hotels on Lanai and several golf courses

A leap year comes once every four years It is a year in which an extra day is added to the Gregorian calendar which is used by most of the world 

An ordinary year has 365 days A leap year has 366 days The extra day is added to the month of February In an ordinary year February has 28 days In a leap year it has 29 days This extra day is called a leap day

In a leap year January April and July all start on the same day of the week

In a leap year February starts and ends on the same day

A leap year can always be evenly divided by four For example 2012 is a leap year But a year is not a leap year if it can be evenly divided by 100 but cannot also be evenly divided by 400 This is why 1600 and 2000 are leap years but 1700 1800 and 1900 are not

We have leap years because instead of 365 days the Earth really takes a few minutes less than 365 14 days to go completely around the Sun

Without leap years the seasons would start one day earlier on the calendar every four years After 360 years spring would begin on December 21

A number of countries use a lunar calendar They have leap years when they add an extra lunar month Different calendars add the extra month in different ways

A license allows a person or company to do something that they otherwise are not allowed to do In British English the spelling is licence A person usually has to pay some money to get a license A license is usually written but it does not have to be

There are many different types of licenses

The laws of most countries say that people are only allowed to drive cars if they have a license If a person does not have a license they may have to pay a fine if they are caught by the police In many country a person must take a test and pay money to get a license

Other licenses give permission to shoot animals The hunting license usually says when a person may hunt

In the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland if someones has a television set they must buy a television licence every year

A person or a company can also give a license to a patent copyright or trademark that they own In those cases the government has said that the owner may stop other people from using their rights So in order for another person to use an owners patent copyright or trademark they need permission from the owner For example when someone buys a computer software application they also need a license from the creator of the software allowing the buyer to use the software

In many countries if a person tries to do something without the correct license to do it he might have to pay a fine or go to prison

License is a verb Licensing sessions were the meetings of magistrates which decided about giving licences to sell alcohol 

In American English spelling there is no difference in spelling between the verb to license meaning to give permission and the noun a licence meaning the permission to do something 

A link also hyperlink in computing is a part of a chain A chain is made of many pieces of metal each piece is a link 

Today people also use the word link in a new way The World Wide Web on the Internet is made of many different Web pages The computer software that people use to make these pages lets us go to other pages in a very fast and easy way 

The person who makes the web page can tell the computer to show a word or a picture on the Web page as a link This means that when we click on the link with our computer mouse the computer will show us the new page we want to see Most links are blue but they can be any color

The color of the link will change to dark blue when clicked as the web browser recognises it in the browsers cache Unless the cache is cleared the link will always stay dark blue

There are many ways in making a link on a web page The process is different for different internet software

In htm and html files a link can be created using this code

Text of link

WikiSyntax like MediaWiki uses a simpler way of making links To create a link to another page of the same website

Link text or just Page name

To link to an external website

Link text or just httpwwwexamplecom

BB code is used in forum software To create a link

A library is a place where many books are kept Most libraries are public and let people take the books to use in their home Most libraries let people borrow books for several weeks Some belong to institutions for example companies churches schools and universities Also a persons bookshelves at home can have many books and be a library The people who work in libraries are librarians

Other libraries keep famous or rare books There are a few Copyright libraries which have a copy of every book which has been written in that country Some libraries also have other things that people might like such as magazines music on CDs or computers where people can use the Internet In school they offer software to learn the alphabet and other details

A library is not a bookstore

Many places have a public library where anybody can join if they live in the area With a library card people can borrow books and take them home for several weeks It does not cost money to get a library card at most public libraries

Books music and movies are kept on shelves in a special order so they are easy to find Public libraries have stories and books about lots of things Many public libraries have books and CDs about learning English Stories are kept in alphabetical order by the last name of the person who wrote them the author Books about other things are often given a special number that refers to what they are about They are then put on the shelf in number order One number system used by many libraries is the Dewey decimal system

A librarian is a person who works in a library Librarians help people find books and information They can teach people how to find books and use the library

There are a number of topics in mathematics Some of them include

Like can mean some different things 

1 We can use to like to say that we find a thing is good 

2 We can use like for the same as or nearly the same as

3 We can also use like for the same way as

4 In a question we can use like to ask people to talk about a thing or to say if they find it good or not

5 We can also use like as for example

6 In British and American English young people when talking have recently started using like as an extra word in the middle of sentences Sometimes they use it to report what someone said especially when mimicking the way they said it This should never be used in writing

As works in the same way as example 2  comparing two things using either the word like or the word as is called making a simile It may be better to use the word as for this to stop confusion with example 1

This is a list of common elements

There are twenty three provinces four municipalities five autonomous regions and two special administrative regions in the flagiconPeoples Republic of China Peoples Republic of China The island of Taiwan is claimed as a province by the Peoples Republic of China but it not under their control Taiwan is currently a democratic island known officially as the flagiconRepublic of China Republic of China

Legislature is a word that comes from the Latin language meaning those who write the laws The legislature of a state or country is a group of people each of whom got his or her office either by winning an election or by being appointed to vote for the best laws The way a legislature is supposed to work can usually be found in the constitution of that state or country

In many countries the legislature is called a Parliament or Congress Sometimes the legislature is made up of two separate houses This is called a bicameral legislature

A county district city or other small area also has a council that makes the rules and laws for its level of government The way a council works can usually be found in the areas charter

Linear algebra describes ways to solve and manipulate systems of linear equations

since it makes all of the original equations valid that is the value on left side of the equals sign is exactly the same as the value on the right side for both equations

Linear algebra uses a system of notation for describing system behavior called a matrix For the previous example the coefficients of the equations can be stored in a coefficient matrix

London is a big city in the southeast of England on the River Thames It is the capital of England and the United Kingdom 75 million people live in London London is the biggest city in the United Kingdom and in Europe It is the worlds largest financial centre slightly ahead of New York City 

London was started by the Romans in 43 AD and called Londinium which was later shortened to London London is also known as Lunnainn in Scottish Llundain in Welsh and Londain in Irish

For a long time London was a small city and all its people lived inside the walls that were built by the Romans This area is still called the City of London Around the city there were many villages Gradually as more and more people came to live there the villages joined together into one huge city which is now called London or Greater London

Most people in London are English However London also has many migrants who come from many different countries speaking different languages and with different religions and cultures There are also many people from different countries who stay in London on business Many people visit London as tourists to see the famous Sights of London which include palaces churches and museums 

London is one of the worlds most important cities for business finance and politics It is also important for culture media entertainment fashion and art

The Romans built a city called Londinium on the River Thames in AD 43 The name Londinium came from the Celtic language of the Ancient Britons In the year 61 AD Queen Boudica and her army destroyed the city Boudica killed herself when Romans trapped her and the Romans then rebuilt London London became an important trading city After the Romans left Britain few people lived in the city for a long time because the Anglo Saxons liked living in the countryside In the 9th century more people started living there again It became the largest city in England but it did not become the capital city of England until the 12th century 

After the railways were built London grew very big Greater London has 33 London Boroughs and a mayor The old City of London is only a square mile in size but has its own Lord Mayor

Another famous old part of Greater London is Westminster which was always a different city from the City of London In Westminster is Westminster Abbey The Palace of Westminster and 10 Downing Street

 Events 

London has twin and sister city agreements with these cities

London also has a partnership agreement with Tokyo Japan

A litre is the metric unit of volume 

One litre is the volume of one cubic decimetre that is a cube of 10 x 10 x 10 centimetre A litre of water has a mass of about one kilogram 

The symbol for litre is L or l 

For smaller volumes the decilitre is used 10 dl one litre

For smaller volumes the millilitre is used 1000 ml one litre

The capital letter L is preferred by some people as the small l can look like the number one 1

A lens is a piece of glass or clear plastic that changes the way things look They may appear larger smaller or inverted Some places lenses are used include spectacles contact lenses cameras projectors microscopes telescopes magnifying glasses etc Eyes are also considered lenses 

They work by refraction or the bending of light

Lenses found in glasses have three main shapes Each different shape manipulates the image slightly The three types are as follows Convex bulges outwards from the lens Concave depressed into the lens Planar flat

First references about lenses were in the ancient Greek piece of Aristofan Clouds where with lenses and suns light made a fire

Lime is a word to refer to various fruit trees Most of them are citrus fruit They are usually associated with the lemon Limes have a lot of vitamin C Sailors from Britain were given lemon or lime juice to stop them falling ill with scurvy This is how they got the nickname Limey

Limes are small round and bright green If they stay on the tree for a long time they turn yellow Then they look like small round lemons

Lime juice is used in cooking and in drinks Lime oils are often used in perfumes used for cleaning and used for aromatherapy

Lime tasetes very acid and bitter not sweet like sugar Lime juice is also made from lime and is in the same family as lemon

Mathematics is the study of numbers shapes and patterns Mathematicians are people who learn about and discover such things in mathematics Mathematics is useful for solving problems that occur in the real world so many people besides mathematicians study and use mathematics Today mathematics is needed in many jobs Business science engineering and construction need some knowledge of mathematics

Mathematicians solve problems by using logic Mathematicians often use deduction Deduction is a special way of thinking to discover and prove new truths using old truths To a mathematician the reason something is true is just as important as the fact that it is true Using deduction is what makes mathematical thinking different from other kinds of thinking

Mathematics includes the study of

Mathematics uses logic to study these things and to create general rules which are an important part of mathematics These rules leave out information that is not important so that a single rule can cover many situations By finding general rules mathematics solves many problems at the same time 

A proof gives a reason why a rule in mathematics is correct This is done by using certain other rules that everyone agrees are correct which are called axioms A rule that has a proof is sometimes called a theorem Experts in mathematics perform research to create new theorems Sometimes experts find an idea that they think is a theorem but can not find a proof for it That idea is called a conjecture until they find a proof

Sometimes mathematics finds and studies rules or ideas in the real world that we dont understand yet Often in mathematics ideas and rules are chosen because they are considered simple or beautiful On the other hand sometimes these ideas and rules are found in the real world after they are studied in mathematics this has happened many times in the past In general studying the rules and ideas of mathematics can help us understand the world better

These theorems have interested mathematicians and people who are not mathematicians

These are theorems and conjectures that have greatly changed mathematics

Progress in understanding the nature of mathematics also influences the way mathematicians study their subject

Mathematics in history and the history of mathematics

The word mathematics comes from the Greek word The Greek word means science knowledge or learning 

Often the word mathematics is made shorter into maths or math The short words math or maths are often used for arithmetic geometry or simple algebra by young students and their schools

There is no Nobel prize in mathematics Mathematicians can receive the Abel prize and the Fields Medal for important works 

The Clay Mathematics Institute has said it will give one million dollars to anyone who solves one of the Millennium Prize Problems

March is the third month of the year It has 31 days March is named after Mars the Roman god of war

In ancient Rome March was called Martius It was named after the war god and the Romans thought that it was a lucky time to begin a war

Marchs flower is the jonquil and its birthstone is the bloodstone The meaning of the bloodstone is courage

May is the fifth month of the year It has 31 days The month of May might have been named for the Roman goddess Maia or more likely the Roman goddess of fertility Bona Dea whose festival was held in May

Mays flower is the Lily of the Valley Its birthstone is the emerald The meaning of the emerald is success in love

Music is an art that puts sounds together in a way that people like or find interesting Most music includes people singing with their voices or playing musical instruments such as the piano guitar or drums

The word music comes from the Greek word Greek language which means of the Muses In Ancient Greece the Muses included the goddesses of music poetry art and dance Someone who makes music is called a musician

 What is music  Music is sound that has been organized by using rhythm melody or harmony If someone bangs saucepans while cooking it makes noise If a person bangs saucepans or pots in a rhythmic way they are making a simple type of music

Blues music is music that is played by singing using the harmonica or the acoustic guitar Jazz musicians use instruments such as the trumpet and saxophone

Music started many thousands of years ago When early people first banged pieces of wood together and enjoyed the sound they were discovering music Early people also discovered that when they cut off the horns of animals they had killed and blew through them they could make interesting sounds People also blew into conch shells and  made sounds that they liked They probably started to sing or shout in celebration

There are four things which music has most of the time

Even in the stone age people made music The first music was probably made trying to imitate sounds and rhythms that occurred naturally Human music may echo these phenomena using patterns repetition and tonality Even today this kind of music still exists Shamans sometimes imitate sounds that occur naturally It may also serve as entertainment or have practical uses like luring animals when hunting

Music may not be something that is limited to humans Songbirds use song to defend their territory or to attract a mate Monkeys have been seen beating hollow logs This may of course also serve to defend the territory 

The first musical instrument used by humans may have been their voice The human voice can make many different kinds of sounds as well as normal talking Involuntary shouts like Ow when hurt singing humming and whistling through to clicking coughing and yawning are examples 

The oldest known Neanderthal hyoid bone with the modern human form was about 60000 years old It indicates that the Neanderthals had language because the hyoid supports the voice box in the human throat This would be an example of convergent evolution because the two species split much earlier up to half a million years earlier

The oldest known bone flute is 10000 years younger Both are unique it is therefore difficult to say when music really started 

Most likely the first rhythm instruments or percussion instruments involved the clapping of hands stones hit together or other things that are useful to create rhythm There are finds of this type that date back to the paleolithic Some of these are ambiguous as they can be used either as a tool or a musical instrument

Music may have arisen amongst humans when stone tools first began to be used by hominids This would put it in the Oldowan era of the Paleolithic The noises produced by work such as pounding seed and roots into meal is a possible source of rhythm created by early humans

The oldest flute ever discovered may be the so called Divje Babe flute found in the Slovenian cave Divje Babe I in 1995 It is not certain that the object is really a flute The item in question is a fragment of the femur of a young cave bear and has been dated to about 43000 years ago However whether it is truly a musical instrument or simply a carnivore chewed bone is a matter of ongoing debate

In 2008 archaeologists discovered a bone flute in the Hohle Fels cave near Ulm Germany The five holed flute has a V shaped mouthpiece and is made from a vulture wing bone The researchers involved in the discovery officially published their findings in the journal Nature in June 2009 The discovery is also the oldest confirmed find of any musical instrument in history Other flutes were also found in the cave This flute was found next to the Venus of Hohle Fels and a short distance from the oldest known human carving When they announced their discovery the scientists suggested that the finds demonstrate the presence of a well established musical tradition at the time when modern humans colonized Europe Scientists have also suggested that the discovery of the flute may help to explain why early humans survived while Neanderthals became extinct

The oldest known wooden pipes were discovered near Greystones Ireland in 2004 A wood lined pit contained a group of six flutes made from yew wood between 30 and 50 cm long tapered at one end but without any finger holes They may once have been strapped together

In 1986 several bone flutes were found in Jiahu in Henan Province China They date to about 6000 BC They have between 5 and 8 holes each and were made from the hollow bones of a bird the red crowned crane At the time of the discovery one was found to be still playable The bone flute plays both the five or seven note scale of Xia Zhi and six note scale of Qing Shang of the ancient Chinese musical system 

There is no simple definition of music which covers all cases It is an art form and subjective judgement comes into play The table below adapted from Nattiez gives some idea of what a definition might cover

One way into a definition is by opinions or votes such as 

A different approach is to list the qualities music must have such as

Another approach is by its effect on the listener

All these and many other attempts do not capture all aspects of music or leave out examples whiich definitely are music According to Clifton music is a certain reciprocal relation established between a person his behavior and a sounding objectp10 So Clifton defines music on the basis of the human behaviour not on composition or sounds as physical objects Musical experience and the music together are called phenomena and the activity of describing phenomena is called phenomenology

It is not known what the earliest music of the cave people was like Some architecture even some paintings are thousands of years old but old music could not survive until people learned to write it down The only way we can guess about early music is by looking at very old paintings that show people playing musical instruments or by finding them in archaeological digs The earliest piece of music that was ever written down and that has not been lost was discovered on a tablet written in Hurrian a language spoken in and around northern Mesopotamia from about 1500 BC

Another early piece of written music that has survived was a round called Sumer Is Icumen In It was written down by a monk around the year 1250 Much of the music in the Middle Ages was folk music played by working people who wanted to sing or dance When people played instruments they were usually playing for dancers However most of the music that was written down was for the Catholic church This music was written for monks to sing in church It is called Chant

In the Renaissance there was a lot of music and many composers wrote music that has survived so that it can be performed played or sung today The name for this period is a French word which means rebirth This period was called the rebirth because many new types of art and music were reborn during this time

Some very beautiful music was written for use in church services by the Italian composer Giovanni da Palestrina In Palestrinas music many singers sing together There was also plenty of music not written for the church such as happy dance music and romantic love songs Popular instruments during the Renaissance included the viols lutes and the virginal a small quiet keyboard instrument

In the arts the Baroque was a Western cultural era which began near the turn of the 17th century in Rome It was exemplified by drama and grandeur in sculpture painting literature dance and music1citation needed In music the term Baroque applies to the final period of dominance of imitative counterpoint where different voices and instruments echo each other but at different pitches sometimes inverting the echo and even reversing thematic material

The popularity and success of the Baroque style was encouraged by the Roman Catholic Church which had decided at the time of the Council of Trent that the arts should communicate religious themes in direct and emotional involvementcitation needed The upper class also saw the dramatic style of Baroque architecture and art as a means of impressing visitors and expressing triumphant power and control Baroque palaces are built around an entrance of courts grand staircases and reception rooms of sequentially increasing opulence In similar profusions of detail art music architecture and literature inspired each other in the Baroque cultural movementcitation needed as artists explored what they could create from repeated and varied patterns Some traits and aspects of Baroque paintings that differentiate this style from others are the abundant amount of details often bright polychromy less realistic faces of subjects and an overall sense of awe which was one of the goals in Baroque art

The word baroque probably derives from the ancient Portuguese noun barrococitation needed which is a pearl that is not round but of unpredictable and elaborate shape Hence in informal usage the word baroque can simply mean that something is elaborate with many details without reference to the Baroque styles of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries

The Classical period is about Sometimes classical music is used to mean any art music that is not pop music but in the History of Music the term classical music means music from the late 1700s and the first years of the 1800s This was a time when people became very interested in ancient Roman and Greek art

In music it was the time of composers like Joseph Haydn Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Ludwig van Beethoven Orchestras became bigger and composers often wrote longer pieces of music called symphonies that had several sections Some movements of a symphony were loud and fast other movements were quiet and sad The form of a piece of music was very important at this time and becoming very popular Music had to have a nice shape They often used a structure which was called sonata form

Another important type of music was the string quartet which is a piece of music written for two violins a viola and a violoncello Like symphonies string quartet music had several sections Haydn Mozart and Beethoven each wrote many famous string quartets

The piano was invented during this time Composers liked the piano because it could be used to play dynamics Other popular instruments included the violin the violoncello the flute the clarinet and the oboe

Joseph Hadyn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart were so powerful in their music that they influenced the western style of music

The 19th century is called the Romantic period Composers were particularly interested in conveying their emotions through music An important instrument from the Romantic period was the piano Some composers such as Frederic Chopin wrote subdued expressive quietly emotional piano pieces Often music described a feeling or told a story using sounds Other composers such as Franz Schubert wrote songs for a singer and a piano player called Lied These Lieder told stories by using the lyrics of the song and by the imaginative piano accompaniments Other composers like Richard Strauss and Franz Liszt created narratives and told stories using only music which is called a tone poem Composers such as Franz Liszt and Johannes Brahms used the piano to play loud dramatic strongly emotional music

Many composers began writing music for bigger orchestras with as many as 100 instruments It was the period of Nationalism when many composers made music using folksong or melodies from their country Lots of famous composers lived at this time such as Franz Schubert Felix Mendelssohn Frederic Chopin Johannes Brahms Pyotr Tchaikovsky and Richard Wagner

From about 1900 onwards is called the modern period Many 20th century composers wanted to compose music that sounded different from the Classical and Romantic music Modern composers searched for new ideas such as using new instruments different forms different sounds or different harmonies

The composer Arnold Schoenberg wrote pieces which were atonal Later Schoenberg invented a new system for writing music called twelve tone system Music written with the twelve tone system sounds strange to some but is mathematical in nature often making sense only after careful study Pure twelve tone music was popular among academics in the fifties and sixties but some composers such as Benjamin Britten use it today when it is necessary to get a certain feel 

Igor Stravinsky wrote music with very complicated chords and rhythms Some composers thought music was getting too complicated and so they wrote Minimalist pieces which use very simple ideas In the 1950s and 1960s composers such as Karlheinz Stockhausen experimented with electronic music using electronic circuits amplifiers and loudspeakers In the 1970s composers began using electronic synthesizers and musical instruments from rock and roll music such as the electric guitar They used these new instruments to make new sounds

Composers writing in the 1990s and the 2000s such as John Adams and James MacMillan often use a mixture of all these ideas but they like to write tonal music with easy tunes as well

Music can now be produced electronically Most commonly keyboards electric guitars and disk tables and very often computer generated sounds They can mimic traditional instruments and also produce very different sounds

Jazz is a type of music that was invented around 1900 in New Orleans in the south of the USA There were many black musicians living there who played a style of music called blues music Blues music was influenced by African music Blues music was a music that was played by singing using the harmonica or the acoustic guitar Many blues songs had sad lyrics about sad emotions or sad experiences such as losing a job a family member dying or having to go to jail

Jazz music mixed together blues music with European music Some black composers such as Scott Joplin were writing music called ragtime which had a very different rhythm from standard European music but used notes that were similar to some European music Ragtime was a big influence on early jazz called Dixieland jazz Jazz musicians used instruments such as the trumpet saxophone and clarinet were used for the tunes drums for percussion and plucked double bass piano banjo and guitar for the background rhythm Jazz is usually improvised the players make up the music as they play Even though jazz musicians are making up the music jazz music still has rules the musicians play a series of chords in order

Jazz music has a swinging rhythm The word swing is hard to explain For a rhythm to be a swinging rhythm it has to feel natural and relaxed Swing rhythm is not even like a march There is a long short feel instead of a same same feel A swinging rhythm also gets the people who are listening excited because they like the sound of it Some people say that a swinging rhythm happens when all the jazz musicians start to feel the same pulse and energy from the song If a jazz band plays very well together people will say that is a swinging jazz band or that band really swings well

Jazz influenced other types of music like the Western art music from the 1920s and 1930s Art music composers such as George Gershwin wrote music that was influenced by jazz Jazz music influenced pop music songs In the 1930s and 1940s many pop music songs began using chords or melodies from jazz songs One of the best known jazz musicians was Louis Armstrong

Pop music is a type of popular music that many people like to listen to The term pop music can be used for all kinds of music that was written to be popular The word pop music was used from about 1880 onwards when a type of music called music was popular

Modern pop music grew out of 1950s rock and roll and rockabilly In the 1960s The Beatles became a famous pop music group In the 1970s other styles of music were mixed with pop music such as funk and soul music Pop music generally has a heavy beat so that it is good for dancing Pop singers normally sing with microphones that are plugged into an amplifier and a loudspeaker

Musical notation means the way music is written down It is very useful to be able to read and write music because this is how composers can tell the person playing their music how they want their music to be played Music is written on five parallel lines called a staff

Notes are put on the lines and in the spaces between the lines It can be seen from the shape whether the music goes up or down The lengths of the notes are shown by making the note heads black or white and by giving them stems and flags Reading music involves being able to tell what the note is called and where to find it on the instrument and being able imagine the sound as well as learning about music theory This all helps someone to become a good musician

It is also useful to be able to play by ear Most rock musicians blues musicians and folk musicians play by ear This means that to learn a song they listen to other people singing it or to a recording until they know how the tune of the song goes

People can enjoy music by listening to it They can go to concerts to hear musicians perform Classical music is usually performed in concert halls but sometimes huge festivals are organized in which it is performed outside in a field or stadium like pop festivals People can listen to music on CDs Computers iPods television the radio cassetterecord players and even mobile phones

There is so much music today in elevators shopping malls and stores that it often becomes a background sound that we do not really hear Sometimes it is good to listen more closely to music by trying to hear the different instruments and what types of notes the instruments are playing

People can learn to play an instrument such as the piano the guitar the bass the trumpet the drums or the tuba They must choose an instrument that is practical for their size For example a very short child cannot play a full size double bass because the double bass is over five feet high People should choose an instrument that they enjoy playing because playing regularly is the only way to get better Finally it helps to have a good teacher

Anyone can make up his or her own pieces of music It is not difficult to compose simple songs or melodies Its easier for people who can play an instrument themselves All it takes is experimenting with the sounds that an instrument makes Someone can make up a piece that tells a story or just find a nice tune and think about ways it can be changed each time it is repeated The instrument might be someones own voice

Madrid is the capital and largest city of Spain The capital used to be Valladolid until 1560

Money is what people use to buy things and services  and what they take for selling their own things or services There are many kinds of money in the world Most countries have their own kind of money such as the United States dollar or the British pound

Money is also called many other names like currency or cash Most of the time a state or a government prints paper money and makes coins at a special place called a mint

Money is what you use to buy things The idea of trading things is very old A long time ago people did not buy or sell with money Instead they traded one thing for another to get what they wanted or needed One person who owned many cows could trade with another person who owned much wheat Each would trade a little of what he had with the other and support the people on his farm This is known as barter Other things that were easier to carry around than cows also came to be held as valuable and were used as trade items such as jewelry and spices 

When people changed from trading in things like cows and wheat to using money instead they needed things that would last a long time still be valuable and could be carried around The first country in the world to make metal coins was called Lydia sometime around 650 BC in the western part of what is now Turkey The Lydian coins were made of a weighed amount of precious metal and were stamped with a picture of a lion This idea soon spread to Greece the rest of the Mediterranean and the rest of the world Coins were all made to the same size and shape In some parts of the world different things have been used as money like clam shells or blocks of salt

Besides being easier to carry than cows using money had many other advantages Money is easier to divide than many trade goods If someone own cows and wants to trade for only half a cows worth of wheat he probably does not want to cut his cow in half But if he sells his cow for money and buys wheat with money he can get exactly the amount he wants

Cows die and wheat rots But money lasts longer than most trade goods If someone sells a cow for money he can save that money away until he needs it He can always leave it to his children when he dies It can last a very long time and he can use it at any time

Not every cow is as good as another cow Some cows are sick and old and others are healthy and young Some wheat is good and other wheat is moldy or stale So if a person trades cows for wheat he might have a hard time arguing over how much wheat each cow is worth But money is standard That means one dollar is worth the same as another dollar It is easier to add up and count money than to add up the value of different cows or amounts of wheat 

Later after coins had been used for hundreds of years paper money started out as a promise to pay in coin much like an IOU note The first true paper money was used in China between 600 and 1455 and paper money was also printed in Sweden between 1660 and 1664 Both times it did not work well and had to be stopped because the banks kept running out of coins to pay on the notes Massachusetts Bay Colony printed paper money in the 1690s and this time the use became more common

Today most of what people think of as money is not even things you can hold It is numbers in bank accounts saved in computer memories A large number of people still feel more comfortable using coins and paper and do not totally trust using electronic money on a computer memory

Many types of money have been used at different times in history These are

Commodity money can be used for other purposes besides serving as a medium of exchange We say it possesses intrinsic value because it is useful or valuable by itself Some examples of commodity money are cattle silk gold and silver Convertible paper money is money that is convertible into gold and silver Gold and Silver certificates are convertible paper money as they can be fully convertible into gold and silver 

Inconvertible money is money that cannot be converted into gold and silver Notes and coins are inconvertible money They are incovertible and are declared by the government money They are also a countrys legal tender Today notes and coins are the currencies used in df the money used is bank deposits 

Types of bank deposits

Multiplication is an arithmetic operation for finding the product of two numbers Multiplication is the third operation in maths after addition which is the first subtraction which is the second and then there is multiplication

With natural numbers it tells you the number of tiles in a rectangle where one of the two numbers equals the number of tiles on one side and the other number equals the number of tiles on the neighbouring side

With real numbers it tells you the area of a rectangle where the first number equals the size of one side and the second number equals the size of the neighbouring side

For example three multiplied by five is the total of five threes added together or the total of three fives This can be written down as 3 5 15 or spoken as three times five equals fifteen Mathematicians call the two numbers you wish to multiply coefficients together or multiplicand and multiplicator separately Multiplicand multiplicator product

Multiplication between numbers is said to be commutative when the order of the numbers does not influence the value of the product This is true for the Integers eg 4 6 is the same as 6 4 and also for the Rational numbers and for all the other Real numbers and also for Complex numbers It is not true for quaternions vectors or matrices

The opposite of multiplication is division

Windows is a popular Microsoft product It is an operating system which means that it is the basic software that makes peoples computers work and lets other programs work Most computers have some kind of Windows like Windows XP or Windows Vista Microsoft Office is also very popular and it lets people write documents on their computer with Microsoft Word make charts and graphs with Microsoft Excel make presentations with Microsoft PowerPoint and do many other things

Internet Explorer lets people look at things on the Internet Microsoft makes other programs on the Internet A lot of it is called Windows Live service with the name Windows Live put in front of the name of the service like Windows Live Hotmail The Xbox and the new Xbox 360 are videogame consoles which means they let people play videogames on their TV Microsoft is one of three big companies that make consoles The other two are Nintendo and Sony Xbox Live lets people play online against other people anywhere in the world Microsoft also makes many PC games

Windows can be two things

The Islamic World consists of all people who are in Islam It is not an exact location but rather a community When they do things together as Muslims they are the umma which means community referring to all of the believers The faith emphasizes unity and defense of fellow Muslims so it is common for these nations to cooperate Recent conflicts in the Muslim World have sometimes spread because of this desire to cooperate It is also likely that some have been made shorter and less damaging because of it Some might even have never started

Muslims are in many countries In 52 nations Muslims are the majority Almost all are Sunni They speak about 60 languages and come from all ethnic backgrounds 

346 million Muslims in Somalia

The Al Jazeera satellite TV network in the Arabic language is a news source many Muslims watch

In most Muslim nations the government is the main source of news This sometimes makes it very difficult or dangerous to make anti government statements

There are however many other news programmes and websites in the Muslim world

Islamic law exists in many variations  in Arabic it is called shariah  five schools of which were created centuries ago These are the classical fiqh the Hanafi school from India Pakistan and Bangaladesh West Africa Egypt the Maliki in North Africa and West Africa the Shafi in Malaysia and Indonesia the Hanbali in Arabia and Jaferi in Iran and Iraq  where the majority is Shia All five are very old and many Muslims feel a new fiqh must be created for modern society Islam has a method for doing this al urf and ijtihad are the words to describe this method but they have not been used in a long time and few people are trusted enough to use them to make new laws

So in most of the Muslim world people are very conservative especially about alcohol adultery abortion and women working in jobs where they are used to lure customers

Muslim women often dress extremely modestly and many do so by choice But in some countries they have been forced to do so against their will This is one of the things that causes tension between the Western World and that of Muslims

Islamic economics bans debt but in most Muslim countries Western banking is allowed This is another issue that many Muslims have with the Western world

One quarter of the world population share Islam as an ethical tradition 

Many people in these countries also see Islam as a political movement In democratic countries there is usually at least one Islamic party

Political Islam is powerful in all Muslim majority countries Islamic parties in Pakistan and Algeria have taken power 

Many in these movements call themselves Islamists which also sometimes describes more militant Islamic groups The relationships between these groups and their views of democracy are complex

Some of these groups are called terrorists because they attack civilians of other non Muslim nations to make a political point

Israel is very unpopular in the Muslim world because of the Israeli Palestinian conflict and the way that the state of Israel came into being in 1948 which many Arabs thought was unfair

Some Muslims see this as a fight against Judaism or Jews but not all In Morocco for instance the Islamists recently invited Jews to join the party Jewish groups also cooperate with Arabs in the West Bank where Neturei Karta leader Rabbi Mosche Hirsch served as the Minister for Jewish Affairs in the Fatah before there was a Palestinian Authority Like the Arabs this small group of Jews thought the way Israel was created was not right However very few Jews believe this and most support Israel as a state

In 1979 there was a big shift in the way the Muslim world dealt with the rest of the world In that year Egypt made peace with Israel Iran became an Islamic state after a revolution and there was an invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union A lot of things changed in that year By 2001 the Soviet Union was gone Jordan had also made peace with Israel and on September 11 2001 there were major attacks on the US  which most people believe were made to drive the United States out of the Muslim world especially Saudi Arabia In many ways the events of 1979 led to the events of 2001

The 2001 invasion of Afghanistan and 2003 invasion of Iraq are called part of a War on Terrorism by the United States Many or most Muslims see it as a War on Islam After the invasion the Islamic parties won more seats and a majority of Muslims polled in many nations expressed support for Osama bin Laden and said he would do the right thing Olivier Roy is a French scholar who thinks that this does not express support for al Qaeda or militant Islam but opposing colonialism and what many Muslims call racism  favourable treatment for Jews especially those living in West Bank settlements many of whom have American or British passport and which the United Nations says have no right to live there

The situation is very complicated and there are many different views of it

The Organization of Islamic Conference formed in 1969 lets the Muslim nations work as a group Russia joined in 2003

The Arab League is a smaller group of only the Arab countries

OPEC is another forum where issues between the Muslim and non Muslim world come up In 1973 to protest US support for Israel there was an oil embargo which caused the 1973 energy crisis

A multiverse is the theory of a set of multiple possible universes including our universe which make up reality These universes are sometimes called parallel universes It is believed by somewho physicists that our universe is perfect for life because it had thousands of other chances at life each of which is a different universe in the multiverse The term multiverse was coined by psychologist William James

The mechanistic paradigm also known as the Newtonian paradigm assumes that things in the environment around humans are more like machines than like life It was more common in the 19th century This is a set of loosely related beliefs that affects all sciences

Believers in this paradigm sometimes say that those who do not believe in it are following a cognitive paradigm  but almost no one uses this term since it is redundant  cognitive science is already accepted as the most basic idea in the philosophy of science But mechanists reject some of the ideas of cognitive scientists like cognitive science of mathematics

Mechanistic thinking also assumes that philosophy of perception is much less important than cognitive scientists say it is  that humans and their beliefs and equipment do not generally add a lot of bias to a scientific theory Thomas Kuhn said otherwise that these things matter and that the major assumptions of science can shift drastically This he called a paradigm shift The shift from mechanistic to cognitive paradigm is an example of this Later he used other words to describe the assumptions and beliefs like mind set but the word paradigm is still used Some say it is much over used

Economics is often said to suffer from assumptions of the mechanistic paradigm Sometimes those who believe in neoclassical economics and also in the mechanistic paradigm say they seek to unify physics and economics as if people and particles behaved as two examples of the same kind of thing

Technology is often easier to make if people accept a mechanistic paradigm  but it may be harder to say why it does not work if one believes in these ideas For instance creating diagnostic trees might be easier if one works from experience not from an idea of how a technology should or must work

A controversial idea is that mechanistic ideas are just an older idea called scholasticism with more mathematics Both tried to work from what should or must be instead of what experiment seemed to show

Another controversial idea is that scientism belief in science as if it were a religion or ethical tradition comes from this paradigm Most scientists who are mechanistic do not say they see science as a guide to ethics but try to keep them separate

As MediaWiki is a complex software there would always be bugs in the software especially for new extensions Therefore Wikimedia has created a bugzilla website for people who see a bug to tell the developers of MediaWiki

Some extensions of MediaWiki use the Wikimedia Bugzilla while some just use the talk pages of the extension page

During the development of MediaWiki different skins have came into the main software For example Wikipedia used to be using Nostalgia But it changed to Monobook before the new Vector skin came up in 116

A survey done by Wikimedia showed that more people prefer the Vector skin

It is possible to change the skin that a user wants to see a wiki as by going to their preferences

A first language is the language a person first learns A persons first language helps them understand words and concepts in the style of that first language

First language sometimes does not mean this however

Sometimes first language means the language a person speaks best

Sometimes first language second language and third language show how well one speaks a language so a person can have more than one first language or second language

Most sciences create and use models of nature

For instance models of our universe are part of astrophysics  the biggest things in nature  and physics  the smallest This is not usually what we mean by nature however We mean the models studied in biology ecology economics environmental health and healing Most models of nature are of things that humans really affect directly and which affect humans back

For instance to dump toxic waste in a river will harm others down the river But without models of nature we do not know who and cannot say how much is harmful

Models of nature affect human decision making They are very important to human health wellness and economics They also matter in ethics since most people wish to reduce harm done by their decisions They matter in law because harms can be proven to have been done in a court

A forest is very hard to bring back to life once it is degraded Smaller models of bits of nature help to understand how much must be left so future generations can use nature too

In many ways humans and nature can be said to be in conflict Natural capital like soil and large healthy trees which nature needs to make more of itself is also useful to humans as natural resources To know how much can be drawn out of nature before it dies is important This is another reason for a model

There are three main ways in which models of nature affect human life

To preserve nature ecology movement activists now cooperate in a global power network It includes not just parties in politics but also NGOs like Greenpeace Earth First or World Wide Fund for Nature

One model of nature they have agreed on is a map that shows ecoregions which are the natural borders of ecology maps According to this map there are 867 regions divided into 8 ecozones  plus others which are in the ocean

Most anthropologists agree that aboriginal languages have a small model of local nature in them For instance there will be more words to describe snow in an Arctic language and more words to describe shades of green in a rainforest This is part of the reason to use ecology borders in politics since people who do not live inside the border do not see or make the same distinctions about nature

A very small number of people think that humans do not need nature at all and can replace everything that it does To prove them wrong some economists made another model of nature

Economists study natures services to see how hard it would be to replace what nature does for humans They showed in 1995 that the services nature performed for humans were more valuable than all services humans perform for each other all over the world The value of Earth as a living thing was much more than we could ever afford to replace with our own technology There has been no real disagreement about any of this

Pricing all the value of Earth to humans gives a huge number  which proves the pricing is right since we must put a high price on anything we have no way to replace

The hair that grows on the upper lip of some men is called a mustache The hair that grows on the sides of the face and chin of some men is called a beard Some men have a lot of hair and a big mustache and some have very little In the modern world many men shave part or all of their mustaches or cut their mustache so it does not get very long A chin beard with no mustache is called a goatee whilst a chin beard with a mustache is known as a Van Dyke

Some animals such as walruses also have hair like this and people sometimes also call this hair a mustache

A mile is a unit of length There are many different kinds of mile 

Statute mile In the US and the UK the word mile usually means the statute mile 

The nautical mile is used for sea or air travel 

The nautical mile was originally defined as one minute of arc along a line of longitude of the Earth There are 60 minutes of arc in one degree or arc So there were 10800 nautical miles from the North Pole to the South Pole

Now the nautical mile is defined as 1852 metres

The mile was first used by the Romans It comes from the Latin phrase mille passus This means one thousand paces A pace is the distance each foot moves when taking one step

Margarine is an artificial butter It can be made from vegetable oil or animal fat It may also contain skimmed milk salt and emulsifiers Margarine is used in many baked products It contains less fat than butter so is often chosen instead of it There are also low fat margarines which contain even less fat However many types of margarine contain trans fats which are unhealthy and can cause heart disease Other vegetables fats like olive oil are a better choice for cooking

The Milky Way is our home galaxy It contains over 200 billion stars including our Sun 

The Milky Way has a diameter of 100000 light years The discovery of the Milky Way goes back to the Ancient Greek philosopher Democritus The Milky Way galaxy is a barred spiral galaxy

This galaxy belongs to a local group of three large galaxies and 30 smaller galaxies Milky Way is the second biggest galaxy in the group behind the Andromeda Galaxy Milky Ways closest neighbour is Canis Major Dwarf which is about 25000 light years away from the Earth The Andromeda Galaxy moves towards the Milky Way Galaxy and will meet it in about 3 billion years Andromeda Galaxy moves with a speed of about 1800 kilometres per minute

The stellar disk of the Milky Way Galaxy is approximately 100000 light years in diameter and is considered to be on average about 1000 light years thick 

It is estimated to contain at least 200 billion stars and possibly up to 400 billion stars The figure depends on the number of very low mass or dwarf stars which are hard to detect especially more than 300 light years from our sun Therefore present estimates of the total number are uncertain This can be compared to the one trillion stars of the neighbouring Andromeda Galaxy

The stellar disc of the Milky Way does not have a sharp edge a radius beyond which there are no stars Rather the number of stars drops smoothly with distance from the centre of the Galaxy Beyond a radius of about 40000 light years the number of stars drops much faster for reasons that are not understood

Extending beyond the stellar disk is a much thicker disk of gas Recent observations indicate that the gaseous disk of the Milky Way has a thickness of around 12000 light yearstwice the previously accepted value As a guide to the relative physical scale of the Milky Way if the Solar System out to the orbit of Pluto were reduced to the size of a US quarter the Milky Way would be the size of the continental United States west of the Mississippi

The Galactic Halo extends outward but is limited in size by the orbits of two Milky Way satellites the Large and the Small Magellanic Clouds whose perigalacticon is at about 180000 light years At this distance or beyond the orbits of most halo objects would be disrupted by the Magellanic Clouds and the objects would likely be ejected from the vicinity of the Milky Way

The galactic disc which bulges outward at the galactic center has a diameter of 70100000 light years 

The exact distance from the Sun to the galactic center is debated The latest estimates give distances to the Galactic center of 2528000 light years

Movement of material around the galactic center shows that it has a compact object of very large mass The intense radio source named Sagittarius A thought to mark the center of the Milky Way is now confirmed to be a supermassive black hole Most galaxies are believed to have a supermassive black hole at their center

The nature of the galaxys bar is also actively debated with estimates for its half length and orientation spanning from 330016000 light years and 1050 degrees Viewed from the Andromeda Galaxy it would be the brightest feature of our own galaxy

Movement or motion is the state of changing somethings position that is changing where something is A flying bird or a walking person are moving because they change where they are from one place to another There are many kinds of science and math related to movement

For example thanks to Albert Einstein we know that all position is relative This means that everythings position depends on where they exist in relation to other things For example a ball is 5 feet away from a box 3 feet away from a chair and a foot away from a table According to Einstein the balls position means how far the ball is from other things so by telling you how far the ball was from other things I told you its position An objects movement is also relative Its movement depends on where it is in relation to other things and where its going to in relation to other things

There are many things involved in movement such as speed velocity acceleration gravity magnetic attraction and repulsion friction and inertia Also work is needed to produce movement Light moves at about 300000 kilometres per second or 186000 miles per second

Metaphor is a figure of speech It uses words not literally but figuratively It takes a word from its original context and uses it in another

We use metaphors to make indirect comparisons but without using like or as because that would be a simile A simile is a direct comparison Jane is like a child

Most metaphors are concepts see conceptual metaphor

A metaphor very often uses the verb to be love is war for example not love is like war Poetry includes much metaphor usually more than prose

Idioms use metaphors or are metaphors for example the English phrase to kick the bucket means to die 

Spam is an example that any email user knows about this word was originally a metaphor from Spam a type of canned meat Servers putting unwanted email into somebodys inbox was similar to waiters putting unwanted Spam into food This was originally suggested by a Monty Python skit When we use a metaphor very often and we forget the old meaning or forget that the two meanings are connected this is a dead metaphor

Originally metaphor was a Greek word for transfer It came from meta and pherein So the word metaphor in English was a metaphor too Today in Greek metaphor is a trolley

A simple metaphor has a single link between the subject and the metaphoric vehicle The vehicle thus has a single meaning which is transferred directly to the subject

In the simple metaphor the cognitive effort to understand what the author or speaker intends is relatively low and hence it may easily be used with a wider and less sophisticated audience

The simple metaphor may be contrasted against metaphors which have multiple elements and meanings for example in the compound metaphor or complex metaphor

A simple metaphor is also known as a tight metaphor

A complex metaphor happens where a simple metaphor is based on a secondary metaphoric element For example using a metaphor of light for understanding may be complexified by saying throwing light rather than shining light Throwing is an extra metaphor for how light arrives 

A compound metaphor is one where there are multiple parts in the metaphor that are used to snag the listener These parts may be enhancement words such as adverbs adjectives etc

Each part in the compound metaphor may be used to signify an additional item of meaning

Compound metaphors are like a multiple punch hitting the listener repeatedly with metaphoric elements Where the complex metaphor uses stacked layers to enhance the metaphor the compound metaphor uses sequential words The compound metaphor is also known as a loose metaphor

A live metaphor is one which a reader notices A dead metaphor is one no one notices because it has become so common in the language 

Two people walk off a tennis court Someone asks the loser What happened

Metabolism is the system of chemical activities by which a living thing gets power from other things such as food This depends for example on how often someone eats If they are hungry their metabolism slows down dramatically Metabolism uses energy to fuel all organs involved in digestion and respiration and so on The new amount of energy used to carry out these life processes is called the BMR rate or basal metabolic rate The bigger someone is the higher their metabolism rate would become in order to sustain their mass

A microscope is a scientific instrument that makes things normally too small to see look bigger so they can be seen better and examined correctly People who use microscopes commonly in their jobs include doctors and scientists

The earliest microscopes had only 1 lens and are called simple microscopes Compound microscopes have at least 2 lenses 

In a compound microscope the lens closer to the eye is called the eyepiece The lens at the other end is called the objective

Microscopes make things seem larger than they are from 10 times larger to about 1000 times larger This is much stronger than a magnifying glass

Microscopes are commonly used in schools such as high schools to benefit their students in science classes such as biology or chemistry class

There are many different types of microscopes The most common are compound light microscopes and electron microscopes Compound light microscopes reflect light under the object being looked at Light then passes through two lenses and makes the image bigger Electron microscopes come in different types as well Transmission electron microscopes fire electrons into the object being looked at which carry information about how the object looks into a lens This is then magnified onto a television screen Scanning electron microscopes also fire electrons at the object but in a single beam These lose their power when they strike the object and the loss of power results in something else being generated usually an X ray This is read and magnified onto a screen

The mass of an object is a measure of the amount of matter in this object A mountain has typically more mass than a rock for instance Mass should not be confused with the related but quite different concept of weight

The unit of mass in the International System of Units is the kilogram which is represented by the symbol kg Fractions and multiples of this basic unit include the gram and the tonne amongst many others

In some fields or applications it is convenient to use different units to simplify the discussions or writings For instance

Traditional units are still in encountered in some countries Imperial units such as the ounce or the pound were in widespread use within the British Empire Some of them are still popular in the United States which also uses units like the short ton ton and the long ton not to be confused with the metric tonne

Mass is an intrinsic property of the object it does not depend on its volume or position in space for instance For a long time it has been known that the sum of the masses of objects that interact or of the chemicals that react remain conserved throughout these processes This remains an excellent approximation for everyday life and even most laboratory work

where c stands for the speed of light This change in mass is only important when the speed of the object with respect to the observer becomes a large fraction of c

Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System It is the closest planet to the sun It makes one trip around the Sun once every 87969 days Mercury is bright when it is able to be seen from Earth ranging from 20 to 55 in apparent magnitude but is not easily seen as it is usually too close to the Sun Since Mercury is normally lost in the glare of the Sun unless there is a solar eclipse Mercury can only be seen in the morning or evening twilight

Compared to what is known about the other planets in the Solar System little is known about Mercury telescopes on the Earth show only a small bright crescent The first of two spacecraft to visit the planet was Mariner 10 which mapped only about 45 of the planets surface from 1974 to 1975 The second is the MESSENGER spacecraft which mapped another 30 during its trip to Mercury on January 14 2008 MESSENGER made one more pass by Mercury in 2009 and is now orbiting the planet to complete the mapping

Mercury looks a lot like our Moon it has many craters with areas of smooth plains no moons around it and no atmosphere Mercury does have what is known as an exosphere However unlike the moon it has a large iron core which gives off a magnetic field about 1 as strong as that of the Earth It is a very dense planet due to the large size of its core Surface temperatures can be anywhere from about 90 to 700 K with the subsolar point being the hottest and the bottoms of craters near the poles being the coldest

Known sightings of Mercury date back to at least the first millennium BC Before the 4th century BC Greek astronomers thought that Mercury was two different objects one able to be seen only at sunrise which they called Apollo the other that was only able to be seen at sunset which they called Hermes The English name for the planet is from the Romans who named it after the Roman god Mercury which they thought to be the same as the Greek god Hermes The symbol for Mercury is based on Hermes staff

Mercury is one of four inner planets in the Solar System and has a rocky body like the Earth It is the smallest planet in the Solar System with a radius of 24397 km Mercury is even smaller though it has a greater mass than the largest moons in our Solar System Mercury is made of about 70 metallic and 30 silicate material Mercurys density is the second highest in the Solar System at 5427 gcm only a little bit less than Earths

Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun in the Solar System Mars is dry rocky and cold It is home to the largest volcano in the Solar System Mars is named after the mythological Roman god of war because it is a red planet which signifies the colour of blood

Mars has two very small moons called Phobos and Deimos The planet Mars is made of rock The ground there is red because of iron oxide in the rocks and dust The planet has a small carbon dioxide atmosphere The temperatures on Mars are colder than on Earth because it is farther away from the Sun There is some ice at the north and south poles of Mars and also frozen carbon dioxide Mars does not have any water on the surface now except at the poles but most scientists think it used to have water

The average thickness of the planets crust is about 50 km with a maximum thickness of 125 km Earths crust on average 40 km is three times smaller than Mars crust based on the sizes of the two planets if they are made equal

Mars has been known since the old times The Greeks named this planet Ares after their god of war The Romans named the planet Mars after their God

Some of the first attempts at making a map of Mars were done by Giovanni Schiaparelli What he saw through his telescope confused him He saw what he called canali which he thought were ditches dug for water to pass through Because of this people thought that there were other animals and life on Mars possibly even aliens Today we know there cannot be any such aliens This is because the crafts sent to Mars have found no trace of alien life and what could have been bacteria were formed at temperatures too high for life to exist What Giovanni actually saw were the scratches on his telescope lense This may sound completely absurd but this is really what happened he spent his whole life studying the marks on his telescope thinking they were alien made water streams

Because Mars is the one of the closest planets to Earth in the Solar System some people have wondered if there is any kind of life on Mars Recently scientists found an old meteorite that had landed near the Earths South Pole and decided it had come from Mars In the meteorite they found some very tiny little shapes in the rock which they think might be fossils made by living things However they were not sure if it was life or just the natural patterns of the rock If it were the fossils of a living thing it was probably some simple plant and one hundred of them could fit across the width of a single hair

It is also possible that there are also pieces of the Earth on Mars If a giant meteorite hit the Earth the force would be strong enough to send pieces of the earth up to space If a piece of Earth left the atmosphere it would take along with it lots of cells and bacteria which are living things

Mars rotates in 24 hours and 37 minutes It rotates on a broken wikt linktilttilt just like the Earth does so it has four different seasons However these seasons are quite different from the seasons on Earth Winter spring fall and summer would all be freezing cold because it is always freezing on Mars Mars is too far away from the sun to get enough energy from the suns light and the atmosphere is much too thin to keep the warmth inside The usual temperature on Mars is usually about 81 degrees below zero and in the summer the temperature goes up about 32 degrees Because it is so cold on Mars carbon dioxide freezes in the winter and makes a lot of dry ice

On earth there is much liquid water but people have not found any liquid water on Mars Scientists think that all of the water on Mars is frozen The summer in Mars is warm enough to get rid of the dry ice but it is not warm enough to melt the ice that is made of water Scientists think that the rest of the water on Mars is permanently frozen in the ground However Opportunity rover has found a rock formation on Mars which suggests that the rocks might have been in salt water once The Spirit rover also found traces of a mineral called jarosite which is made in liquid water So there is some evidence that liquid water did once exist on Mars

Even though Mars is really cold its actually closer to the Earths temperature than any other planet in the Solar System This is the reason lots of people think of sending humans to Mars one day and dream of building an broken wikt linkartificeartificial ecosystem that will protect people

Mars has a very thin atmosphere with barely any oxygen Because there is an atmosphere however thin it is the sky does change colors when the sun rises and sets The dust in the Martian atmosphere make the Martian sunsets have a rather blue color Marss atmosphere of course is too thin to protect Mars from meteors well which is why the bottom half of Mars has so many craters Some craters hit Mars with so much force a few pieces of Mars went flying into space  even into Earth People have actually found rocks on Earth that have chemicals in them  chemicals that are like the ones in Martian rocks These rocks also look like they fell really quickly through the atmosphere so it is reasonable to think they came from Mars

Mars is home to the highest known mountain in the Solar System Olympus Mons Olympus Mons is about 17 miles high This is more than three times the height of Earths tallest mountain Mount Everest

Some famous stories were written about this idea The writers used the name Martians for intelligent beings from Mars In 1898 H G Wells wrote The War of the Worlds a famous novel about Martians attacking the Earth In 1938 Orson Welles broadcast a radio version of this story in the United States and many people thought it was really happening and were very afraid Beginning in 1912 Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote several novels about adventures on Mars

As of February 2011 scientists have not found life on Mars either living now or extinct Several space probes without people have gone to Mars to study it Some have orbited the planet and some have landed on it There are pictures of the surface of Mars that were sent back to Earth by some of these probes Some people are interested in sending astronauts to visit Mars This would be difficult The astronauts would be in space for many years and it could be very dangerous because of radiation from the sun

The Macintosh Operating System is a program that allows a Macintosh computer to operate and be used by humans Mac OS was first made by Apple Inc in 1984 In those days Mac OS was called Macintosh System Software which was shortened to System or SSW The term Mac OS first appeared in the splash screen for System 751 but was not adopted as the new name until the release of Mac OS 76

The latest version of Mac OS is Mac OS X 1072

The Apple Macintosh or just Mac is a very successful line of personal computers made by the brand Apple The Macintosh was one of the first computers in which the people could use a mouse for pointing on a screen which had icons This new way of working with a computer was known as graphic user interface It was this feature of the Macintosh that made it so popular

Macintosh were different than other personal computers for many years based on their central processor unit At the start Macs used Motorola 68000 chips instead of Intel chips Later Macs used PowerPC chips In 2006 Macs started to use Intel chips Today Macs are sold with Intel quad core i7 chips See Apple Intel transition

Today three types of Macintoshes are sold The laptops are called MacBooks or earlier PowerBooks The less powerful desktop computers are called iMacs The most powerful desktop computers which can be interally expanded are called Mac Pros or earlier PowerMacs

There are several versions of the iMac The design of the iMac is very pleasant It can be recognized easily It has a big screen is made of aluminum and has a very rich feel to it It has a very enjoyable interface It has big and colourful icons and very good picture quality

The Mac does not have Windows operating system installed in it It has its own range of operating systems The newest operating system is known as Lion OS X or However Macs can run both Windows and Lion at the same time

In general Macintosh computers cost more than other computers of the same size But it is very good in quality

Other popular products of Apple include iPod iPhone and iPad

A metre is the basic unit of length in the SI measurement system The abbreviation for the metre is m The first meaning it was 110000000th of the distance between the Earths equator and the North Pole along the Paris meridian The metre is now officially defined as the distance light travels in a vacuum in 1299792458th of a second

In the imperial system of measurement one metre is equal to about 3937 inches 328 feet or about 109 yards

Note units in bold are the most commonly used

A magnifying glass is a lens through which you can look to make things appear bigger so you can see them better 

The magnifying glass consists of a piece of convex shaped glass or plastic It has to be held at the right distance between the eye and the object The magnifying glass usually comes with a handle A telescope is a more advanced kind of magnifying glass and consists of at least two glass lenses 

A pair of binoculars is like a telescope for each eye Spectacles or eyeglasses also use lenses to correct a persons vision

A molecule is the smallest amount of a chemical substance that can exist If a molecule were split into smaller pieces it would be a different substance

Molecules are made up of atoms that are stuck together in a particular shape or form Not all combinations of atoms are usually possible atoms like certain shapes but not others For example oxygen atoms always have two bonds with other atoms carbon atoms always have four bonds with other atoms and nitrogen atoms always have three bonds with other atoms

In gases like air the molecules are just flying around In liquids like water the molecules are stuck together but they can still move In solids like sugar the molecules can only vibrate 

With a molecular formula you can write down the numbers of all atoms in a molecule For example the molecular formula of sugar is C6H12O6 That means that one molecule of sugar is made up of six carbon atoms twelve hydrogen atoms and six oxygen atoms

For a molecule to exist atoms have to stick together This happens when two atoms share electrons Instead of circling just one atom the electron now circles around two This is called bonding The shared electrons are called bonds Sometimes more than one electron is shared The more electrons are shared the stronger the bond gets and the stronger the atoms stick together

Bonds can also be broken apart Since most bonds require energy to form they also give off energy when they are broken But before most bonds break the molecule has to be heated Then the atoms start to move and when they move too much the bond breaks Molecules that require less energy to break than they give off when broken are called fuels For example a candle will just sit there and nothing happens But when you use a match to light it it will burn for a long time The match brings the energy to break the first bonds which release enough energy to break the bonds below them until the candle has burned down

Moral reasoning is a topic studied in psychology and in moral philosophy It studies how people think about moral issues problems and questions Psychologists who have studied it include Lawrence Kohlberg and Elliot Turiel Kohlberg said that moral understanding develops in three main stages as a person gets older but Turiel said that there are three domains of moral understanding that develop at the same time as a person gets older

Moral philosophy or ethics is a major branch of philosophy It is the study of value or quality It covers the analysis and use of concepts such as right wrong good evil and responsibility

A mosque is a place where Muslims worship The word mosque comes from the Arabic word masjid A mosque may be small and privately owned A larger collective mosque is called a masjid jmi Larger mosques offer more services to their community 

For many Muslim people a mosque is more than a place of worship Muslims worship study and discuss Islam and do many other things in a mosque and its compounds In the United Kingdom many mosques are used as community centres They are also used to teach about Islam Religious festivals and gatherings are held in mosques Weddings are one example Mosques have rules to control what people do inside One of these rules is that it is considered rude to disturb another person who is worshipping 

Many mosques are known for their Islamic architecture The earliest mosques opened in 7th century were open air spaces They are the Quba Mosque and Masjid al Nabawi Later mosques were buildings that were specially designed Nowadays mosques are every continent except Antarctica

Many mosques are famous works of architecture They are often built in a style that has stayed the same for many centuries Many mosques have prayer halls domes and minarets They may also have a courtyard 

Mosques were first built on the Arabian Peninsula The Muslims who built them used old architectural styles They also combined these styles in new ways A major influence was the palaces built during the Parthian and Sassanid dynasties of Persia The Sarvestan palace from the Sassanid era is a good example of this It has an arched entrance and a central dome These features already existed in Persia before Islam

After the Arab invasion of Persia the new style with its Sassanid influence was used for the new Islamic world Many forms of mosques have developed in different regions of the Islamic world Important mosque types include the early Abbasid mosques T type mosques and the central dome mosques of Anatolia In the 20th century many countries that grew rich from oil paid for the building of many new mosques The rulers of these countries often hired leading architects to design these mosques They included non Muslims

Many early mosques have a square or rectangular plan They also have a prayer hall and an enclosed courtyard This is known as Arab plan The first mosques of this type were built during the Umayyad Dynasty 

The flat roof of the prayer hall was supported by columns Many rows of columns were needed to support such roofs this is called hypostyle architecture One of the most famous hypostyle mosques is the Mezquita de Crdoba in Spain It is supported by over 850 columns 

In the warm Mediterranean and Middle Eastern climates the courtyard served to hold the large number of worshippers during Friday prayers Often hypostyle mosques have outer arcades They allow the visitors to enjoy the shade Arab plan mosques were built mostly during the Umayyad and Abbasid dynasties The Arab plan was very simple which did not allow for much further development This caused that style of mosque to fall out of favour

The Ottomans began building central dome mosques in the fifteenth century These mosques have a large dome centered over the prayer hall There may also be smaller domes which are off center over the prayer hall or the rest of the mosque This style was heavily influenced by the Byzantine religious architecture with its use of large central domes

Iwan mosques are famous for their domed rooms and iwans Iwans are spaces with an arched roof They have an opening at one end One or more iwans face a central courtyard that serves as the prayer hall The style borrows from pre Islamic Iranian architecture Most mosques with this style are in Iran

Most mosques have minarets Minarets are tall towers Usually they are at one of the corners of the mosque The top of the minaret is the highest point in the mosque and usually the highest point in the area around the mosque The tallest minaret in the world is in the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca Morocco

The first mosques had no minarets The most conservative Islamic groups like Wahhabis still avoid building minarets They see them as simply a fancy decoration and unnecessary The first minaret was built in 665 in Basra during the reign of the Umayyad caliph Muawiyah I Muawiyah encouraged the building of minarets as they were supposed to be the same as bell towers on Christian churches Because of this mosque architects used the shape of the bell tower for their minarets Both the minaret and the bell tower serve the same purpose to call the faithful to prayer

Before the five required daily prayers a muezzin calls the worshippers to prayer from the minaret In many countries like Singapore where Muslims are not the majority mosques are stopped from loudly playing the call to prayer The main problem is the use of electronic amplification of the call which is now widely used by mosques

The domes were often placed directly above the main prayer hall They represent the vaults of heaven and the sky At first these domes were small They only took up a small part of the roof near the mihrab Later they took the whole roof above the prayer hall Domes normally have the shape of a hemisphere The Mughals in India popularized onion shaped domes in South Asia and Persia Some mosques have several domes as well as the main large dome The other domes are often smaller

Domes would help the imam be heard as the sound waves would bounce in and then out of the dome making the voice louder

All mosques have a prayer hall which is also called musalla Normally there is no furniture in it except for prayer mats or rugs These are necessary as Islamic prayer is usually done kneeling 

Some mosques have Arabic calligraphy and Quranic verses on the walls to help worshipers focus on the beauty of Islam and its holiest book the Quran as well as for decoration

The qiblah wall is usually at the other side of the entrance to the prayer hall This wall is specially decorated In a properly sited mosque it will be set perpendicular to a line leading to Mecca People pray in rows parallel to the qiblah wall They arrange themselves so they face Mecca In the qiblah wall usually at its center is the mihrab a niche or depression showing the direction of Mecca The mihrab serves as the place where the imam leads the five daily prayers

All people must wash themselves before they pray Mosques often have fountains or other facilities for washing in their entrances or courtyards so that people can perform the washing ritual before prayer At very small mosques worshipers may use restrooms for their ritual washing In traditional mosques there is often a building specially for washing This is often in the center of the courtyard In the prayer halls people must not wear shoes for much the same reason

Modern mosques should appeal to the community they serve For this reason other facilities may also be available at the mosque like health clinics libraries and gymnasia

Adult Muslims are expected to pray five times a day Most mosques have formal prayers for each of these times If performing the prayer is difficult for example for ill people then exceptions are made 

Mosques also hold a special prayer service called jumuah This is done once a week It is a form of Sabbath and replaces the Friday prayers at the mosque Daily prayers can be done anywhere However Muslims are expected to do their Friday prayer at the mosque

When a Muslim dies a funeral prayer is normally held It is held outdoors in a courtyard or square close to the mosque The prayers have all the worshippers present including the imam taking part During eclipses mosques will host special prayers called eclipse prayers

There are two large holidays in the Islamic calendar During these days there are special prayers at mosques in the morning Larger mosques will normally hold them for their own communities as well as the people from smaller local mosques Mosques especially those in countries where Muslims are the majority will also host Eid prayers outside in courtyards or town squares

There are many events in Ramadan Islams holiest month During Ramadan Mulims must fast during the day Mosques organise iftar dinners after sunset These are done after the fourth required prayer of the day Part of the food is given by members of the community which creates nightly potluck dinners The community contribution to these dinners is required For this reason mosques with smaller communities may not be able to hold the iftar dinners daily 

Some mosques will also hold meals in the morning before dawn Mosques will often invite poorer members of the community to these meals Islam sees giving charity during Ramadan as good acts

Larger mosques sometimes offer special optional prayers They are done after the last required prayer of the day During each night of prayers one member of the community who has memorized the entire Quran will recite a part of the book It can last for up to two hours Sometimes several such people take turns to do this During the last ten days of Ramadan larger mosques will host all night programs to observe Laylat al Qadr It is the night Muslims believe that the Islamic prophet Muhammad first received Quranic revelations On that night between sunset and sunrise mosques employ speakers to teach the worshipers about Islam Mosques or the community usually provide meals at times through the night

During the late twentieth century more and more mosques have been used for political purposes Modern day mosques in the Western world want to educate good citizens The details differ greatly from mosque to mosque and from country to country

Countries with small Muslim populations use mosques as a way to support civic participation They are more likely to do this than Muslim majority countries of the Greater Middle East American mosques host voter registration and civic participation drives In the United States Muslims are often immigrants or the children of immigrants Mosques want to interest these people for politics They also want to keep them informed about issues that concern the Muslim community People who attend the services at the mosque regularly are more likely to take part in protests to sign petitions and to involve themselves in political matters

A link between political views and mosque attendance can still be seen in other parts of the world After the al Askari Mosque bombing in February 2006 imams and other Islamic leaders used mosques and Friday prayers to call for calm and peace during the widespread violence

Beginning in the late twentieth century and continuing into the early twenty first century a small number of mosques have also become a base for extremist imams to support terrorism and extreme Islamic ideals Finsbury Park Mosque in London is a mosque that has been used in this manner

Like other places of worship mosques can be at the center of social conflicts 

Babri Mosque was the centre of such a conflict up until the early 1990s when it was demolished Before a solution could be found the mosque was destroyed by about 200000 Hindus It took place on 6 December 1992 The mosque was built by Babur to mark the birth place of Ram It was believed to be on a site of an earlier Hindu temple The conflict over the mosque was directly linked to rioting in Bombay as well as bombings in 1993 that killed 257 people

In February 2006 a bombing seriously damaged Iraqs al Askari Mosque This increased the existing tensions The conflict between two Muslim groups in Iraq had already led to other bombings However mosque bombings are not limited to Iraq In June 2005 a suicide bomber killed at least 19 people at an Afghan mosque In April 2006 there were two explosions at Indias Jama Masjid

After the September 11 attacks several American mosques were targets of attacks These ranged from simple vandalism to arson

The Jewish Defense League was suspected of plotting to bomb the King Fahd Mosque in Culver City California There were similar attacks in the United Kingdom after the 7 July 2005 London bombings Outside the Western world in June 2001 the Hassan Bek Mosque was the target of attacks The attacks involved hundreds of Israelis angry at Arabs for a previous attack

Saudi involvement in building mosques around the world only goes back to the 1960s In the 1980s the Saudi Arabian government began to pay for the building of mosques in countries around the world An estimated US45 billion has been spent by the Saudi Arabian government for mosques and Islamic schools in foreign countries Ain al Yaqeen a Saudi newspaper reported in 2002 that Saudi money may have helped to build as many as 1500 mosques and 2000 other Islamic centers Saudi citizens have also given a lot of money to mosques in the Islamic world especially in countries where they see Muslims as poor and oppressed Following the fall of the Soviet Union in 1992 mosques in Afghanistan received money from Saudi citizens The King Fahd Mosque in Culver City California and the Islamic Cultural Center of Italy in Rome are two of Saudi Arabias largest investments in foreign mosques as former Saudi king Fahd bin Abdul Aziz al Saud gave US8 million and US50 million to the two mosques respectively

The structure resembles the Kaaba in Mecca

In a mosque people should keep focused on worshiping Allah For this reason there are a number of rules about the correct behaviour in a mosque Some of these rules are the same all over the world such as no shoes should be worn in the prayer hall Other rules are different from mosque to mosque

It is generally seen as good to have someone who leads the prayers though this is not strictly necessary The person who usually leads the prayers is called imam He must be a free and honest man He should also be an authority when it comes to answering questions on religion In mosques that were built or that are kept up by the government the imam is selected by the ruler In private mosques the community selects the imam through majority voting 

Only men may lead prayers for men Women are allowed to lead prayers for congregations where there are only women

In addition to washing there are other rules that also apply to those who enter the mosque even if they do not wish to pray there It is forbidden to wear shoes in the carpeted area of the prayer hall Some mosques also do not allow wearing shoes in other parts even though these may not be devoted to praying 

Islam requires that its believers wear clothes that show modesty As a result both men and women must follow this rule when they attend a mosque Men are supposed to come to the mosque wearing loose and clean clothes that do not show the shape of the body Similarly women who come to the mosque are expected to wear loose clothing shirts pants that cover to the wrists and ankles and cover their heads such as with a hijab Many Muslims regardless of their ethnic background wear Middle eastern clothing associated with Arabic Islam to special occasions and prayers at mosques

Mosques are places of worship For this reason those inside the mosque should be respectful to those who are praying Loud talking or discussion of topics that could be disrespectful is forbidden in areas where people are praying It is also considered as rude to walk in front of Muslims in prayer or otherwise disturb them 

Islamic law requires men and women to be separated in the prayer hall Ideally women should pray behind men Muhammad said women should pray at home not at the mosque Muhammad thought women should not be forbidden in mosques The second caliph Umar at one time stopped women from attending mosques especially at night because he feared they may be teased by males so he made them to pray at home Sometimes a special part of the mosque was railed off for women for example the governor of Mecca in 870 had ropes tied between the columns to make a separate place for women

Many mosques today will put the women behind a barrier or partition or in another room Mosques in South and Southeast Asia put men and women in separate rooms as the divisions were built into them centuries ago In nearly two thirds of American mosques women pray behind partitions or in separate areas not in the main prayer hall some mosques do not admit women at all Although there are sections only for women and children the Grand Mosque in Mecca is desegregated

A few scholars of Islamic law believe that non Muslims may be allowed into mosques as long as they do not sleep or eat there Followers of the Maliki school of Islamic jurisprudence disagree They say that non Muslims may not be allowed into mosques at all

Different countries have different opinions on the question Nearly all the mosques in the Arabian Peninsula as well as Morocco do not allow non Muslims The Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca is one of only two mosques in Morocco currently open to non Muslims 

In modern day Saudi Arabia the Grand Mosque and all of Mecca are open only to Muslims Likewise the Masjid al Nabawi and the city of Medina that surrounds it are also off limits to those who do not practice Islam For mosques in other areas it has most commonly been taken that non Muslims may only enter mosques if granted permission to do so by Muslims and if they have a proper reason

In modern Turkey non Muslim tourists are allowed to enter any mosque but must obey the rules of decorum Visiting a mosque is allowed only between prayers visitors must wear long trousers and take off their shoes women must cover their heads no photos no loud talk is allowed No references to other religions are allowed

However there are also many other places in the west as well as the Islamic world where non Muslims are welcome to enter mosques Most mosques in the United States for example report receiving non Muslim visitors every month Many Mosques throughout the United States welcome non Muslims as a sign of openness to the rest of the community and to encourage conversions to Islam

Dogs are usually banned from entering mosques but on 24 September 2008 the Muslim Law Council UK made special ruling called a fatwa which granted a blind Muslim permission to take his guide dog into the mosque

It is common for a smaller mosque to serve as a hostel for Muslims on haj Sometimes mosques are used for refugees or as temporary homes for homeless people Obligations to neighbours in Islam are very strict and specific In the Quran Mohammed said that a person who helps others in the hour of need and who helps the oppressed that person God will help on the Day of Travail There are other commands such as helping the poor and being nice to people An important part of being Muslim or just being part of the mosque is taking care of people who need help A mosque is a social as well as a religious group

A madrassa is a little different from a mosque A madrassa focuses on teaching Islam usually to children and young people

When Spain was under Muslim control some of the most beautiful buildings were mosques After 1492 Spain was under Christian control However the Christians did not tear down the mosques They simply put a crucifix in them to make them into churches These mosques influenced the Renaissance architecture in Europe

Mammals are a group of vertebrate animals which form the class Mammalia They have these features

 Most mammals bear live young All mammals feed their young on milk which is made by glands in the skin or the mammary glands All mammals protect and look after their young though details differ greatly 

 Mammals are warm blooded they regulate their body temperature The heat they need to live is made chemically inside their body With this goes a higher rate of metabolism and heat retaining fur 

 One diagnostic feature is the lower jaw which unlike earlier forms is composed of a single bone the dentary

 Another diagnostic feature is the neocortex of the brain which no other vertebrate has

Almost all mammals give birth to live young There are only two mammals that lay eggs called Monotremes the Duck billed Platypus Ornithorhynchus and the Spiny Anteater Echidna with four species All are confined to Australia and New Guinea and are the sole survivors of an earlier group of mammals However like other mammals they feed milk to their young and protect and look after them

Other mammals are divided into the Marsupials and the Eutheria the placental mammals Marsupials are mammals with pouches to carry young in like the kangaroo All other mammals are Eutherian

Mammals are found on land and in water and also in the air where they compete with lots of other animals Their ability to move from place to place and adapt has made them a most efficient group Many mammals live in cold places These mammals have thick hair or blubber to keep them warm Others may live in rainforests Some live in deserts and still others are in rivers lakes and seas all around the world

Sea going mammals the Cetacea and the pinnipeds are very successful and significant predators This includes the whales seals walrus dolphins and others In the air the bats are the mammalian order with the most species They own the nighttime since birds are largely diurnal animals

On land the rodents are hugely successful more common in numbers than any other mammals Large mammals on land have been hunted to extinction in many parts of the world The ones which remain are now being better protected

Last but certainly not least are the primates Their natural habitat with few exceptions are the forests Most live in the trees with hands that grasp good colour vision and intelligence In the Pliocene period some moved out onto the savannahs as grassland began to replace forests

The evolutionary relationships among land vertebrates is as follows

This sort of classification is not traditional but it does reflect our knowledge of palaeontology and evolution 

A somewhat standardized classification system has been adopted by most current mammalogy classroom textbooks It is based on living animals The following taxonomy of extant and recently extinct mammals is from Vaughan et al 2000

Class Mammalia

Mammals can be divided in a number of orders

A number is a concept from mathematics used to count or measure Depending on the field of mathematics where numbers are used there are different definitions

Numbers are also used for other things besides counting Numbers are used when things are measured Numbers are used to study how the world works Mathematics is a way to use numbers to learn about the world and make things The study of the rules of the natural world is called science The work that uses numbers to make things is called engineering

There are different ways of giving symbols to numbers These methods are called number systems The most common number system that people use is the base ten number system The base ten number system is also called the decimal number system The base ten number system is common because people have ten fingers and ten toes There are 10 different symbols 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 9 used in the base ten number system These ten symbols are called digits

A symbol for a number is made up of these ten digits The position of the digits shows how big the number is For example the number 23 in the decimal number system really means 2 times 10 plus 3 and 101 means 1 times a hundred plus 0 times 10 plus 1 times 1

Another number system is more common for machines The machine number system is called the binary number system The binary number system is also called the base two number system There are two different symbols used in the base two number system These two symbols are called bits

A symbol for a binary number is made up of these two bit symbols The position of the bit symbols shows how big the number is For example the number 10 in the binary number system really means 1 times 2 plus 0 and 101 means 1 times four plus 0 times two plus 1 times 1 The binary number 10 is the same as the decimal number 2 The binary number 101 is the same as the decimal number 5

English has special names for some of the numbers in the decimal number system that are powers of ten All of these power of ten numbers in the decimal number system use just the symbol 1 and the symbol 0 For example ten tens is the same as ten times ten or one hundred In symbols this is 10 10 100 Also ten hundreds is the same as ten times one hundred or one thousand In symbols this is 10 100 10 10 10 1000 Some other power of ten numbers also have special names

When dealing with larger numbers than this there are two different ways of naming the numbers in English Under the long scale a new name is given every time the number is a million times larger than the last named number It is also called the British Standard This scale used to be common in Britain but is not often used in English speaking countries today It is still used in some other European nations Another scale is the short scale under which a new name is given every time a number is a thousand times larger than the last named number This scale is a lot more common in most English speaking nations today

If 0 is called a natural number then the natural numbers are the same as the whole numbers If 0 is not called a natural number then the natural numbers are the same as the counting numbers So if the words natural numbers are not used then there will be less confusion about whether zero is included or not But unfortunately some say that zero is not a whole number either and some say whole numbers can be negative Positive integers and non negative integers are another way to include zero or exclude zero but only if people know those words

Negative numbers are numbers less than zero

One way to think of negative numbers is using a number line We call one point on this line zero Then we will label every position on the line by how far to the right of the zero point it is for example the point one is one centimeter to the right the point two is two centimeters to the right 

Now think about a point which is one centimeter to the left of the zero point We cannot call this point one as there is already a point called one We therefore call this point minus 1

A drawing of a number line is below

All the normal operations of mathematics can be done with negative numbers

If people add a negative number to another this is the same as taking away the positive number with the same numerals For example 5 is the same as 5 3 and equals 2

If they take away a negative number from another this is the same as adding the positive number with the same numerals For example 5 is the same as 5 3 and equals 8

If they multiply two negative numbers together they get a positive number For example 5 times 3 is 15

If they multiply a negative number by a positive number or multiply a positive number by a negative number they get a negative result For example 5 times 3 is 15

Integers are all the natural numbers all their opposites and the number zero Decimal numbers and fractions are not integers

Rational numbers are numbers which can be written as fractions This means that they can be written as a divided by b where the numbers a and b are integers and b is not equal to 0

Some rational numbers such as 110 need a finite number of digits after the decimal point to write them in decimal form The number one tenth is written in decimal form as 01 Numbers written with a finite decimal form are rational Some rational numbers such as 111 need an infinite number of digits after the decimal point to write them in decimal form There is a repeating pattern to the digits following the decimal point The number one eleventh is written in decimal form as 00909090909 

A percentage could be called a rational number because a percentage like 7 can be written as the fraction 7100 It can also be written as the decimal 007 Sometimes a ratio is considered as a rational number

Irrational numbers are numbers which cannot be written as a fraction but do not have imaginary parts

Irrational numbers often occur in geometry For instance if we have a square which has sides of 1 meter the distance between opposite corners is the square root of two which equals 1414213  This is an irrational number Mathematicians have proved that the square root of every natural number is either an integer or an irrational number

One well known irrational number is pi This is the circumference of a circle divided by its diameter This number is the same for every circle The number pi is approximately 31415926535 

An irrational number cannot be fully written down in decimal form It would have an infinite number of digits after the decimal point Unlike 0333333 these digits would not repeat forever

Real numbers is a name for all the sets of numbers listed above

This is all numbers that do not involve imaginary numbers

Imaginary numbers are formed by real numbers multiplied by the number i This number is the square root of minus one

There is no number in the real numbers which when squared makes the number 1 Therefore mathematicians invented a number They called this number i or the imaginary unit 

Imaginary numbers operate under the same rules as real numbers

Imaginary numbers were called imaginary because when they were first found many mathematicians did not think they existedFactdateApril 2009 The person who discovered imaginary numbers was Gerolamo Cardano in the 1500s The first to use the words imaginary number was Ren Descartes The first people to use these numbers were Leonard Euler and Carl Friedrich Gauss Both lived in the 18th century

Complex numbers are numbers which have two parts a real part and an imaginary part Every type of number written above is also a complex number

Complex numbers are a more general form of numbers The complex numbers can be drawn on a number plane This is composed of a real number line and an imaginary number line

All of normal mathematics can be done with complex numbers

For example  i i 2 23i

Proving that a certain number is transcendental can be extremely difficult Each transcendental number is also an irrational number The first people to see that there were transcendental numbers were Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and Leonhard Euler The first to actually prove there were transcendental numbers was Joseph Liouville He did this in 1844 

Well known transcendental numbers

A numeral is a written symbol that represents the value of a number

Instead of the word one a writer may use the symbol 1 for example

November is the eleventh month of the year It has 30 days Its name is from the Latin word novem which meant nine It was the ninth month of the year before January and February were added to the Roman Calendar November begins on the same day of the week as March every year and also February except in leap years

Novembers flower is the Chrysanthemum Its birthstone is the topaz The meaning of the topaz is broken wikt linkFidelityfidelity

A national anthem is a song that the people of a country use to remember and respect their country

Some countries like Spain have a national anthem which has no lyrics

Name is a word given to things and people 

For example cat is the name of a kind of animal Ryan is a name of a person usually a male Julia is a common female name 

The word name can also be used as a verb To name something is to give it a name

In many cultures there are rules and customs about how to give a person a name 

Some of the rules are defined by laws and others are defined by traditions 

There are rules about different aspects of the names and naming including the following

1 Number of parts of a name

In some cultures a person has a one part name such as ShiningWater 

In other cultures a person has a two part name such as John Smith

In some cultures a person can have any number of name parts In the United States for example some people have three first name middle name and last name Other people have only two a first and last name

In Chinese cultures it is typical for a person to have three part name such as Cheah Ching San where Cheah is the surname Written in English format a comma is introduced making it Ching San Cheah

2 Relations with names of parents and other relatives

In some cultures people have the same family name as their parents For example the father of John Smith may be Mike Smith And Mike Smiths father may be James Smith The Smith part is the same for all the family 

In other cultures a person has the same name as his or her father but the name is in a different place For example Shafiq Hanifs son may be Hanif Kamal Hanif is in both the fathers and sons name 

3 Name changes

In some cultures a name changes when people marry divorce go through some religious ceremony etc For example in some Spanish speaking countries people use two last names their mothers fathers name and their fathers name If Elena Rodriguez Gomez and Jose Sanchez Soria marry she may change her name to Elena Rodriguez de Sanchez and their child could be named Pilar Sanchez Rodriguez taking the names of both of her grandfathers 

4 Name origins

In some cultures personal names come from history In most European countries some first names are taken from the Bible In some cultures names are taken from a relative In other cultures a name shows what the parents hope their child will be like A baby may be given a name Wisdom because parents hope the baby will be a wise girl or boy 

Some cultures avoid giving people a name of an animal For example there is no name like dog cat snake owl or fish in Japanese peoples first names But in some cultures animal names may be good 

5 Lengths pronunciations spelling etc

In some languages and cultures you can tell if a word is a persons name or not by just looking at the spelling or listening to its pronunciation There are some other linguistic patterns For example many Chinese names are made up of three syllables 

6 Use of names titles nicknames etc

In some cultures people use names when they call each other In other cultures people use their nicknames In some other cultures people use their titles when they call each other

7 Spelling of names titles nicknames etc

8 Name awareness

Taking note of names is taken a step farther by those who elect to celebrate a name whether their own name someone elses name or names in general complete ownership of ones name might very well include celebrating it 

9 Middle names

While some people might choose to hide a middle name for any number of reasons others have taken to celebrating their middle name

In the English language names exclusively are usually pronounced in correlation with the spelling however can be pronounced as desired eg John is but can also be However not probable is held true in the English rules of grammar

Examples of names

Sarah Lucy Ellen Claire Ben

Names can be shortened eg Isabelle can become Izzy or Belle

Here are some things that are often found in Japanese names today In the past people went by different rules 

1 Number of parts of a name

Japanese names have two parts One is the family name and the other is the given name 

Suzuki Ichiro is a name of a Japanese person Suzuki is the family name and Ichiro is the first name In the Japanese language the family name comes first and the given name comes second

Only some members of the royal family do not have a family name 

2 Relations with names of parents and other relatives

A newborn baby gets a family name from their parents The parents have the same family name So a son of Ono Yoko and Ono Ken is Ono something 

The family name Ono is mostly shared by the paternal part of the family So Ono Kens parents have the family name Ono but Ono Yokos parents probably do not 

3 Name changes

Names of people change when they marry and divorce It is a custom in many parts of the world that women change their family name to that of their new husband when they marry However in Europe and North America especially many women no longer do this even though their mothers and grandmothers may have Sometimes the man will take the womans family name

6 Use of names titles nicknames etc 

Niihau is the smallest of the inhabited islands of Hawaii in the United States It has a land area of 70 sq miles It is the oldest of the eight main islands

The whole island is owned by the Robinson family They bought it from the Kingdom of Hawaii for 10000 It was said that the buyer Elizabeth Sinclair liked the island better than other places such as Waikiki Pearl Harbor and the island of Lanai There is a small US Navy base where a handful of Navy people work

The island has a few hundred permanent inhabitants Almost all of them are native Hawaiians They support themselves largely with small family farms Many work for the ranch owned by the Robinsons The native Hawaiians lead a rural low tech life They speak the Hawaiian language and keep traditions alive This is because Ms Sinclair promised to help preserve Hawaiian culture and tradition when she bought the island Niihau is the only one of the Hawaiian islands where the Hawaiian language is the main language

Niihau is also known as the Forbidden Island This is due to the fact that until recently the island was off limits to all but family members US Navy personnel government officials and expressly invited guests Now tourists can go on one of a limited number of supervised tours or hunting safaris

On the beaches of the island are found shells which are the only shells to be classified as gems Niihau shells and the jewelry made from them are very popular Many especially those with darker and richer color are collectors items The sale of shells and shell jewelry brings extra money for the local people

The Nn or Hawaiian Goose Branta sandvicensis is a species of goose It is found today on only three Hawaiian islands It gets its name from its soft call

This is an unmistakable species with its generally brown plumage and darker head Its strong toes have much reduced webbing an adjustment to the lava flows on which it breeds The Nn goes about on land much more than other water birds When moulting the Nn cannot fly as do other geese a factor which made it vulnerable to hunting

The Nn was once among the most threatened waterfowl species around the world Once common hunting and predators brought to the islands such as mongooses pigs and cats reduced the population to only 30 birds in the 1950s However this species breeds well in captivity and has been successfully re introduced There are also good numbers in wild bird collections

The Nn is the state bird of Hawaii

A network is a group of things that are connected together using some form of talking or other communication to transfer information or data An example of a large computer network is the Internet

A fishing net is a woven trap usually used to catch fish They are usually made out of rope A net is a kind of tool

Internet slang is slang words which are used on the Internet Most of these words are new such as Wiki and blog which were not used before the Internet became popular

Some old words were given new meanings such as mail and these compare the old communication methods with the new ways using the Internet There are many mixed metaphors on the Internet such as boot and link Some existing acronyms such as AFK and IRL were used on bulletin board systems before the Internet became popular These are now used on the Internet such as in chat rooms and on instant messenger software

People have also created some verbs and adjectives to describe things that only happen on the Internet

Shorthand is where a word is written in a shorter way because it is quicker and easier to type It is also done to fit more text into a limited space

Internet slang uses many acronyms because they are quicker and easier to type They are often shorthand for common phrases and idioms but they can show somebodys emotions and their certainty

Leet speak is the most common language on MMORPGs because rude words are not stopped by filters This language is changing all the time because new words are made and used A lot of the words use numbers instead of letters but some were made because of typing errors which are now done on purpose Also some suffixes are used such as age and ness

Some of the numbers and symbols used instead of letters are in the table below

Nauru is a small island in the Pacific Ocean This one island is one country It sells phosphate to Australia Nauru is the smallest republic in the world English and Nauruan are the official languages of Nauru Nauru has no official capital but its biggest place is Yaren There are 14 districts in Nauru

A noun is a kind of word that is usually the name of something such as a person place thing quality or idea In English nouns can be singular or plural

Nouns often need a word called an article or determiner These words usually do not go with other kinds of words like verbs or adverbs Adjectives can also describe nouns In English there are more nouns than any other kind of word 

Every language in the world has nouns but they are not always used in the same ways They also can have different properties in different languages For example in some other languages nouns do not change for singular and plural and sometimes there is no word for the 

Some examples of nouns in English are time people way year government day world life work part number house system company end party information

The word noun comes from the Latin nomen meaning name Words like nouns were described in early days by the Sanskrit grammarian Pini and ancient Greeks like Dionysios Thrax

In English sentences nouns can be used as a subject object or complement They often come after prepositions as the object of preposition 

Nouns can sometimes describe other nouns When they do this they are called modifiers 

There are also verb forms that can be used in the same way as nouns These are called verbals or verbal nouns and include participles and infinitives

Nouns are grouped into common nouns and proper nouns There are also pronouns These have commonly been considered a different part of speech from nouns but in the past some grammars have included them as nouns as do many modern linguists 

A proper noun is a name given to individual people places companies or brands Some examples of proper nouns are London John God October Mozart Saturday Coke Mr Brown Atlantic Ocean

Proper nouns begin with an upper case letter in English and many other languages that use the Roman alphabet The word I is really a pronoun although it is capitalized in English like a proper noun

Some common nouns can also be used as proper nouns For example someone might be named Tiger Smith  even though he is not a tiger or a smith

Common nouns are all other nouns that are not proper nouns Sometimes the same word can be either a common noun or a proper noun depending on how it is used for example

In English and many other languages nouns have number But some nouns are only singular and others are only plural Also some nouns are countable but others are not for example we do not say one furniture two furnitures to change

Nouns are words for things and since things can be possessed nouns can also change to show possession in grammar In English we usually add an apostrophe and an s to nouns to make them possessive or sometimes just an apostrophe when there is already an s at the end like this

Most adjectives become nouns by adding the suffix ness Example Take the adjective natural add ness to get naturalness a noun To see a list of 100 adjectives used in Basic English click here

The words nature and natural are used for all the things that are normally not made by humans Things like the weather plants animals mountains rivers the sun and much more are part of nature Scientists study the way the parts of nature work Things that have been made by people are said to be man made or called an artifact

There are Natural sciences that study different parts of nature The science of ecology is about plants and animals as a whole while biology tends to study each of these animals by themself 

In many ways humans and nature can be said to be in conflict Nature is often seen by humans as natural resources People cut down trees to get wood to burn or to build houses or to make a place to grow food Fires cars and factories make a lot of smoke come out from different places especially in towns and cities and sometimes villages too People who like to leave nature unharmed and those who feel they need to use more of nature often fight about what they should do In the modern world with many people and many big cities these problems are becoming more serious

A natural resource is anything people can use which comes from nature People do not make natural resources but gather them from the earth Examples of natural resources are air water wood petroleumcrudeoil solar energy wind energy hydro electric energy and coalRefined oil is not a natural resource because people make it

We often say there are two sorts of natural resource renewable resources and non renewable resources 

All places have their own natural resources When people do not have a certain resource they need they can either replace it with another resource or trade with another country to get the resource Some resources are difficult to find so people sometimes fight to have them

When people do not have some natural resources their quality of life can get lower For example when they can not get clean water people may become ill if there is not enough wood trees will be cut and the forest will disappear over time if there are not enough fish in a sea people can die of starvation Some examples of renewable resources are wood solar energy trees wind hydroelectric power fish and sunlight Non renewable resources cannot be recycled For example oil minerals and other non renewable resources cannot be recycled Natural resources are very important to a human lifestyle Natural resources are certain materials Earth produces 

Natural resources exist in natural form in various evironments These resources are important in our life It may exist as an individual such as air fresh water or as a living organism such as a fish Natural resources are categorized as either renewable or non renewable resources It may be divided into two categories from which it was originated either in a biotic or abiotic form

Negentropy is reverse entropy It means things becoming more in order

Time in science is defined as the direction of entropy This makes it very hard to talk about ideas of time that would apply to negentropy or its effects

Life is considered to be negentropic because it takes things in less order like dead food and turns it into things in more order like cells in the body tissues and organs In doing so it gives off heat The outside or skin of an organism is always at maximum entropy because it is removing heat

Based on several different ideas of entropy negentropy also would mean several different things Cliff Joslyn proposed a list of ways to find entropy in ways other than measuring heat as given off by a body Since it is living things looking for these ways however and since they create models that are in more order than the measurements they combine thinking and science are also negentropic just a part of life

The idea that living things order the universe is called the anthropic principle It has a strong form which says that we are needed to do this And a weak or obvious form which says if we were not here asking it would not matter Cosmology is concerned with this and other issues of where life fits into models of our universe

North America is a continent in the Northern and Western halves of Earth It is to the east of the Pacific Ocean the West of the Atlantic Ocean the South of the Arctic Ocean and the North of South America It is the northern part of the Americas North America used to be part of a larger ancient supercontinent named Laurasia 

North America includes these large countries listed from North to South

Neptunes atmosphere is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium It also contains small amounts of methane which makes the planet appear blue Neptunes blue color is much brighter compared to Uranus which has a similar amount of methane so there might be another reason why Neptune is blue Neptune also has the strongest winds of any planet in the solar system measured as high as 2100 kmh or 1300 mph

Neptune was discovered by the astronomers Urbain Le Verrier and John Couch Adams They were both honored for the discovery The planet was the first to be discovered by mathematical calculations instead of using a telescope Because of Uranus odd movements in its orbit it made astronomers search for the new planet The planet was visited by only one spacecraft Voyager 2 on August 25 1989 Neptune once had a huge storm known as the Great Dark Spot which was discovered in 1989 by Voyager 2 However the dark spot was not seen in 1994 and new spots were found since then It is not known why the dark spot disappeared However NASA suggested for a future spacecraft to orbit and learn more about Neptune The spacecraft was to be shared between the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the California Institute of Technology

The first possible sighting of Neptune is thought to be by Galileo as his drawings showed Neptune near Jupiter But Galileo was not credited for the discovery since he thought Neptune was a fixed star instead of a planet Because of Neptunes slow movement across the sky Galileos small telescope was not strong enough to detect Neptune as a planet

In 1821 Alexis Bouvard published the astronomical tables of the orbit of Uranus Later observations showed that Uranus was moving in an irregular way in its orbit making some astronomers think of another large body being the cause of the irregular motions of Uranus In 1843 John Couch Adams calculated the orbit of an eighth planet that would possibly be influencing the orbit of Uranus He sent his calculations to Sir George Airy the Astronomer Royal who asked Adams for an explanation Adams began to make a copy of the reply but never sent it

In 1846 Urbain Le Verrier who was not working with Adams created his own calculations but also had problems in encouraging any interest with his people However in the same year John Herschel began to support the mathematical method and encouraged James Challis to search for the planet After much delays Challis began his unwilling search in July 1846 Meanwhile Le Verrier had convinced Johann Gottfried Galle to search for the planet

Although Heinrich dArrest was still a student at the Berlin Observatory he suggested that a newly drawn map of the sky in the region of Le Verriers predicted area could be compared with the current sky to look for the displacement characteristic of a planet as compared to a fixed star Neptune was then discovered that very night on September 23 1846 within 1 of where Le Verrier had predicted it to be and about 10 from Adams prediction Challis later found out that he had seen the planet twice in August failing to recognize it owing to his careless approach to the work

After the news of the discovery of Neptune spread there was also a lot of arguing between the French and the British about who was to be deserved credit for the discovery Later an international agreement decided that both Le Verrier and Adams together deserved credit However historians are now reviewing the topic after the rediscovery in 1998 of the Neptune papers which had seemingly been stolen by astronomer Olin Eggen for nearly three decades and were only rediscovered right after his death After reviewing the documents some historians now think that Adams does not deserve equal credit with Le Verrier

Shortly after its discovery Neptune was temporarily called as the planet exterior to Uranus or as Le Verriers planet The first suggestion for a name came from Galle He proposed the name Janus In England Challis suggested the name Oceanus In France Arago suggested that the new planet be called Leverrier a suggestion which was met with a lot of opposition outside France French almanacs promptly reintroduced the name Herschel for Uranus and Leverrier for the new planet 

Meanwhile on separate and different reason Adams suggested changing the name Georgian to Uranus while Leverrier suggested Neptune for the new planet Struve gave support of that name on December 29 1846 to the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences Soon Neptune was internationally agreed among many people and was then the official name for the new planet In Roman mythology Neptune was the god of the sea identified with the Greek god Poseidon

At 10243e25 kg Neptunes mass puts the planet between Earth and the largest gas giants Neptune has seventeen Earth masses but just 118th the mass of Jupiter Neptune and Uranus are often considered to be part of a sub class of gas giant known as ice giants given their smaller size and big differences in composition compared to Jupiter and Saturn In the search for extrasolar planets Neptune has been used as a reference to determine the size and structure of the discovered planet Some discovered planets that have similar masses like Neptune are often called as Neptunes just as astronomers refer to various extra solar Jupiters

The atmosphere of Neptune is made up mostly of hydrogen with a smaller amount of helium A tiny amount of methane is also detected in the atmosphere Important absorption bands of methane happen at wavelengths above 600 nm in the red and infrared portion of the spectrum This absorption of red light by the atmospheric methane gives Neptune its blue hue

Because Neptune orbits so far from the Sun it gets very little heat with the uppermost regions of the atmosphere at 218 C Deeper inside the layers of gas however the temperature rises slowly Like Uranus the source of this heating is unknown but the differences are larger Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun yet its internal energy is strong enough to create the fastest winds seen in the Solar System Several possible explanations have been suggested including radiogenic heating from the planets core the continued radiation into space of leftover heat made by infalling matter during the planets birth and gravity waves breaking above the tropopause

The structure of the inside of Neptune is thought to be very similar to the structure of the inside of Uranus There is likely to be a core thought to be about 15 Earth masses made up of molten rock and metal surrounded by a mixture of rock water ammonia and methane The heavy pressures keep the icy part of this surrounding mixture as solids in spite of the large temperatures near the core The atmosphere extending about 10 to 20 of the way towards the center is mostly hydrogen and helium at high altitudes More mixtures of methane ammonia and water are found in the lower areas of the atmosphere Very slowly this darker and hotter area blends into the superheated liquid interior The pressure at the center of Neptune is millions of times more than that on the surface of Earth Comparing its rotational speed to its degree of oblateness shows that it has its mass less concentrated towards the center unlike Uranus 

One difference between Neptune and Uranus is the level of broken wikt linkmeteorologymeteorological activity that has been observed When the Voyager spacecraft flew by Uranus in 1986 that winds on that planet were observed to be mild When Voyager flew by Neptune in 1989 powerful weather events were observed The weather of Neptune has extremely active storm systems Its atmosphere has the highest wind speeds in the solar system thought to be powered by the flow of internal heat Regular winds in the equatorial region have speeds of around 1200 kmh while winds in storm systems can reach up to 2100 kmh near supersonic speeds

In 1989 the Great Dark Spot a cyclonic storm system the size of Eurasia was discovered by NASAs Voyager 2 spacecraft The storm resembled the Great Red Spot of Jupiter However on November 2 1994 the Hubble Space Telescope did not see the Great Dark Spot on the planet Instead a new storm similar to the Great Dark Spot was found in the planets northern hemisphere The reason why the Great Dark Spot has disappeared is unknown One possible theory is that heat transfer from the planets core disrupted the atmospheric balance and existing circulation patterns The Scooter is another storm a white cloud group farther south than the Great Dark Spot Its nickname was given when it was first noticed in the months leading up to the Voyager encounter in 1989 it moved faster than the Great Dark Spot Later images showed clouds that moved even faster than Scooter The Wizards eyeDark Spot 2 is another southern cyclonic storm the second most strongest storm seen during the 1989 encounter It originally was completely dark but as Voyager came closer to the planet a bright core developed and is seen in most of the highest resolution images

Unlike other gas giants Neptunes atmosphere shows the presence of high clouds making shadows on a thick cloud deck below Though Neptunes atmosphere is much more active than that of Uranus both planets are made up of the same gases and ices Uranus and Neptune are not exactly the same type of gas giants like to Jupiter and Saturn but are rather ice giants meaning they have a larger solid core and are also made of ices Neptune is very cold with temperatures as low as 224 C recorded at the cloud tops in 1989

Neptune also has similarities with Uranus in its magnetosphere with a magnetic field strongly tilted comparative to its rotational axis at 47 and offset at least 055 radii from the planets physical center Comparing the magnetic fields of the two planets scientists think the extreme course may be characteristic of flows in the interior of the planet and not the result of Uranus sideways rotational movementCitation neededdateJanuary 2012

Very small blue colored rings have been discovered around the blue planet but they are not well known as the rings of Saturn When these rings were discovered by a team led by Edward Guinan originally they thought that the rings may not be complete rings However this was proven wrong by Voyager 2 Neptunes planetary rings have a weird clumpy arrangement Although the cause is currently unknown but some scientists think that it may be because of the gravitational contact with small moons that orbit near themCitation neededdateJanuary 2012

Proof that the rings are incomplete first began in the mid 1980s when stellar occultation were found to rarely show an extra blink just before or after the planet occulted the star Pictures from Voyager 2 in 1989 solved the problem when the ring system was found to have several faint rings The farthest ring Adams has three famous arcs now named Libert Egalit and Fraternit

The existence of arcs is very hard to understand because the laws of motion would predict that arcs spread out into a single ring in a very short time The gravitational effects of Galatea a moon just inward from the ring are now thought to have created the arcs

Several other rings were discovered by the Voyager cameras Also with the thin Adams Ring about 63000 km from the center of Neptune the Leverrier Ring is at 53000 km and the wider smaller Galle Ring is at 42000 km A very small outward expansion to the Leverrier Ring has been named Lassell it is surrounded at its outer edge by the Arago Ring at 57000 km

New Earth based observations published in 2005 appeared to show that Neptunes rings are a lot more unstable than thought before To be exact it looks like that the Libert ring might disappear maybe quickly in less than 100 years The new observations seems to puzzle our understanding of Neptunes rings into a lot of confusion

Neptune has a total of 13 known moons As Neptune was the Roman god of the sea the planets moons were named after lesser sea gods or goddesses The largest and the only one big enough to have the shape of a sphere is Triton discovered by William Lassell just 17 days after the discovery of Neptune itself Unlike all other large planetary moons Triton has a retrograde orbit showing that the moon was probably captured and maybe was once a Kuiper belt object It is close enough to Neptune to be locked into a synchronous orbit and is slowly moving into Neptune and will one day be torn apart when it passes the Roche limit Triton is the coldest object that has been measured in the solar system with temperatures of 235 C Its diamter is 2700 km its mass is 2151022 kg its orbital diameter is 354800 km and its orbital period is 5877 days

Neptunes second known moon the odd moon Nereid has one of the most unusual orbits of any satellite in the solar system 

From July to September 1989 Voyager 2 discovered six new moons of Neptune Of these the lumpy shaped Proteus is the biggest known object that has not been shaped into a sphere by its own gravity Although it is the second most massive Neptunian moon it has only one quarter of one percent of the mass of Triton Neptunes closest four moons Naiad Thalassa Despina and Galatea orbit close enough to be inside Neptunes rings

The next farthest out Larissa was originally discovered in 1981 when it had occulted a star The moon was credited for causing Neptunes ring arcs when Voyager 2 observed Neptune in 1989 Five new unusual moons discovered between 2002 and 2003 were announced in 2004 

Neptune cannot be seen with naked eye alone since Neptunes normal brightness are between magnitudes 77 and 80 which can be out shined by Jupiters Galilean moons the dwarf planet Ceres and the asteroids 4 Vesta 2 Pallas 7 Iris 3 Juno and 6 Hebe A telescope or strong binoculars will show Neptune as a small blue dot similar in appearance to Uranus The blue color comes from the methane in its atmosphere Its small obvious size has made it difficult to study visually most telescopic data was quite limited until the arrival of the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground based telescopes with adaptive optics 

With an orbital period of 16488 Julian years Neptune will soon return to the same place in the sky where it was discovered in 1846 This will happen three different times also with a fourth in which it will come very close to being at that position These are April 11 2009 when it will be in prograde motion July 17 2009 when it will be in retrograde motion and February 7 2010 when it will be in prograde motion It will also come very close to being at the same point since the 1846 discovery in late October through early mid November 2010 when Neptune will turn from retrograde to direct motion on the exact degree of Neptunes discovery and will then stop for a moment along the ecliptic within 2 arc minutes at that point This will be the last time for about the next 165 years that Neptune will be at its point of discovery 

This is explained by the idea of retrogradation Like all planets and asteroids in the Solar System beyond Earth Neptune goes through retrogradation at certain points during its synodic period In addition to the start of retrogradation other events inside the synodic period include astronomical opposition the return to prograde motion and conjunction to the Sun

In its orbit around the Sun Neptune will return to its original point of discovery in August 2011

Currently only one spacecraft has visited Neptune NASAs Voyager 2 probe made a quick flyby of the planet with its closest encounter on August 25 1989 and was the last planet to have been visited by at least one spacecraft 

Some of Voyager 2s important discoveries was its very close fly by of Triton where took pictures of several parts of the moon The probe also discovered the Great Dark Spot although it has now disappeared after when the Hubble Space Telescope took pictures of Neptune in 1994 Originally thought to be a large cloud or cyclonic storm system it was later guessed just to be a hole in the visible cloud deck

Neptune turned out to have the strongest winds of all the solar systems gas giants In the outer regions of the solar system where the Sun shines over 1000 times fainter than on Earth the last of the four giants did happen as what the scientists actually expected One might think that the farther a planet is from the Sun the less energy and heat there would be to create and run the very strong winds around The winds on Jupiter were already hundreds of kilometres per hour Rather than seeing slower winds the scientists found faster winds on more distant Neptune

One possible guess for the cause of the faster wind speeds is that if enough energy is produced turbulence is created which slows the winds down At Neptune however there is so little solar energy that once winds are started they meet very little resistance and are able to keep very high speeds Anyhow Neptune gives out more energy than it gets from the Sun and the internal energy source of these winds remains undetermined

The pictures sent back to Earth from Voyager 2 in 1989 became the basis of a PBS all night program called Neptune All Night

Negative is a word that has at least three different meanings

If a person or a company has negative net worth this means that the money they owe to others is more than the money and other things they have or are going to get

No one is an English idiom meaning no person or no body It is the opposite of someone It means no one who counts or can be heard or respected or more closely zero persons that we are concerned with whoever we are

It literally refers to zero persons or voices But this is not always exactly what is meant It does not usually literally mean that absolutely no human on Earth can be found that expresses the view or takes the position that no one takes It means that the view or position can be safely ignored and that those who take it can be singled out for social exclusion

So for instance it can be said that No one in the United States supports communism But of course there are a few such people they are just not open or declared supporters or not found or they should not be in the US

Use of this term usually implies that an ideology is advocated or a challenge is being issued to find someone willing to state support for or publicly do the thing that no one is in favour of or doing

Now is the time span between the past and the future It can be long or short but it is almost always used to refer to the span between the present instant to some time horizon when a decision must be made It can be used to ask or demand that someone make a decision even if they want to delay

I want to know what you think now

What do you think now

Now is the time for all good people to come to the aid of their country

Mathematics and measurement assume that everything used in one equation equals the same quantities at the beginning of calculation or axiomatization as at the end That means it is mathematically correct to say that the idea of equal means equal from the time the process starts to the time it ends In General Semantics and E Prime the words equal remain and become replace the verb to be for this reason

Algebra is now often called snapshot algebra or algebra of seeing because of this dependence on time If any action or event were possible between steps in algebraic analysis then in theory one would have to start over as if one had no knowledge of the new state at all For these reasons the idea of statistics and also knowledge and knowledge management are sometimes questioned for instance in the book Lies Damn Lies and Statistics A major issue is the comparing of numbers gathered in the past and now after some key conditions change

New York City is the largest city in the United States Over 8 million people live in it and over 22 million people live in and around it It is in the state of New York which is located in the northeastern United States 

The oldest part of the city the island of Manhattan still has its original Lenape Native American name Although Native people such as the Lenape and Canarsees had lived there for many thousands of years New York City was first explored by Europeans in the 1500s Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazano found the entrance to New York Harbor in the year 1524 and English explorer Henry Hudson named the Hudson River in 1609

New York City was settled by Europeans from The Netherlands in 1624 The Dutch called the whole area of New York Nieuw Nederland and they named a fort and town on the south end of Manhattan Island Nieuw Amsterdam after the capital city of the Netherlands which was to become present day New York When the English took over the colony in 1664 they changed the name to New York to honor the Duke of York who later became King James II of England The Dutch surrendered Nieuw Amsterdam without fighting They were afraid of the English Navy so they traded the town to England for the colony of Surinam in South America which they thought was worth more money

By the time the English came to New York there were many other Dutch towns in what would become New York City including Breukelen Vlissingen and Nieuw Haarlem There were already some English towns in the area also such as Gravesend in Brooklyn and Newtown in Queens Dutch and English people had been living together in New York for a long time

New York quickly grew to become a large and important port city Many important battles of the American Revolution were fought in northern Manhattan and in Brooklyn New York was the capital of the United States under the Articles of Confederation from 1785 to 1788 When the US Constitution was made it stayed as the capital from 1789 until 1790 

In 1898 the cities of New York and Brooklyn came together with the Bronx Staten Island and the towns in Queens County to make Greater New York This is the total area of the City of New York today Around this time many new immigrants came into New York City They came in at Ellis Island an island in New Yorks harbor near the Statue of Liberty Many of them then moved to the Lower East Side neighborhood in Manhattan which had over a million people living in just a few square miles

Most of New York City is on three islands near the Atlantic Ocean although one part is on the mainland of North America The city includes all of Manhattan Island and Staten Island and the western end of Long Island There are also many smaller islands

The city is divided into five major parts called boroughs Each one is also a county They are

Water divides a lot of the city Part of the Hudson River forms the border between Manhattan and the Bronx on one side and the State of New Jersey on the other side The East River forms the border between Manhattan on one side and Brooklyn and Queens on the other side The Harlem River forms the border between Manhattan and the Bronx Part of Long Island Sound forms the border between the Bronx and Queens Newtown Creek is part of the border between Brooklyn and Queens Some parts of the city are very separate from the others because of water such as Far Rockaway in Queens and City Island in The Bronx A small piece of land in Manhattan is international territory and it belongs to the United Nations to use for its buildings 

The hallmark of New York city is an enormous number of skyscrapers especially in ManhattanIn New York City is located about 5600 skyscrapers and 48 of them are over 200 metres tallwhich is the highest number of skyscrapers in one area in the world

New York City currently has a population of about 8 million people Over 18 million people live in the city and nearby areas Most of the New York city population since the 1990s belongs to ethnic groups that are minorities in the US New York City has had large numbers of immigrants for many years In the early 19th Century they came from Ireland and Germany Later in the 19th century they came from Italy Russia and Eastern Europe Today they come from Puerto Rico Haiti the Dominican Republic and Colombia

The current mayor of New York is Michael Bloomberg an Independent The city also has a City Council that makes some local laws Most laws in New York City are set by the state government in Albany

Subway transportation is provided by the New York City Subway system one of the biggest in the world Pennsylvania Station the busiest train station in the United States can be found here

John F Kennedy International Airport which is in the Queens neighborhood of New York is one of the busiest airports in the United States

October is the tenth month of the year It has 31 days The name comes from the Latin oct for eight It was the eighth month of the year before January and February were added to the beginning of the year

October begins on the same day of week as January except in leap years

Octobers flower is the Calendula Its birthstone is the opal The meaning of the opal is hope

Of is a preposition used in the English language to show a possessive relationship For example the phrase book of maps means that the book has maps The phrase father of Mike means the father that is being mentioned is Mikes father

One is a natural number after zero and before two It represents a single item A human typically has one head nose mouth and navel The Roman numeral is I

In mathematics one is also the only number with this special fact Any number multiplied by 1 equals that number Then the number 1 divides any number but it is not divided by any except itself The number 1 divides any number to give that same number but it cannot be divided by any other number to give one as the answer Let n be any number Then n1 n but 1n is never 1 Example 71 7 but 17 is not 1 but 0142857 

Any number divided by itself always gives 1 as the answer nn 1 Example 77 1

The number one is important for computer science because it is together with zero a part of the binary numeral system In machine code and in lots of programming languages one means true Zero means false

Oahu is the third largest of the Hawaiian Islands in the United States It means the gathering place in the Hawaiian language Most of the people of Hawaii live there The total land area is convert608mi2km2 Honolulu the capital city of Hawaii is on this island Other well known places on Oahu are Waikiki Pearl Harbor Diamond Head Hanauma Bay Kaneohe Bay and both the North Shore and Makaha 

Kamehameha I made Oahu his capital when he became the first king of Hawaii Iolani Palace was built later on by others of the royal family It is the only royal palace on American soil 

Oahu was perhaps the first of the Hawaiian Islands which the crew of HMS Resolution saw on 18 January 1778 This was during Captain James Cooks third Pacific Ocean trip Europeans did not land on Oahu until 28 February 1779 when Captain Clerke of the HMS Resolution stepped ashore at Waimea Bay Clerke took command of the ship after Captain Cook was killed at Kealakekua Bay on February 14

Today Oahu has become a tourism and shopping center Almost 7 million visitors go there every year to enjoy the special island holiday found only in Hawaii

Oahu can be seen in hundreds of movies and TV shows Some of them are Magnum PI Lost Hawaii Five O and Jake and the Fatman

Orthography or spelling is the correct order and combination of letters put together to form words 

Spelling changes over time At about the time of the Renaissance words in English did not have a fixed spelling Over time however different combinations of letters became more common resulting in the more standard spellings of words we see today Although spelling is not so important as vocabulary and usage it is a traditional sign of education Those who cannot spell well may suffer discrimination

Differences between American English and British English spelling came about mainly as the result of one man Noah Webster wrote a Grammar a Spelling book and finally an American dictionary of the English language In the course of this he proposed a number of simplifications in spelling In his dictionary he chose s over c in words like defense he changed the re to er in words like center he dropped one of the Ls in traveler At first he kept the u in words like colour or favour but dropped it in later editions He also changed tongue to tung that did not stick His main reason was to help children learn to read and write Websters dictionary contained seventy thousand words of which twelve thousand had never appeared in a published dictionary before 

Webster did create a slightly different identity for American English But because his efforts left the most glaring problems untackled his variations make little difference to the way the language is used An example of the real problems in English orthography is the word ending ough which is pronounced several different ways tough bough cough The root causes of spelling variation are historical and loan words come with their own spelling Either all French loan words should be left as they were or they all should be changed Either we should move wholesale to a more phonetic spelling or not This was proposed by many people since Webster such as George Bernard Shaw who proposed a new phonetic alphabet for English In some cases Websters changes have been widely adopted in Britain the spelling programme came from the French US program is clearly simpler and more consistent with word endings in English In our modern world English orthography is still a problem In some countries a national committee can give advice and direction as to spelling English has long escaped from national custody 

Modern British spelling and use was greatly influenced by the two great English dictionaries Samuel Johnsons A dictionary of the English language and James Murrays Oxford English dictionary Johnsons dictionary was hugely influential abroad as well as at home The dictionary was exported to America The American adoption of the Dictionary was a momentous event not just in its history but in the history of lexicography For Americans in the second half of the eighteenth century Johnson was the authority on language and the subsequent development of American dictionaries was coloured by his famep224 For American lexicographers the dictionary was impossible to ignore Americas two great nineteenth century lexicographers Noah Webster and Joseph Emerson Worcester argued fiercely over Johnsons legacy In 1789 Webster declared that Great Britain whose children we are and whose language we speak should no longer be our standard for the taste of her writers is already corrupted and her language on the decline Where Webster found fault with Johnson Joseph Worcester saluted him In 1846 he completed his Universal and critical dictionary of the English Languagep226

Some people argue which language is the easiest to spell People who learn a second language tend to think that their first language is the easiest However for the learner programmatic languages with well defined rules are easier to start with than English The spelling of the English language is by far the most irregular of all alphabetic spellings and thus the most difficult to learn English is in its origin a Germanic language From its early roots as Anglo Saxon it has borrowed words from many other languages French and Latin are the most frequent donors to English

Languages that use phonetic spelling are easier to learn to spell than others With phonetic spelling the words are spelled as they are pronounced The Italian word orologio for instance is pronounced oh ro LO jo In English one comes across the word knife In knife the k is not spoken even though in English its more common to pronounce Ks when they are in words

One of the problems we have is that similar sounding words may be spelt quite differently Rough and ruff meet and meat great and grate Words with complicated spelling may be pronounced simply Leicester is pronounced Lester Even what rules we do have are frequently broken i before e except after c has over 100 exceptionsp272 Almost all these problems have come about for historical reasons English has been changing for the last thousand years and as the language changes so parts of it get stuck with different spellings 

Here are some of the causes of English orthography 

1 Originally a 23 letter alphabet for the 35 or so phonemes of Old English Other letters were added later

2 After the Norman conquest French scribes introduced new spellings

3 Printing Many of the early printers came from the continent of Europe and brought other spelling norms to England But although print stabilised spelling pronunciation continued to change 

4 Printing coincided with the Great Vowel Shift at the end of Middle English To avoid complex details here is what happened over a century the pronunciation of all the vowels changed and is still not standard throughout Britain In any event the spelling of thousands of words now reflects their pronunciation in Geoffrey Chaucers time

5 16th century scholars tried to indicate the history of a word by its spelling the silent b in debt is there to reflect the Latin debitum

6 More loan words added in the late 16th to early 17th century such as pneumonia idiosyncrasy epitome cocoa

English has a huge number of words but its spelling comes from many different sources The large and varied lexicon of English has been bought at the expense of an increasingly deversified graphologyp275

The word oil is used for many different kinds of liquids Oil usually does not mix with water

Some oils are made from plants and used in foods and for cooking Some kinds of plant oils that people use are African oil palm maize olive peanut soy and sunflower

Other kinds of oil are made from crude oil which comes from under the ground People use large oil wells to bring the oil to the top of the ground The oil is sent in special ships called tankers or in pipelines to factories called refineries where it is distilled into LPG gasoline diesel fuel and fuel oil Plastics are also normally made from crude oil Oils from crude oil are also used as fuels for engines or to make the parts of machines work together without sticking or stopping

Different kinds of oils are also used for many other things for example to make cosmetics medicines paints and detergents like washing up liquids Soap are similar to detergents but they are generally made from animal fat rather than oils

There is also synthetic oil

OK is a word in the English language It is used to mean that something is good or correct

It can often be used instead of the word Yes

It is also the two letter abbreviation for the state of Oklahoma in the United States of America

It is not certain where the word OK originally comes from but some experts say it came from a funny way of writing Ol Korrect 

You also find the phrase Ola kala in Greek which means something like Everything fine and it could stem from Ancient Greek

An oxymoron is made up of two or more words that seem to be opposite to each other or actually are opposite

For example the words Wise fool Warm freezer Legal murder all have two words In each one the one word looks like the opposite of the other word

You can have words that look opposite but are right For example a warm freezer could be right A freezer could be warm if it was turned off or left open

The word oxymoron is an oxymoron oxy comes from the Greek word that means sharp while moron comes from the Greek word that means dull

Words that really are opposite to each other would be words that just cannot be put together For example a round square could not happen because squares are not round

Oxymorons sometimes appear in jokes Sometimes the joke is just to say that a pair of words are an oxymoron For example a joke that says that honest politician is an oxymoron This means that politicians are dishonest if the word politician is opposite to honest

FileUbuntu 1010pngthumbrightUbuntu Linux a free operating systemAn operating system is what is needed to run the programs on a computer or a mobile device The programs that run on an operating system talk to the hardware Microsoft Windows and Mac OS are common operating systems Less common but important operating systems are Linux Unix and Solaris

An operating system must be made up of different parts

Most ordinary computer users take their operating system for granted The easiest way to understand what an operating system does is to take a close look at what computers were like before operating systems were invented

The earliest electronic computers did not have any operating system If the user wanted to change what the computer was doing the user had to open the back panel on the computer and change how the wires were connected Changing what the computer did was very time consuming and required an expert

Later computer scientists decided to have the wires stay as they were and feed instructions to the computer with punch cards or magnetic tape The computer would store the instructions in some kind of memory This way of operating a computer is called the von Neumann architecture

Still computers of the time generally only had enough memory to remember one program at a time If the user wanted the computer to run a different program the user had to wipe out the first program from memory and then load another program into memory

Computer operators and computer scientists grew tired of carrying around large stacks of punch cards They also wanted computers to run more than one program at a time As years of work changed or replaced computers to have more memory computer operators and computer scientists decided that some computers could hold several programs in its memory The computer user could then simply choose which program the user wanted to run Running a computer this way requires a boss program that controls all the other programs and asks the user what program the user wants to run Such a boss program is called an operating system

Having several programs in memory that can be run at any time makes some new problems The operating system itself has to remember where the programs are at in memory The operating system also has to prevent two programs from fighting over which one gets to use the processor

Modern desktop computers need an operating system Operating systems generally start up automatically when the user turns on the computer

Operating systems can also have other differences

Some common operating systems are

A philosophy is a way of thinking about the world the universe and about people A philosophy is a group of ideas worked out by a philosopher The ideas in philosophy are abstract which means that they are things that cannot be touched But this does not mean that philosophy is not about the real world Ethics for example asks what we should do in our everyday lives and metaphysics asks about how the world works and of what it is made

Sometimes people talk about how they have a personal philosophy which means the way a person thinks about the world This article is not about peoples personal philosophies This article is about the ideas that have been thought about by philosophers for a long time 

For thousands of years philosophers have asked questions such as

These ideas and questions from philosophy and many more have formed a large body of questions and knowledge that are written down in books 

There are many different types of philosophy from different times and places Some philosophers came from Ancient Greece such as Plato and Aristotle Others came from Asia such as Confucius or Buddha Some philosophers are from the Middle Ages in Europe such as William of Ockham or Saint Thomas Aquinas 

Philosophers from the 1600s 1700s and 1800s included Thomas Hobbes Ren Descartes John Locke David Hume and Immanuel Kant Philosophers from the 1900s included Ludwig Wittgenstein and Jean Paul Sartre

The word philosophy comes from two Greek words meaning love of wisdom

Philosophy is the study of humans and the world by thinking and asking questions It is a science and an art Philosophy tries to answer important questions by coming up with answers about real things and asking why

Sometimes philosophy tries to answer the same questions as religion and science Philosophers do not all come up with the same answers to questions Some people think there are no right answers in philosophy only better answers and worse answers 

Philosophy is a way of thinking in the middle ground that is between science and religion Many types of philosophy criticize or even attack the beliefs of science and religion 

In his work Critique of Pure Reason Immanuel Kant asked the following questions

The answers to these questions gives the different domains or categories of philosophy

Philosophy can be divided into different groups based on the types of questions that it asks Below is a list of questions split into groups One possible list of answers to these questions can be called a philosophy There are many different philosophies because all of these questions have many different answers according to different people Not all philosophies ask the same questions These are the questions that are usually asked by philosophers from Europe

In metaphysics

Metaphysics is sometimes split up into ontology the philosophy of mind and the philosophy of religion but these sub branches are very close together

Ontology

The philosophy of mind

The philosophy of religion

In epistemology

In ethics

In aesthetics

In logic

In axiology

Does philosophy do any good Very few people would dispute this It is easy to argue that philosophy is a good thing because it helps people to think more clearly Philosophy helps people to understand the world and the way people act and think Philosophers believe that asking philosophical questions is useful because it brings wisdom and helps people to learn about the world and each other Some philosophers might even argue that the question Is philosophy good or bad is a philosophical question itself

However some people think that philosophy is harmful as philosophy encourages free thinking and often questions the beliefs that others hold For example philosophies such as some existentialist views say that there is no meaning to life or human existence except the meaning that we make up or invent People from some religions do not agree with the beliefs of existentialism

It should be noted that every major science including physics biology and chemistry are all disciplines that originally were considered philosophy As speculation and analysis about nature became more developed these subjects branched away This is a process that continues even today psychology only split in the past century In our own time subjects such as consciousness studies decision theory and applied ethics have increasingly found independence from philosophy as a whole Because of this philosophy seems useful because it makes new kinds of science

Philosophers ask questions about ideas They try to find answers to those questions Some thinkers find it very hard to find those words that best describe the ideas they have When they find answers to some of these questions philosophers often have the same problem that is how to best tell the answers they found to other people Depending on the meaning of the words they use the answers change 

Some philosophers are full time thinkers who work for universities or colleges These philosophers write books and articles about philosophy and teach classes about philosophy to university or college students

Other philosophers are just hobby thinkers who think about philosophy during their free time A small number of hobby thinkers have thought so much about philosophy that they are able to write articles for philosophy magazines Other people approach philosophy from another job For example monks artists and scientists may think about philosophical ideas and questions

Most philosophers work by asking questions and looking for good definitions of words to help them understand what a question means

Some philosophers say the only thing needed to answer a question is to find out what it means and that the only thing that makes philosophical questions such as those above difficult is that people do not really know what they mean

Philosophers will also often use both real and imaginary examples to make a point For example they may write about a real or fictional person in order to show what they think a good person or a bad person is like

Some philosophers look for the simplest way to answer a question and say that is probably the right answer This is a process called Occams razor Others believe that complicated answers to questions can also be right For an example of a philosophical problem see the God paradox

Physics a branch of science is the study of forces and their impacts on the environment Modern physics connects ideas together about the laws of symmetry and conservation

Physics is the study of matter and energy in space and time and how they are related to each other Physicists assume the existence of mass length time and electric current and then define all other physical quantities in terms of these basic units Mass length time and electric current are never defined but the standard units used to measure them are always defined In the International System of Units the metre is the basic unit of length the kilogram is the basic unit of mass the second is the basic unit of time the Ampere is the basic unit of electric current

In addition to these four units there are three other ones the mole which is the unit of the quantity of matter the candela which measure the luminous intensity and the Kelvin the unit of temperature

Physics studies how things move and the forces that make them move For example velocity and acceleration are used by physics to show how things move Also physicists study the forces of gravity electricity magnetism and the forces that hold things together 

Physics studies very large things and very small things For instance physicists can study stars planets and galaxies but could also study small pieces of matter such as atoms and electronsThey may also studies sound light and other waves As well as that they could examine energy heat and radioactivity and even space and time Physics not only helps people understand how objects move but how they change form how they make noise how hot or cold they will be and what they are made of at the smallest level

Physics is a quantitative science because it is based on measuring with numbers Math is used in physics to make models that try to guess what will happen in nature The guesses are compared to the way the real world works Physicists are always working to make their models of the world better

Physics is the science of matter and how matter interacts Matter is any physical material in the universe Everything is made of matter Physics is used to describe the physical universe around us and to predict how it will behave Physics is the science concerned with the discovery and characterization of the universal laws which govern matter movement and forces and space and time and other features of the natural world

The sweep of physics is broad from the smallest components of matter and the forces that hold it together to galaxies and even larger things There are only four forces that appear to operate over this whole range However even these four forces are believed to be different parts of a single force 

Physics is mainly focused on the goal of making ever simpler more general and more accurate rules that define the character and behavior of matter and space itself One of the major goals of physics is making theories that apply to everything in the universe In other words physics can be viewed as the study of those universal laws which define at the most basic level possible the behavior of the physical universe

Physics uses the scientific method That is data from experiments and observations are collected Theories which attempt to explain these data are produced Physics uses these theories to not only describe physical phenomena but to model physical systems and predict how these physical systems will behave Physicists then compare these predictions to observations or experimental evidence to show whether the theory is right or wrong

The theories that are well supported by data and are especially simple and general are sometimes called scientific laws Of course all theories including those known as laws can be replaced by more accurate and more general laws when a disagreement with data is found

Physics is more quantitative than most other sciences That is many of the observations in physics may be represented in the form of numerical measurements Most of the theories in physics use mathematics to express their principles Most of the predictions from these theories are numerical This is because of the areas which physics has addressed are more amenable to quantitative approaches than other areas Sciences also tend to become more quantitative with time as they become more highly developed and physics is one of the oldest sciences

Classical physics normally includes the fields of mechanics optics electricity magnetism acoustics and thermodynamics Modern physics is a term normally used to cover fields which rely on quantum theory including quantum mechanics atomic physics nuclear physics particle physics and condensed matter physics as well as the more modern fields of general and special relativity Although this distinction can be found in older writings it is of little recent interest as quantum effects are now understood to be of importance even in fields previously considered classical

There are many approaches to studying physics and many different kinds of actitivies in physics There are two main types of activities in physics the collection of data and the development of theories 

The data in some subfields of physics is amenable to experiment For example condensed matter physics and nuclear physics benefit from the ability to perform experiments Experimental physics focuses mainly on an empirical approach Sometimes experiments are done to explore nature and in other cases experiments are performed to produce data to compare with the predictions of theories 

Some other fields in physics like astrophysics and geophysics are primarily observational sciences because most their data has to be collected passively instead of through experimentation Nevertheless observational programs in these fields uses many of the same tools and technology that are used in the experimental subfields of physics 

Theoretical physics often uses quantitative approaches to develop the theories that attempt to explain the data In this way theoretical physics often relies heavily on tools from mathematics Theoretical physics often can involve creating quantitative predictions of physical theories and comparing these predictions quantitatively with data Theoretical physics sometimes creates models of physical systems before data is available to test and validate these models 

These two main activities in physics data collection and theory production and testing draw on many different skills This has led to a lot of specialization in physics and the introduction development and use of tools from other fields For example theoretical physicists apply mathematics and numerical analysis and statistics and probability and computers and computer software in their work Experimental physicists develop instruments and techniques for collecting data drawing on engineering and computer technology and many other fields of technology Often the tools from these other areas are not quite appropriate for the needs of physics and need to be adapted or more advanced versions have to be produced

There are many famous physicists Isaac Newton studied gravity Galileo Galilei studied light and how planets move Albert Einstein made a theory for how light can make electrons move and studied how gravity affects light and space James Clerk Maxwell proved that light is a type of electromagnetic wave

Ernest Rutherford stated that Physics is the only real science The rest are just stamp collecting

Politics is the way that people living in groups make decisions Politics is about making agreements between people so that they can live together in groups such as tribes cities or countries In large groups such as countries some people may spend a lot of their time making such agreements These people are called politicians Politicians and sometimes other people may get together to form a government The study of politics in universities is called political science political studies or public administration

In everyday life the term politics refers to the way that countries are governed and to the ways that governments make rules and laws But politics can also be seen in other groups too such as in big companies schools and churches

The government tries to lead the whole group Governments do things such as

One of the ways the government leads the group is by making laws and rules which tell everybody what they can and can not do The government makes these laws so that society will be safe and well ordered The law that you must not drink alcohol while driving a car stops people from drunk driving which could kill people The law you must wear a helmet on a motorcycle makes sure that people protect themselves

The government can also control people and what happens in a country in other ways besides making laws

Politics is often compared to ethics Ethics is a more abstract study of right and wrong Ethics is usually more concerned with principle than law or politics or diplomacy so many people think ethics is not practical But without some agreement on ethics there is probably no way to even have a public debate a legal system or an election There is always some agreement on ethics and personal conduct in a political system

In most countries people have formed political parties to put forward their ideas There is usually some disagreement between people within a party but they work together because they feel that they agree on enough things and they will have more power if they join together They agree to take the same position on many issues and agree to support the same changes to law and the same leaders An election is usually a competition between different parties

The Greek philosopher Aristotle wrote that humans are a political animal and that ethics and politics are closely linked

Niccolo Machiavelli wrote that politics was firstly about having and keeping power He said that without power a leader could do nothing

In 1651 Thomas Hobbes wrote Leviathan a book about politics Hobbes wrote that people living in groups often give up some of their rights in exchange for some protections from a government

In the 1800s John Stuart Mill developed the liberal idea of politics Mill said that democracy is the most important political development of the 1800s He said that there should be more protection for individual rights against the government Bernard Crick wrote a list of the political virtues which were about best practices of politics itself

There are also disagreements between different countries Attempts to solve the problem with meetings and negotiations are then called diplomacy This is just politics between nations instead of politics within nations If the problems are very serious or very minor and they are not resolved by diplomatic meetings they definitely lead to war

A value usually means an abstract rule one that can be seen to apply in many experiences or can be applied by choice in a lot of situations It can also mean a moral choice one makes often and consistently for example many Buddhists avoid eating meat as a matter of principle 

Many groups of people agree on lists of principles They may also try to agree on the order in which they are to apply that is which principles should be violated before which other ones They might also try to list best practices which reflect the principles in the right order and provide more practical instruction

Profanity is the act of using rude words The adjective is profane Profanities can also be called swear words curse words dirty words bad words foul language obscenity or obscene language or expletives It can be called an oath although this word also has a normal meaning of a solemn promise 

Religious profanity is called blasphemy The verb is to blaspheme and the adjective is blasphemous Saying God or Jesus Christ as an expression of surprise or annoyance is considered by many people to be blasphemy mostly because one of the Ten Commandments says not to use the Christian gods name in vain Swearing oaths can also be considered wrong by some who follow Jesus teaching against swearing oaths in the Gospels

A profanity usually refers to religion sex or broken wikt linkbodily functionsbodily functions These are things that people feel very strongly about In some languages such as French there is more profanity about religion than most other topics Russian has more about broken wikt linkdefecationdefecation and the lower broken wikt linkdigestive tractdigestive tract

A profanity can be a word or gesture or some other form of behaviour 

Different words can be profanity to different people and what words are thought of as profanity in English can change over time

Whether a word is a profanity will always depend on the way people think Some people will be offended by something while others will not be Words which should not be used are taboo words Using such words is thought by some people to be a sin

Some people call profanity crude but some say that it is no cruder to say damn than puke People who use profanity do not always mean to make anybody feel bad and tolerance for different forms of profanity can vary widely from person to person Most often using profanity is a verbal outlet for strong feelings that might otherwise cause a physical reaction At other times some people may use profanity as humor

Some people develop a mental condition where they use profanity constantly This is called coprolalia Many people think this is called Tourettes syndrome Tourettes syndrome is actually a group of disorders that only includes coprolalia 15 of the time The condition can be broken wikt linkaggravateaggravated by stress

Several of these words come from Anglo Saxon or Norse names for body parts and bodily functions They came to be thought of as profanity mostly after the Normans brought French and Latin words for them to England

These are mostly performed while facing another person and can be meant toward them or about them These gestures are considered as strong as profane words in most cases

The capital city is Beijing and Shanghai is the biggest city United Kingdom and Portugal returned Hong Kong and Macao back to China in 1997 and 1999 respectively These two cities remain highly autonomous The central government is responsible for defense and foreign affairs but not the daily operations for 50 years PRC claims Taiwan as one of the many provinces However PRC does not have control of Taiwan which has an entirely different political system and officially known as the Republic of China

Chinese civilization has been around since the second millennium BCE as a feudal society Its land area has mostly looked like that of modern China except with northern and western edges that varied often It has been commonly attacked by the northern people such as Genghis Khan and Kublai Khan While China achieved many things in the First millennium CE and early second millennium CE it became an isolationist country in the 15th century CE 

By the Renaissance European powers started to take over other countries in Asia While China was never actually taken over many European countries such as Britain and France built spheres of influence in China Since China had cut itself off from the world over the previous few centuries it had fallen behind other countries in technology and was helpless to stop this from happening This had become clear when it lost the Opium Wars to Britain in the 19th century 

In 1911 the monarchy was overthrown by Sun Yat sen who started a Nationalist government Over time Marxist philosophies grew under the Nationalist rule In 1927 the Chinese Civil War started which was fought by the Nationalist leader Chiang Kai shek and the Communist leaders Mao Zedong gradually took over the power within the Communist Party whose army was called the Red Army At the background Japan continued to expand their influence and control of north and northeast provinces of China The Nationalists and Communists joined to fight Japan The conflict became part of and led to World War II After the war against Japanese civil war started again 

By 1949 the Red Army won Chiang Kai shek and the Nationalists fled to Taiwan Mao Zedong has been in power although for a long period of time he did not have official position in the government as the leader of China until he died in 1976 During that time China had bad relations with the Western World In the late 60s and early 70s PRC is even more isolated after the Sino Soviet Split Before Mao died initial contact with US took place in order to counter the threat from USSR 

All though the initial 30 years of governing the Communist Party led by Mao Zedong has eliminated free thinking in politics economics and academic aspects The peak of all these is known as the Cultural Revolution which is a disaster in human history not only because millions of people were killed but also because the traditional value system was destroyed as a result The Communist Party is still not willing to admit the fault and a lot of criminal actions associated with the Cultural Revolution 

After Mao Deng Xiaoping as one of the 1st generation Communist Party leaders took power and launched the Change and Open Policy 

In 1979 because of the overpopulation problem in China he made the one child policy which put a limit on how many children couples can have 

In 1989 the Chinese government used tanks to stop a protest killing thousands of people in Beijings Tianamen Square

China also has some problems with news censorship and Internet being blocked by the government

In August 2008 China hosted the Summer Olympics for the first time

There were severe snow storms through out China in the Winter of 2009 2010 On 12 October 2009 Just over 200 herdsmen and 1000 heads of livestock had been stranded by heavy snowfalls in Ali prefecture The week long snowfall had accumulated to about 30 centimetres in Pulan County of Ali with some areas reaching as much as 1 meter depth according to Xing Xiuyin head of an armed police detachment stationed in the Tibetan region 30 soldiers and two snow clearing machines were sent on the way to Ali according to Xing Xiuyin Thousands of people were trapped as heavy snow fell in Tibets Lhunze County but rescue services managed to minimize the casualties and housing losses The rescue services also managed to provide shelter and emergency fodder for 200 head of cattle By October 13 snow was reported by Chinese authorities to be falling in both Qinghai and Heilongjiang Provinces

A power structure is a system to decide who can decide and for how long their decision stands and who can be forced to comply with their decision

In democracy this is done by educating people in the issues and then voting  in an election to choose leaders or a referendum to actually choose one option from several Competing power networks each form a political party and each offers only one leader or one option to the public to simplify the issues to make decisions possible After the decision they typically do not fight it to the point of civil war but wait for the next election

In dictatorship this is done by asking one powerful person to make the decision and then agreeing to force everyone to follow it Any who will not are exiled imprisoned or killed even if the decision is not very important since the refusal to follow is taken as a challenge to the power structure itself There is only one power network and all others are forced to become part of it or fight it Civil war is much more common in a dictatorship than in a democracy

A monarchy is a traditional form of dictatorship Over time the advisors and eventually the actual decision makers have become elected in many countries Also limits are put on the powers of the monarch  to make constitutional monarchy For more on this and other theories of power see civics

Psychoneuroimmunology or mind body medicine is a view of medicine and health It partly explains healing as a process of regaining balances not as curing

Disturbing and correcting forces which may be molecules or hormones are treated in a more abstract and social way than in most other medicine Family and other social network connections play a very major role in healing in this view and are more important than drugs

Much biology supports this view Some immune system responses cannot be explained unless they are strongly linked to the nervous system and the senses Examples are the type of epileptic seizure that can only be triggered by light or an allergy that goes off if only a few molecules not even enough to smell are received into the nose Also there are cases of people with HIV who have lived a very long time with almost no functioning immune system only their positive attitude seems to make them different from those who die

Sometimes the whole system is compared to a symphony orchestra in your body There are different types of instruments playing in sections which are like the different systems in your body Rhythm and overall level of stress matter much more than how any individual part of the system works Rest and sleep matter a great deal just as they would for symphony players

An important difference between this view and other medicine is that someone is not just sick until they are well but will go through periods of time feeling sick and feeling well as a part of the rhythms starting to work So a child for instance should not just go to bed and stay there for a period of time but should be able to get up and do things even if they have to go back to bed quickly afterward to rest some more

Dr Esther Sternberg an expert in this field believes that the body has its own internal way of restoring its balance and that doctors usually cannot improve these In 500 BC she says it was common to build temples to Asclepius the god of healing and they had long sloping ramps to let sick people use them There were hospital like cells and healthy food and fresh water were served Removing day to day stress getting enough sleep and music dreams exercise nutrition prayer and interaction with others were all part of the method Advocates of this approach to healing believe that modern hospitals are making mistakes by isolating the sick unless they are infectious which is good for others but not necessarily for the sick themselves

A political party is an organized group of voters It often puts forward candidates for public office In a democracy leaders must run for office in an election In a dictatorship there is generally only one party allowed that can approve a new leader without non members having a choice 

A political party is similar to a faction and can be the same thing In some systems members of one party in the legislature are all expected to vote the same way The laws written by the party or faction with the majority of votes become adopted by the country so this means whatever party is elected to over half the seats gets to run the government The next largest party is often called the opposition Sometimes when there are more than two parties with seats no one party has over half of the seats Then two or more parties might join together to form what is called a coalition

Some parties are formed around a single issue or interest group Others form policies to address all matters of government known as a platform

Many political parties have a set of ideas and beliefs People often describe these ideologies using words such as rightwing and leftwing 

Common ideologies include environmentalism socialism conservatism democracy liberalism and nationalism

Political parties can be against the law in some places When some parties get a lot of power they can make all other political parties illegal For example the Nazi Party did this in Germany and the Communist Party did it in several countries Some countries make extreme right parties illegal At other times countries have outlawed far left parties For example West Germany banned the Communist Party in 1956

A handful of countries like China North Korea and Cuba still have one party dictatorships In a few other dictatorships such as Saudi Arabia all political parties are banned and there is no parliament at all

In all big democratic countries parties are very important But there are a few very small countries such as the island of Jersey where most politicians do not belong to any party and where parties do not matter much

In some democracies there are only two big political parties For example in the United States there is the Democratic Party and the Republican Party Some other parties exist but are very small and do not hold seats in Congress

In other countries there are larger numbers of parties In the German federal Parliament six parties have seats In the United Kingdom there are two big parties one medium sized party and many small ones

A page can be different things

A pet is a domesticated animal that lives with people but is not forced to work and is not eaten in most instances In most cases a pet is kept to entertain people or for companionship Some pets such as dogs and cats are placed in an animal shelter if there is no one willing to take care of it If no one adopts it or the pet is too oldsick the pet may be killed

Dogs cats fish birds are the most common pets in North America Horses elephants oxen and donkeys are usually made to work so they are not usually called pets Some dogs also do work for people and it was once common for some birds to work for humans

Rodents are also very popular pets The most common are guinea pigs rabbits hamsters mice and rats

A product can mean a few things

The term Program can be used in many ways

Platonic realism is the philosophical idea that one must try to know about perfect things even though you know that they do not exist and may not be able to be understood It is named after the philosopher Plato Plato thought that goodness was part of reality but was part of a parallel perfect universe Plato thought it was the job of the philosopher to look for reflections of these perfect things in our universe and to teach others about what they found

In philosophy of mathematics someone is called a Platonist if they believe a mathematical proof is part of reality but also that it is not part of our universe but a parallel perfect one Mathematical Platonists also believe that numbers are not related to things in our universe and that even if there was never a group of one million things that the number one million would still be a real number 

Some think this idea affects our ideas about money and our ideas of time It is hard to say if this is true since platonism is so basic in the Western culture Plato and his student Aristotle had many ideas which are still the most important in this culture It is hard to say if this one was critical Gods eye view may be more important especially in politics

Today Platonism is mostly considered a philosophy of mathematics but not of science or reality in general This might under estimate its effects But no one calls themselves Platonist other than a few mathematicians today

A paradox is a sentence in logic that cannot be true but also cannot be false Many famous problems of this kind exist

One of most famous paradoxes is called the liars paradox It is the simple sentence This sentence is a lie

If the sentence is true then it is a lie as it says But if it is a lie how can it be true A lie cannot also be the truth So the sentence being true makes it a lie

If the sentence is a lie then it is not as it says it is true But that is just what the sentence says So that makes it true So the sentence being a lie makes it true

This paradox is not just true in English but in any language powerful enough for a sentence to make a claim about itself This is true of mathematics as well Paradox can never be removed from any symbol system that makes claims about itself

Another example is the statement that there is no cabal Only a cabal can know if there is no cabal so this is either a guess or it is a cabal trying to pretend it does not exist

Other famous examples

A paradox can also arise in ethics Taking power over others is often also required to protect them but also one of the things being protected is their ability to do as they please which this power interferes with There is another article on ethical dilemma which means a paradox arising in ethics

Because a paradox forces us to think out of the box about possibilities other than true or false in logic right or wrong in morality it is considered very important in education People who do not see a paradox where others do are likely to be too certain they are right

A potato is a type of vegetable The scientific name of the potato plant is Solanum tuberosum It contains a lot of starch and other carbohydrates It is a small plant with large leaves The part of the potato that people eat is a tuber that grows under the ground It usually has a brown or pink skin and is white or yellow inside If it gets light on it the tuber turns green and will be poisonous

The potato is from the high and cool areas of the Andes of Peru It began to be grown as a food crop more than 7000 years ago When the Europeans came to South America in the 1500s they took the potato back to Europe It took nearly 200 years for the potato to become a widely grown crop In the 1780s the farmers in Ireland began growing potatoes because they grew well in the poor soils They also have most of the vitamins that people need to survive The Irish became so dependent on the potato that when the crop failed in 1845 there was a famine and many people starved to death

The potato plant is now grown in many different parts of the world Captain William Bligh planted potatoes on Bruny Island Tasmania in 1792 In Australia they are now the largest vegetable crop

There are now many different types of potato These have names such as

Scientists in Germany have used genetic engineering to make a potato called the Amflora which could be grown to make starch for making other things in factories

The potato is not very good to eat unless it is cooked People cook potatoes by boiling roasting or frying them French fries or chips are potatoes cut into long pieces and fried until they are soft Potato chips often called crisps are potatoes cut into very thin round pieces and fried until they are hard 

William Shakespeare wrote that the potato was an aphrodisiac but there is no evidence to show this is true

Plants are one of five big groups of living things They are autotrophic eukaryotes which means they have complex cells and make their own food Usually they cannot move

Plants include familiar types such as trees herbs bushes grasses vines ferns mosses and green algae The scientific study of plants known as botany has identified about 350000 extant species of plants Fungi and non green algae are not classed as plants 

Most plants grow in the ground with stems above and roots below Water and some nutrients come from the roots The evaporation of water from pores in the leaves pulls water through the plant This is called transpiration 

A plant needs sunlight carbon dioxide minerals and water to make food A green substance in plants called chlorophyll traps the energy from the Sun needed to make food Chlorophyll is mostly found in leaves inside plastids which are inside the leaf cells The leaf can be thought of as a food factory Leaves of plants vary in shape and size but they are always the plant organ best suited to capture solar energy Once the food is made in the leaf it is transported to the other parts of the plant such as stems and roots

The word plant can also mean to put something in the ground For example farmers plant seeds in the ground 

Green algae

Land plants

At least some plant cells contain photosynthetic organelles which enable them to make food for themselves With sunlight water and carbon dioxide the plastids make sugars the basic molecules needed by the plant Free oxygen is produced as a by product of photosynthesis 

Later in the cell cytoplasm the sugars may be turned into amino acids for proteins nucleotides for DNA and RNA and carbohydrates such as starch This process needs certain minerals nitrogen potassium phosphorus iron and magnesium

Plant nutrition is the study of the chemical elements that are necessary for plant growth 

Macronutrients

Micronutrients include

The roots of plants perform two main functions First they anchor the plant to the ground Second they absorb water and various nutrients dissolved in water from the soil Plants use the water to make food The water also provides the plant with support Plants that lack water become very limp and their stems cannot support their leaves Plants which specialise in desert areas are called xerophytes

Water is transported from the roots to the rest of the plant through special vessels in the plant When the water reaches the leaves some of it evaporates into the air Many plants need the help of fungi to make their roots work properly This plantfungi symbiosis is called mycorrhiza Rhizobia bacteria in root nodules help some plants get nitrogen

Flowers are the reproductive organ only of flowering plants The petals of a flower are often brightly colored and scented to attract insects and other pollinators The stamen is the male part of the plant It is composed of the filament that holds the anther which produces the pollen Pollen is needed for plants to produce seeds The carpel is the female part of the flower The top part of the carpel contains the stigma The style is the neck of the carpel The ovary is the swollen area at the bottom of the carpel The ovary produces the seeds The sepal is a leaf that protects a flower as a bud

The process by which pollen gets transferred from one flower to another flower is called pollination This transfer can happen in different ways Insects such as bees are attracted to bright scented flowers When bees go into the flower to gather nectar the spiky pollen sticks to their back legs The sticky stigma on another flower catches the pollen when the bee lands or flies nearby it 

Some flowers use the wind to carry pollen Their dangling stamens produce lots of pollen that is light enough to be carried by the wind Their flowers are usually small and not highly coloured The stigmas of these flowers are feathery and hang outside the flower to catch the pollen as it falls

A plant produces many spores or seeds Lower plants such as moss and ferns produce spores The seed plants are the Gymnosperms and Angiosperms If all the seeds fell to the ground besides the plant the area might become overcrowded There might not be enough water and minerals for all the seeds Seeds usually have some way to get to new places Some seeds can be dispersed by the wind or by water Seeds inside juicy fruits are dispersed after being eaten Sometimes seeds stick to animals and are dispersed that way

A prediction is a statement that someone makes about what they think is going to happen It is often very helpful to know what is going to happen to help prepare for these future events Predictions are based on the idea that two beginning positions that are like each other will have similar results By watching something happen it is possible to predict what will happen if something similar happens Predictions are given by science or fortune tellers or horoscopes 

The most common example of a prediction is the weather forecast Studying how weather happens lets people predict what the weather will be by looking at what is currently happening This is helpful because by knowing that it is going to rain a person can wear the right clothes for it

Nostradamus has made many predictions about future

Probability is a part of mathematics It has to do with chance the study of things that might happen or might not happen 

For example using probability you can show that if you throw a coin up in the air and let it land half of the time it will land with one side facing up and half the time with the other side facing up Many coins have a picture of the face of a famous person on one side and something else on the other side Often people call the side with the face heads and the other side tails

The probability of an event is always between zero and one

If we roll a die then the chance that it will land on 1 is 16 Also the chance it will land on 2 is 16 This is because it can land on 1 2 3 4 5 or 6 The chance of any number between 1 and 6 landing is 1 Every time we roll the die it will always land on a number between 1 and 6

Probability can be figured out using math For example if you roll six dice the chance of you getting a number more than ten is not obvious but can be figured out using math and science

eoProbable



A probability experiment is a situation where chance affects the outcome If the experiment can only have two outcomes it is named Bernoulli trial A coin flip is a probability experiment because chance affects whether a coin will land heads or tails when it is flipped

Proteins are large molecules built from small units known as amino acids These small pieces are stuck together with peptide bonds They do different things depending on their shape They can be found in meat or muscle They are used for growth and repair as well as for strengthening the bones They help to make tissue and cells They can be found in animals plants fungi bacteria and also in the human body For example muscles contain a lot of proteins Body builders will eat foods with a lot of protein because exercise breaks down the muscles allowing new protein to be used to rebuild them larger and stronger Proteins form an important part in foods like milk eggs meat fish beans and nuts There are four things that determine what a protein will do The first is the order of the amino acids There are 20 amino acids and they are all a bit different The second is the little twists in the chain The third is how the entire thing is folded up The fourth is whether its working with other proteins

Animals eat proteins and break them down into amino acids in order to recombine them into other things needed including other proteins and other amino acids Animals have certain amino acids they are not able to create this way and must get from their food These are called essential amino acids and different animals have different amino acids they are not able to create Meat contains all the essential amino acids humans need most plants do not However eating a mixture of plants such as both wheat and peanut butter or rice and beans provides all the essential amino acids needed Soy products like tofu provide all the essential amino acids but are not the only way to get the protein you need Amino acids are used to build new proteins that are used as enzymes hormones or antibodies Protein is very important to have in your diet its basically what you are made of Proteins are essential for life

The scientist Jons Jacob Berzelius gave proteins their name but many other scientists have studied proteins

The periodic table of the chemical elements is a list of known atoms In the table the elements are placed in the order of their atomic numbers starting with the lowest number The atomic number of an element is the same as the number of electrons or protons in that particular atom

In the periodic table the elements are arranged into periods and groups 

A row of elements across the table is called a period Each period has a number from 1 to 7 Period 1 has only 2 elements in it hydrogen and helium Period 2 and Period 3 both have 8 elements Other periods are longer

A column of elements down the table is called a group There are 18 groups in the standard periodic table Each group has a number from 1 to 18 Elements in a group have electrons arranged in similar ways which gives them similar chemical properties For example group 18 is known as the noble gases because they are all gases and they do not combine with other atoms

The periodic table can be used by chemists to observe patterns and relationships between the elements For example elements to the bottom and far left of the table are the most metallic and elements on the top right are the least metallic There are also many other patterns and relationships

There are three systems of group numbers one using Arabic numerals and the other two using Roman numerals The Roman numeral names were used at first and are the traditional names the Arabic numeral names are newer names that the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry decided to use as well The IUPAC names were meant to replace the older Roman numeral systems as they used the same names to mean different things which was confusing

The Periodic Table was invented and arranged by the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev

The colour of the number above the element symbol shows the state of the element at normal conditions

Physiology is the study of how living things work Physiologists can study how organs of an organism work together to make things happen In human beings for example the digestion of food hormones and other chemicals are made by the stomach liver and pancreas Muscle contraction happens because of chemical messages made by nerves of that muscle By learning how the body functions normally physiologists and physicians can better understand what happens when organs do not function normally For example an understanding of how the thyroid gland functions has helped in treating goitre Studies of the circulatory system and the nervous system have helped physicians understand and treat such illnesses like heart disease stroke and high blood pressure

A planet according to modern philosophy is a large object such as Jupiter or Earth that orbits a star It is smaller than a star and it does not make light Planets are ball shaped Objects that orbit planets are called moons There are eight planets in the Solar System Pluto used to be known as a planet but in August 2006 the International Astronomical Union decided it was a dwarf planet instead There are five more known planets Ceres Makemake Eris and Haumea

The name planet is from the Greek word meaning wanderers or things that move Until the 1990s people only knew of those in the Solar System As of June 2011 we know of 563 other planets All of these newly found planets are orbiting other stars they are extrasolar planets Sometimes people call them exoplanets

The planets in the Solar System have names of Greek or Roman gods apart from Earth because people did not think Earth was a planet in old times However Earth is occasionally referred by the name of a Roman god Terra Other languages for example Chinese use different names Moons also have names of gods and people from classical mythology or from the plays written by Shakespeare 

Here is a list of planets in our Solar System They are ordered by how close they are to the Sun nearest first 

Astronomers speak about major planets and minor planets which are smaller objects that go around the Sun Some examples of minor planets are asteroids comets and trans Neptunian objects

Planets in the Solar System are of three sorts

Many objects in the Solar System that are not planets are also icy Examples are the icy moons of the outer planets of the Solar System

The Peoples Republic of China claims that the island of Taiwan is part of its territory but the Republic of China still claims the land as theirs and tries to control Taiwan

Many people say the government stops people from having freedom of speech freedom of religion and other political rights that people in western countries have

The following territories are claimed by China and by another country or more

Unequal treaties were forced onto Asian countries when European imperialism reached Asia The list includes claims from PRC and ROC as well as unofficial historical claims Note Japans and Koreas unequal treaties have been resolved since the end of WWII

The police are a group of people whose job it is to enforce laws help with emergencies solve crimes and protect the public People who work for the police are called police officers They work out of a police station Police are trained in first aid and rescue because police officers are often one of the first people to get to a place where people are sick or injured such as a car accident or a fire

The police have different powers to help them do their job These powers are different in different countries Most police officers have the power to arrest people search people and their houses and carry equipment such as guns batons and pepper spray The area where a police officer can use these powers is called their jurisdiction If the officer goes outside of his jurisdiction he is no longer allowed to use his powers Another police force has to then take over

The police deal with

Most police departments have most of their officers in two main groups a patrol group that has officers who wear uniforms and a detective group that has officers who wear normal clothing 

Not all countries use the same words to describe these groups In the United Kingdom for example patrol officers form the uniform branch while detectives work within the CID Police uniforms equipment and methods can change a lot depending on the country In some areas groups of police are train for special jobs such as dealing with riots or when a situation is very bad 

Different countries have different names for their police In Ireland they are called the Garda and in Russia they are called the Militsiyaner Other names for police services are sheriffs office marshals office or department of public safety In the same country there can be different types of police officer who have powers in different areas and situations such as state police military police and local police

In most countries police officers have been trained to carry guns Even in countries like the United Kingdom New Zealand and the Republic of Ireland where most police officers do not carry guns more are being trained to do so because gun crime is getting worse Firearms training teaches that the use of a firearm is only when lives are at risk 

Mathematicians people who do math have known about pi for thousands of years because they have been working with circles for the same amount of time Civilizations as old as the Ancient Egyptians and the Babylonians have been able to approximate pi to many digits such as the fraction 258 and 25681 The first written reference to it dates to 1900 BC Around 1650 BC the Egyptian Ahmes gave a value in the Rhind Papyrus The Babylonians were able to find that the value of pi was slightly greater than 3 by simply making a big circle and then sticking a piece of rope onto the circumference and the diameter taking note of their distances and then dividing the circumference by the diameter Knowledge of the number pi passed back into Europe and into the hands of the Hebrews who made the number important in a section of the Bible called the Old Testament where the Catholic Church would later emphasizeCitation needed After this the most common way of trying to find pi was to draw a shape of many sides inside any circle and use the area of the shape to find measure pi The Greek philosopher Archimedes for example used a shape that had 96 sides in order to find the value of pi but the Chinese in 500 AD were able to use a shape with 16384 sides to find the value of pi The Greeks like Anaxagoras of Clazomenae were also busy with finding out other properties of the circle such as how to make squares of circles and squaring the number pi Since then many people have been trying to find out more and more exact values of pi

In the 16th century better and better ways of finding pi became available such as the complicated formula that the French lawyer Franois Vite developed The first use of the Greek symbol was in an essay written in 1706 by William Jones

A mathematician named Lambert also showed in 1761 that the number pi was irrational that is it cannot be written as a fraction by normal standards Another mathematician named Lindeman was also able to show in 1882 that pi was part of the group of numbers known as transcendentals which are numbers that cannot be the solution to a polynomial equation

To calculate the circumference of a circle with an error of 1 mm

People generally celebrate March 14 as Pi Day because March 14 is also written as 314 which represents the first three numbers 314 in the approximation of pi

Pi is frequently used in math jokes to make the pun about how the word pi sounds like the word pie

A proper noun or proper name is a noun representing a unique thing as opposed to a common noun which represents a class of things Proper nouns are the only nouns in English which have the first letter capitalized 

In English proper nouns are not normally preceded by an article or other limiting modifier and are used to denote a particular person place or object without regard to any descriptive meaning the word or phrase may have

Which nouns are considered proper names depends on language For example names of days and months are considered proper names in English but not in Spanish French Swedish or Finnish where they are not capitalized

A plastic is a material that can change its shape so many things can be made of plastic There are many types of plastic Some can be shaped only when they are freshly made then they become hard afterwards Others can be changed by heating them up or even by melting them 

Most plastics are man made they do not occur in nature They are often made from oil that comes out of the ground The process of making plastics is usually quite complicated Most of the materials that are called plastic are polymers Polymers are long chains of atoms bonded to one another

People experimented with plastics based on natural polymers for a very long time Alexander Parkes an English inventor created the earliest form of plastic in 1855 It was hard but flexible and transparent and he called it Parkensine

Plastic is filling up the landfills and sometimes if you burn it it releases toxic fumes If you do not recycle it becomes waste 

Product stewardship includes waste disposal measures in the distribution chain of an industrial product That is paying for the safe and proper disposal when you pay for the product and relying on those who sold it to you to dispose of it 

The slightly more specific idea of product take back means that the service of waste disposal is paid for at time of purchase It is often applied to paint tires and other goods that become toxic waste if not disposed of properly It is most familiar as the deposit bottle  where one pays for the loan of the bottle at the same time as one purchases what is inside it The container deposit charged for a deposit bottle may be a fee to buy the bottle separately from the fee to buy what it contains If one returns the bottle the fee is returned and the supplier must return the bottle for re use or recycling If not one has paid the fee and presumably this can pay for landfill or litter control measures that dispose of say a broken bottle Also since the same fee can be collected by anyone finding and returning the bottle it is common for people to collect these and return them as a means of surviving This is quite common for instance among homeless people in US cities

Legal requirements vary the bottle itself may be considered simple property of the purchaser of the contents or the purchaser may have some obligation to return the bottle to some depot so it can be recycled or re used  For the more toxic items it is more likely that returning it is required

This principle is applied very broadly beyond bottles to paint and automobile parts such as tires When purchasing paint or tires in many places one simultaneously pays for the disposal of the toxic waste they become In some countries such as Germany law requires attention to the comprehensive outcome of the whole extraction production distribution use and waste of a product and holds those profiting from these legally responsible for any outcome along the way This is also the trend in the UK and EU generally In the United States there have been many class action suits that are effectively product stewardship liability  holding companies responsible for things the product does which it was never advertised to do

Rather than let liability for these problems be taken up by the public sector or be haphazardly assigned one issue at a time to companies via lawsuits many accounting reform efforts focus on achieving full cost accounting This is the financial reflection of the comprehensive outcome  noting the gains and losses to all parties involved not just those investing or purchasing Such moves have made moral purchasing more attractive as it avoids liability and future lawsuits

So these are partial implementations of a strict service economy ideal

Those who advocate these measures are concerned with the later phases of product lifecycle and the comprehensive outcome of the whole production process It is considered a pre requisite to a strict service economy interpretation of commodity and product relationships

Peace is a time without any fights or wars In a larger sense peace can mean a state of harmony quiet or calm that is not disturbed by anything at all like a still pond with no ripples

Peace within and among states is a goal of many people and organizations One organization that was set up to bring peace among the nations and try to make war a thing of the past was the League of Nations after World War I When it failed to stop World War II it was replaced by the United Nations which tries to make the world peaceful by standing for collective security between all the members This means that if any member is attacked or invaded by another country without attacking that country first the other members will come to help the country that was attacked first This idea was used by the United Nations to defend both South Korea and Kuwait when they were attacked

Martin Luther King Jr wrote in a letter he sent from the Birmingham jail that True peace is not merely the absence of tension it is the presence of justice In other words Real peace is more than just problems being gone there must be fairness to have peace

Alfred Nobel created an annual award the Nobel Peace Prize for the person who had done the most to bring peace to the world

Buddhists think that peace can be gotten once all suffering ends To get rid of suffering and get this peace they follow a set of teachings called the Four Noble Truths a central tenet to their philosophy 

Jews and Christians believe that true peace comes from a personal relationship with God Jesus Christ said Peace I leave with you my peace I give you I do not give to you as the world gives Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid

Inner peace refers to a state of being mentally and spiritually at peace with enough knowledge and understanding to keep oneself strong in the face of broken wikt linkdiscorddiscord or stress Being at peace is considered by many to be healthy and the opposite of being stressed or anxious Peace of mind is generally associated with bliss and happiness

Peace of mind serenity and calmness are descriptions of a disposition free from the effects of stress In some cultures inner peace is considered a state of consciousness or enlightenment that may be cultivated by various forms of training such as prayer meditation Tai Chi Chuan or yoga for example Many spiritual practices refer to this peace as an experience of knowing oneself Finding inner peace is often associated with traditions such as Buddhism and Hinduism

A movement that seeks to get ideals such as the ending of a particular war minimize inter human violence in a particular place or type of situation often linked to the goal of achieving world peace Means to achieve these ends usually include advocacy of pacifism non violent resistance diplomacy boycotts moral purchasing supporting anti war political candidates demonstrations and lobbying to create legislation

Many different theories of peace exist in the world of peace studies which involves the study of conflict transformation The definition of peace can vary with religion culture or subject of study

Peace is a state of balance and understanding in yourself and between others where respect is gained by the acceptance of differences tolerance persists conflicts are resolved through dialog peoples rights are respected and their voices are heard and everyone is at their highest point of serenity without social tension

Quebec is a province in Eastern Canada It is the biggest of Canadas ten provinces It is the province with the second highest number of people Most of Quebecs inhabitants live along or close to the banks of the Saint Lawrence River Not many people live in the north part of the province Unlike the other provinces most people in Quebec speak French There is a strong French language culture which includes French language newspapers magazines television and radio shows and movies

The government of Quebec has its offices in the capital Quebec City one of the oldest cities in North America The largest city in Quebec and the second largest city in Canada is Montreal

Quebec has many natural resources that are used to create jobs Quebec also has many companies that create products for information and communication technologies aerospace biotechnology and health industries It has also developed close relations with the Northeastern United States

Quebec was part of New France until 1760 Quebec became a province in the Canadian Confederation in 1867 Since then some people in Quebec have wanted to leave Canada Since Quebec is a mainly French speaking province most of the people there feel that it is very different from the rest of Canada and a select few are proud of this difference and want to keep it that way They feel that for this to happen Quebec must leave Canada and become its own country However the people of province are still divided as to its place in Canada Quebec people held democratic votes in 1980 and 1995 to decide whether to leave Canada In 1995 the people of Quebec voted on the question and chose to stay in Canada by a 1 margin

Aboriginal people and Inuit groups were the first peoples who lived in what is now Qubec These Aboriginal people lived by hunting gathering and fishing Some of the Aboriginal people called Iroquoians planted squash and maize The Inuit fish and hunt whales and seals for fur and food and they sometimes warred with each other

Vikings came in longboats from Scandinavia in 1000 BC Basque whalers and fishermen traded furs with Aboriginal people throughout the 1500s

The first French explorer to reach Quebec was Jacques Cartier He sailed into the St Lawrence River in 1534 and established a colony near present day Quebec City

Samuel de Champlain came from France and traveled into the St Lawrence River In 1608 he founded Quebec City as a permanent fur trading outpost Champlain signed trading and military agreements with the Aboriginal people Voyageurs coureurs des bois and Catholic missionaries used river canoes to explore the interior of the North American continent 

After 1627 King Louis XIII of France made a rule that only Roman Catholics could go to live in New France Jesuit clerics tried to convert New Frances Aboriginal people to Catholicism New France became a Royal Province of France in 1663 The population grew from about 3000 to 60000 people between 1666 and 1760 Colonists built farms on the banks of St Lawrence River

In 1753 France began building a series of forts in the British Ohio Country Britain asked the French to remove the forts and the French refused By 1756 France and Britain were at war In 1758 the British attacked New France by sea and captured the French fort at Louisbourg

In 1759 British General James Wolfe defeated General Louis Joseph de Montcalm outside Quebec City France gave its North American land to Great Britain in 1763 In 1764 New France was renamed the Province of Quebec

In 1774 the British Parliament passed the Quebec Act giving recognition to French law Catholic religion and French language in the colony The Quebec Act gave the Quebec people their first Charter of rights The Quebec Act made American colonists angry so they launched the American Revolution A 1775 invasion by the American Continental Army was stopped at Quebec City In 1783 Quebec gave the territory south of the Great Lakes to the new United States of America In 1867 the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed the British North America Act which brought most of the provinces together

The conservative government of Maurice Duplessis dominated Quebec politics from 1944 to 1960 with the support of the Catholic church The Quiet Revolution was a period of social and political change During the Quiet Revolution English Canadians lost their control over the Quebec economy the Roman Catholic Church became less important and the Quebec government took over the hydro electric companies

In 1963 a terrorist group that became known as the Front de Libration du Qubec began doing bombings robberies and attacks on government offices In 1970 the FLQ kidnapped and killed James Cross the British trade commissioner to Canada and Pierre Laporte a provincial minister and Vice Premier Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau invoked the War Measures Act and 497 people were arrested

The Quiet Revolution was so named because it was not marked by protests or violence

In 1977 the newly elected Parti Qubcois government of Ren Lvesque introduced the Charter of the French Language Often known as Bill 101 it defined French as the only official language of Quebec 

Reading is a way of getting information from something that is written Reading involves recognising the symbols that make up a language Reading and hearing are the two most common ways to get information Information gained from reading can include entertainment especially when reading fiction or humor

Reading by people is mostly done from paper Stone or chalk on a blackboard can also be read Computer displays can be read

Reading can be something that someone does by themself or they can read aloud This could be to benefit other listeners It could also be to help your own concentration 

Proofreading is a kind of reading that is done to find mistakes in a piece of writing

A religion is a set of beliefs that is held by a group of people There are many different religions each with a different set of beliefs The beliefs are about the world and the people in it about how they came into being and what their purpose is These beliefs are often linked to supernatural beings such as god a number of gods or spirits They may also be linked to an idea such as a path that the spirit of each person should take towards goodness truth and duty Each religion has different ideas about these things Each religion also has a moral code which is a set of beliefs about how humans should act Each religion usually has their own type of devotions when people worship or pray They often have rituals for certain times of the year or certain times of a persons life Other words that are used for religion are faith and belief system 

The main religions today are called the World Religions They are

There are many other religions such as Jainism Tenrikyo Wicca Zoroastrianism and Pantheism

People who do not believe in any religion are called atheists People who say that they are not sure whether they believe or not are called agnostics 

In many religions one of the main beliefs is that there is a deity who is a great creator spirit In many religions there is just one deity that the people believe in In other religions there are many deities who each have different roles in the universe In many religions there are other types of spirits These may include angels devils and other such things which can be both good and bad 

Giving honour to God the gods or the spirits is an important part of most religions While this may often be done privately it is also often done with gatherings of people and rituals These rituals are often based on old traditions and may have been done in almost the same way for hundreds or even thousands of years 

Another main belief is that humans have a soul or spirit which lives on after their body has died The persons spirit is on a journey through life that continues after death Most religions believe that what a person does during their lifetime will affect what happens to their spirit in the afterlife Many religions teach that a good persons spirit can reach a special place of peace and happiness like Heaven or Nirvana and that a bad persons spirit can travel to a place of pain and suffering like Hell Still other religions believe in reincarnation  that instead of going either to Heaven or Hell spirits of the dead return to earth in a new body

Morals are the way a human behaves to other humans Most religions make rules about human morals The rules of how people should act to each other are different in different religions 

For some religions following a path of goodness truth and duty is very important This is called Tao in the teachings of Buddha In the teachings of Judaism people were told to love your neighbour as yourself In the teachings of Jesus people were told to think of every single person as their neighbour and treat them with love 

Not every religion teaches people to be kind to all other people In many religions it has been common for people to believe that they have to act kindly only to some people and not to others In some religions many people believe that they can please a god or spirit by killing or sacrificing another person

A religion is passed on from one person to another through teachings and stories which may be written down like the Bible or told from memory like the Dreamtime stories of Australian Aboriginal people In many religions there are people who take the role of priest and spend their lives teaching others about the religion There are also people who take the role of pastor and spend their life caring for other people A person may be both a priest and a pastor They are called by different names in different religions

Symbols are used to remind people of their religious beliefs They are also used or worn as a sign to other people that the person belongs to a particular religion A symbol might be something that is drawn or written it might be a piece of clothing or jewellery it might be a sign that a person makes with their body or it might be a building or monument or artwork Picture symbols for different religions are shown in the box in the introduction to this article 

In many religions it is thought important that people should show other people that they are following a particular religion This might be done in a general way by wearing a symbol or a type of clothing Many people believe that it is important to tell other people about their religion so that they can believe as well This is called witnessing 

There are many ways to witness A young person might simply say to their friends I do not use drugs or get drunk because of my religion This is a witness A person may tell their classmates workmates and friends about their beliefs A person might go to other peoples houses and talk about their beliefs or invite the people to join in the rituals of the religion such as going to church or to a religious festival A person might have printed material such as books or leaflets that they give to other people to read A person might travel to a different country to teach to work in a health service or to help people in some other way These are different ways that people witness to their religion 

When a person hears a witness and decides that they will join the religion this is called a conversion Usually a person decides to join a religion because they like what they have read or been told and they believe that they are hearing the truth They join the religion because they choose However throughout history there have been many times when people have been forced to join a religion by violence and threats This is still happening today 

In most countries of the world people are free to belong to whatever religion they choose This is generally thought of as a basic human right However there are parts of the world where it is illegal to witness to any religion except the one accepted by the government of the country People who belong to other religions may be threatened put in jail or murdered 

Rituals are an important part of the tradition of many religions In many religions it is the tradition for people to meet for a celebration on one day in every week There are also major celebrations that may be held only at certain times of the year for example on the birthday of a person who is honoured in that religion Some religions have celebrations for different seasons of the year or when the sun or moon is in a certain part of the sky 

In nearly every religion the important stages of a persons life have a religious celebration Birth naming reaching an age to think for oneself reaching adulthood marriage childbirth sickness and death are all celebrated by some religions Having a celebration or special traditions when a person dies is very common 

It is the traditions that are about death that give the earliest evidence of religious beliefs Scientists have discovered that 120000 years ago Neanderthal people started burying their dead Early Homo sapiens put tools and other things into graves with the bodies as if they could use them in the afterlife From 40000 years ago many of the objects in graves are small artworks Scientists believe that these objects were put there for religious reasons

An institution is one name for an organization Many religions have organizations that manage the way that people who follow the religion are to act The organization might employ religious leaders educate people into the ideas of the religion manage money own buildings and make rules The organization might be worldwide like the Roman Catholic Church or it might be just a small group of people like the Tempe Bible Tract Society

Most religions have special buildings where people meet They are often called temples In Judaism they are called synagogues In Christianity they are called churches In Islam they are called mosques People often try to make their religious building as beautiful as possible Some religious buildings are great works of architecture

People often make artworks that are about their religion or that are used in religious celebration or are put in a religious building Religious art comes in all shapes and sizes from tiny pieces of jewellery to huge statues and paintings Artworks often give important clues to historians about different ancient religions that are not well understood 

Music is often important in religious celebrations Singing chanting and playing musical instruments are often part of regular religious gatherings of people Special music is often used on special occasions Many famous composers have written religious music The words of songs that are 3000 years old are used every day in Christian churches and Jewish synagogues

The Romans are the people of the city of Rome in Italy In ancient times the people of the city of Rome created a very large empire called the Roman Empire The largest Roman settlement in England was Londinium

Kipling is buried in Westminster Abbey

Recreation or fun is a persons time of refreshing his or her body and mind

There are many different forms of recreation which are shaped by individual interests and by environment a few examples being reading playing or listening to music watching movies or TV gardening hunting hobbies sports studies and travel 

Public places such as parks and beaches are very important for many recreational activities Tourism profession has recognized long ago that many of their clients are specifically attracted by recreational offerings

Foods are raw when they are not cooked Most things are good to eat raw but some such as eggplants can be poisonous  

Theres currently no solid evidence to suggest that raw food is more healthy than cooked food

Raw food can sometimes make people sick because of bacteria which would otherwise be destroyed by cooking

The Roman Empire was the largest empire of the ancient world Its capital was Rome and its empire was based on the Mediterranean The Empire dates from 27 BC when Octavian became the Emperor Augustus

The empire was the third stage of Ancient Rome Rome was first ruled by kings then by the Roman Republic then by an emperor 

Many modern lands were once part of the Roman Empire including Britain Spain Portugal France Italy Greece Turkey Germany Egypt and the north coast of Africa The language of the Roman Empire was Latin 

The western part of the Roman Empire continued for almost 1000 years and the eastern part including Greece and Turkey continued for about a thousand years more The eastern part was called the Byzantine Empire with a capital at Constantinople

In order to control their large empire the Romans developed important ideas about law and government They developed the best army in the world at that time and ruled by force They had fine engineering and built roads cities and outstanding buildings The Empire was divided into provinces each with a provincial governor plus civil and military support Letters would constantly go to and from Rome both official and private letters 

Trade was most important for Rome a city of a million people by far the largest city in the world They needed and got wheat from Egypt tin from Britannia grapes from Gaul and so on In return the Romans built provincial capitals into fine cities protected them from raids by barbarians and provided education and career opportunites for young people in the provinces offered careers in the Roman army

In principle emperors had absolute control and could do as they pleased In practice they faced many difficult problems They had a staff of what we call civil servants and the advice of the Roman Senate The emperor had to decide what were the most important issues facing the Empire and what should be done about them Most of them tried to do two sorts of thing One was to do things to improve the life of Romans in peacetime The other was to fight and defeat Romes enemies A wealthy empire always has enemies

With kings and emperors a big problem is the succession Who follows them when they die Sometimes it would be his eldest son if he was capable of ruling More often it would be an adopted son It worked like this The emperor would notice an outstanding young man from one of the best families He would adopt him as his son Before he died he would make clear whom he thought should succeed him by making him a Roman consul or by stating in his will that the younger man should succeed him Sometimes this worked sometimes it did not Every now and then there would be a civil war between claimants to the throne

An adopted son or two gave the emperor more choices Some emperors had no son some had sons who were killed in battle or died during a plague Later on emperors grew so weak that the military would just pick one of their generals to be the next emperor This often led to civil war The life stories of the emperors can be found in List of Roman emperors

The Romans fought many wars against other countries and enjoyed watching violent sports They enjoyed watching races between chariots pulled by horses and fights between men using weapons Unlike in modern sports the fighters were often killed in these fights Romans enjoyed these shows in the Roman Colosseum

The Romans built many large public buildings and villas aqueducts to carry water and good stone bridges and roads Some of these things can still be seen today Many famous writers were Romans including Cicero and Virgil

The New Testament of the Bible tells about the Romans in the life of Jesus Christ During Jesus life the Romans who were pagan controlled his country Later several emperors tried to destroy Christianity but they did not succeed By 312 AD the emperor Galerius allowed people freedom to follow Christianity and the next year a general Constantine became emperor and converted to Christianity

The city of Rome was taken over several times by barbarians notably in 410 AD when the Goths sacked the city The last Western Roman emperor Romulus Augustus resigned in 476 AD The Roman Empire would last another 1000 years as the Byzantine Empire in the east

The main coin of the Roman Empire was the denarius 

A regime is the leader and other people who run a government of a sovereign state

There are many kinds of regimes They can achieve power in many ways Depending on the time and place and local civics like the electoral system they can lose power in many ways too The most common way for a regime to lose power was a coup invasion or revolution until the 20th century After that it became very dangerous and difficult to use these methods Peaceful regime change is usually by an election  this method is now used by more than half the people on the Earth It is called representative democracy Such regimes are often called administrations to make it clear they are not dictators and since the executive branch does not have all the power itself  it may share it with a legislative branch Also the judicial branch is separate The courts are not usually considered part of the regime

However some things are the same no matter how the regime achieved power

When many regimes negotiate at the United Nations or World Trade Organization it does not matter at all how each regime got its power It matters only that they can agree and make everyone in their country do as the agreement says

When someone wants a regime to change in another country they usually are not able to do this by any means other than violence or interfering in its election This is common if a regime is threatened by another regime

A river is a stream of water that flows through a channel in the surface of the ground The passage where the river flows is called the riverbed and the earth on each side is called a riverbank A river begins on high ground or in hills or mountains and flows down from the high ground to the lower ground because of gravity A river begins as a small stream and gets bigger the farther that it flows 

The water in a river is called fresh water It comes from rain or snow and it can usually be drunk safely unless it has been polluted The water in a sea cannot be drunk safely because it is salt water Both people and animals often live near rivers because they need water to survive 

The start of a river is called its source or its headwaters The part of the river that is near the source is called a young or youthful river A young river is often in a V shaped river bed and flows quickly downhill over stones and around big rocks Young rivers often have lots of small waterfalls and rapids 

The middle part of a river is called a mature river A mature river makes a riverbed that is U shaped It might be very deep and run fast It sweeps over small rocks and boulders and makes big turns around hills and mountains It is much wider than a young river but not as wide as an old river To cross over a mature river people use bridges Many cities and towns are built on the banks of mature rivers Many farms that keep animals such as dairy cows horses and sheep are along mature rivers because the animals can drink from the river every day  ImageClearwater River valleyJPGClearwater River in Alberta is a mature river ImageRiver Severn from Severn Valley Railway train 2004 12 31jpgThe Severn River flowing through farmland ImageBacharach rheinblickjpgThe Rhine River valley has many towns ImageFirenze riflessi sullarno2jpgThe city of Florence was built beside the Arno River 

A river usually ends by flowing into an ocean a lake or a bigger river The place where the river flows out into a bigger body of water is called the mouth of the river 

As a river flows towards its mouth the countryside around the river often changes from hilly to flat As it flows over the flat land the river becomes wider and slower A wide slow river is called an old river An old river often floods across the land after there is lots of rain at the headwaters An old river slowly builds up its banks on either side the high banks are called levees An old river often meanders and sometimes after a flood it leaves lakes behind which are called ox bows or billabongs Old rivers are the most useful type of river for growing crops Corn rice fruit cotton hay tobacco and sugar are some of the crops that are grown near old rivers 

The shape of the mouth depends on the conditions of the sea where it flows If there is a strong tide where the river meets the sea the river forms an estuary An estuary is a wide funnel like mouth of the river The fresh water of the river mixes slowly with the salt water becoming brackish water a break between fresh and salty water Many kinds of fish clams mollusks and other sealife live at estuaries Many of the worlds largest cities and harbours are at estuaries

Where a river flows out to the sea it sometimes flows very slowly through sandy or muddy land making lots of little islands as it flows The main stream of the river gets broken into many parts that spread out into a triangle shape like the Greek letter Delta When this happens it is called the delta of the river Deltas are often places that are not good for towns or farms but are very good for birds and other wildlife and fishing Deltas are often made into wildlife reserves Not all rivers have deltas There are famous deltas on the Nile River the Amazon River the Mekong River the Mississippi River and the Danube River

Some rivers flow underground through caves Underground rivers form in places where there are lots of cracks in the rocks above so that in rainy weather the water runs downs and collects in small underground streams Sometimes the underground water trickles or gushes out of the ground to form a small spring of water In other places where there are caves the small underground streams run together to form a river The river can sometimes run through deep wide underground caverns While many underground rivers flow gently some underground rivers flow fast and have rapids particularly after heavy rain Many underground rivers flow out through a cave mouth to become an ordinary river

The water in rivers is fresh water that has come from rain snow and from underground streams It can usually be drunk safely by people unless it is too dirty because of mud or human pollution People and animals need fresh water to drink so they often live by the side of a river

A right angle is an angle with a measurement of 90 degrees When two lines cross each other so that all the angles have the same size the result is four right angles The top of the letter T is at right angles to the vertical line Walls of buildings are usually at right angles to the floor Two things that are at right angles are called perpendicular or orthogonal

A reward is getting something good for doing a given task It needs someone who has the power to give the good thing It is the opposite of punishment

Ideas like risk and reward reward and punishment are based on the idea that people do things or avoid doing things to get rewards In psychology there is another idea that this is not true This other idea says that training and emotions are much more important than the rewards or punishments given by others

In trying to catch criminals and other bad people the government often offers money to people This money is given to people who may capture the criminal or give information that helps the police catch them For example after the Eureka Stockade rebellion in Ballarat Victoria in 1854 the government offered a big reward of 400 pounds for the capture of the people who had started it

In 2001 the US government offered a big reward of 25 million dollars for help in capturing the person who had sent anthrax in letters to a newspaper journalist and 2 senators Anthrax is a disease which can kill people

A ranch is a large farm where animals such as cows horses or sheep are raised A ranch is often on private land 

The word ranch is from the Spanish word rancho 

Ranches are often found in the desert areas of Australia or the American west because there is plenty of available space

A sport utility vehicle is a type of vehicle that can carry lots of passengers like a station wagon or minivan 

SUVs are shaped like a big station wagon However they are taller because the seats are more upright and because they have a taller suspension so that they can go off road 

Another way that many SUVs are different from some regular cars is that many SUVs have four wheel drive but most regular cars only have two wheel drive Also many SUVs have larger engines like a six or an eight cylinder engine In some countries SUVs often have diesel engines 

SUVs come from designs that were originally military or commercial such as the Jeep and the Land Rover These vehicles have been popular for many years with rural people because they can go off road but now they are also popular with people in urban areas because they believe that they look good

Consequently newer SUVs are more like cars because buyers like it that way Instead of buying a car they buy a SUV thats designed like a car They have luxury features and more car like suspensions and ride heights This is because most of these newer SUVs seldom go off road but stay on the street most of the time

However some people do take their SUVs off the road to explore places that they could not go with a car and to enjoy the driving Because of this there are many off road clubs in different countries SUVs are even raced such as in the Paris Dakar Rally and the Australian Safari 

Also there are many fun things you can do with a SUV For example you can tow a boat with an SUV 

There are many reasons why SUVs have become popular One reason is the comfort of their large cabins they can carry almost as much as a minivan Another reason is that people think they are safe 

Finally a major reason why they are popular is that they have a rugged powerful image People buy them because they look good even though a small car might be less expensive and more practical Automobile companies have sold many SUVs They make more profit on them per vehicle than with other automobiles because they are cheaper and simpler to build than many passenger cars of equivalent price 

Many people have bought SUVs but now many people do not like them anymore because SUVs are bad for the environment and dangerous to other drivers In addition these people think that the SUVs are not really as safe as people believe they are 

One problem with SUVs is that they roll over more easily than lower vehicles In recent years Consumer Reports magazine found several SUVs unacceptable because they roll over too easily Also they are big and stiff and they have high bumpers so when they hit another car the other car and its passengers can be severely damaged Big heavy SUVs like Ford Excursions and Chevrolet Suburbans can damage cars badly when they hit them 

SUVs have become so popular in the United States that the US is using much more gasoline than before SUVs are much less fuel efficient than cars The main reason is that the US government classifies them as small trucks so they do not have to be as fuel efficient as passenger cars Since auto companies have little reason to change SUVs they are fuel inefficient They are big and heavy have a lot of wind resistance and have big engines and a heavy suspension They also use tires that are better for off road than for driving on the street Smaller SUVs that look like cars may be shorter and use better tires but they still have big fuel inefficient polluting engines

Because SUVs are very big it is difficult to park them If there is a big car park this is not a problem but in some places like Hong Kong where there is not a lot of space it is a problem

In Australia and Europe SUVs are usually called 4 wheel drivesor 4WDs

Substance sub stuns is the material or matter of which something is made Substances can be seen or touched They are made up of one or more elemental parts Iron aluminium water and air are examples of substances

A symbol is a drawing shape or object that represents an idea object or amount of something 

The most common symbols are letters which are symbols of words and sounds A symbol can be an actual object such as the cross and the scepter Symbols can even be colors or patterns Symbols are used often in poetry and other types of literature most often used as metaphors or similes

A national emblem is a symbol for a certain country

There are thousands of symbols that are recognized by most people all over the world and many more that are limited to certain regions religions sciences etc Some of the best known ones are listed below

September is the ninth month of the year It has 30 days From the Latin word sept for seven

September begins on the same day of week as December every year

In Ancient Greece September was called Boedromion

Septembers flower is the Aster with the birthstone being the sapphire The meaning of the sapphire is love

We can define a sound wave as a disturbance which travels through some medium Sound is the term to describe what is heard when sound waves pass through a medium to the ear All sounds are made by vibrations For instance when a drum or a cymbal is struck the object vibrates These vibrations make air molecules move Sound waves move away from their source traveling on the air molecules When the vibrating air molecules reach our ears the eardrum vibrates too The bones of the ear vibrate in the same way that of the object that started the sound wave These vibrations let you hear different sounds Even music is a vibration Irregular vibrations are noise

Sound waves have two parts compression and rarefaction Compression is the part of the sound waves where the molecules of air are pushed together Rarefaction is the part of the waves where the molecules are far away from each other Sound waves are a lot of compressions and rarefactions

Sound waves can travel through solids liquids and gases but it cannot travel through a vacuum This is why astronauts can not talk to each other in space they need a radio to hear each other Sound can travel through water faster than through air and they travel even faster in solids like stone iron and steel Sound travels 1100 feet per second in the air 

Pitch is the highness or lowness of sound Pitch is how humans hear different frequencies Frequency is determined by the number of vibrations per second The highest key on a piano for instance vibrates 4000 times per second It has a frequency of 4000 hertz or 4 kilohertz Lower keys have lower frequencies A note an octave higher than another note has twice the frequency of that note

Sound intensities can be very different They can range from 0000000000001 Wm2 to 1 Wm2 The decibel scale makes sound intensity numbers easier to work with A 0000000000001 Wm2 intensity is 0 dB When the decibel number increases by 10 the intensity is ten times as much So a 1 Wm2 intensity is 120 dB

Loudness is how people sense the intensity of sound Loudness depends on sound intensity sound frequency and the persons hearing

Audible sound has frequencies between 20 Hz to 20 kHz Human beings can hear audible sound Sound waves with frequency above 20 kHz are called ultrasound waves Sound waves with frequency below 20 Hz are called infrasound waves Human beings cannot hear ultrasound waves and infrasound waves but some animals like bats and dolphins use them Older people have an even smaller hearing range People are best at hearing sounds between 1000 Hz and 6000 Hz 

When a sound source is moving towards someone the frequency seems to increase The same thing happens when someone moves toward the sound source Frequency seems to decrease when someone moves away from a sound source It also seems to decrease when the sound source moves away from someone This is the Doppler Effect

Society is the term to describe human beings together It does not refer to everything everybody thinks or does but only to those things that everybody acts upon  or refuses to do  quite reliably

Because it must keep even the poorest and weakest members of a society willing to help even the richest and strongest a society is very concerned with its citizenship rights ethics and time limits These are basic ways to achieve fairness If they break down badly people will think the society is unfair and start taking things from each other refusing to help each other or seeing those who have more as cheats 

While every society is different the way it breaks down and fails is very often the same fraud theft violence war and sometimes even genocide if people stop identifying with the society and thus identify with what they think of as a race of people A new society may be formed out of only those who still agree or who just survive the collapse of an old failed one

If the strength and unity of any societys members willingness to help each other is to be measured it is called social capital because it substitutes for other styles of capital One needs less money with more solidarity in society because the collective substitutes for the currency 

However usually the strength is not directly measured but only assumed People take risks that society will support them without knowing for sure that it will For instance they may refuse to obey the law and count on their fellow society members to free them in a jury or court of appeal

A social contract sets out rules for this kind of cooperation One kind of social contract is a constitution  which allows for a jury or court to decide that the law not the person is wrong according to the societys rules

A suggestion is an idea that one suggests or says is good for another to follow Some people may agree to it and some may disagree If they disagree or have a different suggestion the person who first suggested the idea will usually discuss with the other people and find a good conclusion that satisfies both and is good

Spache Readability Formula is one method of finding out how hard a piece of writing is

The method compares words in a text to a list of words which are familiar in everyday writing The words that are not on the list are called unfamiliar The number of words per sentence are counted This number and the percentage of unfamiliar words is put into a formula The result is a reading age Someone of this age should be able to read the text

Spache works best on texts that are for children under the age of eight

A sport is commonly defined as a sort of game that requires physical activity and involves a degree of competition as for example baseball soccer bowling or basketball Many adolescents and adults play sports with their friends Sportsmen need coaches to teach or train teams or individuals how to do better Sports can be played indoors or outdoors

Some people like to watch other people play sports Those who like to watch people playing sports are called fans While some fans watch sports on television others actually go to places where people play sports to watch them in person These fans are called spectators

At present there is a great variety of sports available for example

Science is a word that can refer to three different ideas which are alike

Today research uses the scientific method Scientific research is used to increase knowledge by creating theories based on previous knowledge and then testing those theories using experiments The word science can also refer to the large amount of knowledge that has been found using this process so far

People who do science are called scientists Scientists study things by looking at them very carefully by measuring them and by doing experiments and tests Scientists try to explain why things act the way they do and predict what will happen

The scientific method is the name given to the methods used by scientists to find knowledge 

The main features of the scientific method are

Most people accept the scientific method as the most reliable way to get knowledge about nature the universe and the human body

Alhazen took many years to prove his claim that light travels through transparent bodies in straight lines only At the end he demonstrated his claim by placing a straight stick or a broken wikt linktauttaut thread next to the light beam

Not everyone agrees about how science works exactly Some philosophers and scientists say that scientific theories are only accepted as long as they are the best explanation for the data that exists and when theories no longer explain the data they are discarded and replaced Other people say that sometimes scientists will make a theory better rather than discard it or that they will keep on using the theory hoping that it will be made better eventually

Science is a way to get knowledge by discarding what is not true 

Scientists must be very careful to make explanations that fit well with what they observe and measure They compete to provide better explanations An explanation might be interesting or pleasing but if it does not agree with what other scientists really see and measure they will try to find a better explanation

Before a scientific article is published other scientists read the article and decide whether the explanations make sense from the data This is called peer review After articles are published other scientists will also check if the same experiments observations or tests produce the same data again Peer review and repeating experiments are the only way to be sure the knowledge is correct 

Science makes models of nature models of our universe and medicine There are many different sciences with their own names However it is not right to say science says any one thing Science is a process not just the facts and rules believed at one time

The Saint Lawrence River is a big river in eastern North America It flows between the Canadian province of Ontario and the American state of New York and through the Canadian province of Quebec 

The river drains water from the Great Lakes into the Atlantic Ocean It is more than three thousand kilometres long The river meets the Atlantic Ocean in a big estuary or bay the biggest in the world this is called the Gulf of Saint Lawrence

The Canadian cities of Kingston Montreal Trois Rivires and Quebec City are on this river It is very important because ships can sail up the river and through the Great Lakes right into the middle of North America It is the third largest river in Canada

Seville is a big city in the South of Spain in Europe There is a big river called the Guadalquivir River which goes through Seville 

The city of Seville is the capital of the Spanish region called Andalusia and of the province of Sevilla The people who live in the city are called Sevillanos and there are almost a million of them 700000 

A very old story says that the city was started by the famous hero of Greece named Hercules The Romans when they came to Spain gave it the Latin name of Hispalis Over time this changed to be spelled in English as Seville The Arab Moors took the city when they invaded the country and you can still see a lot of the buildings they built during their 800 year stay in Spain

In the year 1992 Seville was the place for the Expo 92 There is a beautiful bridge across the Guadalquivir River called Puente del Alamillo It was thought up by Santiago Calatrava a famous building expert

Seville is famous for its hot summer weather

Seville is the home town of two soccer teams Sevilla FC and Real Betis Balompi

  

Seville is also the name of a place in the State of Ohio

Salami is a sausage that first came from Italy The name comes from the Italian salare meaning to make something salty

The original salami was made from a mix of chopped pork and salt which was dried using air in a casing People who are Muslim are not allowed to eat this type of salami because it is pork Now there are many types of salamis made in some countries Nearly all are seasoned with a combination of herbs and spices in addition to salt Salamis are now sometimes smoked or cooked before air drying Some kinds are made of beef while others mix beef and pork Most if not all Italian salamis have garlic in them but few German kinds do for example Some like a few salamis from Spain include paprika or chili The difference between some types is in how coarse or fine the meat is chopped Some light salami might add turkey or chicken to reduce both fat and calories

Many salamis are named after the city or region where they come from Some examples are Arles Genoese Hungarian and Milano salamis

Special English is a simple form of the English language It is used by a public radio station called Voice of America run by the United States government in Special English programs every day Its news and feature programs are read more slowly than usual using fewer English words and simple grammar 

The contents of Simple English programs are much easier to understand Simple English is clearer and simpler and it uses shorter sentences It can also help someone whose English is weak to improve his or her English In some countries for example China Special English is popular among people learning English

Special English was first used on October 19 1959

Sausage is a food made of ground up or chopped up meat It often has spices in it and is covered in a casing Other meats like the hot dog pepperoni bologna and salami also are covered with a casing like a sausages

Sausages often have meat from the animals head lips cheeks and other parts Some have blood in them Irish and English sausages normally have a lot of rusk or bread crumbs and they are less meaty than sausages from other countries

Sausages may be used as a meal in a sandwich or in other foods like stews

Many countries and regions have special kinds of sausage Sausages are some of the oldest foods

Slang is words that are informal Usually each generation or social group has its own slang  for example older people can have trouble understanding the slang of younger people On the other hand younger people often understand but find silly or old fashioned the slang of older people

Over time language tends to get more complex since new words enter much faster than old words leave Over time slang almost always becomes part of the language and approved for use by all 

It has also happened that some words used in Anglo Saxon for bodily functions became thought of as profanity or rude after they were replaced by Latinate words like urinate defecate and copulate  which polite people were supposed to use after the Norman invasion of England in 1066 This was in part a way of making poor people all appear to be rude while more powerful people appeared to be polite  one way that etiquette can develop and reinforce power structure This is only one example from history of how racism can be a reason for defining one groups language as slang and another as correct

Wanting to have rules of grammar that do not change and the same vocabulary used by everyone for better communication is another reason that is often given for defining one groups language as correct

An idiom can be slang but it can also be a metaphor that becomes part of the culture

Two examples of slang are wassup and dunnoe Wassup usually means What is up and dunnoe usually means I dont know

A social contract is an agreement between the people of a state and the government of a state The people agree to follow certain rules made by the government These rules are usually called laws Laws help to make sure people have rights and that their rights are taken care of One kind of social contract is a constitution A constitution sets limits on the powers of government leaders police and other people who have authority

The first social contracts were written by philosophers such as John Locke and Jean Jacques Rousseau They saw good government as coming from social contracts Rousseau wrote a book called The Social Contract Both the United States Declaration of Independence and United States Constitution are social contracts

Social capital is the willingness of people to help each other 

It often replaces money which people would use to buy the same help

Society works best when there is plenty of social capital The less social capital there is the more social problems there usually are If there is no social capital war and revolution often results

People who have no money and cannot get help from society may have to agree to do things they do not want to do or force others to do things they do not want to Organized crime grows in this way and so do forced labour and slavery

Most ways of measuring social capital have to do with trust  people who trust that favours and help will be available when they need it will favour and help others more Those who are seen as trying to get a free ride will get much less help A social climber tries to earn social capital by making friends with those who have it but without actually helping Some call this kind of person a social parasite They are very hard to detect unlike people who cheat or commit fraud When there are too many of these kinds of people especially when they are politicians people begin to broken wikt linkmistrustmistrust their government Rather than work with a political party to change law they may start to look for direct revenge for things 

Social capital is a lot like real capital The more money a person or a society has the easier it is to do things and the better off people are The less money the more difficult things become and the worse people feel

The Social Capital Foundation

A site is a real fixed physical location where something will or has happened or a place where something is 

It is used very often in building trades to mean the place where a building will go up 

A gravesite is a place where a person will be buried after they die 

The words onsite and offsite refer to work that must take place on the site or which can take place somewhere else For instance a prefabricated building can be built offsite and then moved onsite

Site is also a common abbreviation in net jargon for website In this case no real physical location exists other than the place where the computers are and one goes to the site simply by using a web browser to go to that URL This is a conceptual metaphor It can be confusing Someone who uses it is also likely using other jargon

Subtraction is the arithmetic operation for finding the difference between two numbers The special names of the numbers in a subtraction expression are minuend subtrahend difference The expression 7 4 3 can be spoken as seven minus four equals three seven take away four leaves three or four from seven leaves three

If the minuend is less than the subtrahend the difference will be a negative number For example 17 25 We can say this as Seventeen minus twenty five equals negative eight This is how cash registers determine the change you receive when you pay with more money than your purchase costs

String theory refers to mathematical models in attempts to find a common explanation for the four main forces observed in nature These forces are gravity the electromagnetic force the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force respectively

Classical physics defines that the universe is made of small particles which are basically static and unchanging String theory says that the particle is a stringline that forms these four different forces by vibrating in different ways

Usually scientists think of matter as being made of very very small particles These particles are so small that we cannot observe them to see their shape At this time all mathematical formulas say that the particles are point like and therefore have no shape at all The main idea behind string theory is that these small particles are instead shaped as tiny loops of string

The theory imagines that these strings are not precise particles The strings are very small yet they seem to act like regular particles It explains how other particles and forces act Because they are so small their actual shape does not matter much when we are looking at larger objects

String theory suggests that when these tiny loops move really really fast back and forth in different ways they are actually a different type of matter In other words if the string theory loop oscillates in one way it becomes a different type of matter than if it oscillates in another way

It is used as a possible way of explaining how some things work it is very hard for scientists to prove everything or answer every question that they can imagine by using just one theory on its own String Theory is slightly different from most other theories because it could help scientists get closer to explaining everything that they can think of so many scientists are excited by the ideas that String Theory has to offer It could someday be a Theory of Everything something that scientists such as Albert Einstein had been dreaming of for a very long time 

There are two ideas that predict the same physical observations of the whole universe One is as large as we think the universe is about the 74 billion light years circumference predicted in Weeks model The other is much smaller than the Planck Length Both mathematics are just as good to explain what we can see

There are several different versions of string theory as well The Superstring theory is based on 10 or 11 dimensions The Bosonic string theory has 26 dimensions Gravity is the only real force in the theory It says only four of the ten dimensions can be observed by us and that the others hint at the other forces that are observed It does not say that other physics theories are not true or wrong 

String theory has led to many new ideas in the mathematics of folding knots and Calabi Yau spaces

There are many different versions of string theory and none of them are fully accurate Often many of them use only good guesses String theory proponents say this is because the theory is not finished yet

Another problem is that the mathematical laws of string theory also give lots of different possible solutions Scientists that believe in string theory work around this problem by picking only the results that match our observations and saying that later we will find why the other ones are not good Opponents argue that we can not ever know if a theory is true as a whole if we only take the bits that work This also makes the theory of little use until the issue is solved because mathematical laws are usually used to predict what will happen in a situation  but string theory cannot yet answer that question because it needs to be tried first and then scientists can pick the answers that work

Yet another problem is that it says our universe is made of at least 10 dimensions while we only see four String theory proponents say some dimensions may not be visible to us but others doubt there can be 6 or more hidden dimensions or that we will never be able to access them even if they do exist

String theory does not make guesses that can actually be tested by scientists today or in the near future Some people say this makes the theory unscientific 

A scientist is a person who works in science A scientist tries to understand how our world or other things work Scientists are people who make observations ask questions and do extensive research work in finding the answers to these questions

Scientists work for governments companies schools and research institutes Some scientists teach at universities and other places and train people to become scientists 

Scientists can work in different areas of science Here are some examples 

Science is the study of all things both living and non living in the environment around us Scientists use experiments and tests to figure out for example if something is metal or not

A soapbox is a temporary platform used to give a speech During the 19th century soap was transported in wooden boxes When a person had new or unusual ideas and wanted to talk to a crowd about them sometimes he or she would stand on an empty soapbox so that everyone could see and hear the talk well 

People sometimes use the word soapbox to mean a place to say new or unusual things

The word supernatural is used for things that some people believe are real but that are not part of nature Because we cannot prove whether these things are real people often disagree about these things 

Scientists say that we should talk about things without talking about the supernatural because we cannot prove that supernatural things are real Other people say that although we cannot prove supernatural things in a scientific way they are real Many ideas like religion magic miracles spirits ghosts angels devils gods and God are supernatural 

In comic books the superhero is a person with supernatural abilities and tries to hide them In books a character has some sort of supernatural powers For example A witch who can cast magic 

In many religions a spirit is considered to be the part of a being that is not the body Other words with the same meanings are soul and ghost When a body is alive it has a spirit in it Death is when the spirit separates from the body 

Some people think that without their bodies spirits can still exist on the Earth and in places like Heaven or Hell Some believe that spirits can talk with people or change things in the world Many religions forbid communicating with such spirits in any way but a few include this as part of their practice

Another use of spirit means the main purpose or meaning of a sentence or document For example the spirit of a law is the meaning of the law which the creator wanted This phrase is often used when the words and sentences of a law could mean more than one thing but a judge must decide what meaning is correct

A seed is the part of a seed plant which can grow into a new plant It is a reproductive structure which disperses and can survive for some time A typical seed includes three basic parts an embryo a supply of nutrients for the embryo and a seed coat

There are many different kinds of seeds Some plants make a lot of seeds some make only a few Seeds are often hard and very small but some are larger The coconut is as big as a childs head but it contains more than just a seed At the start seeds are dormant for a while When the seed is ready to develop it needs water air and warmth but not sunlight to become a seedling

Because most kinds of seeds carry the food that helps the new plant begin to grow many kinds of seeds are good food for animals and people Seeds are often inside fruits The many kinds of grain that people grow such as rice wheat and maize are all seeds

A seed though not active is a tiny living thing It contains the embryo of the future plant which is not changing or developing it is dormant The common idea is that the seed sleeps until it gets what it needs to wake up That is not correct Different seeds have different habits no doubt adapted to their habitat There are different kinds of resting stages in seeds

When a seed germinates it begins to grow into a little plant called a seedling It uses the soft fleshy material inside the seed for nutrients until it is ready to make food on its own using sunlight water and air

Most seeds germinate underground where there is no sunlight The plant does not need the nutrients in soil for a few days or weeks because the seed has all the things it needs to grow Later though it will begin to need sunlight If there is sunlight the plant will use it to grow healthy If there is no light the plant will still grow for a while but its plastids will not mature the chlorophyll does not turn green If the plant does not get enough light it will eventually die It needs light to make food for itself when the reserve in the seed runs out

Seeds have been an important development in the reproduction and spread of conifers and flowering plants Plants such as mosses liverworts and ferns do not have seeds and use unprotected spores and other methods to broken wikt linkpropagationpropagate themselves Before the upper Devonian period land plants like modern ferns reproduced by sending spores into the air The spores would land and become new plants only in favourable conditions Spores have little food stored and may be just single cells rather than embryos 

The evolution of seeds changed the plant life cycle by freeing plants from the need for external water for sexual reproduction and by providing protection and nutrients for the developing embryo These functions allowed plants to expand beyond the immediate neighbourhood of water sources They were able to exploit environments which were drier and more uplandp92 This can be seen by the success of seed plants in important biological niches on land from forests to grasslands both in hot and cold climates The present day seed plants are the Gymnosperms with naked seeds and the Angiosperms with covered seeds usually fruits

The first true seeds are from the upper Devonian 370354 million years ago which is probably the theatre of their first evolutionary radiation The earliest seed producing trees were in the forests of the Carboniferous periodp112 The seed plants steadily became one of the most important elements of nearly all ecosystems

A sail is a large piece of cloth on the top of some boats The wind goes around the sail and makes the boat move through the water The piece that the sail is attached to is called a mast Some boats have many sails and some have only one Usually small boats have only one sail and bigger boats have more Boats with sails are called sailing boats There are many different names for different kinds of sailing boats with different kinds of sails 

Before people made boats with engines that used coal or oil sailing boats were an important way to travel across oceans Now they are not so important for transport but they are still used for recreation and competition

The word Spanish means 

Skin is the outside covering of animals The skin of different kinds of animals is very different Many kinds of animals have hair or fur on their skin Birds have feathers on their skin Most fish and reptiles like snakes and lizards have scales on their skin 

The skin of human beings usually has very small hairs on it that are hard to see Some people have more hair or hair that is easier to see and some have less People have hair that is longer and easier to see on some parts of their bodies such as the tops of their heads and mens beards 

The skin of animals can be made into leather Leather is sometimes used to make shoes bags and balls

A Search engine is a web site on the World Wide Web of the Internet that helps us to quickly and easily find the web pages we want 

When a user type words into the search engine it looks for web pages with those words There could be thousands or even millions of web pages with those words So the search engine helps users by putting the web pages it thinks the user wants first

Search engines are very useful to find almost anything quickly and easily

The Shabbat day of Judaism is the seventh day of the week and day of rest It has its origins in Creation when God made the Universe and everything on Earth for six days and stopped work on the seventh day The Shabbat day starts Friday evening when the sun goes down until Saturday night

According to Kabbalah the Shabbat day is meant to be like a perfect world in which everyone knows about God and loves Him a kind of world that has not been since the Garden of Eden and will not be again until the Messiah comes

On Shabbat work is not allowed according to the Ten Commandments It is a day to rest and study the Torah Most machines may not be used not even a light switch can be used according to Orthodox Judaism but not all Jewish groups do this It is also prohibited to cut wheat or shear sheep

Like the Shabbat the Sabbath in Christianity comes from the Genesis story of creation but most Christians have it on Sunday not Saturday They also rest but not the same way as Jews The exact way depends on the church denomination

Islam also has a Day of Rest which also comes from Shabbat In Islam it is on Friday and is called Yawm al Jammea the Day of Gathering

Most Christians honor the Sabbath on Sunday to remember the Resurrection of Jesus on the first day of the week on the Jewish calendar They say that there is an analogy between the obligation of the Christian day of worship and the Sabbath day ordinance These two rules are not literally identical though They say that this ordinance is no longer valid because God has replaced his old creation by a new one For this reason the obligation to keep the Sabbath is not the same for Christians as for Jews They say there are examples in the New Testament and in other writings surviving from the first few centuries 

Some conservative Christians are Sabbatarians Most of these follow the Reformed traditions Sabbatarians think the first day of the week or Lords Day is the new Sabbath This is because the 4th commandment has never been revoked and Sabbath keeping is in any case a creation ordinance 

Still others believe that the Sabbath remains as a day of rest on the Saturday reserving Sunday as a day of worship In reference to Acts 207 the disciples came together on the first day of the week to break bread and to hear the preaching of the apostle Paul This is not the first time Christians assembled together on a Sunday Jesus appeared to the Christians on the first day of the week while they were in hiding One can maintain this argument in that Jesus himself maintained the Sabbath although not within the restrictions that were mandated by Jewish traditions the Pharisees often tried Jesus by asking him if certain tasks were acceptable according to the Law This would seem to show that while the Sabbath was still of importance to the Jews Sunday was a separate day for worship and teaching from Scriptures

The Seventh day Adventists and other churches disagree with some of these views They argue that the custom of meeting for worship on Sunday originated in paganism specifically Sol Invictus and Mithraism This is therefore an explicit rejection of the commandment to keep the seventh day holy Instead they keep Saturday as the Sabbath as a memorial to Gods work of creation believing that none of the Ten Commandments can ever be destroyed Seventh day Sabbatarians claim that the seventh day Sabbath was kept by the majority of Christian groups until the 2nd and 3rd century by most until the 4th and 5th century and a few thereafter but because of opposition to Judaism after the Jewish Roman wars the original custom was gradually replaced by Sunday as the day of worship The history of these changes is certainly not altogether lost regardless of any belief in a suppression of the facts by a conspiracy of the pagans of the Roman Empire and the clergy of the Catholic Church 

Jews had come to be hated in the Roman Empire after the Jewish Roman wars This led to the criminalization of the Jewish Sabbath Hatred of Jews is apparent in the Council of Laodicea where Canon 3738 states It is not lawful to receive portions sent from the feasts of Jews or heretics nor to feast together with them and It is not lawful to receive unleavened bread from the Jews nor to be partakers of their impiety In keeping with this rejection of the Jews this Roman council also criminalized the Jewish Sabbath as can be seen in Canon 29 of the Council Laodicea Christians must not Judaize by resting on the Sabbath but must work on that day rather honoring the Lords Day and if they can resting then as Christians But if any shall be found to be judaizers let them be excommunicated from Christ

Statistics is the science of data It enables the collection analysis understanding and presentation of data It helps in the study of many other fields such as medicine economics psychology and marketing Someone who works in statistics is called a statistician

Statistics provides ways to get the data needed for a study without waste such as surveys and controlled experiments Once the data has been collected there are two basic ways that data can be analysed

Statistics has been in use for a long time The first known statistics are census data The Babylonians did a census around 3500BC the Egyptians around 2500 BC and the Ancient Chinese around 1000 BC

Before we can describe the world with statistics we must collect data The data that we collect in statistics are called measurements After we collect data we use one or more numbers to describe each observation or measurement For example suppose we want to find out how popular a certain TV show is We can pick a group of people out of the total population of viewers Then we ask each one how often they watch the show or we measure it by attaching a counter to each of their television sets For another example if we want to know whether a certain drug can help lower blood pressure we could give the drug to people for some time and measure their blood pressure before and after

Most often we collect statistical data by doing surveys or experiments To do a survey we pick a small number of people and ask them questions Then we use their answers as the data

The choice of which individuals to take for a survey or data collection is important as it directly influences the statistics When the statistics are done it can no longer be determined which individuals are taken Suppose we want to measure the water quality of a big lake If we take samples next to the waste drain we will get different results than if the samples are taken in a far away hard to reach spot of the lake

There are two kinds of problems which are commonly found when taking samples

We can reduce chance errors by taking a larger sample and we can avoid some bias by choosing randomly However sometimes large random samples are hard to take And bias can happen if some people refuse to answer our questions or if they know they are getting a fake treatment These problems can be hard to fix See also standard error

The middle of the data is called an average The average tells us about a typical individual in the population There are three kinds of average that are often used the mean the median and the mode

The examples below use this sample data

The problem with the mean is that it does not tell anything about how the values are distributed Values that are very large or very small change the mean a lot In statistics these extreme values might be errors of measurement but sometimes the population really does contain these values For example if in a room there are 10 people who make 10day and 1 who makes 1000000day The mean of the data is 90918day Even though it is the average amount the mean in this case is not the amount any single person makes and is probably useless

The median is the middle item of the data To find the median we sort the data from the smallest number to the largest number and then choose the number in the middle If there is an even number of data there will not be a number right in the middle so we choose the two middle ones and calculate their mean In our example there are 10 items of data the two middle ones are 57 and 64 so the median is2 605 Another example like the income example presented for the mean consider a room with 10 people who have incomes of 10 20 20 40 50 60 90 90 90 100 and 1000000 the median is 55 because 55 is the average of the two middle numbers 50 and 60 If the extreme value of 1000000 is ignored the mean is 57 In this case the median is close to the value obtained when the extreme value is thrown out The median solves the problem of extreme values as described in the definition of mean above

The mode is the most frequent item of data For example the most common letter in English is the letter e We would say that e is the mode of the distribution of the letters

For example if in a room there are 10 people with incomes of 10 20 20 40 50 60 90 90 90 100 and 1000000 the mode is 90 because 90 occurs three times and all other values occur fewer than three times

There can be more than one mode For example if in a room there are 10 people with incomes of 10 20 20 20 50 60 90 90 90 100 and 1000000 the modes are 20 and 90 This is bi modal or has two modes Bi modality is very common and often indicates that the data is the combination of two different groups For instance the average height of all adults in the US has a bi modal distribution This is because males and females have separate average heights of 1763 m for men and 1763 m for women These peaks are apparent when both groups are combined

The mode is the only form of average that can be used for data that can not be put in order

Another thing we can say about a set of data is how spread out it is A common way to describe the spread of a set of data is the standard deviation If the standard deviation of a set of data is small then most of the data is very close to the average If the standard deviation is large though then a lot of the data is very different from the average

If the data follows the common pattern called the normal distribution then it is very useful to know the standard deviation If the data follows this pattern about 68 of every 100 pieces of data will be off the average by less than the standard deviation Not only that but about 95 of every 100 measurements will be off the average by less that two times the standard deviation and about 997 in 1000 will be closer to the average than three standard deviations

We also can use statistics to find out that some percent percentile number or fraction of people or things in a group do something or fit in a certain category

For example social scientists used statistics to find out that 49 of people in the world are males

There are many units of measurement for speed For example an objects speed can be measured in 

When an object changes speed it gets faster or slower If the speed of the object increases it is called acceleration If the object gets slower and the speed decreases it is called deceleration or negative acceleration

A server log records what is happening on a server at any time For example an HTTP server runs a web site

In net jargon a server is a computer that serves many things to user or client machines Usually a server will only do a few things Every type of thing a server does is called a service Services are used by other computers that are called clients The relationship between the client and the server is called a client server relationship For example Wikipedia has a web server which has a service for sending web pages over the Internet Your client computer talks to the Wikipedias web page service to get web pages for you A server can also host internet games and allow file sharing In simple words the individual computers are connected to some powerful computers called servers These store files and information in the form of website These files can be accesed by different users anywhere from the world using an internet connection

So that servers and clients can talk to each other they need to be connected to a network and they need to use the same protocol In networks a protocol is a set way for machines to talk to other machines It is just like a language For example the Wikipedia server runs the HTTP to send web sites to your computer and your computer uses the HTTP Protocol to ask Wikipedia for pages

Usually servers are specially made to be more powerful and reliable and they are much more expensive than normal computers Sometimes servers can be clustered which means that lots of servers work together to do one service

The server might slow down if there are too many people accessing the server at the same time resulting in a high load It might also be unable to take the high load so it will automatically shut down

In a peer to peer system every computer is both a client and a server to each other This is commonly put into file sharing and VOIP However this can help in attempts at piracy Many game servers use a large server for players to store their gaming data and can access them anytime with an internet connection 

A simile is a figure of speech which derives from classical rhetoric It is used to make a direct comparison Similes may be confused with metaphors which do the same kind of thing Similes use comparisons with the words like or as Metaphors use indirect comparisons without the words like or as

In modern politics a state is an association which has control over a geographic area or territory States are seen as having three main pieces

There are different forms of government a state can havefor example a republic or a monarchy Sometimes states form their own countries sometimes many states work together to form a country Most states also have armed forces civil service law and police

The earliest states were just groups of power A group of farms working together or a group of factories working together could be states since people can control them and protect them 

More organized states could be the monarchies such as early Egypt under the Pharaoh Following this were larger more military based states such as the Roman Empire The most important early states however were the Ancient Greek states which had freedom writing and a democracy

When the military based state the Roman Empire fell lots of little states were made and each was also military based and controlled by a king These states did not often work together and war raged However once people within the state itself started fighting the kings had to make peace and start parliaments

Modern states soon started in the late 15th century The main states in Europe were

These states all tried to improve their politics and economy and became more and more like the states today They formed proper boundaries for their lands and worked with power within the state itself more such as the Church or the nobility They made armies tax systems and embassies all to help make them more powerful and stable

 Different types of state  Types of state can be separated into two categories democracy and dictatorship However just because a group of states are all democratic does not mean that they follow the same rules Iran Pakistan France Germany and the United States of America are all states Each of them sees itself as a democracy Each of them however has a different idea what democracy really means 

Different states of the same category can also function differently For example two democratic states may be quite different if one has a well trained police or army while the other does not Therefore the word state only tells us what type of government that state follows and does not tell us about the country itself

There are lots of sub types of state branching off from democracy and dictatorship The main ones are Pluralism Marxism and Institutionalism 

Pluralism has been very popular in the United States It shows the state as a neutral place for settling arguments between other states Pluralism tells us that all people are not equal but still allows each group of people to tell the state what to do This type of state is called a polyarchy 

Also in a pluralist state politics the military and the economy are all united and work together This means that all power in the state is diffused across the people who live there

Marxism was popular in Europe in the 1960s and 1970s It was started by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels Marxism rejects the idea that a state is there for all the people living in it and is definitely not a neutral place for settling arguments 

The main job of a Marxist state is to protect capitalist made profits and to help people make contracts to keep economy in the state fair This is a good idea however the person who makes the money by using production or contracts has power over the people who do not make as much money as him This means that the working class have hardly any power but the people who own the factories have a lot of power Basically instead of giving power to everyone such as a polyarchy would do only a small part of the people have power

Both Marxism and Pluralism states have to react to the activities of groups of people in the state itself Institutionalist states do not see themselves as instruments to be controlled they are more just geographical areas In this area the people just form groups themselves An Institutionalist state can be made up of both Marxist and Pluralist people both which have the power to control themselves and not influence the other parties of the state

Anarchism is when a group of people have complete freedom and do not believe in having a state at all Anarchists are a lot like Marxists since they do not believe that all people are equal but they believe that a country can work without any organizations in it Law and order are not necessary

Anarchists often want a form of Marxism but ignoring some of their rules They want workers to manage themselves and simply get paid for what they do rather than getting paid in wages

The Solar System is the Sun and all of the objects in space that orbit it The Sun is orbited by planets moons asteroids comets and other things

The Sun is a star It contains 999 per cent of the Solar Systems mass This means that it has strong gravity The other objects are pulled into orbit around the Sun

There are eight planets in the Solar System In order of increasing distance from the Sun they are Mercury Venus Earth Mars Jupiter Saturn Uranus and Neptune The first four planets are called terrestrial planets They are mostly made of rock and metal and they are mostly solid The last four planets are called gas giants This is because they are large planets that are mostly made of gas They also have much more mass than the terrestrial planets

The Solar System also contains other things There is the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter Further out than Neptune there is the Kuiper belt and scattered disc In these two areas there are dwarf planets There are five dwarf planets in the Solar System Ceres Pluto Haumea Makemake and Eris There are also thousands of very small objects in these areas As well as these there are comets centaurs and there is interplanetary dust

Six of the planets and three of the dwarf planets are orbited by moons Planetary dust orbits the gas giants

The formation and evolution of the Solar System is estimated to have begun 4568 billion years ago with the gravitational collapse of a small part of a giant molecular cloud

Most of the collapsing mass collected in the centre forming the Sun while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk out of which the planets moons asteroids and other small Solar System bodies formed

This widely accepted model known as the nebular hypothesis was first developed in the 18th century by Emanuel Swedenborg Immanuel Kant and Pierre Simon Laplace Its subsequent development has interwoven a variety of scientific disciplines including astronomy physics geology and planetary science Since the dawn of the space age in the 1950s and the discovery of extrasolar planets in the 1990s the models have been adjusted to account for new observations

The Solar System has evolved considerably since its initial formation Many moons have formed from circling discs of gas and dust around their parent planets while other moons are believed to have formed independently and later been captured by their planets Still others as the Earths Moon may be the result of giant collisions 

Collisions between bodies have occurred continually and have been important to the evolution of the Solar System The positions of the planets often shifted and planets have switched places This planetary migration is thought to have been responsible for much of the Solar Systems early evolution

The Earths orbit around the Sun is nearly a perfect circle but when mapped it is found that the Earth moves around the Sun in a very slightly oval shaped or elliptical orbit The other planets in the Solar System also circle the Sun in slightly elliptical orbits Mercury has a more elliptical orbit than the others and some of the smaller objects orbit the Sun in very eccentric orbits

For thousands of years most people did not believe that the Solar System was real They thought that the Earth stayed still at the center of the universe Although the Greek philosopher Aristarchus of Samos suggested that there was a special order in the sky Nicolaus Copernicus was the first to develop a mathematical system In the 17th century Galileo Galilei Johannes Kepler and Isaac Newton began helping people understand physics more clearly This made people slowly accept the idea that Earth moves around the Sun and that the planets have the same physical laws that control Earth More recently telescopes and spacecrafts have led to discoveries of mountains and craters and seasonal meteorological phenomena such as clouds dust storms and ice caps on the other planets

In their order from the Sun and labelled with the numbers like the picture at the beginning of the article

The planets are the biggest objects that go around Sun It took people many years of looking carefully through telescopes to find the farthest away ones No one expects to find new planets but more small objects are found every year Most of the planets have moons that orbit around them There are at least 173 of these moons in the solar system

Pluto had been called a planet since it was discovered in 1930 but in 2006 astronomers meeting at the International Astronomical Union decided for the first time on the definition of a planet and Pluto did not fit Instead they defined a new category of dwarf planet into which Pluto did fit along with some others These small planets are sometimes called plutinos

There are a few main parts of the Solar System Here they are in order from the Sun with the planets numbered and the dwarf planets marked with the letters a  e

Sometimes people use alternative names for similar regions defined above These are less formal and less well defined

Sometimes the Outer solar system is taken to mean and the Gas Giant Planets the Kuiper Belt and the Scattered Disk But with more recent discoveries of objects in the Kuiper Belt and the Scattered Disk and with more dwarf planet discoveries the Outer solar system is now usually defined as above

The Oort cloud is separate from the Trans Neptune region and much farther out

The plane of the ecliptic is defined by the Earths orbit around the Sun All of the planets orbit the Sun roughly around this plane The farther away from this plane a planet orbits the more inclined is its orbit If you could look at the solar system edge on then all the planets would be roughly in a horizontal plane around a centre line of the Sun but not around the Suns equator

The inside of Saturn is probably a core of iron nickel silicon and oxygen compounds surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen then a layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium and finally an outer gaseous layer

Saturn has 62 known moons orbiting the planet 53 are officially named The largest moon is Titan which is larger in volume than the planet Mercury Titan is the second largest moon in the Solar System The largest moon is Jupiters moon Ganymede Also around Saturn there is a very large system of rings made of ice with smaller amounts of rocks and dust Saturn is about 1400000000 km from the Sun In the time it takes Saturn to complete one orbit of the Sun or one Saturn year the Earth has orbited 296 times or 296 years on Earth 

Saturn was named after the Roman god Saturnus Saturns symbol is which is the symbol of Saturnus sickle 

Saturn is an oblate spheroid meaning that it is flattened at the poles and it swells out around its equator The planets equatorial diameter is convert120536kmmi0lkoffabbron while its polar diameter is convert108728kmmi0lkoffabbron a 9 difference Saturn has a flattened shape is due to its very fast rotation rotating once every 108 hours Saturn is the only planet in the Solar System that is less dense than water Even though the planets core is very dense it has a gaseous atmosphere so the average specific density of the planet is 069 gcm This means if Saturn could be placed in a large pool of water it would float

The outer part of Saturns atmosphere is made up of about 96 hydrogen 3 helium 04 methane and 001 ammonia There are also very small amounts of acetylene ethane and phosphine

Saturns clouds show a banded pattern like the cloud bands seen on Jupiter Saturns clouds are much fainter and the bands are wider at the equator Saturns lowest cloud layer is made up of water ice and is about convert10kmmi0lkoffabbron thick The temperature here is quite low at 250 K However scientists do not agree about this The layer above about convert77kmmi0lkoffabbron thick is made up of ammonium hydrosulfide ice and above that is a layer of ammonia ice clouds convert80kmmi0lkoffabbron thick The highest layer is made up of hydrogen and helium gases which extends between convert200kmmi0lkoffabbron and convert270kmmi0lkoffabbron above the water cloud tops Auroras are also known to form in Saturn in the mesosphere The temperature at Saturns cloud tops is extremely low at 98 K The temperatures in the inner layers are much higher than the outside layers because of the heat produced by Saturns interior Saturns winds are some of the fastest in the Solar System reaching 1800 kmh ten times faster then winds on Earth

Saturns atmosphere is also known to form oval shaped clouds similar to the clearer spots seen in Jupiter These oval spots are cyclonic storms the same as cyclones seen on Earth In 1990 the Hubble Space Telescope found a very large white cloud near Saturns equator Storms like the one in 1990 were known as Great White Spots These unique storms only exist for a short time and only happen about every 30 Earth years at the time of the summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere Great White Spots were also found in 1876 1903 1933 and 1960 If this cycle continues another storm will form in about 2020

The Voyager 1 spacecraft found a hexagonal cloud pattern near Saturns north pole at about 78N The CassiniHuygens probe later confirmed it in 2006 Unlike the north pole the south pole does not show any hexagonal cloud feature The probe also discovered a hurricane like storm locked to the south pole that clearly showed an eyewall Until this discovery eyewalls had only been seen on Earth

Saturns interior is similar to Jupiters interior It has a small rocky core about the size of the Earth at its centre It is very hot its temperature reaches 15000 K Saturn is so hot that it gives out more heat energy into space than it receives from the Sun Above it is a thicker layer of metallic hydrogen about convert30000kmmi0lkoffabbron deep Above that layer is a region of liquid hydrogen and helium The core is heavy with about 9 to 22 times more mass than the Earths core

Saturn has a natural magnetic field that is weaker than Jupiters Like the Earths Saturns field is a magnetic dipole Saturns field is unique in that it is perfectly symmetrical unlike any other known planet This means the field is exactly in line with the planets axis Saturn generates radio waves but they are too weak to be detected from Earth The moon Titan orbits in the outer part of Saturns magnetic field and gives out plasma to the field from the ionised particles in Titans atmosphere

Saturns average distance from the Sun is over 1400000000 km about nine times the distance from the Earth to the Sun It takes 10759 days or about 297 years for Saturn to orbit around the Sun This is known as Saturns orbital period 

Voyager 1 measured Saturns rotation as being 10 hours 14 minutes at the equator 10 hours 40 minutes closer to the poles and 10 hours 39 minutes 24 seconds for the planets interior This is known as its rotational period 

Cassini measured the rotation of Saturn as being 10 hours 45 minutes 45 seconds 36 seconds That is about six minutes or one percent longer than the radio rotational period measured by the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft which flew by Saturn in 1980 and 1981

Saturns rotational period is calculated by the rotation speed of radio waves released by the planet The CassiniHuygens spacecraft discovered that the radio waves slowed down suggesting that the rotational period increased Since the scientists do not think Saturns rotation is actually slowing down the explanation may lie in the magnetic field that causes the radio waves

Saturn is best known for its planetary rings which are easy to see with a telescope There are seven named rings A B C D E F and G rings They were named in the order they were discovered which is different to their order from the planet From the planet the rings are D C B A F G and Erp57

Scientists believe that the rings are the material left after a moon broke apartrp60 A new idea says that it was a very large moon most of which crashed into the planet This left a large amount of ice to form the rings and also some of the moons like Enceladus which are thought to be made of icerp61

The rings were first discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610 using his telescope They did not look like rings to Galileo so he called them handles He thought that Saturn was three separate planets that almost touched one another In 1612 when the rings were facing edge on with the Earth the rings disappeared then reappeared again in 1613 further confusing Galileo In 1655 Christiaan Huygens was the first person to recognise Saturn was surrounded by rings Using a much more powerful telescope than Galileis he noted Saturn is surrounded by a thin flat ring nowhere touching In 1675 Giovanni Domenico Cassini discovered that the planets rings were in fact made of smaller ringlets with gaps The largest ring gap was later named the Cassini Division In 1859 James Clerk Maxwell showed that the rings cannot be solid but are made of small particles each orbiting Saturn on their own otherwise it would become unstable or break apart James Keeler studied the rings using a spectroscope in 1895 which proved Maxwells theory

The rings range from convert6630kmmi0lkoffabbron to convert120700kmmi0lkoffabbron above the planets equator As proved by Maxwell even though the rings appear to be solid and unbroken when viewed from above the rings are made of small particles of rock and ice They are only about convert10mft0lkoffabbron thick made of silica rock iron oxide and ice particlesrp55 The smallest particles are only specks of dust while the largest are the size of a house The C and D rings also seem to have a wave in them like waves in waterrp58 These large waves are convert500mft0lkoffabbron high but only moving slowly at about convert250mft0lkoffabbron each dayrp58 Some scientists believe that the wave is caused by Saturns moons Another idea is the waves were made by a comet hitting Saturn in 1983 or 1984rp60

The largest gaps in the rings are the Cassini Division and the Encke Division both visible from the Earth The Cassini Division is the largest measuring convert4800kmmi0lkoffabbron wide However when the Voyager spacecrafts visited Saturn in 1980 they discovered that the rings are a complex structure made out of thousands of thin gaps and ringlets Scientist believe this is caused by the gravitational force of some of Saturns moons The tiny moon Pan orbits inside Saturns rings creating a gap within the rings Other ringlets keep their structure due to the gravitational force of shepherd satellites such as Prometheus and Pandora Other gaps form due to the gravitational force of a large moon farther away The moon Mimas is responsible for clearing away the Cassini gap

Recent data from the Cassini spacecraft has shown that the rings have their own atmosphere free from the planets atmosphere The rings atmosphere is made of oxygen gas and it is produced when the Suns ultraviolet light breaks up the water ice in the rings Chemical reaction also occurs between the ultraviolet light and the water molecules creating hydrogen gas The oxygen and hydrogen atmospheres around the rings are very widely spaced As well as oxygen and hydrogen gas the rings have a thin atmosphere made of hydroxide This anion was discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope

The Voyager space probe discovered features shaped like rays called spokes These were also seen later by the Hubble telescope The Cassini probe photographed the spokes in 2005 They are seen as dark when under sunlight and appear light when against the unlit side At first it was thought the spokes were made of microscopic dust particles but new evidence shows that they are made of ice They rotate at the same time with the planets magnetosphere therefore it is believed that they have a connection with electromagnetism However what cause the spokes to form is still unknown They appear to be seasonal disappearing during solstice and appearing again during equinox

Saturn has 53 named moons and another nine which are still being studied Many of the moons are very small 33 are less than convert10kmmi0lkoffabbron in diameter and 13 moons are less than convert50kmmi0lkoffabbron Seven moons are large enough to be a near perfect sphere caused by their own gravitation These moons are Titan Rhea Iapetus Dione Tethys Enceladus and Mimas Titan is the largest moon larger than the planet Mercury and it is the only moon in the Solar System to have a thick dense atmosphere Hyperion and Phoebe are the next largest moons larger than convert200kmmi0lkoffabbron in diameter

In December 2004 and January 2005 a man made satellite called the CassiniHuygens probe took lots of close photos of Titan One part of this satellite known as the Huygens probe then landed on Titan Named after the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens it was the first spacecraft to land in the outer Solar System The probe was designed to float in case it landed in water Enceladus the sixth largest moon is about convert500kmmi0lkoffabbron in diameter It is one of the few outer solar system objects that shows volcanic activity In 2011 scientists discovered an electric link between Saturn and Enceladus This is caused by ionised particles from volcanos on the small moon interacting with Saturns magnetic fields Similar interactions cause the northern lights on Earth

Saturn was first explored by the Pioneer 11 spacecraft in September 1979 It flew as close as convert20000kmmi0lkoffabbron above the planets cloud tops It took photographs of the planet and a few of its moons but were low in resolution It discovered a new thin ring called the F ring It also discovered that the dark ring gaps appear bright when viewed towards the Sun which shows the gaps are not empty of material The spacecraft measured the temperature of the moon Titan

In November 1980 Voyager 1 visited Saturn and took higher resolution photographs of the planet rings and moons These photos were able to show the surface features of the moons Voyager 1 went close to Titan and gained much information about its atmosphere In August 1981 Voyager 2 continued to study the planet Photos taken by the space probe showed that changes were happening to the rings and atmosphere The Voyager spacecrafts discovered a number of moons orbiting close to Saturns rings as well as discovering new ring gaps

On July 1 2004 the CassiniHuygens probe entered into orbit around Saturn Before then it flew close to Phoebe taking very high resolution photos of its surface and collecting data On December 25 2004 the Huygens probe separated from the Cassini probe before moving down towards Titans surface and landed there on January 14 2005 It landed on a dry surface but it found that large bodies of liquid exist on the moon The Cassini probe continued to collect data from Titan and a number of the icy moons It found evidence that the moon Enceladus had water erupting from its geysers Cassini also proved in July 2006 that Titan had hydrocarbon lakes located near its north pole In March 2007 it discovered a large hydrocarbon lake the size of the Caspian Sea near its north pole

Cassini observed lightning occurring in Saturn since early 2005 The power of the lightning was measured to be 1000 times more powerful than lightning on Earth Astronomers believe that the lightning observed in Saturn is the strongest ever seen

Slavery is an economic system In it some people must work for no pay These people are called slaves

There is evidence that even before there was writing there was slavery There have been different types of slavery and they have been in almost all cultures and continents Some societies had laws about slavery or they had an economy that was built on it As of 2011 slavery has been made against the law in almost all countries The Universal Declaration of Human Rights says that slavery is wrong Nevertheless there are still different forms of slavery in some countries

The English word slave comes from the medieval word for Slavic people of Central and Eastern Europe because these were the last ethnic group to be captured and enslaved in Central Europe According to Adam Smith and Auguste Comte a slave was mainly defined as a captive or prisoner of war 

Slaves are not allowed all rights

People are still being made slaves in some parts of the world The ways in which it is done have changed Today slaves may work because of things like a high debt For girls and women forced prostitution is a type of slavery Another form of slavery still happening today is forced child labor Some children have to work in mines or in plantations or they have to fight wars as child soldiers for no pay 

One study says that there are 27 million people in slavery today

Some of the countries where there is still slavery are in Africa the Middle East and South Asia In summer 2007 570 people were found to be slaves for brick makers in China Of those freed 69 were children The Chinese government made a force of 35000 police check northern Chinese brick kilns for slaves and sent lots of kiln supervisors and officials to prison and sentenced one kiln foreman to death for killing a worker who was a slave

In Mauritania it is thought that up to 600000 men women and children or 20 of the population are slaves and that many of them are used as bonded labour Slavery in Mauritania was made illegal in August 2007 In Niger there is also much slavery A Nigerian study has found that more than 800000 people are slaves almost 8 of the population Child slavery has commonly been used when making cash crops and mining According to the US Department of State more than 109000 children were working on cocoa farms alone in Cte dIvoire in the worst forms of child labour in 2002

They start at about US40 in Mali for young adult male workers A young woman or a girl may sell for as much as US1000 in Thailand In 1850 in the United States a slave could have been US1000 about 25800 today

In November 2006 the International Labour Organisation said that it would prosecute members of the junta that rules Myanmar at the International Court of Justice for Crimes against Humanity This is because the military makes some citizens do forced labour The International Labour Organisation says that it thinks that about 800000 people are forced to work this way 

In 1833 Britain stopped slavery then in late 1865 the United States did the same making it illegal They made it a crime to own slaves In the United States it stopped after the American Civil War When the North won all slaves were made free When that happened it was called abolition of slavery 

Many philosophies and religions say that a soul is the part of a living human being which is supernatural and lives after death It cannot be discovered by science because it cannot be tested in any controlled way Many different opinions exist as to what happens to personal experience after death Most atheists say that there is no such thing as a soul and that the body is the only part of a person

In popular culture soul usually means deep feeling and commitment It is in this sense that the word appears in the term soul music However that music was also influenced by gospel music which was religious

One popular idea about souls that is easy to express is that a person is a soul and has a body The soul is the I in I exist that feels and lives life What people call the mind could be part of the soul one soul started this article other souls have edited it and another soul is reading it This view however implies that the human body is a possession and seems to devalue bodies that do not have souls as defined or understood by the speaker Like most uses of the verb to be there is an ideology in these simple words

In Japan the soul is believed to weigh 21 grams

One distinction often made is between soul which is distinct from other souls and spirit which may be combined with that of other beings The idea of the Holy Spirit in Christianity for example is a universal and shared spirit many souls are part of and which is expressed on Earth in that faith by the Church meaning the body of Christ meaning all bodies that follow Jesus This could be more inclusive than the ishas view of souls and bodies

Reincarnation is a belief that says that after the body dies the soul will be born again in another body

Soap is a chemical compound resulting from the reaction of an alkali with a fatty acid When mixed with water during bathing or washing they help people and clothes get clean by lowering the chance of dirt and oil to get to the skin or fabric Soaps are made from animal fats or vegetable oils There are two basic steps in making soap They are called Saponification and Salting out of soap

Soap cleans very well in soft water It is not toxic to water life It can be broken down by bacteria However it is slightly soluble in water so it is not often used in washing machines It does not work well in hard water It cannot be used in strongly acidic solutions Many soap experts say that soap can be made in many ways Man has used soap like things for at least 4000 years The earliest recorded evidence of the making of soap like materials dates back to around 2800 BC in Ancient Babylon A recipe for soap having water alkali and cassia oil was written on a Babylonian clay tablet around 2200 BC 

The Ebers papyrus looks like that ancient Egyptians bathed commonly and had animal and vegetable oils with alkaline salts to make a soap like substance Egyptian documents says that a soap like substance was used in the preparation of wool for weaving

Hand soaps are only acidic enough to remove unwanted skin oils For other forms of oil Dishwashing soap is acidic enough to remove almost all forms of oil without damaging other petrolium products such as Plastic It does not damage skin either

A summary is a short version of something for instance a movie or a book or an article It tells you the main things in the movie or article or book in a short way and leaving out the details Many scientific journals publish a summary for every large article so people who do not have much time can read the main information quickly without spending too much time reading the article

A service is a job or work done for someone else 

Often the person who gives the service will get something in return for the service The person who gives the service can get money in return The person who gives the service can get goods in return The person who gives the service can get another service in return This is a type of trade 

All the service trades in a place form a service economy The service economy can be in a region like a country or in a town or city

There are several meanings of the word sense This page is for disambiguation  there are more detailed articles on each meaning

When a word has several meanings one can refer to it as being used in the sense of some context or other In Simple English for instance we avoid using words in unusual senses

The human sensory system is usually said to have six senses

Other animals may have other senses Fish have lateral lines which detect changes in the water pressure around them and some can detect changes in electric fields around them

Sense in this context is the meaning conveyed by language 

Another use is to flag whether an argument or statement is correct and understood That makes no sense or That is nonsense are examples from everyday speech 

A variation of this is to say that something does not make economic sense Usually these words signal a political dispute or some failure to define terms correctly

The term common sense is thinking based on a wide experience of life It used to mean practical wisdom It has a long history of being used in politics often to mean that some idea will be accepted or rejected because of human nature

A synagogue is a place where Jews meet to worship and pray to God

In Hebrew a synagogue is called beit knesset which means a house of gathering The word synagogue comes from sunagoge which is a Greek word In a synagogue Jews do the Jewish services which are prayers sometimes with special actions

A synagogue will always have a big room for prayers There might be some smaller rooms for studying There will be some offices There will also usually be a big room for special events 

The front of a synagogue faces towards Jerusalem in Israel In the front is the holiest part of the synagogue the Ark This is a closet which has the Torah scrolls inside The Torah scrolls have the holy writings of Judaism on them The Ark usually has a curtain in front of it

On top of the Ark is light which is always lit called the Eternal Lamp It is a symbol which means that God is always there Every synagogue has a raised platform called the Bimah The person who reads the Torah scroll stands there when he reads The Bimah is either in the middle of the hall or in front of the Ark

In some synagogues men and women sit in different places Some synagogues even have a short wall so that they can not see each other This is so that the people will think about the prayers better

Jews may call synagogues by different names Many Orthodox and Conservative Jews living in English speaking countries use the name synagogue or shul Jews who speak Spanish or Portuguese call synagogues esnoga Some Jews call the synagogue a temple 

Scarcity in economics is used to describe the lack of various forms of capital Scarcity can be used to describe an economic situation in economics or it can be used to describe more general situations

In economics scarcity is the result of people having Unlimited Wants and Needs or always wanting something new and having Limited Resources Limited Resources means that there are never enough resources or materials to satisfy or fulfill the wants and needs that every person have Scarcity is called the basic economic problem meaning that is always exists

Scarcity exists due to the effects of nature such as drought floods storms pest infestation fire and other things Real scarcity can also exist by over use of non renewable resources Goods and services are also scarce because there are only a limited number of things in the world and due to the limits of technology and our own priorities

Textual difficulty means how easy or hard a text is to read Research has shown that two main factors affect the ease with which texts are read

A readability test is a way to measure a text for how easy it is to read Readability tests give a prediction as to how difficult readers will find a particular text They do this by measuring one or both of the two main causes as follows

Word difficulty is usually measured by vocabulary lists or word length

 Vocabulary lists  Several vocabulary lists have been published by researchers These lists are based on samples of published texts in English and samples of recorded spoken language The lists differ slightly according to the sources chosen but they are very reliable The items listed may represent more than one actual word they are lemmas For instance the entry be contains within it the occurrences of is was be and are The top 100 lemmas account for 50 of all the words in the Oxford English Corpus

The Reading Teachers Book of Lists claims that the first 25 words make up about one third of all printed material in English and that the first 100 make up about one half of all written material

One of the first readability tests the DaleChall formula used a vocabulary list It counted the number of listed words in a passage and applied a formula which gave a grade level It was used to rate textbooks for grade levels in US school districts

It is easy in principle to use a vocabulary list as part of a computer based readability measure The list is organised as a look up table The percentage of listed words in a passage gives the data for the formula and the user is presented with a grade level

This is called an index or a proxy This is because word length is correlated with word frequency and word frequency is correlated with word difficulty Longer words are on average harder than short words 

Word length is measured by counting the letters in each word or by counting syllables Since most syllables have one vowel some computer programs count vowels per average word A few tests measure the percentage of words on a list the list is based on the known frequency of words in a language

Sentence difficulty is usually measured by sentence length This again is an index because longer sentences are on average harder than short sentences Computers count the number of words between full stops but this is a second best method Humans can judge whether a semi colon or colon should count as the end of a sentence for testing purposes

Since both factors may vary independently of each other the best predition is gained by devising a formula with makes use of both indices What this means is that a single score is produced for a text and that score is looked up on a table or graph That tells you how difficult the text is in terms of either a an American school grade level or b an artificial scale of 0 to 100 Either way is effective What really makes a difference is

It is possible to get a good prediction by getting a group of subjects to read through a passage followed by multiple choice questions Even better is a method called cloze where subjects fill in blanks on a text they have not seen before The percentage of correctly completed blanks is an outstandingly good predictor of text difficulty

Naturally this kind of direct measure requires subjects and a skilled experimenter It also requires the prior preparation of texts suitable for the chosen sample of subjects The method is therefore too expensive for widespread use

A person can perform readability tests himself by counting and doing some math or by using word processing software 

Theatre or Theater has several meanings

The word comes originally from the Greek Theatron meaning roughly a place to behold In American English the word theater can mean either a place where films are shown or a place where live stage plays are performed In British English theatre means a place where live plays are performed 

Theatre or Theater can also mean the business of putting on plays An actor might say I am in the theatre business or a writer might say I write for the theatre meaning that they write plays rather than writing for movies or television shows

The first people we know created plays were the Ancient Greeks about the year 500 AD They divided plays into two kinds tragedy and comedy This division is still used today The best known Ancient Greek writers of plays are Aeschylus Sophocles Euripides and Aristophanes Some of their plays survived and are still performed today 

These ancient Greek plays were performed outdoors in large amphitheatres so that many people could see them There were contests among the playwrights and the winner would get a prize

The Greeks were full of brilliant ideas They used mechanical devices like trap doors and the machina a crane for winching gods on and off the stage They had a Greek chorus that offered information to help the audience follow the performance The chorus comments on themes and shows how an audience might react to the drama The players wore masks Illustrations on vases show helmet like masks covering the entire face and head with holes for the eyes and a small aperture for the mouth plus a wig The mask was to melt into the face and allow the actor to vanish into the role Therefore onlookers did not think about the actor but thought about the character

In the Middle Ages the Christian church began to use theatre as a way of telling the stories from the Bible to people who did not know how to read They wrote Mystery Plays where each part of the Bible story would be a play put on by a different group of people They also wrote Miracle Plays which were plays about the lives of the saints There were also Morality plays which taught the audiences how to live a good Christian life 

In the 1500s groups of actors who would tour around Italy performing comic plays to entertain townspeople These plays were called Commedia dellarte and different stories would be created around the same group of characters Often the spoken lines would be made up by the actors for each performance

Other kinds of plays called Neoclassical Dramas and Neoclassical Comedies were also popular in Italy and in France at this time These plays were written to copy the style of the plays from Ancient Greece and Rome

At the end of the sixteenth century the traveling actors began to perform in fixed theatre buildings This was the period when William Shakespeare wrote He lived from 1564 to 1616 At that time in England women were not allowed to perform so male actors would play female characters 

His theatre was in London England It was called The Globe It was an outdoor theatre and plays were performed in the daytime for large audiences His plays were very popular and are many are still performed today Many scholars and theatre people believe Shakespeare was one of the best playwrights 

He wrote many kinds of plays tragedies comedies romances and also history plays All of his plays are written in beautiful poetic language Shakespeare often wrote plays set in Italy or in exotic far away places that would be interesting to London audiences His plays are still popular today for many reasons His characters are interesting and talk about interesting ideas 

The stories he tells in his plays are often exciting very funny or very sad and make you want to know what happens to his characters He also talks in his plays about things we still think about today like love sadness hope pride hatred jealousy and foolishness

After World War II playwrights in Europe and the United States began doing plays in a new style called Theatre of the Absurd After seeing the horrors of war these playwrights felt that all their old values had been destroyed Playwrights such as Samuel Beckett Eugne Ionesco Harold Pinter and Jean Genet wrote plays that are considered to be Theatre of the Absurd 

The Theatre of the Absurd plays have some of the same ideas that are found in the philosophy called existentialism Existentialism is very different from many other philosophies Most religions and philosopies say that human life has a meaning The philosophy of existentialism is that human life does not have a meaning When something has no meaning it is absurd

The plays written in this style make people think about questions like what is it like to be a person in the world and what does it mean for a person to be free They are often filled with sad emotions such as worry fear and thoughts about death

There are many other types of plays performed in the theatre today

Theatre breaks are a form of short holiday based around viewing a theatrical show Theatre breaks tend to include a nights hotel accommodation included in the price Some theatre breaks websites have been trading for over 20 years 

This is a demonstrative pronoun used to identify a noun It describes something that is here or nearby A very easy way to tell if someone is using this the right way is if the object that they are talking about can be pointed to For example if someone says this computer is mine it should be possible to point to the computer It does not matter if the computer is in the room or in a picture 

   This can also mean

A test is a way of checking something to see if it is true or false or if it is edible or not If something can be tested or finishes the tests correctly it is testable

Products are usually tested for quality and so that many customers will get the best products

People are tested to see what they have learned This is often called an broken wikt linkassessassessmentassessassessment or broken wikt linkexamineexaminationexamineexamination In learning a test item is a question or set of questions on a test

People and animals can also be tested for illnesses For example a blood test can be used to check for disease

Rarely people use tests to check peoples hearts For instance in a famous rap song in Korea the lyrics were about a boyfriend telling his girlfriend Im sorry but I must tell you we have to break up I do not love you I have to tell you Forgive me but I have to tell you Its all a test  Many people accuse this theory as an excuse to be offensive or an excuse to break up with his girlfriend so it does not count very logically in the test page

In science tests are called experiments These are done to check for a presence of a substance or to check the quality of the thing being tested

In software engineering a test is used to determine a characteristic of a software system Software is tested before it is released Alpha testing is where software developers check the software for bugs Software can also be checked for quality and usability Beta testing is done by groups of users

Cars and other vehicles are tested using a crash test The car is put under severe conditions to see what will make it fail Other machines can also be crash tested Crash test dummies stand in for humans They sit in the car seat to see if a human in the crash would have been injured or killed Crash tests cost a lot of money

The River Test is a chalk stream in the south of England The river is used a lot for trout fishing The river starts near Overton in Hampshire and ends at the sea at the head of Southampton Water

Sometimes though perhaps not often police officers use tests to find out criminals by measuring their pulse or heartbeat when asking questions 

A time horizon is a future point in time when something must be done or will be over Either way the matter will be closed when the time horizon is reached

Common time horizons people use are

It is very important to know at what time horizon something you are doing will be scored evaluated marked or paid for

Sports for example football and basketball often have time limits Baseball and others do not which sometimes causes problems

A time limit is a time horizon that is imposed on everyone at once 

It may be used to try to achieve fairness in some system of ethics For instance if poor people and rich people are debating something a time limit may be imposed so that the rich people cannot keep debating until the poor people have to go to work and lose

Time limits are very important in accounting so that everyone can report their results at the same time This in turn creates deadlines for the accountant and those reporting

However the deadline is imposed by an authority whereas the time limit is imposed by a system So there can be slack in a deadline so that results do not have to be reported always very fast

For example in the United States of America the end of the calendar year on December 31 is the time limit for taxes but the deadline for reporting is April 15 Sometimes the government allows more time as it did for the families of those who were killed in the September 11 2001 attacks

Taiwan is an island country in the western Pacific and east of China It is the nationalist government of China since 1949 It is called the Republic of China which is a country comprising the island of Taiwan and nearby islands The Chinese Nationalist government moved to Taiwan after Communist armed force took over the capital Currently the Chinese Nationalist government governs Taiwan Taiwan is southeast of the communist China south of Japan and north of the Philippines 

Formosa means beautiful island in Portuguese

The largest cities on Taiwan are the capital of Taipei and Kaohsiung

Most people living in Taiwan are Han There are also Taiwanese Aborigines who lived on Taiwan before the Han came to live there

Taiwan has three large Han groups They are different in language and places where their ancestors came from the Southern Fujianese the Hakka and Mainlanders

There are two Chinese governments in the world The Peoples Republic of China and the Republic of China PRC claims control over the island of Taiwan which is why people want Taiwan to formally declare independence Today in reality the PRC government controls mainland China and the ROC government governs Taiwan The PRC government has never occupied Taiwan The ROC government occupied mainland China from 1911 to 1949 before losing control of mainland China to the communist PRC

Today people who live in Taiwan have different ideas Although many Taiwanese think there is no freedom in China there are still some Taiwanese want to be united again with China But most of the people in Taiwan want to keep everything like it is now at least until China becomes free

Today most countries of the world recognize the Peoples Republic of China as China Even though Taiwan is not recognized by UN as a sovereign nation most countries still have very close economic and cultural relationship with Taiwan The government of China have said that if the people of Taiwan formally vote to become the Republic of Taiwan they will invade Taiwan So there is now a situation where both sides are not making any big changes

In March 2004 Chinas government passed a law that will allow China to invade Taiwan if the people of Taiwan vote to become the Republic of Taiwan This law hurt the feelings of the people in Taiwan very much especially since the government of China does not rule Taiwan It has caused even more people in Taiwan to not want to be re united with mainland China

A trademark is a way for a business to help people to identify the products that the business makes from products made by another business A trademark can be a name word phrase symbol logo design or picture It can only be used on things made by the business that owns the trademark 

For example Coca Cola and Coke are trademark names for a certain drink made by the Coca Cola Company No other business can use these names or any names similar to them Other businesses can make a drink that is similar like colas soft drinks but they have to use a different name for their drink such as Pepsi

Another example is the Nike company which makes sporting goods like shoes and clothes The swoosh symbol used on their products is a trademark

Famous trademarks like Coca Cola and Nike are used for branding whole families of products

Trademarks are protected by law In some countries a person or company can get a trademark simply by using the name word phrase symbol logo design or picture on its products

Trademarks can also be registered In that case the business tells the government of its country that it wants to use a certain name word phrase symbol logo design or picture as a trademark for the products it sells If no other person or business is using the trademark to sell those products then the government will list that trademark Once it is listed no one else can use that trademark for those products This is called registering the trademark

If someone uses the trademark in a wrong way the trademark owner can sue the other person If a court decides that the other person was not allowed to use the trademark they might have to pay a fine to the trademark owner 

If another person wants to use a trademark that they do not own they can ask the trademark owner for permission The trademark owner can grant the other person a license The other person usually must pay some money to the trademark owner for the license This can be in the form of a percentage of the cost of the product that the other person sells called a royalty For example a person might pay Nike ten percent of the cost of each pair of shoes it sells for the right to include the Swoosh

When people write a word that is a trademark or show a picture or symbol that is a trademark they should say that it is a trademark If a trademark is not registered they can write the word Trademark use the abbreviation TM or use the symbol on their products 

If a trademark is registered they can use the letter R in a circle symbol People can also say it is a registered trademark or use the abbreviation Reg

Trademarks are used for products Businesses that do things for people instead of making things are called service providers They can get a service mark instead of a trademark When people write or show a service mark they can use the service mark symbol 

In the United States the governing law for trademarks is the Lanham Act in Germany the Markengesetz

In ecology a terrestrial ecoregion is a certain area of land which is different from the area near it It has a distinct climate geology type of soil water availability and distinct living species

For example one ecoregion can be a desert It would have sand very little water very hot temperatures during the day and very cold at night The plants could be just bushes small trees cactii The animals could be scorpions little mammals spiders

Or for example an ecoregion could be a tropical forest It would have warm temperatures all day a lot of rainfall all year a huge river crossing and a very organic soil The plants could be huge trees or ferns The animals could be insects birds fish and apes

An ecoregion is likely to be about 100 km square

The Ten Commandments according to the Bible are rules for life given by God to Moses on Mount Sinai to give to the People of Israel The rules were written on stone tablets The book of Exodus speaks about Mount Sinai the Book of Deuteronomy about Mount Horeb The rules are important for Judaism and Christianity

Sometimes these rules are also called Decalogue The name decalogue first occurs in the Septuagint The Jews received the commandments after they had left Egypt during the reign of Pharaoh Ramses There are different texts talking about the commandments Most of them are in the Bible The Book of Exodus Chapter 20 and the book of Deuteronomy Chapter 5 The Quran also talks about them Both the Bible and the Quran have been translated many times For this reason there are many variations in the way the commandments are written

The Bible in Basic English lists the commandments from Exodus in this way

These commandments are translated from Ancient Hebrew to Simple English so the exact words chosen may not mean to us exactly what they meant to the Hebrews There is a variety of interpretations of these commandments

One understanding on the commandment to not make any image or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above is as from Roman Catholicism they hold that likenesses may be built and used as long as the object is not worshipped The Eastern Orthodox Church has a very similar position Eastern Orthodoxy teaches that the incarnation of an invisible God as a visible human Jesus makes it alright to worship images But for Jews Muslims and most other Christians this violates the commandment

Jehovahs Witnesses criticize the use of all of the above as well as the use of the cross The Amish forbid any sort of graven image such as photos

Most Christians honor the Sabbath on Sunday to remember the Resurrection of Jesus on the first day of the week on the Jewish calendar

Some conservative Christians are Sabbatarians Sabbatarians think the first day of the week or Lords Day is the new Sabbath because the 4th commandment has never been revoked and Sabbath keeping is in any case a creation ordinance

Others believe that the Sabbath remains as a day of rest on Saturday while Sunday as a day of worship in reference to Acts 207 the disciples came together on the first day of the week to break bread and to hear the preaching of the apostle Paul Also Jesus appeared to his followers on the first day of the week while they were in hiding

The Seventh day Adventist Church and some others believe that the custom of meeting for worship on Sunday originated in paganism specifically Sol Invictus and Mithraism Instead Adventists keep Saturday as the Sabbath as a memorial to Gods work of creation believing that none of the Ten Commandments can ever be destroyed Seventh day Sabbatarians claim that the seventh day Sabbath was kept by the majority of Christian groups until the 2nd and 3rd century but because of opposition to Judaism after the Jewish Roman wars the original custom was gradually replaced by Sunday as the day of worship

To be false to the married relation called adultery is when a married person has sexual relations with a person other than his or her spouse The Bible does not say whether or not this includes unmarried people having sex with each other although some people think so Some have interpreted Exodus 2216 to mean that if two unmarried people have sex they should make a commitment to one another

There are different translations this commandment the Hebrew words  are translated either as thou shalt not kill or thou shalt not murder Older Protestant translations of the Bible those based on the Vulgate and Roman Catholic translations usually translate it Thou shalt not kill Jewish and newer Protestant versions tend to use You shall not murder There are different opinions as to which translation is more faithful to the original

The many examples in the Old Testament of killing sanctioned by God are quoted in defense of the view that murder is more accurate Furthermore the Hebrew word for kill is  harog while the Hebrew word for murder is  retzach which is found in the Ten Commandments   lo tirtzach

In the New Testament Jesus talked about who was guilty of breaking these commandments He said that even if someone was just angry and rude to another person they might be judged for murder and if they just looked with desire or lust at a woman they had committed adultery in their heart

Many theologians suggest that commandment you shall not steal was originally intended against stealing peopleabductions and slavery This would be the same as the Jewish interpretation of the statement as you shall not kidnap

To give false witness called lying may include all lying or may only mean saying that someone else did something when they really did not as in lying in a court called perjuryfactdateApril 2009

The Bible does not number the commandments Different religious groups have numbered them in different ways The Jews followed by Christian Protestants end the first commandment with You are to have no other gods but me as above Catholics and Lutherans end the first commandment at I will have mercy through a thousand generations on those who have love for me and keep my laws and separate in their last two commandments the desire for a mans wife from the desire for other things he owns

The commandments passage in Exodus has more than ten important statements there are 14 or 15 in all While the Bible itself gives the count as 10 using the Hebrew phrase aseret hadvarimtranslated as the 10 words statements or things this phrase does not appear in the passages usually presented as being the Ten Commandments Various religions divide the commandments differently The table below shows those differences 

Notes

Muslims reject the Bibles version of the Ten Commandments Islam teaches that the Bible is a revelation from God but the text used in Judaism and Christianity has been corrupted The Ten Commandments are not explicitly mentioned in the Quran but each is implied by the following verses in the Quran

In general religions other than those mentioned do not recognise the Ten Commandments as ethical standards Many of them have similar laws or principles though In the atheist Soviet Union the Moral Code of the Builder of Communism was a set of rules that resembled the Ten Commandments

The term Ten Commandments without a generally applies to the list mentioned in Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5 However there is a continuous story being told starting in Exodus 3118 Exodus 3219 and Exodus 34 This story lists a very different set of commandments This version is sometimes called Ritual Decalogue Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and the people after him who followed the documentary hypothesis note that Exodus 3428 seems to refer to these Ten Commandments rather than the traditional ones These people thought that the commandments in Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5 show a later set of Ten Commandments and that the ten listed in Exodus 34 were the original Ten Commandments now known as the Ritual Decalogue The differences between the two Decalogues highlight the development of sacred texts over a long time and from differing narrative traditions by incorporating two differing sets of Ten Commandments

The commandments have influenced Jewish ethics and law and through Judaism and Christianity Western ethics and law since the Roman EmpirefactdateApril 2009

There have been two famous films of this name both were directed by Cecil B DeMille a silent movie in 1923 and a movie in 1956 starring Charlton Heston as Moses That one was the biggest money making movie that year

Table may mean one of these

A tree is a tall plant with a trunk and branches made of wood It can live for many years The four main parts of a tree are the roots the trunk the branches and the leaves 

The roots of a tree are usually under the ground One case for which this is not true are the roots of the mangrove tree A single tree has many roots The roots carry food and water from the ground through the trunk and branches to the leaves of the tree They can also breathe in air Sometimes roots are specialized into aerial roots which can also provide support as is the case with the Banyan tree 

The trunk is the main body of the tree The trunk is covered with bark which protects it from damage Branches grow from the trunk They spread out so that the leaves can get more sunlight

The leaves of a tree are green most of the time but they can come in many colors shapes and sizes The leaves take in sunlight and use water and food from the roots to make the tree grow and to reproduce

Trees and shrubs take in carbon dioxide and give out oxygen This is the opposite of what animals do 

The parts of a tree are the roots trunk branches twigs and leaves Tree stems are mainly made of support and transport tissues Wood consists of xylem cells and bark is made of phloem and other tissues external to the vascular cambium 

As a tree grows it may produce growth rings as new wood is laid down around the old wood In areas with seasonal climate wood produced at different times of the year may alternate light and dark rings In temperate climates and tropical climates with a single wet dry season alternation the growth rings are annual each pair of light and dark rings being one year of growth In areas with two wet and dry seasons each year there may be two pairs of light and dark rings each year and in some there may be a new growth ring with each rainfall 

In tropical rainforest regions with constant year round climate growth is continuous Growth rings are not visible and there is no change in the wood texture In species with annual rings these rings can be counted to find the age of the tree This way wood taken from trees in the past can be dated because the patterns of ring thickness are very distinctive This is dendrochronology Very few tropical trees can be accurately dated in this manner 

The roots of a tree are generally down in earth providing anchorage for the parts above ground and taking in water and nutrients from the soil Most trees need help from a fungus for better uptake of nutriens this is mycorrhiza Most of a trees biomass comes from carbon dioxide absorbed from the atmosphere Above ground the trunk gives height to the leaf bearing branches competing with other plant species for sunlight In many trees the order of the branches makes exposure of the leaves to sunlight better

Not all trees have all the organs or parts as mentioned above For example most palm trees are not branched the saguaro cactus of North America has no functional leaves tree ferns do not produce bark etc Based on their general shape and size all of these are nonetheless generally regarded as trees Trees can vary very much A plant form that is similar to a tree but generally having smaller multiple trunks andor branches that arise near the ground is called a shrub Even though that is true no precise differentiation between shrubs and trees is possible Given their small size bonsai plants would not technically be trees but one should not confuse reference to the form of a species with the size or shape of individual specimens A spruce seedling does not fit the definition of a tree but all spruces are trees

A tree is a plant form that can be found in many different orders and families of plants Trees show many growth forms leaf type and shape bark traits and organs

The tree form has changed separately in classes of plants that are not related in response to similar problems With about 100000 types of trees the number of tree types in the whole world might be one fourth of all living plant types Most tree species grow in tropical parts of the world and many of these areas have not been surveyed yet by botanists making species difference and ranges not well understood

The earliest trees were tree ferns horsetails and lycophytes which grew in forests in the Carboniferous period tree ferns still survive but the only surviving horsetails and lycophytes are not of tree form Later in the Triassic Period conifers ginkgos cycads and other gymnosperms appeared and subsequently flowering plants in the Cretaceous period Most species of trees today are flowering plants and conifers

A small group of trees growing together is called a grove or copse and a landscape covered by a dense growth of trees is called a forest Several biotopes are defined largely by the trees that inhabit them examples are rainforest and taiga A landscape of trees scattered or spaced across grassland is called a savanna A forest of great age is called old growth forest or ancient woodland A very young tree is called a sapling

The Coast Redwood 11556 m in Redwood National Park California is believed to be the worlds tallest tree 

The tallest trees in Australia are all eucalypts of which there are more than 700 species The so called Mountain ash with a slim straight trunk grows to over 300 feet

The stoutest living single trunk species in diameter is the African Baobab m to ft159precision0abbryes Glencoe Baobab Limpopo Province South Africa This tree split up in November 2009 and now the stoutest baobab could be Sunland Baobab with diameter 1064 m and circumference of 334 m

Some trees develop multiple trunks which grow together The Sacred Fig is a notable example of this forming additional trunks by growing adventitious roots down from the branches which then thicken up when the root reaches the ground to form new trunks a single Sacred Fig tree can have hundreds of such trunks

The oldest trees are determined by growth rings which can be seen if the tree is cut down or in cores taken from the edge to the center of the tree Correct determination is only possible for trees which make growth rings generally those which occur in seasonal climates trees in uniform non seasonal tropical climates are always growing and do not have distinct growth rings It is also only possible for trees which are solid to the center of the tree many very old trees become hollow as the dead heartwood decays away For some of these species age estimates have been made on the basis of extrapolating current growth rates but the results are usually little better than guesses or wild speculation White proposes a method of estimating the age of large and veteran trees in the United Kingdom through the correlation between a trees stem diameter growth character and age 

The verified oldest measured ages are

Other species suspected of reaching exceptional age include European Yew Taxus baccata and Western Redcedar Thuja plicata The oldest known European Yew is the Llangernyw Yew in the Churchyard of Llangernyw village in North Wales which is estimated to be between 4000 and 5000 years old

The oldest reported age for an angiosperm tree is 2293 years for the Sri Maha Bodhi Sacred Fig planted in 288 BC at Anuradhapura Sri Lanka this is said to be the oldest human planted tree with a known planting date

Studies have shown that trees contribute as much as 27 of the appraised land value in certain markets

assuming 22 inflation per year

Tree climbing is an activity where one moves around in the crown of trees

Use of a rope helmet and harness are the minimum requirements to ensure the safety of the climber Other equipment can also be used depending on the experience and skill of the tree climber Some tree climbers take special hammocks called Treeboats and Portaledges with them into the tree canopies where they can enjoy a picnic or nap or spend the night

Tree climbing is an on rope activity that puts together many different tricks and gear originally derived from rock climbing and caving These techniques are used to climb trees for many purposes including tree care animal rescue recreation sport research and activism

The two major sources of tree damage are biotic and abiotic Biotic sources would include insects which might bore into the tree deer which might rub bark off the trunk or fungi which might attach themselves to the tree

Abiotic sources include lightning vehicles impacts and construction activities Construction activities can involve a number of damage sources including grade changes that prevent aeration to roots spills involving toxic chemicals such as cement or petroleum products or severing of branches or roots People can damage trees also

Both damage sources can result in trees becoming dangerous and the term hazard trees is commonly used by arborists and industry groups such as power line operators Hazard trees are trees which due to disease or other factors are more susceptible to falling during windstorms or having parts of the tree fall 

The process of finding the danger a tree presents is based on a process called the Quantified Tree Risk Assessment

Trees are similar to people Both can take a lot of some types of damage and survive but even small amounts of certain types of trauma can result in death Arborists are very aware that established trees will not tolerate any appreciable disturbance of the root system Even though that is true most people and construction professionals do not realize how easily a tree can be killed

One reason for confusion about tree damage from construction involves the dormancy of trees during winter Another factor is that trees may not show symptoms of damage until 24 months or longer after damage has occurred For that reason persons who do not know about caring for trees may not link the actual cause with the later damaged effect

Various organizations have long recognized the importance of construction activities that impact tree health The impacts are important because they can result in monetary losses due to tree damage and resultant remediation or replacement costs as well as violation of government ordinances or community or subdivision restrictions 

As a result protocols for tree management prior to during and after construction activities are well established tested and refined These basic steps are involved

International standards are uniform in analyzing damage potential and sizing TPZs to minimize damage For mature to fully mature trees the accepted TPZ comprises a 15 foot clearance for every 1 inch diameter of trunk That means for a 10 inch tree the TPZ would extend 15 feet in all directions from the base of the trunk at ground level 

For young or small trees with minimal crowns a TPZ equal to 1 foot for every inch of trunk diameter may be good enough That means for a 3 inch tree the TPZ would extend 3 feet in all directions from the base of the trunk at ground level Detailed information on TPZs and related topics is available at minimal cost from organizations like the International Society for Arboriculture

The tree has always been a cultural symbol Common icons are the World tree for instance Yggdrasil and the tree of life The tree is often used to represent nature or the environment itself A common mistake is that trees get most of their mass from the ground In fact 99 of a trees mass comes from the air

A Wish Tree is a single tree usually distinguished by species position or appearance which is used as an object of wishes and offerings Such trees are identified as possessing a special religious or spiritual value By tradition believers make votive offerings in order to gain from that nature spirit saint or goddess fulfillment of a wish

Tree worship refers to the tendency of many societies in all of history to worship or otherwise mythologize trees Trees have played a very important role in many of the worlds mythologies and religions and have been given deep and sacred meanings throughout the ages Human beings seeing the growth and death of trees the elasticity of their branches the sensitiveness and the annual decay and revival of their foliage see them as powerful symbols of growth decay and resurrection The most ancient cross cultural symbolic representation of the universes construction is the world tree 

The tree with its branches reaching up into the sky and roots deep into the earth can be seen to dwell in three worlds  a link between heaven the earth and the underworld uniting above and below It is also both a feminine symbol bearing sustenance and a masculine phallic symbol  another union

For this reason many mythologies around the world have the concept of the World tree a great tree that acts as an Axis mundi holding up the cosmos and providing a link between the heavens earth and underworld In European mythology the best known example is the tree Yggdrasil from Norse mythology

The world tree is also an important part of Mesoamerican mythologies where it represents the four cardinal directions The concept of the world tree is also closely linked to the motif of the Tree of life

In literature a mythology was notably developed by JRR Tolkien his Two Trees of Valinor playing a central role in his 1964 Tree and Leaf William Butler Yeats describes a holy tree in his poem The Two Trees

There are many types of trees Here is a list of some of them

A tragedy is a sad thing In theatre a tragedy is a play that ends sadly A tragedy is usually about a person who has many good qualities but has one bad quality that causes trouble for him and may cause him or his family or friends to be in trouble

Often in a tragedy there is one thing that the hero does not want to happen and tries to prevent but no matter what he does it makes this thing more and more sure to happen They originated in Ancient Greece where they were performed at religious festivals The three most famous Greek tragedy writers were Aeschylus Sophocles and Euripides Other famous writers include Shakespeare

Taxonomy is a branch of science It is about the laws and principles of classifying things From one type of taxonomy many classifications might be produced

The best known kind of taxonomy is used for the classification of lifeforms Each lifeform has a scientific name This name is part of the scientific classification of that species The name is the same all over the world so that when scientists from different places talk or write about the living thing they can understand each other In addition a species has a position in the tree of life Thus the crow is Corvus corone a member of the Corvidae family and they are passerine birds That is well agreed but the classification of other groups is not agreed at present and often several classifications are being discussed

The highest rank in the domain of living things is the kingdom Each kingdom has many smaller groups in it called phyla Each phylum has more smaller groups in it called classes This pattern looks like branches on a tree with smaller branches growing from them Each species is put into a group because of what it does how and what it eats special body parts and so on At the end of the pattern the groups are very small Then each species in the genus is given its own name 

When someone writes about a living thing and its formal scientific name they write the genus and species name This is known as binomial nomenclature because it is a way to describe organisms using two names the first is the genus name and the second is the species in that genus The scientific name of the domestic cat is Felis catus Sometimes it is enough to write F catus 

These are the major groups used in taxonomy

Some mnemonics

When people started naming species Latin was the language most widely used around the world So all species names are still Latin names Scientists used to write the official description of each new species in Latin as well Years ago zoologist switched from Latin to English for the description of animals On January 1 2012 the International Botanical Congress switched to English for describing new plant species

An important modern approach to taxonomy is cladism This approach is based on the branching course of evolution Like traditional Linnaean classification it uses characters to decide on the branches of the classification It insists on groups being monophyletic This has the effect that birds are not a class but a sub group of dinosaurs It also means the rank system described above would be abolished Cladism thus has different principles of taxonomy and so produces a different kind of classification Decisions where possible are supported by DNA sequence analysis Present day biological classification is a mixture of the old Linnaean and the modern cladistic principles of taxonomy In parts it is changing rapidly The classificatons presented in wikipedia at present are often a compromise between the two systems The details are regularly discussed

A temple is a building where people go to practice their religion In a temple people perform religious activities like prayers and worship of God Thus a temple is a general term for a house of worship Christians usually call their religious buildings churches

Some religions use the term temple exclusively or alongside specific synonyms

Theft is a crime It is when one person or group takes from another person business or state any object money service or information without permission A person who has been convicted of theft may be called a thief However the practice of engaging in theft is also called stealing There are many different types of theft such as burglary armed robbery and shoplifting

Theft is also known as permanent borrowing

Stealing is a basic crime and is illegal almost everywhere Thieves steal things sometimes because they want to have something for themselves or because they want to sell something for money Sometimes thieves will come up with plans to rob a store bank house or person and sometimes they will just see a chance to steal something and take it

When thieves steal things for money they usually pick cars electronics laptops or other things they can sell easily Sometimes thieves use pawn shops to sell things easily to someone who will not ask questions

Items can be protected with a lock andor alarm to prevent theft Most locks will not stop a determined thief but a good high quality safe will

About 61 million people live in the UK Most people in the UK speak English There are five native languages other than English They are Welsh in Wales Gaelic and Scots in Scotland and Northern Ireland Irish in Northern Ireland and Cornish in Cornwall 

Between the 17th and mid 20th centuries Britain was an important world power It became a colonial empire that controlled large areas of Africa Asia North America and Oceania Today this empire does not exist although Britain retains links with some of its former empire 

Some well known cities in the UK are London Edinburgh Cardiff Belfast Manchester Liverpool Birmingham York and Glasgow

Archaeological remains show that the first group of people to live in the British Isles were hunter gatherers after the last ice age ended The date is not known perhaps as early as 8000BC but certainly by 5000BC They built mesolithic wood and stone monuments Stonehenge was built between 3000 and 1600BC Later Celtic tribes arrived from mainland Europe Britain was a changing collection of tribal areas with no overall leader Julius Caesar tried to invade in 55BC but was not able to do so The Romans successfully invaded in 43AD

History begins when there is a written record and writing like so much else was brought to Britain by the Romans Rome ruled in Britain from 44AD to 410AD but they ruled only England and Wales The Romans never ruled Scotland north of the Clyde Forth valley or Ireland their northern boundary varied from time to time and was marked for a while at Hadrians Wall

After the Romans two waves of immigrants came to Britain The first were Vikings and the second were from German tribes the Angles Saxons and Jutes English the language is a development from Anglo Saxon Old English and is a Germanic language

After a long period when England was divided into various kingdoms it was finally made into one country by thelstan in 945AD England and Wales were unified by Edward I by force in the 13th century This union is known as Britain 

Union with Scotland took much longer there were hundreds of years of conflicts between the two countries This union is known as Great Britain In 1603 when Queen Elizabeth I of England died her closest relative was King James VI of Scotland He became king of England as well as king of Scotland but the two countries stayed separate In 1707 the Scottish and English Parliaments agreed the Treaty of Union which joined the two countries into one country called The Kingdom of Great Britain under Queen Anne

By 1800 both Scotland and England had already independently had much influence over Ireland for over 600 years In that year laws were passed in Great Britain and Ireland to merge the two states The new country was called the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland In 1922 much of Ireland became independent as the Irish Free State from the United Kingdom However six northern counties continue to be part of the United Kingdom The country was renamed The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland

The British people today are ruled by Parliament not by monarchs Parliament started a thousand years ago as an advisory body for the monarch but by the 17th century it had gained enough power to successfully defeat Charles I in the English Civil War Oliver Cromwell became Lord Protector Though the monarchy was restored after his death the Crown gradually became the secondary power and Parliament the first Members of Parliament were elected but until the early twentieth century only men who owned property could vote In the nineteenth century more people were given suffrage but even so by 1900 women could not vote and only 40 of men were rich enough to vote But in 1928 all adults male and female got the vote this is called universal suffrage

Parliament is in London but it has power over the whole of the UK Today Wales Scotland and Northern Ireland each have their own parliaments as well but they have more limited powers There are also parliaments in the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands which are islands that are partly controlled by the UK and partly independent

The members of Parliament belong to political parties the biggest parties are the Labour Party the Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats Members of the same party agree to act and vote more or less together A party with more than half the seats forms the government the leader of the party becomes the Prime Minister who then appoints other ministers Because the government has a majority in Parliament it can normally control what laws are passed

Major languages spoken in the United Kingdom other than English include Polish Eastern Panjabi or Punjabi Bengali Urdu Cantonese Greek Southwestern Caribbean Creole English 

The UK is made up of four different countries Wales England Scotland and Northern Ireland The capital city of Wales is Cardiff The capital city of England is London The capital city of Scotland is Edinburgh and the capital city of Northern Ireland is Belfast Other large cities in the UK are Birmingham Bristol Manchester Liverpool Newcastle upon Tyne Leeds Sheffield Glasgow Southampton Leicester Coventry Bradford and Nottingham

The UK is north west off the coast of mainland Europe Around the UK are the North Sea the English Channel and the Atlantic Ocean The UK also rules usually indirectly a number of smaller places round the world which are known as overseas territories They are remnants of the once great British Empire

The weather of the United Kingdom is changeable and unpredictable Summers are moderately warm winters are cool to cold Rain falls throughout the year and more on the west than the east The reasons include its northerly latitude and the warm water from the Atlantic Oceans Gulf Stream The usually moderate prevailing winds from the Atlantic may be interrupted by Arctic air from the north east or less often hot air from the Sahara

The UK is a parliamentary democracy based on a constitutional and hereditary monarchy The people of the United Kingdom vote for a members of Parliament to speak for them and to make laws for them Queen Elizabeth II is the queen of the UK and is the head of state Even though she is the head of state she does not actually govern the country The government led by the Prime Minister governs the country and decides policy Today the Prime Minister is David Cameron who is the leader of the Conservative party

Parliament is where laws are made It has three parts the House of Commons the House of Lords and the Queen The House of Commons is the most powerful part It is where Members of Parliament sit The Prime Minister sits here as well because he is a Member of Parliament The people who sit in the House of Lords are called peers they are not chosen by the people Most peers are now appointed by the government There are some who are hereditary peers and a few others such as certain bishops in the established Church of England and the Judiciary The 92 hereditary peers are the only elected members of the House of Lords they are elected by the larger total of hereditary peers There are two other hereditary peers in the House of Lords because they also have jobs to do on state occasions

Scotland has its own devolved Parliament with power to make laws on things like education health and Scottish law Northern Ireland and Wales have their own devolved Assemblies which have some powers but less than the Scottish parliament The UK Parliament remains sovereign and it could end the devolved administrations at any time

The UK is a developed country with fifth largest economy in the world It was a superpower during the 18th 19th and early 20th century and was considered since the early 1800s to be the most powerful and influential nation in the world in politics economics and in military strength Britain continued to be the biggest manufacturing economy in the world until 1908 and the largest economy until the 1920s The economic cost of two world wars and the decline of the British Empire in the 1950s and 1960s reduced its leading role in global affairs The UK still has strong economic cultural military and political influence and is a nuclear power It is a member state of the European Union The UK holds a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council and is a member of the G8 NATO World Trade Organization and the Commonwealth of Nations

London the capital is famous as being the largest centre of finance in the world along with New York City in the United States

William Shakespeare is perhaps the most famous English playwright He wrote plays in the late 16th century including Romeo and Juliet and Macbeth In the 19th century Jane Austen and Charles Dickens were popular novelists Twentieth century writers include the science fiction novelist HG Wells and JRR Tolkien The childrens fantasy Harry Potter series is written by JK Rowling Aldous Huxley was also from the United Kingdom 

English literature is written by authors from many countries The UK has eight Nobel laureates in literature Seamus Heaney is a well known writer who was born in Northern Ireland

Arthur Conan Doyle from Scotland wrote the Sherlock Holmes detective novels He was from Edinburgh The poet Dylan Thomas has brought Welsh culture to international attention

England Northern Ireland Scotland and Wales have separate but similar systems of education They have in common that education is required from ages five to sixteen The majority of children attend state schools but a small proportion attend private schools 

Britains most well known universities include the University of Cambridge and University of Oxford as well as the London universities which collectively form the Golden Triangle of UK universities 

A broader group of twenty universities form the Russell Group which account for two thirds of reseach grants and contract funding out of the total of 100 universities

Road traffic in the United Kingdom drives on the left hand side of the road and the driver steers from the right hand side of the vehicle The road network on the island of Great Britain is extensive with most local and rural roads having evolved from Roman and Medieval times Major routes developed in the mid 20th Century were adapted to the needs of the motor car The high speed motorway network was mostly constructed in the 1960s and 1970s and links together major towns and cities

The system of rail transport was invented in England so the United Kingdom has the oldest railway network in the world It was built mostly during the Victorian era At the heart of the network are five long distance main lines which radiate from London to the major cities and secondary population centres with dense commuter networks within the regions The newest part of the network connects London to the Channel Tunnel from St Pancras station and is built to the same standard as the French TGV system The network is part privatised with privately owned train operating companies providing service along particular lines or regions whilst the tracks signals and stations are owned by a Government controlled company called Network Rail The system of underground railways in London known as the Tube has been copied by many other cities

Most domestic air travel in the United Kingdom is between London and the major cities in Scotland and the North of England London Heathrow is the nations largest airport and is one of the most important international hubs in the world Other major airports with principal international service include London Gatwick Birmingham Manchester and Glasgow

An extensive system of ferry networks operate between the Scottish islands and major ferry routes operate between England and France Scotland Northern Ireland and EnglandWales Republic of Ireland

The universe is commonly defined as everything that exists It includes all kinds of physical matter and energy the planets stars galaxies and all the contents of space

Earlier stages in the development of the universe can be seen at great distances Observations suggest that the universe has been governed by the same physical laws and constants throughout most of its extent and history

In recorded history various cosmologies have been proposed to account for what people saw in the sky Most early models thought the Earth was the centre of the Universe Some ancient Greeks thought that the Universe has infinite space and has existed forever They thought it had a set of spheres which corresponded to the fixed stars the Sun and various planets The spheres circled about a spherical but unmoving Earth 

Over the centuries more precise observations and better ideas of gravity led to Copernicuss Sun centred model This was hugely controversial at the time and was fought long and hard by authorities of the Christian church 

The invention of the telescope in the Netherlands 1608 was a milestone in astronomy By the mid 19th century they were good enough for other galaxies to be distinguished The modern optical telescope is still more advanced Meanwhile the Newtonian dynamics showed how the Solar System worked 

The improvement of telescopes led astronomers to realise that the Solar System is in a galaxy made of millions of stars the Milky Way and that other galaxies exist outside it as far as machines can reach Careful studies of the distribution of these galaxies and their spectral lines have led to much of modern cosmology Discovery of the red shift showed that the Universe is expanding 

The most used scientific model of the Universe is known as the Big Bang theory The Universe expanded from a very hot dense phase called the Planck epoch in which all the matter and energy of the Universe was concentrated Several independent experimental measurements support the expansion of space and more generally the Big Bang idea Recent observations support the idea that this expansion is happening because of dark energy Most of the matter in the Universe may be in a form which cannot be detected by present methods This has been named dark matter

Just to be clear dark matter and energy have not been detected directly Their existence is inferred by deduction from observations which would be difficult to explain otherwise

Current thinking in cosmology is that the age of the Universe is 1373 billion years and that the diameter of the Universe is at least 93 billion light years or 880 E26 metres 

According to general relativity space can get bigger faster than the speed of light but we can view only part of the universe because of the speed of light We cannot see space beyond the limitations of light

The word Universe comes from the Old French word Univers which comes from the Latin word universum The Latin word was used by Cicero and later Latin authors in many of the same senses as the modern English word is used 

A different interpretation of unvorsum is everything rotated as one or everything rotated by one This refers to an early Greek model of the Universe In that model all matter was in rotating spheres centered on the Earth according to Aristotle the rotation of the outermost sphere was responsible for the motion and change of everything within It was natural for the Greeks to assume that the Earth was stationary and that the heavens rotated about the Earth because careful astronomical and physical measurements are required to prove otherwise

The most common term for Universe among the ancient Greek philosophers from Pythagoras onwards was  defined as all matter and all space

The broadest word meaning of the Universe is found in De divisione naturae by the mediaeval philosopher Johannes Scotus Eriugena who defined it as simply everything everything that exists and everything that does not exist

Time is not considered in Eriugenas definition thus his definition includes everything that exists has existed and will exist as well as everything that does not exist has never existed and will never exist This all embracing definition was not adopted by most later philosophers but something similar is in quantum physics

Usually the Universe is thought to be everything that exists has existed and will exist This definition says that the Universe is made of two elements space and time together known as space time or the vacuum and matter and different forms of energy and momentum occupying space time The two kinds of elements behave according to physical laws in which we describe how the elements interact 

A similar definition of the term Universe is everything that exists at a single moment of time such as the present or the beginning of time as in the sentence The Universe was of size 0

In Aristotles book The Physics Aristotle divided  into three roughly analogous elements matter form and change Physical laws were the rules governing the properties of matter form and their changes Later philosophers such as Lucretius Averroes Avicenna and Baruch Spinoza altered or refined these divisions For example Averroes and Spinoza have active principles governing the Universe which act on passive elements

It is possible to form space times each existing but not able to touch move or change interact with each other An easy way to think of this is a group of separate soap bubbles in which people living on one soap bubble cannot interact with those on other soap bubbles According to one common terminology each soap bubble of space time is denoted as a universe whereas our particular space time is denoted as the Universe just as we call our moon the Moon The entire collection of these separate space times is denoted as the multiverse In principle the other unconnected universes may have different dimensionalities and topologies of space time different forms of matter and energy and different physical laws and physical constants although such possibilities are currently speculative

According to a still more restrictive definition the Universe is everything within our connected space time that could have a chance to interact with us and vice versa 

According to the general idea of relativity some regions of space may never interact with ours even in the lifetime of the Universe due to the finite speed of light and the ongoing expansion of space For example radio messages sent from Earth may never reach some regions of space even if the Universe would exist forever space may expand faster than light can traverse it 

It is worth emphasizing that those distant regions of space are taken to exist and be part of reality as much as we are yet we can never interact with them even in principle The spatial region within which we can affect and be affected is denoted as the observable universe 

Strictly speaking the observable universe depends on the location of the observer By traveling an observer can come into contact with a greater region of space time than an observer who remains still so that the observable universe for the former is larger than for the latter Nevertheless even the most rapid traveler may not be able to interact with all of space Typically the observable universe is taken to mean the universe observable from our vantage point in the Milky Way Galaxy

The Universe is huge and possibly infinite in volume The matter which can be seen is spread over a space at least 93 billion light years across For comparison the diameter of a typical galaxy is only 30000 light years and the typical distance between two neighboring galaxies is only 3 million light years As an example our Milky Way Galaxy is roughly 100000 light years in diameter and our nearest sister galaxy the Andromeda Galaxy is located roughly 25 million light years away There are probably more than 100 billion galaxies in the observable universe Typical galaxies range from dwarf galaxys with as few as ten million stars up to giants with one trillion stars all orbiting the galaxys center of mass Thus a very rough estimate from these numbers would suggest there are around one sextillion stars in the observable universe though a 2003 study by Australian National University astronomers resulted in a figure of 70 sextillion

The matter that can be seen is spread throughout the universe when averaged over distances longer than 300 million light years However on smaller length scales matter is observed to form clumps many atoms are condensed into stars most stars into galaxies most galaxies into galaxy groups and clusters and lastly the largest scale structures such as the Great Wall of galaxies 

The present overall density of the Universe is very low roughly 99 1030 grams per cubic centimetre This mass energy appears to consist of 73 dark energy 23 cold dark matter and 4 ordinary matter The density of atoms is about a single hydrogen atom for every four cubic meters of volume The properties of dark energy and dark matter are not known Dark matter slows the expansion of the Universe Dark energy makes its expansion faster

The Universe is old and changing The best good guess of the Universes age is 1373012 billion years old based on what was seen of the cosmic microwave background radiation Independent estimates agree although they are less precise ranging from 1120 billion years to 1315 billion years 

The universe has not been the same at all times in its history This getting bigger accounts for how Earth bound pople can see the light from a galaxy 30 billion light years away even if that light has traveled for only 13 billion years the very space between them has expanded This expansion is consistent with the observation that the light from distant galaxies has been redshifted the photons emitted have been stretched to longer wavelengths and lower frequency during their journey The rate of this spatial expansion is accelerating based on studies of Type Ia supernovae and other data

The relative amounts of different chemical elements especially the lightest atoms such as hydrogen deuterium and helium seem to be identical in all of the universe and throughout all of the history of it that we know of The universe seems to have much more matter than antimatter The Universe appears to have no net electric charge and therefore gravity appears to be the dominant interaction on cosmological length scales The Universe also appears to have neither net momentum nor angular momentum The absence of net charge and momentum would follow if the universe were finite

The Universe appears to have a smooth space time continuum made of three spatial dimensions and one temporal dimension On the average space is very nearly flat meaning that Euclidean geometry is experimentally true with high accuracy throughout most of the Universe However the universe may have more dimensions and its spacetime may have a multiply connected global topology

The Universe seems to be governed throughout by the same physical laws and physical constants According to the prevailing Standard Model of physics all matter is composed of three generations of leptons and quarks both of which are fermions These elementary particles interact via at most three fundamental interactions the electroweak interaction which includes electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force the strong nuclear force described by quantum chromodynamics and gravity which is best described at present by general relativity 

The idea of special relativity is thought to hold in all of the universe provided that the spatial and temporal length scales are sufficiently short otherwise general relativity must be applied There is no explanation for the particular values that physical constants appear to have throughout our Universe such as Plancks constant h or the gravitational constant G Several conservation laws have been identified such as the conservation of charge conservation of momentum conservation of angular momentum and conservation of energy

Accurate predictions of the universes past and future require an accurate theory of gravitation The best theory available is Albert Einsteins general theory of relativity which has passed all experimental tests so far However since rigorous experiments have not been carried out on cosmological length scales general relativity could conceivably be inaccurate Nevertheless its predictions appear to be consistent with observations so there is no reason to adopt another theory

General relativity provides of a set of ten nonlinear partial differential equations for the spacetime metric that must be solved from the distribution of mass energy and momentum throughout the universe Since these are unknown in exact detail cosmological models have been based on the cosmological principle which states that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic In effect this principle asserts that the gravitational effects of the various galaxies making up the universe are equivalent to those of a fine dust distributed uniformly throughout the universe with the same average density The assumption of a uniform dust makes it easy to solve Einsteins field equations and predict the past and future of the universe on cosmological time scales

Einsteins field equations include a cosmological constant that is related to an energy density of empty space Depending on its sign the cosmological constant can either slow or accelerate the expansion of the universe Although many scientists including Einstein had speculated that was zero recent astronomical observations of type Ia supernovae have detected a large amount of dark energy that is accelerating the universes expansion Preliminary studies suggest that this dark energy is related to a positive although alternative theories cannot be ruled out as yet

The distances between the spinning galaxies increase with time but the distances between the stars within each galaxy stay roughly the same due to their gravitational interactions This animation illustrates a closed Friedmann universe with zero cosmological constant such a universe oscillates between a Big Bang and a Big Crunch

The prevailing Big Bang model accounts for many of the experimental observations described above such as the correlation of distance and redshift of galaxies the universal ratio of hydrogenhelium atoms and the ubiquitous isotropic microwave radiation background As noted above the redshift arises from the metric expansion of space as the space itself expands the wavelength of a photon traveling through space likewise increases decreasing its energy The longer a photon has been traveling the more expansion it has undergone hence older photons from more distant galaxies are the most red shifted Determining the correlation between distance and redshift is an important problem in experimental physical cosmology

Other experimental observations can be explained by combining the overall expansion of space with nuclear and atomic physics As the universe expands the energy density of the electromagnetic radiation decreases more quickly than does that of matter since the energy of a photon decreases with its wavelength Thus although the energy density of the universe is now dominated by matter it was once dominated by radiation poetically speaking all was light As the universe expanded its energy density decreased and it became cooler as it did so the elementary particles of matter could associate stably into ever larger combinations Thus in the early part of the matter dominated era stable protons and neutrons formed which then associated into atomic nuclei At this stage the matter in the universe was mainly a hot dense plasma of negative electrons neutral neutrinos and positive nuclei Nuclear reactions among the nuclei led to the present abundances of the lighter nuclei particularly hydrogen deuterium and helium Eventually the electrons and nuclei combined to form stable atoms which are transparent to most wavelengths of radiation at this point the radiation decoupled from the matter forming the ubiquitous isotropic background of microwave radiation observed today

Other observations are not clearly answered by known physics According to the prevailing theory a slight imbalance of matter over antimatter was present in the universes creation or developed very shortly thereafter Although the matter and antimatter mostly annihilated one another producing photons a small residue of matter survived giving the present matter dominated universe 

Several lines of evidence also suggest that a rapid cosmic inflation of the universe occurred very early in its history Recent observations also suggest that the cosmological constant is not zero and that the net mass energy content of the universe is dominated by a dark energy and dark matter that have not been characterized scientifically They differ in their gravitational effects Dark matter gravitates as ordinary matter does and thus slows the expansion of the universe by contrast dark energy serves to accelerate the universes expansion

Some people think that there is more than one Universe They think that there is a set of universes called the multiverse By definition there is no way for anything in one universe to affect something in another The multiverse is not yet a scientific idea because there is no way to test it An idea that cannot be tested is not science

Measurement is a process to attach a numerical value to an observation This is done to be able to compare or order two or more such observations Units of Measurement provide standards to compare against For example the metre is the standard unit to measure length Before 1982 it was defined as the distance between two markers on a certain rod Now scientists define the metre as the distance light travels in a certain time in vacuum

Saying something has a length of 2 metres therefore means that it is exactly twice as long as that rod used to define the metre or that light takes twice the time defined for a metre to travel that distance

This also makes it easy to say that something that is 3 metres long is longer than something else that is only 2 metres long

Today most units of measure fall into one of two systems The older imperial system uses the foot as a mesure of length the pound as a mesure for weight and the second as a measure for time There are other units as well Most of the time 12 or 16 of the smaller unit make the bigger unit This is difficult to remember so there is another system that uses 10 of the smaller unit to make the bigger one It is known as the SI system or metric system It uses the metre for length the kilogram for weight and the second for time

The property of the thing being measured is given as a number of units of measure The number only has sense when the unit of measurement is also given

For example The Eiffel Tower in Paris France is 300 meters tall That is the distance from the top to the bottom of the Eiffel Tower is 300 meters The property of the Eiffel Tower being measured is a distance The number measured is 300 This number does not make sense without the unit of measure The unit of measure is the meter

Standards are used in measurements That is the unit of measurement used to measure a property is the same everywhere and does not change This makes measurement easier and comparisons between measurements easier

There are units of measurement of different sizes There are small units of measurement to measure small things There are big units of measurement to measure big things 

Science medicine and engineering use smaller units of measurement to measure small things with less error It is easier to measure large things using larger units of measurement Large measurements like the width of a galaxy and small measurements like the mass of an atom use special units of measurement

There are many different standards and units used all over the world

The metric system is a system of measurement used in most of the world It is also called the International System of Units or SI

Units of measure in the metric system include

Imperial units were used in countries that were part of the British Empire however they can be different in different countries For example the fluid ounce in Britain is smaller than the fluid ounce in the US but the US gallon is smaller than the British gallon The imperial units are now used mainly in the United States While many countries have officially adopted SI older system of units are still used In the United States the metric system has been legal for trade since 1866 but other measurements such as the gallon inch and the pound are still widely used

Imperial units of measurement include

The ounces for weight and volume are different Even when measuring water the number of ounces of weight is not the same as the number of fluid ounces

The unit of time is the second The minute and hour are larger units A day is usually said to be 24 hours but is actually a small bit longer This difference is corrected at the end of every year A week and month are also standard units

A unit of measurement that applies to money is called a unit of account This is normally a currency issued by a country For instance the United States use dollars Each dollar is 100 cents The United Kingdom uses pounds Each pound is 100 pennies or pence Other countries in Europe use the Euro which is 100 cent for the Euro they are not called cents

US customary units are those used to measure things in the United States

Length or distance units include the inch foot yard and mile

Land units include square miles and acres

Common volume units are the teaspoon tablespoon fluid ounce cup pint quart US gallon

A barrel is the unit to measure oil

Temperature is measured in degrees Fahrenheit To convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit take the Celsius multiply by nine divide by five and add thirty two

Units of weight include the pound which contains 16 ounces This should not be confused with the British pound which is a type of money The different uses of the word pound can cause confusion

Some people have been trying to get rid of these units in the United States and replace them with the metric system since the 1820s During and after World War II there was much infrastructure built using the old measures by both British and Americans

Uranus completes its turn around the Sun in 84 earth years It completes its turn around itself in 17 hours and 14 minutes This means there are about 43000 days in 1 uranian year

The distance between Uranus and Neptune is 16 billion km Uranus was discovered in 1781 Uranus has 11 rings which are hard to see from earth

This planet can be seen with the naked eye under perfect conditions Some evidence suggests that this planet was catalogued as a star before its confirmed discovery factdateJuly 2010

Uranus is named after the Greek god Uranus who was a god of sky

Uranus has 27 known moons The names for these moons are chosen from characters from the works of Shakespeare and Alexander Pope

The five biggest moons are Miranda Ariel Umbriel Titania and Oberon Many moons yet have been discovered They remain a mystery

In 1986 NASAs Voyager 2 visited Uranus The visit is the only attempt to investigate the planet from a short distance

Uranus is covered in blue clouds The clouds made of methane are difficult to see as they are low in the atmosphere There are also violent storms on the surface with winds that blow at 160 miles per hour Scientists are studying the clouds to try and understand the storms on the planet

The planet Uranus has a system made of 13 rings between the more extensive set around Saturn and the simpler systems around Jupiter and Neptune The rings of Uranus were discovered on March 10 1977 by James L Elliot Edward W Dunham and Douglas J Mink More than 200 years ago William Herschel also reported observing rings but modern astronomers do not believe that he saw them because they are very dark and faint Two additional rings were discovered in 1986 in images taken by the Voyager 2 and two outer rings were found in 20032005 by the Hubble Space Telescope As of 2010 people know that the Uranian ring system have 13 rings In the order of increasing distance from the planet they were called 1986U2R 6 5 4     and They are probably composed of water ice

The rings of Uranus are thought to be relatively young not more than 600 million years old The Uranian ring system probably began from the collisional fragmentation of moons that once existed around the planet After colliding the moons probably broke up into many particles which survived as narrow and optically dense rings only in strictly confined zones of maximum stability

As we know currently the ring system of Uranus has thirteen distinct rings In order of increasing distance from the planet they are 1986U2R 6 5 4     rings They can be divided into three groups nine narrow main rings two dusty rings and two outer rings The rings of Uranus  consist mainly of macroscopic particles and little dust although dust is known to be present in 1986U2R   and rings In addition to these well known rings there may be numerous optically thin dust bands and faint rings between them These faint rings and dust bands may exist only temporarily or consist of a number of separate arcs which are sometimes detected during occultations Some of them became visible during a series of ring plane crossing events in 2007 A number of dust bands between the rings were observed in forward scatteringReflabelAanone geometry by Voyager 2 All rings of Uranus show azimuthal brightness variations

The rings are made of an extremely dark material The rings are slightly red in the ultraviolet and visible parts of the spectrum and grey in near infrared They exhibit no identifiable spectral features The chemical composition of the ring particles is not known However they cannot be made of pure water ice like the rings of Saturn because they are too dark darker than the inner moons of Uranus This indicates that they are probably composed of a mixture of the ice and a dark material The nature of this material is not clear but it may be organic compounds considerably darkened by the charged particle irradiation from the Uranian magnetosphere The rings particles may consist of a heavily processed material which was initially similar to that of the inner moons

As a whole the ring system of Uranus is unlike either the faint dusty rings of Jupiter or the broad and complex rings of Saturn some of which are composed of very bright materialwater ice However there are similarities with some parts of the latter ring system the Saturnian F ring and the ring are both narrow relatively dark and are shepherded by a pair of moons The newly discovered outer rings of Uranus are similar to the outer G and E rings of Saturn Narrow ringlets existing in the broad Saturnian rings also resemble the narrow rings of Uranus In addition dust bands observed between the main rings of Uranus may be similar to the rings of Jupiter In contrast the Neptunian ring system is quite similar to that of Uranus although it is less complex darker and contains more dust the Neptunian rings are also positioned further from the planet

A university is an institution where teaching and research is done The word university comes from the Latin universitas magistrorum et scholarium roughly meaning community of teachers and scholars People can attend university to get a degree Unlike the schooling they have done before the courses at university are specialized A person studying biology at university has lots of courses about biology and not very many courses in other fields like languages or history To get a higher degree people must do some research

The universities were born in Europe during the Middle Ages The first institution of this type was the University of Bologna that later became a model for similar centers of education This term can often be used in other cultures to mean centers of higher education and higher thought although their creation was often well before the Middle Ages

At first the universities had formed themselves according to the model of the professional groups and like almost everything in the Middle Ages they remained tied to the Catholic Church At the beginning they had worked to teach the so called seven liberal arts

That earliest division caused the present divisions between literary and scientific fields

A university can include several campuses or different places where classes are taught In each campus there are several faculties and university schools and also laboratories departments and institutes of research Many campuses also have housing for students in buildings called dormitories and structures like libraries study rooms and gymnasiums for students that live there Each school offers many courses that students take to earn a degree The person with the highest right to control and to command in a university is the rector who governs the university with the help of the party of vice rectors and of other organs such as the social council and the governing body

There is a group of famous universities called the Ivy League They are

Some other famous universities are

Value is how much something is worth Often the best way to find the value of something is to use the price that it can be sold for In mathematics a value is a number

Volapk is a constructed language created in 1880 by Johann Martin Schleyer Schleyer was a Catholic priest from Germany He felt that God had told him in a dream to make an international language Volapk conventions took place in 1884 1887 and 1889 The aim was to help people from different cultures speak to each other

Volapk became less popular after 1887 when Esperanto was published Part of the reason was that Esperanto is easier to learn with a simpler grammar There are only 25 30 Volapk speakers in the world today

The vocabulary of Volapk is mostly English with some words from German and French 

Vol and pk come from the English words world and speech The grammar is based on Indo European languagesEsperanto

An example of Volapk is the translation of the Lords prayer

A vocabulary is a list of words A persons vocabulary is all the words that he or she knows A five year old would probably know about 5000 words An adult who has studied at university or college may know at least 20000 words in their language factdateApril 2009

The vocabulary of a language is always changing New words are invented or words change their meaning This means that dictionaries have to be updated Words to do with computers such as download are new to the English language The new word bling came from hip hop Words like cool have developed new meaningsfactdateApril 2009

If a person wanted to find out roughly how many words they knew they could look at a page in a dictionary and count how many of those words they knew If they multiplied that by how many pages there were in the dictionary they could estimate how many words they knewfactdateApril 2009

A way of looking up unknown vocabulary can be done with a Dictionary or a Multi word dictionary

It is difficult to be exact Some words may be understood but not known well enough to be used  Words that are used are part of a persons active vocabulary Words that are only understood and not used are called passive vocabularyfactdateApril 2009

Sometimes it may not be easy to decide if a word is understood It may depend on the context or the words around it Knowing the context the word is being used in may make it possible to guess what it means Without knowing what a chough is the phrase I saw a chough fly off from its nest would let someone guess that it is a kind of birdfactdateApril 2009

Someone who knows many words is said to have a wide vocabularyfactdateApril 2009

It is good to develop a wide vocabulary Knowing lots of words helps with reading listening writing and talking to people The English language has a very large vocabulary This is because of Britains history Every time Britain was invaded the new people brought new words There are words from the Celts Anglo Saxons Vikings Romans and French There are also many words from Ancient Greek and Latin Many of these new words were used as well as the old ones but they may have a different meaning For example pork came from the old French word porc but it means food that comes from a pigfactdateApril 2009

In English some long words may be hard to understand This could be because they were taken from Latin or Greek That makes it difficult to guess the meaning of the wordfactdateApril 2009

A verb is a kind of word that usually tells about an action or a state and is the main part of a sentence Every sentence has a verb In English verbs are the only kind of word that changes to show past or present tense 

Every language in the world has verbs but they are not always used in the same ways They also can have different properties in different languages For example in some other languages verbs do not change for past and present tense This means the definition above only works well for English verbs

There are sixteen verbs used in Basic English They are be do have come go see seem give take keep make put send say let get

The word verb originally comes from were a Proto Indo European word meaning a word It comes to English through the Latin verbum and the Old French verbe

In simple sentences the verb may be one word The cat sat on the mat However the verb may be a whole phrase The cat will sit on the mat 

Verbal phrases can be extremely difficult to analyse Im afraid I will need to be going soon There seem to be three verbal phrases here which add to something like Sorry I must go soon

In English and many other languages verbs change their form This is called inflection Most English verbs have six inflected forms but be has eight different forms

You should notice that some of the verb forms look the same You can say they have the same shape For example the plain present and the plain form of walk have the same shape The same is true for the past and the past participle But these different forms can have different shapes in other verbs For example the plain present of be is usually are but the plain form is be Also the past of eat is ate but the past participle is eaten When you look for a verb in the dictionary it is usually the plain form that you look for

An English sentence must have at least one primary form verb Each main clause can only have one primary form verb

English has two main kinds of verbs normal verbs and auxiliary verbs The difference between them is mainly in where they can go in a sentence Some verbs are in both groups but there are very few auxiliary verbs in English There are also two kinds of auxiliary verbs modal verbs and non modal verbs The table below shows most of the English auxiliaries and a small number of other verbs

There are several auxiliary verbs

The follow verbs are modal auxiliaries

Auxiliary verbs also inflect for negation Usually this is done by adding not or nt

Sometimes the verb do It does not really change the meaning

It is also used in the negative when no other auxiliary verbs are used

Many other languages do not use the verb do as an auxiliary verb They use the simple present for do and the simple past or perfect for did

Many people think that all different ways of using verbs are all different tenses This is not true There are three main systems related to the verb tense aspect and mood

Tense is mainly used to say when the verb happens in the past present or future Some languages have all three tenses some have only two and some have no tenses at all English and Japanese for example have only two tenses past and present Chinese and Indonesian verbs do not show tense Instead they use other words in the sentence to show when the verb happens

Aspect usually shows us things like whether the action is finished or not or if something happens regularly English has two aspects progressive and perfect In English aspect is usually shown by using participle verb forms Aspect can combine with present or past tense

English uses the gerund participle usually together with the auxiliary be to show the progressive aspect

Many other languages such as French do not use progressive tenses They use the simple present instead of the present progressive and the imperfect instead of the past progressive

English uses the past participle usually together with the auxiliary have to show the perfect aspect

The past perfect can be used to express an unrealized hope wish etc

After If wish and would rather the past perfect can be used to talk about past events that never happened

Finally English mood is now usually shown by using modal verbs In the past English had a full mood system but that has almost completely disappeared The subjunctive mood now uses the plain form There is also a form of be that is used in conditionals to show that something is not true

Certain parts of a sentence naturally come before verbs or after them but these are not always the same for all verbs The main sentence parts are subject object complement and modifier 

Almost all English sentences have subjects but sentences that are orders usually do not have any subjects A subject usually comes before a verb but it can also come after auxiliary verbs In the following examples the subject is underlined and the primary verb is in bold

Many verbs can be followed by an object These verbs are called transitive verbs In fact some verbs must have an object but some verbs never take an object Verbs that do not take an object are called intransitive verbs Some verbs can even have two objects They are called ditransitive verbs In the following examples the object is underlined and the primary verb is in bold

Some verbs can or must be followed by a complement These verbs are called linking verbs or copula In the following examples the complement is underlined and the verb is in bold

Verbs can be modified by various modifiers mainly adverbs Note that verbs generally do not need modifiers its usually a choice In the following examples the adverb is underlined and the verb is in bold

Verbs also commonly take a variety of other modifiers including prepositions

Sometimes a verb and another word can have the same shape In these cases you can usually see the difference by looking at various properties of the words

Sometimes a verb and an adjective can have the same shape Usually this happens with participles For example the present participle interesting and the adjective interesting look the same Verbs are different from adjectives though because they cannot be modified by very more or most For example you can say That is very interesting so you know interesting is an adjective here But you cannot say My teacher is very interesting me in math because in this sentence interesting is a verb On the other hand if you cannot change the be verb to seem or become it is probably a verb 

The gerund particle sometimes looks like a noun This is especially true when it is used as a subject as in the following example

The main differences between these verbs and nouns are modifiers number and objectcomplement

Verbs cannot generally be modified by adjectives and nouns cannot generally be modified by adverbs So in Running regularly is good for you running is a verb because it is modified by regularly an adverb

Verbs cannot change for number so if you can make the word plural it is a noun not a verb For example this drawing is nice can change to these drawings are nice so drawing is a noun But drawing trees is fun cannot change to drawings trees is fun so it is a verb here

Many verbs can take objects or complements but nouns cannot So in parking the car is hard parking is a verb because it takes the object the car But if you say theres no parking parking may be a noun because it does not have an object

Some verbs have become prepositions Again usually these share a shape with participles Here are some examples

The main difference between verbs and prepositions is that verbs have a subject Even if the subject is not written you can understand what it is Prepositions do not have a subject

The volume of an object is a measure of the amount of space occupied by that object The volume of a mountain is much larger than the volume of a rock for instance

The word volume implies a three dimensional context where by convention

For objects at or near the Earths surface height or depth often refers to the dimension of the object along the local vertical All physical objects occupy a volume even if some are so thin that they appear to be two dimensional like a sheet of paper

The unit of volume in the International System of Units is the cubic meter which is represented by the symbol m3

In some fields or applications it is convenient to use different units to simplify the discussions or writings For instance

Traditional units are still in encountered in some countries Imperial units such as the gallon or the fluid ounce were in widespread use within the British Empire Some of them are still popular in the United States which also uses units like the bushel or the quart the cup and the teaspoon See US customary units for more examples

The volume of an object is not a fundamental property of that object it can change with environmental conditions such as pressure and temperature especially if the object is highly compressible

The volume of a mixture of fluids may or may not be equal to the sum of their volumes before they were mixed

The volume of simple geometric objects can often be calculated on the basis of their known dimensions

The volume of a gas is typically that of its container but it could be ill defined as in the case of the atmosphere which has no clear upper limit The volume of a liquid is often measured by pouring it into a graduated container The volume of a small solid can be estimated by immersing it into a graduated container partially filled with a known amount of liquid provided the solid is not soluble in the liquid

Venus is the second planet from the Sun It is a terrestrial planet because it has a solid rocky surface The other terrestrial planets are Mercury Earth and Mars Astronomers have known Venus for thousands of years The ancient Romans named it after their goddess Venus Venus is the brightest thing in the night sky except for the Moon It is sometimes called the morning star or the evening star as it is brightest just before the sun comes up in the morning and just after the sun goes down in the evening Venus comes closer to the earth than any other planet does

Venus is sometimes called the sister planet of Earth as they are quite similar in size and gravity In other ways the two planets are very different Venus atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide with clouds of sulfuric acid Sulphuric acid is a chemical that is very poisonous to humans The thick atmosphere has made it hard to see the surface and until the twenty first century many people thought things might live there The pressure on Venus surface is 92 times that of Earth Venus has no moons 

Venus is a terrestrial planet so like the Earth its surface is made of rock Venus is much hotter than Earth All the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere acts like a blanket trapping heat from the Sun This effect is called the greenhouse effect and it is very strong on Venus This makes Venus the hottest planet in the Solar System with an broken wikt linkestimationestimated average temperature of convert480CF1 This is hot enough to melt lead or zinc 

Venus surface is about 80 smooth rocky plains Two higher areas called continents make up the north and south of the planet The north is called Ishtar Terra and the south is called Aphrodite Terra They are named after the Babylonian and Greek goddesses of love

Venus atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide and nitrogen gas with clouds of sulphuric acid Because the atmosphere is so thick or dense the pressure is very high The pressure is 92 times the pressure on Earth enough to crush many things

It is impossible to look at the planets surface from space as the thick cloud layer reflects 60 of the light that hits it The only way scientists have been able to look is by using infrared and ultraviolet cameras

So for example something that moves in a square and finishes back where it started has not been displaced This would mean that the objects displacement zero and it would have a velocity of zero It is different to the speed that it moved around the square People often use velocity and speed to mean the same thing but they are different velocity must have a direction

A virtual community is a group of people who share an interest hobby or set of views The people in it may come from many different places They talk with each other using technology such as the Internet telephone calls and email The most common is the Internet

The World Wide Web is the part of the Internet that contains websites and webpages It was invented in 1989 by Tim Berners Lee at CERN Geneva Switzerland Sir Tim Berners Lee created a new language called HTML Websites are composed of pages linked by hypertext links They are all written in HTML

The World Wide Web is not used to describe HTML webpages that are not part of the Internet 

In order to see the World Wide Web one needs a computer and a computer program called a web browser One also needs a connection to the Internet

Many companies nowadays offer free website hosting allowing one to make websites that can be displayed on the WWW like any other domain site These sites usually make money from advertisements instead of fees

A wiki is a type of website that lets anyone create and change its pages The word is Internet slang The word Wiki is short for WikiWikiWeb Wikiwiki is a word from Hawaiian meaning fast or speed Examples of wikis include Wikipedia Anarchopedia and Conservapedia

Every wiki can be changed or edited by everyone although some important pages cannot be changed by anyone Wikis are central places where we all can share information with each other people can add new information and then people read them Wikis allow information from all around the world to be collected 

In a wiki people can write pages together If one person writes something wrong then the next person can correct it The next person can also add something new to the page Because of this the page gets better whenever someone changes it If someone writes information that is very obviously wrong and the person actually wanted to vandalise it would be changed by administrators and the person will not be able to change the wiki anymore Pages are watched closely 

Users can also discuss things on wikis Discussion can make people understand things better or gives people a chance to tell their views In Wikipedia the talk pages are for that but in some wikis the article and the discussion are in the same page

Wikis can be used for different things not all wikis follow the same rules for using them For example the purpose of Wikipedia is to write articles for an encyclopedia Thats why in Wikipedia people do not want to hear general discussion that does not help in writing articles

Ward Cunningham started the first wiki in March 1995 Many people liked the place and wrote there after which they started similar websites Wiki is also an abbreviation for Wikipedia

A wiki is freely editable by anyone even to people without an account so wikis are the best targets for vandals to add inappropriate content to because it is easy for them to save the page There are many ways to prevent this Like protecting the page to only allow registered users to edit or simply block them if they go out of hand

There is no way to stop vandalism totally but it is possible to lower the number of vandals of the wiki

A website is a set of webpages that are joined together People look at websites with a computer of some kind sometimes including the computer inside mobile telephones and televisions The websites are kept on computers called web servers

There is almost always a single homepage which has links to other pages that are part of that site Sometimes it has links to pages that are part of other sites as well

Websites can be used to advertise or sell things They can also be used to talk to other people A blog is a website where the location of the material is less relevant than who writes it and which is more focused on dialogue Very often the people who use blogs dislike the word site since it implies a controlled place Sites are good for looking up information on the computer

Users can access any website by using a URL This is the website address which is shown near the top of the web browser The homepage and the rest of the site usually have the same words at the start of the URL  for instance pages at the Simple English Wikipedia always start httpsimplewikipediaorg but are different after that

Web sites are usually shown in HTML but are not always written or kept that way  some use WAP and others use XML

A word is something spoken by the mouth that can be pronounced It is also a collection of letters used together to try to communicate a meaning and these can also usually be pronounced Some words have more than one meaning for example spring can refer to the season or the object Some words have different pronunciations for example wind and wind are pronounced differently Some words have different spellings for example color and colour which are both correct Some words can be only one letter for example a and I in English Besides English every other language also has its own words 

For example hello is a word

Find the meaning of this word using a Dictionary or a multi word dictionary to find the meaning of multiple words 

Microsoft Word is a program by that is used for word processing

A web browser is a computer program application that lets people find and read web pages on the Internet Browsers read documents that are written in HTML to display images and text with clickable links They use rules such as HTTP to transfer data with the World Wide Web

Some web browsers used today are

Alternative browsers are

Web can mean several things

A webpage is part of a website It is in the form of text and images Web pages are connected by links Clicking on a link makes another webpage appear Webpages are hosted on web servers and downloaded and viewed with a web browser

Wiktionary is a dictionary or a group of meanings for words in the form of a wiki There are many languages of Wiktionary Wiktionary is also a thesaurus There is also a Simple English Wiktionary Wiktionary is run by the Wikimedia Foundation which also runs Wikipedia The Simple English Wiktionary was created on November 2005

In 2006 there was a vote for the change of the logo of Wiktionary The original logo of only words was replaced However there were very few people who voted in this contest Therefore smaller wikis used the newer logo but the English Wiktionary stayed the same logo

In 2009 there was a second contest for a newer logo This was a step to make all the Wiktionaries to have the same logo on all projects However the English Wiktionary still did not use the new logo

Microsoft Windows is an operating system made by Microsoft It is used by almost 90 of computer users but not everyone agrees it is the best Almost all new personal computers come installed with Windows 7 some weaker computers may come with an older version

Microsoft Windows was first made in 1985 The most recent change is Windows 7 which was made in 2009 Bill Gates helped make Windows He was vice chief executive officer and co founder of Microsoft and he was the chief software architect but now has left the company

Windows lets people run programs and sort their files It has many programs that come with it these can read and write documents and pictures The program Internet Explorer lets people use the internet look at web pages and read e mail The application Windows Media Player lets users listen to music and watch videos A user is also able to download and install many other applications These applications can be anything from video games to software like Microsoft Office

Many users have complained that Windows operating systems are buggy or have many security holes and can slow down over time Because of its popularity most computer viruses are written to infect computers running Windows

A window is an opening in a wall of a building in a car etc to let air and light in It is usually filled with a sheet of glass There can be many different shapes and sizes including rectangular square circular or irregular shapes Some windows include coloured glass Windows are usually transparent so that people can see through them

In a graphical operating system a window is a rectangle within a screen that displays some data or pictures to a user Windows can contain many things for example a web browser

Wine is an alcoholic drink The word wine is usually used to talk about drinks made from the juice of grapes although people sometimes call alcoholic drinks made from the juice of other fruits wine This article only deals with wine made from grapes

Wine is made by the fermentation of the sugar in grapes There are two main types of wine red wine and white wine Red wine is made from red grapes and white wine is made from white grapes Ros wine is made by leaving red grapes in skin contact for a very short time The colour comes only from the skin so if you have short skin contact the wine will not turn red but only pink Wine sometimes has bubbles in it this wine is called sparkling wine The most popular sparkling wine is champagne which comes from France

People have been making wine for about 5000 years 

Wine is a popular drink in many countries The countries that drink the most wine are 

However if you make a list of countries where the average person drinks the most wine the list is different

Luxembourg France Italy Portugal Croatia Switzerland Spain Argentina Uruguay and Slovenia

Wine is made in many countries The countries that make the most wine are 

France Italy Spain USA Argentina Germany Australia South Africa Portugal and Chile

In mathematics width is the distance between the end of an object farthest to the left and the end of an object farthest to the right

For example the distance between the left side and right side of a chair is the width of it

Water is the most common liquid on Earth It covers about 714 of the Earth Pure water has no smell taste or color Lakes oceans and rivers are made of water Rain is water that falls from clouds in the sky If water gets very cold it freezes and becomes ice Frozen rain can be ice or snow if conditions permit If water gets very hot it boils and becomes steam Water is very important for life However some studies suggest that by 2025 more than half of the people around the world will not have enough water 

Water is the only natural fluid on earth Water is the only substance that exists in all three aggregate states There are over 40 anomalies known When water freezes its volume expands by about 9

Plants and animals must drink water to live It gives a medium for chemical reactions to take place and is the main part of blood It keeps the body temperature the same by sweating from the skin Water helps blood carry nutrients from the stomach to all parts of the body to keep the body alive Water also helps the blood carry oxygen from the lungs to the body Saliva helps animals and people digest food Water helps make urine Urine helps remove bad chemicals from the body The human body is 6070 water

Water is the main component of drinks like milk juice and wine Each type of drink also has other things that add flavor or nutrients things like sugar fruit and sometimes alcohol Water that a person can drink is called potable water The water in oceans is salt water but lakes and rivers usually have unsalted water There is only about 3 fresh water on earth the rest is salt water

Water is a molecule made of 2 hydrogen atoms and 1 oxygen atom Its formula is H2O Water has a surface tension so a little water makes drops on a surface rather than spreading out to wet the surface Water can also be called aqua the Roman word for water Water is also used for recreational purposes Though a human being can survive for up to a week without food they can only survive for a day or two without water Water is a necessary thing to live

A want is a wish or a desire for something If a person would like to have something but can choose not to have it that thing is wanted or can be called a want To want is not the same as to need which is when someone must have something

People often talk about needing a thing when they really just want it Wants can be for the same things as needs For example a person can need to eat food and can want to eat cake If there is no cake then he or she may have to eat something else perhaps bread The need is no longer so important although the want may still be there If there is cake then the persons needs and wants can both be met

In economics a want is about goods or services Choice is how to satisfy a want when there are different ways to do this

Want can also be the idea of what it means to be poor hungry or with no money Charles Dickens wrote a famous book called A Christmas Carol in which there are two children named Want and Ignorance

A web server is a computer with a boot device or other disk containing a web site The term may also refer to an application that helps a computer to perform web server functions

If one site runs more than one server they must use different port numbers Alternatively several hostnames may be mapped to the same computer in which case they are known as virtual servers

Apache IIS and nginx are three popular web servers There are many others including some for practically every platform Servers differ mostly in the server side features they offer such as server side includes and in their authentication and access control mechanisms All decent servers support CGI and most have some binary API as well

You can add lots of engines onto the server to make the server understand programming languages A few examples of these are

To work with the server they must be a web based language instead of being a language which is used to make normal computer programs

War is any fighting that includes the organized use of weapons and harmful force between countries or other groups of people 

War can hurt people on both sides International law has tried to reduce the harmful effects of war The signing of the Kellogg Briand Pact and the development of the United Nations have tried to limit wars Examples include 

See Articles 2 2 and 2 of the United Nations Charter

Many years ago a German soldier named Karl von Clausewitz wrote in his classic book On War Der Krieg ist eine bloe Fortsetzung der Politik mit anderen Mitteln and War is a way of using force to get our enemies to do what we want them to do 

Wars have been fought to control natural resources for religious or cultural reasons over political balances of power legitimacy of particular laws to settle arguments about land or money and many other issues The reasons of any war are very complex while a war can start for just about any reason there is usually more than one cause

Sometimes people see a difference between fighting between countries or people and the formal declaration of a state of war Those who see this difference usually only use the word war for the fighting where the countries governments have officially declared war on each other Smaller armed conflicts are often called riots rebellions coups etc 

When one country sends armed forces to another country supposedly to help keep order or prevent killings of innocents or other crimes against humanity or to protect another government friendly to it against an uprising that country sometimes calls it a police action instead of a war Some people disagree with the use of this word

A war between peoples and groups in the same country is known as a civil war

Some people say peace is the absence of war

Another way to classify warfare splits it into four generations of war

First generation warfare reflects tactics of the era of the smoothbore musket the tactics of line and column Operational art in the first generation did not exist as an idea although it was practiced

Second generation warfare was developed in response to the rifled musket breech loaders barbed wire the machine gun and indirect fire Tactics were based on one group firing and another moving but they remained linear with the defence still trying to prevent all penetrations and the attacks along a sideways line advanced by rushes in small groups Second generation tactics remained the basic tactics of the US until the 1980s and they are still practised by most American units in the field

Third generation warfare was first developed by the Germans in World War I to make up for their inability to match their enemies industrial production Its tactics were the first truly nonlinear tactics attacks rely on penetration to get around and collapse the enemys combat forces and defense was in depth and often provoked penetration to set the enemy up for a counterattack

Fourth generation warfare is what most people call a guerrilla war Fourth generation warfare is far different from the other generations as the objective is not winning a military victory but rather to destroy the spirit or political means of the enemy from attacking you Usually it is when a country is brought into another one or when an outside force is trying to destroy the current government For example the later part of the Second Iraq war or the US occupation period can be considered fourth generation warfare

A number of treaties and other agreements control warfare Put together these are called the Laws of war The most common and famous of those are the Geneva conventions the earliest of which began to take effect in the mid 1800s 

Treaty signing has been a part of international diplomacy and too many treaties to mention in this article have been signed A couple of examples are Resolutions of the Geneva International Conference Geneva 26 29 October 1863 and Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War 75 UNTS 135 entered into force Oct 21 1950

The statistical analysis of war was started by Lewis Fry Richardson following World War I More recent databases of wars have been assembled by the Correlates of War Project and Peter Brecke

Yiddish is a language used by some Jews At first it was a dialect of the German language which Jews began to use in Europe about a thousand years ago It was used in the United States especially in New York Most of its words are of German origin Also Yiddish has many words from Hebrew and Slavic languages notably Polish Yiddish is usually written in Hebrew characters

In the whole world Yiddish is spoken by about 3 million people It is mainly spoken by Hasidic Jews 

In the Netherlands and Sweden Yiddish is protected by the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages

One year is about 365 days long It is the time it takes the Earth to go completely around the sun once A year is actually 365 days long but a calendar has 365 days except in a leap year

The year starts on January 1 and ends on December 31 in the Gregorian calendar but a fiscal year or a school year can start on a different day of the year

There are several ways used to measure the length of a year

Solar and lunar years are used by different societies in daily life The other measurements are used by astronomers

You is a second person English pronoun The word can be singular or plural It is what a person says when he or she is addressing another person in second person Sometimes just using the English letter u is acceptable and ur for the words youre and your This is very informal and is mostly used in texting

The Chinese language is the language used by Chinese in China and elsewhere It forms one of the groups of a language family called the Sino Tibetan family of languages

Chinese can refer to the written or the spoken languages Chinese is special because although there are many spoken languages they use only one way of writing the language Therefore it is possible to communicate by writing the same way Many people in China think that although these different languages sound different they are still one language They call these different languages fang yan to tell them apart from one another

They have one standard language for all of the schools in China and Taiwan It is also a standard for language teaching in some other countries In English we call it Mandarin In China they call it pu tong hua or common to everybody speech In Taiwan they call it Guo yu or language of the whole country They need a standard language because otherwise even though they are in the same country many people could not understand each other

The Chinese language is like a big tree The base of the tree started thousands of years ago It now has several main limbs Some people call just a branch what other people call a main limb so you can say there are six or seven main limbs Each of these main limbs splits off into branches about the way there are branches of English spoken in Great Britain the United States Australia India and so forth Line the Chinese limbs up by number of speakers and we get Mandarin the language spoken in an area centering on Shanghai the language spoken in Guangdong province the language spoken mostly in Fujian province the language spoken mostly in Hunan province a language that is historically that of a refugee group and so not so closely concentrated in any one area in south east China and a language spoken in an area that centers on Jiangxi province Just as the Romance languages all come from the area around Rome and are based on Latin the Chinese languages all have some common source so they keep many common things among them

Chinese is used by the Han people in China and other groups who have come into China and think of themselves as Chinese Chinese is almost always written in Chinese characters They are symbols that have meaning called logograms They also give some indication of pronunciation But just as Xavier sounds very different in English French and Spanish the same character can get very different pronunciations among the seven main limbs of Chinese or even sometimes from branch to branch Since Chinese characters have been around for at least 3500 years it is no wonder that people in places far from each other would say them differently just as 1 2 3 can be read differently in different languages

Chinese people needed to write down pronunciations in dictionaries Chinese does not have an alphabet so how to write down sounds was a big problem in the beginning Nowadays the Mandarin language uses Hanyu pinyin to represent the sounds in Roman letters

All the Chinese languages uses tones This means that they use high and low pitches to help make differences in meaning clear Chinese does not have very many syllables For instance the words for mama hemp horse scold and a kind of question mark word put at the end of sentences to make them into questions are all pronounced ma in Mandarin So for mom you say ma high and level For hemp you say ma starting low and ending high For horse you say ma starting fairly high dipping very low and then going back up again For scold you say ma starting high and ending low Then to make a question out of a statement you add ma but you keep it very soft and short and about on the same level Mandarin has first tone second tone third tone fourth tone and neutral tone Other Chinese languages have more tones some as many as nine

Here are the main seven main groups of languagesdialects of Chinese by size

In 1956 the government of the Peoples Republic of China made public a set of simplified Chinese characters to make learning reading and writing the Chinese language easier In Mainland China and Singapore people use these simpler characters In Hong Kong Taiwan and other places where they speak Chinese people still use the more traditional characters The Korean language also uses Chinese characters to represent certain words The Japanese language uses them even more often These characters are known in Korean as Hanja and in Japanese as Kanji 

A Chinese person with a good education today knows 6000 7000 characters About 3000 Chinese characters are needed to read a Mainland newspaper However people who have learned only the 400 most frequently used characters can read a newspaper  but they will have to guess some less used words

Here are some samples of some words and sentences in Mandarin Chinese Simplified Characters are on the left and Traditional characters are on the right The pronunciation is given in the pinyin system which may not always be as simple as it looks for those who have not studied it

The Traditional Characters are now used in Hong Kong and Taiwan Chinese from Mainland China uses the Simplified Characters but may recognize Traditional Characters

Before 1956 Chinese was written using only Traditional Characters At that time most Chinese people could not read or write at all The government of the Peoples Republic of China thought that the Traditional characters were very hard to understand They also thought that if they made the characters simpler more people could learn how to read and write Today many people in China can read and write with the new Simplified Characters

Zero is a special number If there are zero things there are not any things There are none For example if John has zero hats that means he does not have a hat at all

The symbol for the number zero is 0 

Zero is a special number That is because

The idea of zero was first thought about in Babylon India and in Central America at different times Some places and countries did not know about a zero which may have made it harder for those people to do mathematics 

Over hundreds of years the idea of zero was passed from country to country From India and Babylon to other places like Greece Persia and the Arab parts of the world The Europeans learned about zero from the Arabs

Zero is almost never used as a place number This means that it is not used like 1 2 or 3 to indicate the order or place of something like 1st 2nd or 3rd

Some other things about zero

Any number divided by itself equals one except if that number is zero In symbols

0 0 not a number

In time zero means now For example when a person is counting down the time to the start of something such as a foot race or when a rocket takes off the count is three two one zero Zero is the exact time of the start of the race or when the rocket takes off into the sky

0 is the integer that precedes the positive 1 and follows 1 In most numerical systems 0 was identified before the idea of negative integers was accepted It means courageous one in hieroglyphics

Zero is a number which means an amount of null size that is if the number of your brothers is zero that means the same thing as having no brothers and if something has a weight of zero it has no weight If the difference between the numbers of pieces in two piles is zero it means the two piles have an equal number of pieces Before counting starts the result can be assumed to be zero that is the number of items counted before you count the first item and counting the first item brings the result to one And if there are no items to be counted zero remains the final result

While mathematicians all accept zero as a number some non mathematicians would say that zero is not a number arguing that one cannot have zero of something Others say that if one has a bank balance of zero one has a specific quantity of money in that account namely none It is that latter view which is accepted by mathematicians and most others

Normally speaking there was no year zero between 1 BC and 1 AD More exactly almost all historians leave out the year zero from the proleptic Gregorian and Julian calendars but astronomers include it in these same calendars However the phrase Year Zero may be used to describe any event considered so important that someone might want to start counting years all over again from zero

The modern numeral 0 is normally written as a circle or rectangle In old style fonts with text figures 0 is usually the same height as a lowercase x

On the seven segment displays of calculators watches etc 0 is usually written with six line segments though on some historical calculator models it was written with four line segments The four segment 0 is not common

The number zero is not the same as the numeral or digit zero used in numeral systems using positional notation Successive positions of digits have higher values so the digit zero is used to skip a position and give appropriate value to the preceding and following digits A zero digit is not always necessary in a different positional number system Something called bijective numeration is a possible example of a system without zeroes

0 is also used as a numerical digit used to represent that number in numerals It is used to hold the place of that digit because correct placing of digits affects a numerals value

Examples

The rule which has the letter O with a slash and the zero without was used at IBM and a few other early mainframe makers this is even more of a problem for Scandinavians because it looks like two of their letters at the same time Some BurroughsUnisys computers display a zero with a backwards slash And yet another convention common on early line printers left zero without any extra dots or slashes but added a tail or hook to the letter O so that it resembled an inverted Q or cursive capital letter O

The letters used on some European number plates for cars make the two symbols look different This is done by making the zero rather egg shaped and the O more circular but most of all by cutting open the zero on the upper right side so the circle is not closed any more The style of letters chosen is called flschungserschwerende Schrift meaning script which is harder to falsify But those used in the United Kingdom do not make the letter o and the number 0 look different from each other because there can never be any mistake if the letters are correctly spaced

In paper writing you do not have to make the 0 and O look different at all Or you may add a slash across the zero in order to show the difference although this sometimes causes mistakes in the number 0

Zeroes of a function Functions are explained in the Function article If the function f 0 then x is called a zero of the function f For example if the function f is x2 1 then the zeroes of the function are 1 and 1 because f 2 1 0 and f 2 1 0

Zeroes of a function are used because they are another way to talk about solving an equation which is a main goal in algebra If we want to solve an equation like x2 1 then we can subtract the right hand side of the equation from both sides in this case 1 Whatever we get on the left hand side in this case x2 1 can be called a function f The right hand side has to be zero because we subtracted it from itself So f 0 Finding the zeroes of this function is the same as solving this equation In the paragraph before the zeroes of this function are 1 and 1 so they are the solutions of this equation We got this equation by subtracting the same thing from both sides so we also have solutions to the equation we started with in this case x2 1 So if we could find zeroes of functions we could solve any equation

Zoology is the science of studying animal life It is part of biology The word is pronounced Z ology not Zoo ology Animal life is classified into groups called phyla of which there are at least 30 

Zoologists are scientists who study animals They may work in laboratories or do field research The methods are many and various At the heart they cover the structure function ecology and evolution of animals The structure is investigated by dissection and microscopic examination The function is investigated by observation and experiment Palaeontology supplies information about extinct animals Zoologists may be employed by universities museums or by zoos

Zinc sometimes called spelter is a chemical element It is a transition metal a group of metals It is sometimes considered a post transition metal Its symbol on the periodic table is Zn Zinc is the 30th element on the periodic table and has an atomic number of 30 Zinc has a mass number of 6538 It contains 30 protons and 30 electrons In total 29 isotopes of zinc are known and five of these occur in nature Some isotopes are radioactive Their half lives are between 40 milliseconds for 57Zn and 5x1018 years for 70Zn

Zinc is a metal that is mostly used for galvanizing and batteries It is the fourth most common metal 

Zinc is a shiny blue gray metal When it has just been cut zinc has a white gray color If it is exposed to air it will not stay shiny for long It melts at a low temperature This temperature is lower than most transition metals but higher than tin or lead It can be melted on a cooking stove It boils at a low temperature for a metal It is not magnetic When heated a little it becomes very flexible If it is heated more it becomes very brittle It forms alloys easily with other metals

Zinc is a reactive metal It is about as reactive as aluminium and more reactive than most of the more common metals such as iron copper nickel and chrome It is less reactive than magnesium Zinc can react with acids bases and nonmetals It does not rust in air though A coating of zinc oxide and zinc carbonate forms on the surface of the zinc when it is in air This coating stops corrosion Acids can dissolve this coating and react with the zinc metal This reaction of zinc with an acid makes a zinc salt such as zinc chloride and hydrogen gas This is a very common chemical reaction The reaction below is the reaction with hydrochloric acid

Zinc can burn when powdered or in small pieces to make zinc oxide a white powder The flame is bright blue green

Zinc oxide can dissolve in strong bases This reaction happens in some batteries that have zinc in them

Zinc is a chalcophile This means that it would rather react with sulfur and elements below it on the periodic table than oxygen That is why zinc sulfide is the most common zinc ore not zinc oxide

Zinc can make chemical compounds with other elements These chemical compounds are only in one oxidation state 2 A 1 compound has been found but it is hard to make There are no other oxidation states other than 1 or 2 Most of these compounds have no color If they have a color it is not the zinc that is making the color

Zinc chloride is one of the most common zinc compounds They are quite unreactive They are a little acidic when dissolved in water They make a green flame when heated in a fire FileZinc chloridejpgZinc chloride FileZinc oxidejpgZinc oxide FileZinc SulfatejpgZinc sulfate 

Five isotopes of zinc are found in nature 64Zn is the most common isotope with 4863 of naturally occurring Zinc This isotope has a half life of 43x1018 years This is so long that its radioactivity can be ignored Similarly chem70Zn with a half life of 13x1016 years is usually considered to not be radioactive The other isotopes found in nature are chem66Zn chem67Zn and chem68Zn

Zinc is not found as a metal in the earths crust Zinc is only found as zinc compounds Sphalerite a mineral that is made of zinc sulfide is a main ore of zinc Very little zinc is in the ocean Zinc ore is normally found with copper and lead ores 

There are some other zinc ores such as smithsonite and a zinc silicate mineral They are less common

The zinc sulfide is concentrated by flotation There is a detergent that collects the zinc sulfide The impurities sink to the bottom and are removed Then the zinc sulfide is heated in air to make zinc oxide and sulfur dioxide 

The sulfur dioxide is oxidized to sulfur trioxide 

The sulfur trioxide reacts with the zinc oxide to make zinc sulfate This makes a soluble form of zinc which can be processed more

The zinc sulfate is purified and electrolyzed This electrolysis makes oxygen zinc and sulfuric acid This makes a pure zinc that is known as SHG or special high grade

The sulfuric acid is reused in place of the sulfur trioxide to leach more zinc oxide 

Zinc oxide can also be reduced by carbon to zinc metal and carbon dioxide at high temperatures This is a blast furnace process similar to how iron is made

This form of zinc is cheaper but is not pure

Zinc is the fourth most common metal in the world About 10 million tons are made every year

Zinc is used in electrical batteries The alkaline cell and the Leclanche cell are the ones that use zinc the most It becomes oxidized and provides electrons for the battery to run 

About 59 of zinc is used for corrosion prevention which includes galvanizing 47 of the worlds zinc is used for galvanizing This is used to protect another metal usually iron from rusting The zinc coating corrodes instead of the iron The zinc coating can be placed on the metal in two ways The metal can be dipped into a pot of melted zinc The zinc can also be electroplated on to the metal Dipping lasts longer but has a patchy surface that some do not think looks nice It is also used in motorboats and pipelines to slow rusting The motor of a motorboat often has a bullet of zinc that will corrode easily but will help other metal parts of the motor to stay rust free 

Zinc is used in alloys Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc Brass is the most common zinc alloy Zinc can form alloys with many other metals Zinc aluminium is an alloy of zinc and aluminium which makes good bearings Commercial bronze has zinc in it Sometimes cadmium telluride is reacted with zinc to make cadmium zinc telluride a semiconductor Nickel silver is another zinc alloy 

Zinc can be used in the pipes of a pipe organ An alloy of tin and lead was used in the past Zinc is used in the US penny where it only has a thin layer of copper The core is zinc Older pennies were made completely out of copper

A mixture of powdered zinc and sulfur can be used to propel a model rocket This reaction makes zinc sulfide heat light and gases Zinc sheet metal is used to make zinc bars

About 14 of zinc is used to make zinc compounds Zinc oxide can be used for sunscreen or paint pigment Zinc oxide also is a semiconductor Zinc chloride is used to preserve wood so it does not rot Some fungicides have zinc in them Zinc sulfate is used in dyes and pigments Zinc sulfide is used in fluorescent bulbs to convert the ultraviolet light to visible light

Humans need a little bit of zinc to help their body run well If they do not get enough zinc in their food they can get a mineral deficiency Almost two billion people have a zinc deficiency Zinc deficiency makes one more easily get infections Some people say that when we get colds we should take more zinc Others say that zinc does not make a difference There are medicines that one can use when they have a cold People add tiny amounts of zinc compounds to vitamin pills and cereals to make sure that they get enough zinc Most single tablet vitamins have zinc in them Zinc is found in at least 100 enzymes It is the second most common transition metal other than iron Zinc also is used by the brain The human body contains 2 to 4 grams of zinc A zinc enzyme helps remove carbon dioxide from blood Wheat has much zinc in it

Large amounts of zinc metal are toxic It can dissolve in stomach acid When too much zinc is eaten copper and iron levels go down in the body Zinc compounds can be corrosive in the stomach Zinc compounds put in the nose can ruin the sense of smell

Zinc ions are very toxic to fish and many things that live in water

A zebra is a mammal of the Equidae family found in Africa Zebras are related to horses and donkeys Zebras are known for having stripes There are three main species of zebra Grevys Zebra the Plains Zebra and the Mountain Zebra In 2004 new research led to reclassifying zebra subspecies 

All zebras have very short fur because they live in hot areas Their fur has black and white stripes The main part of the body has mostly vertical stripes and the legs have horizontal stripes They also have a dark line down their back Each of the different zebra species has a different type of stripes Each zebra has a unique pattern of stripes

Zebras live in families with one male and lots of females They can have babies when they are about five years old and can have one foal every year Zebras mainly eat grass but they also eat fruit leaves and some vegetables They always live near water They are endangered and the numbers of zebra is dropping

Zebras live naturally in Africa south of the Sahara desert

A zoological garden zoological park or zoo is a place where many different species of animals are kept so people can see and watch them

Modern zoos try not only to be for peoples entertainment but for education research and the conservation and protection of animals Many zoos are centers where rare animals are preserved when they are in danger of dying out These modern zoos also want to give the animals a natural life so that they are healthy and behave normal This is done for the animals but also that people can see the animals as if they were in nature and not in a zoo

A copyright is a law that gives the owner of a written document musical composition book picture or other creative work the right to decide what other people can do with it Copyright laws make it easier for authors to make money by selling their works Because of copyright a work can only be copied if the owner of the copyright gives permission

People who copy or edit a work that is protected under copyright without permission can be punished by the law usually with a fine In other more serious cases a person who copies a work that is protected under copyright could be arrested and go to prison

In most countries authors automatically own the copyright to any work they make or create as long as they do not give the copyright to someone else 

In most countries there is no need to register the copyright and some countries do not even have procedures to register copyrights But in countries where registration is available without registration it may be difficult to prove that the copyright of a work belongs to a certain author So it is often a good idea to register anyway especially for works that are sold for money

If an author gets paid to make a work for someone else the person who pays for making the work will often get to own the copyright instead of the author him or herself For example if a person working for a company like Microsoft creates a new computer software program at work the Microsoft company would own the copyright

Copyright laws usually protect the owner of copyright for their entire lifetime such as until 50 years after the authors death This period has now been extended to 70 years in most cases When the period of copyright protection has ended the written document musical composition book picture or other creative work is in the public domain This means that no one owns the copyright to them and everyone is free to copy use and change them without having to ask for permission or pay the owner

There is an exception to the rules of copyright called fair use This means that people can copy a very small amount of a work to use in reviews or in research reports 

An example of fair use is when newspaper writers quote several sentences from a copyright protected document to tell the story Another example of fair use is when a university professor quotes several sentences from a copyright protected book in a review of the book or in a research report

Different countries have different copyright laws Most of the differences are about

Because of these differences a certain piece of work may be under copyright in one country and in the public domain in another

Some people argue that copyright laws make it easier for people to make new works and think of new ideas After all if authors get to make money for the time effort and money they put in then they will want to make more works later and make more money

But others believe that copyright laws make it harder to be creative Without copyright other people could reuse existing work and copyright law often stops that

If an author wants to sell a work its often easiest to give the copyright to a publisher The publisher will do all the selling and in return for that service will keep part of the money But the publisher has many different things to sell and they may not want to sell the work the author made Authors often find it very hard to find a publisher willing to sell their work

But without a publisher it can be even harder for an author to sell his or her work In many markets a few big publishers own the copyrights to almost everything available and stores will not want to sell works published by small authors themselves Many people say copyright law helps big publishers stay in control and keeps smaller authors out of the market

As a solution to these problems groups of small authors have come up with the idea of open content With open content authors give everyone permission to copy change and give away or sell their works as long as they follow certain rules These rules are explained in an open content license Some possible open content rules are

The term for Open Content is sometimes Copyleft

The Republic of China also known as Republic of China is a democratic island country in East Asia that is known around the world by most people as Taiwan It located southeast of the flagiconPeoples Republic of China Peoples Republic of China south of flagiconJapanJapan and north of the flagiconPhilippinesPhilippines

The territory the Republic of China controls is known by most people as the island of Taiwan Most places on Taiwan Island are called Taiwan Province by the government of the Republic of China for official business except the two largest cities of Taipei and Kaohsiung West of Taiwan Island there are three small groups of islands that also belong to ROC They are

The ROC used to govern Mainland China too Now it is owned by the Communist Peoples Republic of China see History and Political problems of China However ROC still declares Mainland China as its territory officially

The Nationalists led by Dr Sun Yat sen got rid of the Qing Dynasty ruled by the Manchus then they established the ROC and ended Imperial Dynastic Rule in late 1911 The ROC at that time had Mainland China and all of what is now called Mongolia

After the Japanese were defeated by the Allies during World War II Taiwan was controlled by the ROC

In 1949 the Chinese Communists fought a war against the Nationalists and won They established the Peoples Republic of China The Nationalists left mainland China and arrived in Taiwan

After the ROC created a base on Taiwan it hoped one day to capture the Mainland But Chinese Communists grew stronger so the Nationalists never did go back The Communists say they replaced the ROC as the only government of China and also calls Taiwan their own

There are those people in Taiwan who want to never be a part of the Peoples Republic of China They believe in complete Taiwan independence and want to rename the ROC to Republic of Taiwan so Taiwan can no longer have any ancestral connection to China or Chinese culture Some other people wish to unite with the Peoples Republic of China they want Chinese reunification Some others want the status quo which means keeping everything the way it is now

Most Taiwanese speak Mandarin and others speak Taiwanese or Hakka A small percentage of the population is aboriginal and these people have their own languages although unfair treatment exerted by the Chinese population have been bad and many of these people and their languages struggle to survive Some older Taiwanese who went to school before 1947 can speak Japanese After the Nationalist government fled the Mainland in 1948 49 they brought their language Mandarin with them and made Mandarin the only official language Then everyone in the ROC had to learn Mandarin In the past students were not allowed to speak their mother tongue in school and were expected to speak only Mandarin Taiwanese Hakka and native languages were considered bad until the early 1990s when education in these languages began to be taught in some school systems They were promoted but by this time many young people could speak only Mandarin The Cantonese language spoken in parts of southern China is not spoken in Taiwan
