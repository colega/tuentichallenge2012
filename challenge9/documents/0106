Racism is the belief that a particular race is better or worse than another and that a person is born with their social and moral traits which are related to their race Racial separatism is the belief which is based on racism most of the time that different races should remain apart from one another Racism has existed throughout human history It may be defined as the hatred of one person by another  or the belief that another person is less than human  because of skin color language customs place of birth or any factor that supposedly reveals the basic nature of that person It has influenced wars slavery the formation of nations and legal codes

During the past 500 1000 years racism on the part of Western powers toward non Westerners has had a far more significant impact on history than any other form of racism The most well known example of racism by the West has been slavery especially making Africans slaves in the New World This happened because of the racist belief that Black Africans were not as human as white Europeans and their descendants 

This belief was not automatic that is Africans were not always to be worse or less human When Portuguese sailors first explored Africa in the 15th and 16th centuries they came upon empires and cities as advanced as their own and they thought Africans to be serious rivals Over time though as African civilizations did not match the technological advances of Europe and the major European powers began to take things from the continent and kidnap people who lived there forcing them to work as slave laborers in new colonies across the Atlantic Africans came to be seen as an inferior species as savages This view was necessary to justify the slave trade at a time when Western culture had begun to promote individual rights and human equality The willingness of some Africans to sell other Africans to European slave traders also led to claims of savagery based on the false belief that the dark people were all like brothers and all part of one society  as opposed to many different nations some of which were at war with one another

Apoptosis is the controlled death of a cell Apoptosis is used to get rid of cells that are not needed anymore by the body This is especially important in normal growth Apoptosis is designed into the cells DNA and allows the cell to die without causing inflammation The cell releases enzymes that destroy the cell from the inside After the cell is dead the left over parts are then removed by other special cells called phagocytes

Cells can die in two ways by damage or by programmed cell death When a cell dies by apoptosis other cells do not react When a cell dies because of damage the cells contents are left over and affect nearby cells 

Apoptosis is the normal end of a cells life At any point in time there may be too many cells in one area and the DNA coding for apoptosis will activate in some of those cells and they will die safely This is important to the overall functioning of the organism If for example the making of liver cells were to speed up and they never died the liver would no longer function properly The liver cells would eventually take over the organisms body

Cancerous cells do not undergo apoptosis and that is why they are such a problem They continuously multiply until the host organ or the organisms body cannot function anymore This occurs because the apoptosis coding has mutated and so has other coding This causes rapid mitotic division of the unwanted cells This is a cancerous growth 

Phagocytes are the white blood cells that protect the body by eating dirt bacteria and dead or dying cells They are important for fighting infections They are also important for becoming immune Phagocytes are important in all animals and are very complex invertebrates One liter of human blood has about six billion phagocytes 

Their name comes from the Greek phagein to eat or devour and kutos hollow vessel Phagocytes were first seen in 1882 by Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov Phagocytes can be found in many animals Some amoebae behave like macrophages and scientists think macrophages evolved a long time ago 

Phagocytes of humans and other animals are called professional or non professional depending on how good they are at phagocytosis The professional phagocytes are neutrophils monocytes macrophages dendritic cells and mast cells The reason they are called professional phagocytes is because they have receptors on their surfaces that can detect harmful objects such as bacteria Phagocytes are very important in fighting infections and in getting rid of dead and dying cells

When there is an infection phagocytes move to the bacteria by sensing chemicals These chemicals may come from bacteria or from other phagocytes that are already there The phagocytes move by a way called chemotaxis When bacteria touch a phagocyte they bind to the receptors on the phagocyte and are eaten When bacteria enter some phagocytes the phagocytes use oxidants and nitric oxide to kill the pathogen After phagocytosis macrophages and dendritic cells can also do antigen presentation this is when the phagocyte moves parts of the killed bacteria back to its surface These parts are then shown to other cells of the immune system Some phagocytes then move to the bodys lymph nodes and show the bacterial parts to white blood cells called lymphocytes This action is important in getting immunity 

Many bacteria now have ways to not be eaten or killed by phagocytes

Hello I am requesting the SysOp tools as I think I can help the Simple English Wikipedia better with them

There has been a freqent backlog at RfD and I have closed the RfDs in the past However since I am not an admin I cannot delete pages So I have to wait for a admin to delete the page This takes a long time to do therefore defeating the purpose of closing the RfD in the first place One of the reasons I am after the tools is that I believe waiting for a admin to QD a RfDd page is merely a waste of time

Secondly I do a lot of new page patrol Sometimes this involves vandals I therefore would find it quicker if I had the tools to delete and block the vandals This way I can stop the vandals earier

Noble gas compounds are chemical compounds that have an element from Group 18 of the periodic table in them Group 18 contains all the noble gases 

For a long time scientists thought that noble gases could not form compounds because their valence electron shell had no space for more electrons This means that they could not accept any more electrons which made bonding impossible However in 1933 Linus Pauling said that heavy noble gases could react with fluorine or oxygen as they are the most electronegative atoms His prediction was correct and xenon hexafluoride was later discovered Many more noble gas compounds have been found since then

Noble gases can also make endohedral fullerene compounds when the noble gas atom is pushed inside a fullerene molecule In 1993 it was discovered that when C60 is put under pressure of about 3 bar of Helium or Neon HeC60 and NeC60 are made Only about one out of every 650000 C60 were found with a helium atom But with more pressures it is possible to get as much as 01 Endohedral molecules with argon krypton and xenon have also been made as well as other compounds of HeC60

Petrochemicals are chemical products that are made from petroleum natural gas or other hydrocarbons

Electronegativity symbol is a chemical property that says how well an atom can attract electrons towards itself It was first theorised by Linus Pauling in 1932 as part of his valence bond theory Pauling decided that his way of measuring attraction of electrons was to start with fluorine the most electronegative element and give it a value of 4 The electronegativity of all other elements would be determined by comparing them to fluorine

Pauling was one the first scientists to work in the fields of quantum chemistry molecular biology and orthomolecular medicine He is one of a small group of people to have been awarded more than one Nobel Prize and is one of only two people to receive them in different fields and the only person in that group to have been awarded each of his prizes without having to share it with another winner

Pauling was born and grew up in Oregon USA He went to Oregon Agricultural College and graduated in 1922 with a degree in chemical engineering Pauling then went to the California Institute of Technology where he received his Ph D in physical chemistry and mathematical physics in 1925 Two years later he became an assistant professor at a university called Caltech

In 1932 Pauling came up with the idea of electronegativity and made a scale that would help broken wikt linkpredictionpredict the chemical bonding Pauling kept doing this work while he also did work on the structure of the atomic broken wikt linknucleusnucleus 

In 1954 Pauling was given the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for work that he did on the structure of DNA This work led scientists in the UK to come up with the double helix of DNA 

During the Second World War Pauling worked on military research and development But after the war had ended he became worried about the making and future use of atomic weapons and with the destruction forced on the world by war Ava Helen Pauling Linuss wife was a broken wikt linkpacifistpacifist and in time he came to share her beliefs Pauling then began to talk about his worries with the effects of nuclear fallout and in 1962 was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work against above ground nuclear testing

Pauling was also an author and a teacher His first book The Nature of the Chemical Bond is still used today his introductory textbook General Chemistry Later in life he became an advocate for greatly increased consumption of vitamin C and other nutrients He generalized his ideas to define orthomolecular medicine which is still regarded as unorthodox by conventional medicine He popularized his concepts analyses research and insights in several successful but controversial books such as How to Live Longer and Feel Better in 1986

Pauling died of prostate cancer on August 19 1994 at 720 PM at home in Big Sur California He was 93 years old A grave marker for him is in Oswego Pioneer Cemetery in Lake Oswego Oregon

Pauling received numerous awards and honors during his career Following are awards and honors he has received 

Strabo was a Greek historian geographer and philosopher 

Strabo was born in a wealthy family from Pontus which had become part of the Roman Empire a short time before His mother was Georgian He studied under several geographers and philosophers Later he made long travels to Egypt and Kush among others It is not known when his Geography was written though comments within the work itself place the finished version within the reign of Emperor Tiberius 

Strabos History is nearly completely lost Although Strabo quotes it himself and other classical authors mention that it existed the only surviving document is a fragment of papyrus now in possession of the University of Milan

Several different dates have been proposed for Strabos death but most of them place it shortly after 23

Strabo is mostly famous for his 17 volume work Geographica which presented a descriptive history of people and places from different regions of the world known to his era It is an important source of information on the ancient world

A sensor is a device that measures a physical quantity and converts it into a signal which can be read by an observer or by an instrument For example a mercury thermometer converts the measured temperature into the expansion and contraction of a liquid which can be read on a calibrated glass tube

There are a lot of different types of sensors Sensors are used in everyday objects

A sensor that detects temperature Thermal sensors are found in many laptops and computers in order to sound an alarm when a certain temperature has been exceeded 

An electronic device used to measure a physical quantity such as pressure or loudness and convert it into an electronic signal of some kind

A motion sensor detects physical movement in a given area

Because of certain disadvantages of physical contact sensors newer technology non contact sensors have become prevalent in industry performing well in many applications The recent style of non contact sensors shows that Thin is In Market trends show that form and size are important Users are looking for smaller and more accurate sensors New technologies for the sensing chips are breaking application barriers For the future the trend will be to continue to provide smaller more affordable sensors that have the flexbility to fit even more applications in both industrial and commercial environments

Victory is when you win an argument war or test Many songs have been made called victory songs Victory often comes with a lot of emotion Victory is usually celebrated after winning although there are many times not to like after a war The term began to be used in Roman antiquity

In terms of human emotion being victorious usually brings strong feelings of gladness and in human behaviour often has movements and victory poses Victory dances and victory cries are quite similar to war dances and war cries that are done before the violence

A curse tablet or binding spell is a type of curse It could be found in all of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome Curse tablets were used to influence other people often the gods were asked to influence someone else or to do harm to them This would involve magic

Usually texts were scratched on very thin sheets of lead using a small writing These sheets would then be rolled up folded or pierced with nailsThey would then be moved under ground placed in graves or thrown into wells pools or lakes Sometimes they were put on temple walls Like an analogy the treatment done to the material should also be done to the target of the spell 

Some of the tablets contained love spells If they were used this way they had to be placed in the home of the desired person so that the spell could work 

About 1600 tablets have been found distributed over all the known lands in Antiquity About 600 of them were found in Greece 

Some of the spells were discovered together with small figures which have falsely been described as voodoo dolls The dolls or figurines were sometimes also pierced with nails The figurines looked like the target and often had both their feet and hands bound Not all curse tablets were made with lead Curses were also written on papyrus wax wood or other perishable materials but these are less likely to show up in the archaeological record

The texts on curse tablets are typically addressed to infernal or liminal gods such as Hermes Charon Hecate and Persephone Sometimes a sometimes a dead person had to mediate Some texts do not invoke the gods but merely list the targets of the curse the crimes or conditions when the curse is valid andor the intended ill to befall them Some tablets are inscribed with nothing more than the names of the targets Some people think that an oral spell may have accompanied the making of the curse

The text on the tablets were not always curses sometimes tablets wereused to help the dead Those whose grave sites these were placed at usually died at a very young age or in a violent manner and the tablet was supposed to help lay their souls to rest in spite of their untimely deaths The language of those texts that do give context is often concerned with justice either listing the targets crimes in great detail handing over responsibility for their punishment to the gods using indefinite grammar or conditional or even future conditionalFactdateFebruary 2007 Frequently such curse tablets are also inscribed with additional otherwise meaningless curse words such as Bazagra Bescu or Berebescu seemingly in order to lend them a kind of supernatural efficacy

Many of those discovered at Athens refer to court cases and curse the opposing litigant asking that he botch his performance in court forget his words become dizzy and so forth Others include erotic binding spells spells ranged against thieves and business and sporting rivals Those curse tablets targeted at thieves or other criminals may have been more public more acceptable some scholars even refuse to use the word curse of such positive texts preferring expressions such as judicial prayers

About 130 curse tablets have been found at Aquae Sulis where many of the curses related to thefts of clothes whilst the victim was bathing Over 80 more have similarly been discovered in and about the remains of a temple to Mercury nearby at West Hill Uley making south western Britain one of the major centres for finds of Latin defixiones

In Ancient Egypt so called Execration Texts appear around the time of the 12th Dynasty listing the names of enemies written on clay figurines or pottery which were then smashed and buried beneath a building under construction or in a cemetery

In baseball a hit is when a player who is trying to hit the ball that is thrown by the thrower hits the ball in such a way as to let him move forward at least one base

The pitcher throws the ball towards the batter standing at home plate who tries to hit the ball and score a run After the batter hits the ball he runs as fast as he can around the bases and tries to get to a base before he is called out by an umpire If he gets to a base before he is called out he is safe and the next batter comes forward and tries to hit a ball from the pitcher The old batter who is on base becomes a runner

There are other kinds of hits but these are the major ones These hits can be made by many ways For example a single can come from a hit that travelled along the ground or that travelled in the air A grounder can often be harder for the other team to stop than a fly ball This is because when it moves along the ground it has more chance of hitting bumps and the glove or foot of the other teams player than it does if it moves in the air There are also more ways in which hits can happen but these are the two major ways 

A no hitter is a form of game in which the other team does not even get a single hit during the whole game Because of the skill of the players a no hitter does not happen very often

A shutout is a baseball game where at least one team does not score any runs This is not always the same as a no hitter in which the team does not get any hits

The State Emblem of Pakistan was adopted in 1954 The emblems green colour and the star and crescent at the top are symbols of Islam the religion with which most Pakistani citizens identify In the center is a quartered shield with each quarter containing a major crop of Pakistan at the time of its adoption cotton jute tea and wheat The floral wreath around the shield is Jasmine represents the Mughal cultural heritage of Pakistan The scroll at the bottom contains the national motto in Urdu coined by Muhammad Ali Jinnah which reads from right to left Iman Ittehad Nazm translated as Faith Unity Discipline

The Qaum Tarna is the national anthem of Pakistan At independence on August 14 1947 Pakistan did not have a national anthem When the flag was hoisted at the independence ceremony it was accompanied by the song Pakistan Zindabad Azadi Paendabad The flag itself had only been approved by the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan three days earlier

The Himalayan Pit Viper Gloydius himalayanus is a medium sized gray brown snake found in caverns and rocky crevices of forested hill sides where it feeds on skinks and lizards The scale pattern consists of medial dark brown blotches alternating with lateral rows of spots

The Himalayan Pit Viper is a habitually sluggish snake that basks in sunlight and hibernates in winter

Chelonia mydas commonly known as the Green Turtle Myda Turtle or Green Sea Turtle is a large sea turtle belonging to the family Cheloniidae It is the only species in the genus Chelonia It is one of the seven marine turtles which are endangered

Although it might have some green on its broken wikt linkcarapacecarapace the green turtle is not green It gets its name from the fact that its body fat is green It can grow up to convert1mft0lkonabbron long and weigh up to convert160kglb0lkonabbron They are an endangered species especially in Florida and the Pacific coast of Mexico They can also be found in warm waters around the world and are found along the coast of 140 countries

The female turtle lays eggs in nests she builds in the sand on the beaches She uses the same beach that she was born on During the nesting season in summer she can make up to five nests She can lay as many as 135 eggs in a nest The eggs take about two months to hatch The baby turtles are about convert50mmin0lkonabbron in length

Green Turtles are omnivorous when they are young eating plants algae plankton and other small animals As they get older they become herbivorous eating only plants deciding to become vegetarians as they get older Their body fat is green because of all the plants they eat The edges of their jaws have many points like the edge of a saw Their jaws can rip off pieces of thick plants and the turtles can swallow the pieces whole

The numbers of Green Turtles around the world has dropped by more than half over the last 150 years The main reasons are hunting of turtles and the taking of their eggs Many turtles are killed when they get caught in fishing nets There is also a disease called fibropapillomatosis which is affecting them This disease which causes tumors to grow on the turtles face is probably caused by damage and pollution of their nesting beaches

Sabelianism is a position in Christian theology It is against to the idea of trinity but embraces Morpheus Sabellianism is also known as modalism modalistic monarchianism or modal monarchism Basically the teaching says that God has three masks and humans see him in three different ways but he is in fact only one 

Historic Sabellianism taught that God the Father was the only person of the Godhead a belief known as Monarchianism One author has described Sabellius teaching thus The true question therefore turns on this viz what is it which constitutes what we name person in the Godhead Is it original substantial essential to divinity itself Or does it belong to and arise from the exhibitions and developments which the divine Being has made of himself to his creatures The former Sabellius denied the latter he fully admitted 

Modalists say that the only number given to God in the Holy Bible is One Christian texts do not explicitley talk about God being three The number three is never mentioned in texts talking about God The number three is the number that is central to the word Trinity There is one text known as Comma Johanneum which may be an exception to this The comma Johanneum is a disputed text passage in First John The text is mainly known from the King James Version of the Bible and some versions of the Textus Receptus It is usually not included in modern critical texts Modalism has been mainly associated with Sabellius who taught a form of it in Rome in the third century 

Hippolytus of Rome knew Sabellius personally and mentioned him in the Philosophumena He knew Sabellius disliked Trinitarian theology but he said Modal Monarchism was the heresy of Noetos not that of Sabellius 

Christians in Cyrenaica liked Sabellianism and converted to it Demetrius Patriarch of Alexandria wrote many letters to them arguing against this belief

The primary critic was Tertullian who said that they crucified the Father 

It is important to note that our only sources available for our understanding of Sabellianism are from people who opposed it Scholars today do not agree what exactly Sabellius or Praxeus taught It is easy to think Tertullian and Hippolytus misrepresented the opinions of their opponents

Tertullian seems to suggest that the majority of believers at that time favoured the Sabellian view of the oneness of God Epiphanius about 375 AD notes that Sabellius still had many followers both in Mesopotamia and at Rome The second general council at Constantinople in 533 AD declared the baptism of Sabellius to be invalid which indicates that Sabellianism was still around

Sabellianism has been rejected by the majority of Christian churches in favour of Trinitarianism This was done through the Athanasian Creed which says that God is three distinct persons Each one of the three is equal to the others and eternal in the same way than the other two

Michael Servetus and Emanuel Swedenborg were scientists of the 16th and 17th century Some of the tests thy have written seem to suggest that they were in favor of Modalism Neither of the two describes God as appearing in three modes Both describe him as the One Divine Person Jesus Christ who has a Divine Soul of Love Divine Mind of Truth and Divine Body of Activity Jesus merged his human form with the divine By doing this he became entirely One with His Divine Soul from the Father in such a way that the persons could no longer be kept apart 

Oneness Pentecostalism teaches that the Father is united with Jesus as the Son of God However Oneness Pentecostalism is very different from Sabellianism because it rejects sequential modalismFactdateMay 2008 They also say that Jesus was just a normal man This directly opposes the idea that Jesus existed before he came to EarthSabellianism does not reject this idea 

Oneness Pentecostaliasm and Sabellianism can be compared ot each other because they are both Notrinitarian There are several differences between both positions though

It is difficult to find out what Sabellianism really taught because all that is left today are the texts of those who opposed it All of his original works were burned The following excerpts which demonstrate some of the known doctrinal characteristics of ancient Sabellians may be seen to compare with the doctrines in the modern Oneness movement

Tritheism is the belief that there are three distinct powerful gods who form a triad Generally three gods are believed to have separate powers and separate supreme beings or spheres of influence but working together In this respect tritheism differs from dualism which typically envisages two opposed Divine powers in conflict with one another

Ironically there is no group that claims to believe in or teach tritheism the term is solely used as an accusation against others somewhat similar to the usage of the word cult in accusing a group of holding an alternate or distorted view of the Christian doctrine of Trinity The main branches consider tritheism heretical

Relient K is an American band from Ohio Their music has been considered Pop punk and Christian rock They have released five studio albums and several EPS Their album The Bird and the Bee Sides was released in July 2 2008

There has been criticism about whether the band are in the Christian music genre Not all the songs mention God or focus on Christian faith Matt Theiseen has said we really dont care you can call us rock n roll or Christian rock or whatever and we can tour with this band or that band but at the end of the day were doing what we want and writing from our hearts

Relient K formed as a four member band back in 1998 At the time they were still attending high school The members have changed a little since then but the two Matthews are still there

The song Hoopes I did It Again from their third album may remind one of Britney Spears but its referring to Matt Hoopes last name In the song during the first verse the two Matts sing back to each other as if in a phone conversation

For their fourth album titled Mmhmm they added instruments like a banjo and another guitar player because they wanted more piano in their music and the addition of another guitar player made this possible for Matt It can be pronounced different ways and can also be written as MMHMM or MmHmm

Relient K is known for their brand of tongue in cheek humor Tongue in cheek meaning when words are said only half seriously They used this in many of their earlier songs such as Marilyn Manson Ate My Girlfriend Nancy Drew and May the Horse Be With You

Their second album was indeed titled The Anatomy of the Tongue in Cheek although you could argue the third album used more humor

Hieronymus Bosch was an early Dutch painter He lived worked and died in s Hertogenbosch a Dutch town This was then the capital of the Duchy of Brabant a region which included much of modern Belgium and Holland

Many of his works depict temptation sin and punishment in hell The paintings have a dreamlike surreal quality with sexual and sadistic images The intent was probably serious to warn of the punishment which awaited sinners in hell

The paintings often look like and certainly did influence the modern art movement known as surrealism Bosch used images of demons half human animals and machines to evoke fear and confusion and to portray the evil of man His works contain complex highly original imaginative and dense use of symbolic figures and iconography some of which was obscure even in his own time

Today only 25 paintings are known to be by him Philip II of Spain collected some of the best which are now in the Prado Museum Madrid

Docetism is an early Christian teaching that says that Jesus only appeared to have a human body The term comes from dokein to seem 

Early Gnostics whose teachings began to threaten Christian doctrine and theology believed all matter was unclean For this reason Christ could not have a physical body as he was seen as the eternal Logos 

Today it is unclear where this teaching came from It might have been influenced by the teachings of Plato Platon taught that only ideas mattered and that matter itself was inferior 

Many Gnostic teachings are docetic For a long time people believed that docetism and Gnosticism were developed together This is however not the case there are also some Gnost systems that are not docetic as well as some docetic systems that are not gnostic 

Today most Christian theolgians see docetism as a heresy

Road game better known as an away game is a reference to all cities and stadiaarenasfieldsvenues where an athletic team plays games for which they are not the host 

Parqus is the Colombian board game The game is similar to those in the Cross and Circle family The game is described as a random thinking one the moves depend on the roll of the dice but players must consider possible strategies before executing their move The objective of the game is to advance all the pieces to the end

Parqus is the Colombian version of Pachisi which originated in India Although it could be argued that the game comes from Spain due to the similarity between both games there is wide agreement in Colombia that the game is completely Colombian Parqus stems directly from Pachisi in the same way as Parcheesi Parchs or Ludo There is no proof to the claim that it stems from a country other than India Moreover no Parqus game is played in any other Latin American countries neither the world

Parqus is a mixture of the original Indian game and the influences of local Colombian culture Other Colombian variations also exist

In Colombia people from all parts of the country play the game it is very popular played by both children and adults Adults usually play the game by betting money on the first piece on capturing pieces or on winning the game to make gameplay more interesting There are boards for 4 6 and 8 players The boards usually contain pictures of soccer teams singers actors or other cultural figures on the jail boxes

The board itself is usually placed on a box covered by glass The use of glass is to allow dice to be thrown more easily There are versions of the board that are made from paper to make it portable

Parqus is played with two dice two to eight players can compete in the same match depending on what type of game board is used Each player is given four pieces and uses a specific colour The most common colours are red blue yellow and green usually arranged in that order The game can also be played with fewer than four pieces

The jail box is where the pieces are placed at the beginning of the match and is where they go whenever an opponent captures them The player throws the dice three times and attempts to get a pair in order to free the pieces Rolling different pairs or doubles allows more pieces to be freed 

When the pieces are freed they are placed in a special box next to the jail This box is called Home or Salida 

If a player does not roll any pairs during his turn he passes the dice to the player on his right Otherwise he frees the pieces and wins an extra turn to move them He throws again and must move the values of the dice with his pieces 

For example

The player rolls 5 3

After he makes his move he must pass his turn to the player on the right

The pieces cannot advance backwards and they cannot be in any of the four boxes before their Home box 

Each player can throw the dice once There are some exceptions to this rule

The player can capture an opponents piece by placing his own piece on the same box as the other players piece However he cannot capture a piece that is on a SAFE or a HOME box Capturing in Colombia is called eating

However the player can capture pieces on his HOME box When he frees any piece from jail the pieces placed on his HOME are captured that is sent to its jail losing all their advances

The player can avoid capturing the piece On that case an opponent has to accuse him and the piece that did not capture must go to jail If nobody notices nothing happens

There are three types of special boxes

In sports home is a term meaning both the city and stadium arena or field where an athletic team plays games at their own venue

The waggle dance is a special figure of eight dance that is done by the honey bee in its hive By this a worker tells the others where it has found nectar This was shown by the Austrian ethologist Karl von Frisch

The dance is a type of communication for bees It is done to give other bees information about the direction and distance to flowers that have nectar or pollen or both It is also used to tell the bees where water can be found

The dance is used for bees to get others to help them collect resources for the hive It used to be thought that bees have two distinct recruitment dances There were the round dances and waggle dances Round dances were thought to be used for things that were close by and wiggle dances were for things farther away It is now known that a round dance is only a waggle dance with a very short waggle run  

A waggle dance is made up of one to 100 or more circuits Each circuit has two phases These phases are the waggle phase and the return phase When a bee returns to the hive after finding a good food source it performs the dance The bee will run through a small wave like pattern After this it will turn to the right and circle back to the starting point It will then do another waggle run and then turn to the left and circle back to the beginning The waggle phase of the dance is the most notable and informative part of the dance 

The direction and duration of waggle runs show the direction and distance to flowers Flowers that are located directly in line with the sun are shown by waggle runs in an upward direction on the vertical combs If the flowers are at an angle to the right or left of the sun the waggle run is done at the same angle to the upward direction The distance between hive and flowers is shown in the duration of the waggle runs The farther the flowers are from the hive the longer the waggle phase For every 100 meters the flowers are distant from the hive the waggle phase lasts about 75 milliseconds

People study the swarm intelligence of social insects and animals such as fish birds and ants Recently there has been research on using bee waggle dance behavior for fault tolerant routing From the abstract of Wedde Farooq and Zhang

Another technique based on bees is called bee colony optimization It is used help Internet servers communicate better

Hernando de Soto is an economist from Peru He has become known for what he wrote and said on the Informal economy and property rights 

In his books de Soto says that an economy cannot go past the stage of a subsistence economy if there is not a formal system of owning property Developing countries have informal ownership since no formal certificate says that land or goods really belong to a certain person

De Soto thinks the capitalist economies of the United States developed because they had a clear system of owning property For the United States the formal system of owning property came from it being a colony of England Japans formal system came after the Second World War

Because formal ownership systems do not exist in developing countries the poor people in these nations cannot develop They cannot use their land as a guarantee to the bank to get money to build something for example De Soto argues that this is the basis for enterpreneurship In much of the developing worldfamers therefore are left with subsistence agriculture As such he argues that this informal ownership should be made formal for example by giving squatters in shanty towns land titles to the land they now live on

De Soto also argues that government bureaucracy greatly hinders the ability for people to hold private property for example

Thus entrepreneurs are driven to form underground economies but de Soto points out the serious disadvantages

Hernando de Soto was a Spanish explorer and conquistador He lead the first European expedition deep into the territory of the modern day United States and was probably the first European to discover the Mississippi River

The expedition was looking for gold and for a way to China They explored the southern United States De Soto died in 1542 on the banks of the Mississippi River at present day Lake Village Arkansas Hernando de Soto was born to parents who were hidalgos in Extremadura a region of poverty and hardship from which many young people looked for ways to seek their fortune elsewhere His parents were poor too Two towns Badajoz and Jerez de los Caballeros claim to be his birthplace All that is known with certainty is that he spent time as a child at both places In his will he wanted to be buried at Jerez de los Caballeros where other members of his family were also buried The age of the Conquerors came on the heels of the Spanish reconquest of the Iberian peninsula from Islamic forces Spain and Portugal were filled with young men begging for a chance to find military fame after the Moors were defeated With discovery of new lands to the West the whispers of glory and wealth were too compelling for the poor

De Soto sailed to the New World in 1514 with the first Governor of Panama Pedrarias Dvila Brave leadership unwavering loyalty and clever schemes for the extortion of native villages for their captured chiefs became De Sotos hallmark during the Conquest of Central America He gained fame as an excellent horseman fighter and tactician but was notorious for the extreme brutality with which he wielded these gifts

During that time Juan Ponce de Len who discovered Florida Vasco Nez de Balboa who discovered the Pacific and Ferdinand Magellan who first sailed that ocean to the Orient profoundly influenced De Sotos ambitions

The leaves of beech trees are smooth with light hairs and with a smooth or slightly toothed edge they are from 515 cm long and 410 cm broad The flowers are small and single sex the female flowers are carried in pairs the male flowers are wind pollinating catkins produced in spring shortly after the new leaves appear The bark is smooth and light grey The fruit is a small sharply threeangled nut 1015 mm long borne singly or in pairs in soft spined husks 1525 cm long known as cupules The nuts are edible though bitter with a high tannin content and are called beechnuts or beechmast

Beech grows on a wide range of soil types acid or basic provided they are not wet for long periods The tree canopy casts a heavy shade shade and the leaves when dropped cover the ground thickly Few plant grow under beech trees

In North America they often form Beech Maple forests by growing together with the Sugar Maple

The beech has been used for its wood by man for thousands of years The wood is white or reddish if grown on acid soil but fine grained smooth and heavy when first cut It may split as it dries It is a good wood for making ornaments tool handles kitchen utensils furniture and parts of buildings Beechwood burns well and is used among other woods to smoke herrings in Scotland It can also be made into charcoal

The southern beeches Nothofagus previously thought closely related to beeches are now treated as members of a separate family Nothofagaceae They are found in Australia New Zealand New Guinea New Caledonia Argentina and Chile

The beech blight aphid is a common pest of beech trees Beeches are also used as food plants by some species of butterflies and moths

The Fagales are an order of flowering plants including some of the best known trees The order name is derived from genus Fagus Beeches They belong among the rosid group of dicotyledons The families currently included are as follows

Bioethics is a field of ethics in philosophy that studies the ethical legal and social issues in medicine and biology It is often used to study how the new discoveries in science will affect humans animals and nature

Caricaceae is a family of flowering plants in the order Brassicales found in tropical regions of Central and South America and Africa They are short lived evergreen pachycaul shrubs or small trees growing to 510 m tall many bear edible fruit

The family comprises five genera and about species

Pollen is a powder made of pollen grains which produce sperm cells of seed plants The pollen grains are actually haploid male gametophytes

The anther contains microsporangia Each microsporangium contains pollen mother cells These undergo meiosis and produce pollen grains which contain the male gametes

The pollen is released by the opening of the anther The pollen is carried by some agent to the receptive surface of the carpel of the same or another flower This process is known as pollination After successful pollination the pollen grain completes its development by growing a pollen tube and undergoing mitosis to produce two male gametes

There are two main kinds of pollination One kind happens when pollen from a stamen sticks to the pistil of the same plant That is self pollination

The other kind of pollination takes place when pollen from one plant travels to the pistil of another plant Most plants use this kind of pollination Plants need help for this kind of pollination because they cannot move So they need another way to move pollen from one plant to another plant

The wind helps move pollen between plants The pollen of some plants is very light Wind blows it from the flowers on one plant to the flowers on another plant The wind can move pollen a long way before the pollen hits the sticky top of a pistil

Animals also help move pollen between plants Many flowers are colourful and their scent attracts some animals These flowers also make a sweet juice called nectar Sometimes an animal such as a bee sees or smells a flower Then it lands on the flower to get nectar As the bee drinks the nectar the stamens brush pollen onto its body Then the bee flies to another flower that has a pistil The pollen on the bees body brushes onto the sticky top of the flowers pistil The pollen is used as protein for the bee larvae

The plants help feed the animal In return the animal helps the plants by moving pollen from flower to flower The relationship has evolved together it is a kind of co evolution called mutualism or symbiosis

I would like to convey my heartfelt appreciation to all the people for their contribution to implementing the project I sincerely hope that this multi million Taka project which is a national asset will be used and maintained for the overall betterment of the common people of Bangladesh We strongly hope that the Lalon Shah Bridge will long be remembered as an important symbol of eternal friendship between our two countries HE Mr Matsushiro Horiguchi Ambassador of Japan said at the inauguration ceremony

The completion of Lalon Shah Bridge will not only strengthen the economical cultural and social unity of the Bangladeshi people who are divided by major rivers but also facilitate trade with India and Nepal Especially as concerns trade with inland Nepal it is expected that better access to Mongla Port will lead to the establishment of an international transportation system Economic ties between Bangladesh and Nepal will then be further strengthened says Mr Shinozawa JBIC Governor JBIC will continue to support the Government of Bangladesh s efforts through the financing of economic infrastructure projects or assistance in structural reforms to achieve the countrys national objective of poverty alleviation through accelerated economic growth the message continued 

The bridge will have an immense socio economic impact on Bangladesh by providing a fixed road link with west and southwest Bangladesh Improved communication through free movement of goods and passengers both within Bangladesh and from neighboring countries like India and Nepal will be facilitated greatly The bridge is to promote easier access to Mongla Port to expedite enhanced cargo handling

It is mention worthy that Lalon Shah Bridge enjoys some of the records such as the deepest concrete piles in the world and the longest continuous segmental deck in the world erected by using the balanced cantilever technique The earthquake protection devices are some of the largest in the world as are the bridge bearings and expansion joints

The brothers made another movie in 1996 with a little money The name was Fargo and it was universally praised They returned to Minnesota because the story takes place there and in North Dakota The story is about a man who needs money to start his own business so he pays other men to kidnap his wife and plans to ask his rich father in law for the ransom Everything goes wrong and a series of violent events starts Experts say the movie was very good because of the dialog used by the actors and Frances McDormands performance She won the Best Actress Oscar The brothers alwa won Best Original Screenplay and the Palme dOr for Best Directing for a second time

Albert Bitzius was a Swiss novelist and pastor He is probably more famous by his pen name Jeremias Gotthelf He was born in Murten where his father was pastor

In 1804 the home was moved to Utzenstorf a village in the Bernese Emmental Bitzius gew up there and received his early education Healso had to help his father to cultivate his glebe In 1812 he went to complete his education at Bern and in 1820 was received as a pastor In 1821 he visited the University of Gttingen but returned home in 1822 to act as his fathers assistant When his father died in 1824 he went to Herzogenbuchsee as a priest In 1829 he went to Bern Early in 1831 he went to help the old pastor of the village of Ltzelflh in the Upper Emmenthal In 1832 he was chosen as his successor He married one of his granddaughters in 1833 He spent the rest of his life there leaving three children

His first work the Bauernspiegel appeared in 1837 It claimed to be the life of Jeremias Gotthelf narrated by himself and this name was later adopted by the author as his pen name It is a living picture of Bernese village life true to nature and not attempting to gloss over its defects and failings It is written in German but contains expressions from the Bernese dialect of the Emmenthal Unlike Auerbach Bitzius was not a peasant by birth but belonged to the educated classes He reproduces what he had seen and learnt and not what he had himself personally experienced The book was a great success as it was a picture of real life and not of fancifully beribboned eighteenth century villagers

His best known work is without doubt the short novel Die Schwarze Spinne a semi allegorical tale of the plague in form of the titular monster that devastates a Swiss valley community first as a result of a pact with the devil born out of need and a second time due to the moral decay that releases the monster from its prison again

Among his later tales are the Leiden und Freuden eines Schulmeisters Uli der Knecht with its continuation Uli der Pchter Anne Bbi Jowger Kthi die Gromutter Die Kserei in der Vehfreude and the Erlebnisse eines Schuldenbauers He also published several volumes of shorter tales

One slight drawback to some of his writings is the echo of local political controversies for Bitzius was a Whig and strongly opposed to the Radical party in the canton which carried the day in 1846

He died on October 22 1854 in Ltzelflh in Canton of Bern

Lives by C Manuel in the Berlin edition of Bitziuss works and by J Ammann in vol i of time Sammlung Bernischer Biographien His works were issued in 24 vols at Berlin 1856 1861 while 10 vols giving the original text of each story were issued at Bern 1898 1900

An alcoholic drink is a drink that contains alcohol In chemistry there is a whole class of substances known as alcohols The alcohol used in alcoholic drinks is known as ethanol or grain alcohol Grain alcohol is generally made through a process called fermentation In fermentation bacteria change sugar to make ethanol or vinegar Other kinds of alcohol are usually harmful to drink so the only kind of alcohol used in alcoholic drinks is grain alcohol Since most people do not have to use any other kind of alcohol except ethanol they will use the word alcohol to mean only ethanol Sometimes people also use the world alcohol to talk about any drink containing ethanol such as whiskey vodka or gin

Fermenting grain can only make a drink that is 20 alcohol To get higher amounts of alcohol in drinks distillation is used This allows to get substances that are made of alcohol to about 80 85 

Generally alcoholic drinks are divided into three classes

Most countries limit the sale of the different kinds of alcohol Usually there are two limits one for wines and beers and the other for distilled alcoholic drinks 

Alcopops are very sweet and usually do not contain much alcohol but many governments make it illegal to buy them in certain places or at certain times because they have distilled alcohol mixed into them They are controversial because some people think that they might be popular among children who are too young to drink

Drinking ethanol causes a person to feel relaxed Ethanol is very commonly used and has been made by humans for thousands of years It is one of the oldest and most used recreational drug in the world People may overuse it for the same reason this results in alcoholism Alcoholic drinks can be dangerous If a person drinks a lot of alcohol they become intoxicated meaning that they get drunk People who are drunk may do or say strange things may not be able to control themselves The amount of alcohol that it takes to get somebody is drunk is different from person to person All alcohols are toxic but ethanol is less toxic because the human body can break it down quickly Some strong alcohol can also cause intoxication and impairment

Lee has been classically trained in piano for 9 years and uses simple chords with left hand backing in songs She often includes the piano as a main or background instrument into the bands music most prominently in the album The Open Door Several music critics consider the piano accompaniment as a characteristic feature of Evanescences music Lee often plays the piano during live performances in selected songs and has been known to cover songs on the piano as well such the Korn song Thoughtless She can play the acoustic guitar and has been training in harp lightly utilizing this instrument in the bands third record most prominently in the song Secret Door

Heraclitus of Ephesus was a pre Socratic Greek philosopher a native of Ephesus Ionia on the coast of Asia Minor 

Heraclitus is famous for his doctrine of change being central to the universe His famous sayings All is flux and You cannot step twice into the same river is still remembered today

He believed in the unity of opposites stating that the path up and down are one and the same existing things being characterized by pairs of contrary properties and other explorations of the concept of dualism His cryptic utterance that all things come to be in accordance with this Logos has been the subject of numerous interpretations

Diogenes states that Heraclitus work was a continuous treatise On Nature but was divided into three discourses one on the universe another on politics and a third on theology Theophrastus says some parts of his work are half finished while other parts make a strange medley

Diogenes also tells us that Heraclitus deposited his book as a dedication in the great temple of Artemis the Artemisium one of the largest temples of the 6th century BCE and one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World 

Ancient temples were regularly used for storing treasures and were open to private individuals under exceptional circumstances Many subsequent philosophers in this period refer to the work

Gorgias Greek sophist pre socratic philosopher and rhetorician was a native of Leontini in Sicily Along with Protagoras he forms the first generation of Sophists Several doxographers report that he was a pupil of Empedocles although he would only have been a few years younger

Sophism can mean two very different things In Ancient Greece sophism was practiced by sophists who were a group of teachers of philosophy and rhetoric In the modern definition a sophism is a confusing or slightly incorrect argument used for deceiving someone The word sophism originated from the Greek word sophisma The similar Greek word sophists means wise ist one who does wisdom one who makes a business out of wisdom while sophs means a wise man

The ancient Greek philosopher Protagoras is often said to be the first of the sophists Others include Gorgias Prodicus Hippias Thrasymachus Lycophron Callicles Antiphon and Cratylus

In modern usage sophism sophist and sophistry are derogatory terms due the influence of many philosophers in the past Sophism and platonism were rival schools as enemies of each other

A sophism is a statement to deceive someone in a debate or conversation It might be made to seem to make sense when really being wrong or it might use difficult words and complicated sentences to intimidate the audience into agreeing An argument ad hominem is an example of sophistry

A sophist is a person who uses sophisms Sophistry means using sophisms for subtly deceptive reasoning or argumentation

Protagoras was a pre Socratic Greek philosopher and is numbered as one of the sophists by Plato the Greek philosopher who followed Socrates In Platos dialogue Protagoras he credits Protagoras with having invented the role of the professional sophist or teacher of virtue

A pirate code is a code of conduct for pirates Some of these codes are fictional and some historical 

In the second half of the 17th century buccaneers started following rules These rules had many different names including Chasse Partie Charter Party Custom of the Coast or Jamaica Discipline Eventually they became known as Articles of Agreement or the pirates code These changed from one captain to another Sometimes they were different from one voyage to another These rules included punishments for rule breakers and how much treasure each crew member would receive

Each crew member signed the articles After the rules were signed they were then posted in a common place often the door of the grand cabin

There are three known sets of these rules that still exist today Most of these come from Charles Johnsons A General History of the Pyrates Part of a code from Henry Morgan is written in Alexandre Exquemelins book The Buccaneers of America Very few of these rules still exist today because often pirates burned the papers before being caught They did this to prevent these papers from being used against them

One of the most famous sets of pirate rules was written by the famous Welsh pirate Bartholomew Roberts in 1720

X The captain and quartermaster to receive two shares of a prize the master boatswain and gunner one share and a half and other officers one and quarter

XI The musicians to have rest on the Sabbath Day but the other six days and nights none without special favour

Stigmata are marks on a persons body that are like the marks Jesus got from being crucified But they supposedly happen to other religious people like Saint Francis of Assisi not just Jesus The marks include nail holes in the hands and feet just as if the person had been crucified but without being crucified Those who believe say that actual nails were not used The holes just appear as a miracle Those who do not believe say it is not a miracle They have other ways to explain how those stories get started

The flag of Turkmenistan was adopted on January 24 2001 It is often described as the most detailed national flag in the world 

It features a green field with a vertical red stripe near the hoist side containing five carpet guls stacked above two crossed olive branches similar to those on the flag of the United Nations a white waxing crescent moon typical of Turkic symbology and five white five pointed stars appear in the upper corner of the field just to the fly side of the red stripe

The green and red colors appear in this flag because they have been venerated historically by the Turkmen The waxing crescent moon symbolizes the hope of the country for a shining future and the stars represent the five provinces of Turkmenistan Ahal Balkan Dashhowuz Lebap and Mary

The five traditional carpet designs along the hoist represent the five major tribes or houses and form motifs in the countrys state emblem and flag These Turkmen tribes in traditional order are Teke Yomut Arsary Chowdur and Saryk The Salyr a tribe that declined as a result of military defeat before the modern period are not represented nor are several smaller tribes or subtribes

The wreath is one of the odder parts of the flag added against the rules of heraldry and breaking up the carpet pattern It was added as an afterthought to represent the status of permanent neutrality which was accepted by the United Nations General Assembly on December 12 1995

Philolaus was a Greek Pythagorean and Presocratic He argued that all matter is composed of limited and unlimited things and that the universe is determined by numbers He is credited with originating the theory that the earth was not the center of the universe

The coat of arms of Turkmenistan was created after Turkmenistan gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 The eight point green starburst with golden edges features in its center a red circular disc which carries sheaves of wheat five carpet guls and centered upon that a smaller blue circle with a lifelike depiction of an Akhal Teke horse a source of pride for the Turkmen people A variant of the emblem which included different colors and rounded was used from 1992 until 2003 

The five traditional carpet motifs on the red disc represent the five major tribes or houses and stand for the traditional and religious values of the country These Turkmen tribes in traditional order are Teke Yomut Arsary Chowdur and Saryk The Salyr a tribe that declined as a result of military defeat before the modern period are not represented nor are several smaller tribes or subtribes 

The green and red colors appear in this shield because they have been venerated historically by the Turkmen The central elements are surrounded by sheaves of wheat that allude to the custom to welcome to guests with salt and bread Atop the wheat and the red circle appear a waxing crescent moon of white typical of Turkic symbology and five five pointed stars also of white The waxing crescent moon symbolizes the hope of the country for a shining future and the stars represent the five provinces of Turkmenistan Ahal Balkan Dashhowuz Lebap and Mary Most of the elements of the coat of arms are present in the national flag

Before independence from the USSR Turkmenistan had a coat of arms similar to all other Soviet Republics A single carpet gul not matching any of the tribal patterns was represented on the Coat of arms of the Turkmen SSR

The Tooth fairy is a fictional character found in modern folklore 

Around the world families have many different traditions to celebrate the loss of a childs tooth especially a first tooth Many of the traditions involve throwing a tooth on a roof under a house burying it under a tree or leaving it for a rodent 

One of the most famous traditions is leaving a tooth under a pillow for the Tooth Fairy This tradition is very popular in the United States as well as other countries The Tooth Fairy will take the tooth away while the child is sleeping and leave some money in its place Sometimes the Tooth Fairy may also leave a note If the child does not go to sleep the Tooth Fairy will not come

Some people believe that the Tooth Fairy is named Fatina and lives in Neverland along with Tinkerbell The belief is that Fatina creates a magic powder from childrens teeth that protects the fairies from hawks who might otherwise eat them

BBC Weather is the BBCs department in charge of preparing and broadcasting weather forecasts and is now part of BBC News The broadcast meteorologists are employed by the Met Office The longest serving presenter of BBC weather was Michael Fish now retired who appeared for 30 years between 1974 and 2004 

The first BBC weather forecast was a shipping forecast read on the radio for the Met Office on 14 November 1922 The first daily weather forecast was broadcast 26 March 1923 

In 1936 the BBC experimented with the worlds first weather maps on television Weather maps were first published in The Times on 1 April 1875 The BBC started broadcasting the maps in 1949 after World War II The map filled the whole TV screen and an off screen narrator would comment on the next days weather

On 11 January 1954 George Cowling was the first weather forecaster to stand in front of a weather map To do this the maps were drawn by hand in the London Weather Centre and were taken across London The forecasts were presented by the same person who had made them and were not always right

In 1962 a fax machine and an electronic computer were bought by the Met Office This gave better and quicker forecasting 

Satellite photography was available from 1964 but was of a poor quality and was given on paper with the coastline etched in felt tip pen This did not change until 1973 when a new computer was bought This made forecasts twice as accurate as earlier ones

As computational capability improved so did graphics technology Early hand drawn maps gave way to magnetic symbols which in turn gave way to bluescreen computer generated imagery technology each of which allowed the presenter greater control over the information displayed

Early magnetic symbols tended to adhere poorly to the maps and occasional spelling errors marred some broadcasts but allowed the presenter to show how weather would change over time The symbols were designed to be self explicit allowing the viewer to understand the map without a key or legend

These were phased out in 1985 for computer graphics although the basic design of symbols was kept the same These forecasts were widely acclaimed for their simplicity winning an award from the Royal Television Society

Possibly the most famous of the forecasters is the now retired Michael Fish Famous for his informal manner and eccentric dress sense he was a viewer favourite despite an unfortunate comment before The Great Storm of 1987

During a weather forecast some hours before the storm Michael Fish started his forecast with the now famous line 

Although he was actually referring to a Florida hurricane and went on to forecast stormy conditions over the South of England the statement has gone down in popular culture as one of the worst mistakes made so publicly

On 2 October 2000 BBC Weather underwent a more significant change Whilst there was not much change to the existing weather symbols new symbols giving information Pollen and Sun levels were introduced A new more detailed map of Britain was used based on satellite data

16 May 2005 saw the end of the weather symbols on television after 29 years and 9 months on air They were replaced by a controversial format as the forecast underwent another redesign with the flat map replaced by a 3D globe and weather conditions shown by coloured areas Cloud cover is indicated by the brightness of the map while rain and snow are indicated by animated blue and white areas respectively

The graphics are provided by Weatherscape XT which was developed by the commercial arm of the New Zealand Metservice 

The move polarised opinion some saw it as more accurate and modern while others disliked the brown colour chosen for the landmass and the presumed high cost of the graphics Poor angling of the map in order to show the curvature of the Earth led to Scotland appearing little larger than Devon and Shetland being almost invisible while exaggerating London and the South East This led to many Scottish commentators claiming the BBC was guilty of a London bias As a result the map was realigned and the moving tour of the UK was lengthened

The new look won a prestigious Silver Award at the PromaxBDA Awards in 2006 Criticism has been ongoing however with some viewers complaining about the colour scheme and of a lack of detail beyond 36 hours

There have been continuous developments since May 2005 In 2006 a rippling effect was introduced to define seas and oceans

The BBC Weather website provides outlook weather forecasts for UK and international locations using animated symbols and a format similar in design to that used for the televised broadcasts

The website also runs frequent special features about seasonal sports White Christmas nature and meteorological science It also has world weather UK outlook and weather news A new beta weather site is currently being developed to fit in with the rest of the BBC site style

Strychnine is a very toxic colorless crystalline alkaloid It is very poisonous the LD50 is about 10 mg Strychnine is soluble in alcohol and chloroform but not in water

Strychnine can act as a stimulant much like caffeine It is on the list of substances tested for doping in sports

The substance was used as a pesticide especially for killing small vertebrates such as birds and rodents Strychnine causes muscular convulsions It leads to death through asphyxia or exhaustion The most common source is from the seeds of the Strychnos nux vomica tree Strychnine is one of the most bitter substances known Its taste is detectable in concentrations as low as 1 ppm

Between 30 and 120mg can kill an adult human Strychnine is rapidly absorbed by Mucous membranes If its given under the skin or intravenously a quantity of 15 mg may be enough to kill an adult Benzodiazepines are used by default for emergency treatment 

Unlike the illustrations given in fiction crime novels Strychnine is not very good for killing someone This is because even diluted at 1130000 it can still be tasted Despite this some murders happened with Strychnine Thomas Neill Cream a serial killer used it on some of his victims 

Strychnine acts as a blocker or antagonist at the inhibitory or strychnine sensitive glycine receptor a ligand gated chloride channel in the spinal cord and the brain

Although it is best known as a poison small doses of strychnine were once used in medications as a stimulant a laxative and as a treatment for other stomach ailments A 1934 drug guide for nurses described it as among the most valuable and widely prescribed drugs Strychnines stimulant effects also led to its use historically for enhancing performance in sports Because of its high toxicity and tendency to cause convulsions the use of strychnine in medicine was eventually abandoned once safer alternatives became available 

The dosage for medical use was cited as between 160th grain110th grain which is between 11 milligrams and 64 milligrams in modern measures Normally the maximum dosage used was 32 mg half of a full dose A lethal dose was cited as 12 a grain but people have been known to die from as little as 5 mg of strychnine

Alkaloids are chemical compounds that can be made naturally They contain basic nitrogen atoms The name comes from the word alkaline and was used to describe any alkaline containing nitrogen Alkaloids are made by a large variety of organisms such as bacteria fungi plants and animals and are part of the group of natural products Many alkaloids can be broken wikt linkpurificationpurified from basic substances by acid base extraction Many alkaloids are toxic to other organisms Some alkaloids have a bitter taste

Quinine is an alkaloid which can reduce fever work against malaria pain and swelling The bark of the Chinona family of trees contains Quinine Quinine can be made artificially but this is more expensive than extracting it from the bark of the tree 

Quinine was the first treatment for Malaria from about the 17th century Even today Quinine is used to treat certain forms of Malaria when other drugs fail or are unavailable In that way Quinine is currently one of the best treatments for Malaria tropica which is caused by plasmodium falciparum For the other forms of Malaria Quinine is no longer used as other drugs have replaced it 

Quinine relaxes muscles and was used by the Incas of Peru to stop people from shivering Europeans first reported using quinine against malaria in Rome in 1631  However indians may have used it earlier

The best type of quinine used to treat malaria was found by Charles Marie de La Condamine in 1737 Quinine helped Europeans colonize Africa A historian said that it was quinine that gave colonists fresh opportunities to swarm into the Gold Coast Nigeria and other parts of west Africa

Quinine can cause cinchonism and even death in some cases Quinine can make someone paralyzed if it is injected into a nerve It is very toxic in overdose

Quinine has a bitter taste It was first added to drinks like Bitter Lemon and Tonic Water Both of these drinks originally came from Africa There Quinine was added to have some protection against Malaria In China it is sometimes added to drugs against the Common cold Quinine is also often used to add a bitter taste to food Usually this has to be declared though Quinine can also stimulate the muscles of the uterus For this reason pregnant women should not take too much of it Sometimes it is used in combination with Heroin

Progressive bluegrass is a type of bluegrass music which became popular in the 1960s and 1970s The four important elements of progressive bluegrass are instrumentation songs imported or styles imitated from other musical genres non traditional chord progressions and lengthy jam band style improvisation

Chirality is when an object is present in two forms which are mirror images of each other

The two forms cannot be superimposed Human hands are chiral The left hand is a mirror image of the right hand You cannot turn or move one of your hands to look exactly the same as the other This is why you can not put a left handed glove on your right hand or shake the right hand of a person using your left hand 

In chemistry chirality refers to molecules If a molecule is chiral it has two forms that are mirror images of each other but otherwise identical 

Chemists call these enantiomers or optical isomers Because the difference between right and left hands is easy to understand chemists call enantiomers either right or left handed A mixture of equal amounts of the two enantiomers is called a racemic mixture 

Molecular chirality is quite common It is found in stereochemistry inorganic chemistry organic chemistry physical chemistry and biochemistry

The symmetry of a molecule tells us whether it is chiral A molecule is achiral if it has an axis of symmetry

Many biologically active molecules are chiral including amino acids and sugars Most of these compounds are of the same chirality Most amino acids are L and sugars are D Proteins made of L amino acids are known as left handed proteins whereas D amino acids produce right handed proteins

The origin of this homochirality in biology is the subject of much debate Most scientists believe that the original origin of chiralities was purely random They think if carbon based life forms exist elsewhere in the universe the chemistry could theoretically have opposite chirality Other theories are possible

Enzymes which are chiral usually only work with one enantiomer of a chiral substrate Imagine an enzyme as having a glove like cavity that binds a substrate If this glove is right handed then one enantiomer will fit inside and be bound whereas the other enantiomer will have a poor fit and is unlikely to bind

It was economical for life forms to adopt one form or the other of each type of chiral compound That way we do not need two enzymes for every chemical reaction which involves chirality

In graphics superimposition is when an image or video is put on top of an already existing image or video This is usually done to add to the overall image effect or to hide something 

This technique is used in cartography to produce photomaps by superimposing grid lines contour lines and other linear or textual mapping features over aerial photographs

Superimposition of 2D images containing correlated periodic grid structures may produce moir patterns Superimposition of two correlated layers comprising parallel lines or curves may give rise line moir patterns The movement of one of the layers results in a faster movement of the line moir superimposition image Such optical acceleration is known as moir speedup When superimposing two identical layers comprising randomly spaced parallel lines at a small angle or with a small scaling difference random line moir patterns namely line Glass patterns appear Similarly when superimposing two identical layers of randomly scattered dots at a small angle or with a small scaling difference random dot Glass patterns namely random dot moir appears When one of the layers embeds complex shapes such as sequences of symbols forming a text and another layer contains parallel lines or curves the superimposition image may gives rise to magnified shapes called shape moir patterns

Aristotle believed that an ignoratio elenchi is a mistake made by a questioner while attempting to falsify a respondents argument He called it an ignorance of what makes for a refutation For Aristotle ignoratio elenchi amounts to ignorance of logic In fact Aristotle goes so far as to say that all logical fallacies can be reduced to what he calls ignoratio elenchi

Modern use limits this term much more narrowly to the kind of mistake described in the first paragraph above

Similar to ignoratio elenchi a red herring is an argument given in reply that does not address the original issue Critically a red herring is a deliberate attempt to change the subject or divert the argument This is known formally in the English vocabulary as digression which is a neutrally connotated Red herring

Maher Its arbitrary isnt it If you had been born in Pakistan you wouldnt be believing in Jesus Christ You would have been told another fairy and you would have been believing that

Scarborough Well Bill thats your opinion

Whether Mahers argument is his opinion or not is irrelevant and does not address the argument made

The conclusion is ignoratio elenchi since friendliness and charity are not the main qualifications for induction into the Hall of Fame

The existence of worse criminals is a secondary issue which has no bearing on whether the driver deserves a fine for recklessness If the speaker were deliberately attempting to divert the issue this would be an example of a red herring While the argument about how the police should spend their time may have merit the question of whom the police should prioritize pursuing and the question of what should be done with those the police have caught are separate questions

A red herring the unrelated alleged affair attempts to change the subject away from the popular policies However if the original discussion were of the prime ministers public integrity this argument could be perfectly valid Such as if a politicians election campaign revolved around family values Then an argument about such an affair would be valid as it is in direct conflict with a family values platform

An informal fallacy is an argument whose stated premises fail to support their proposed conclusion Informal fallacies often come about because of an error in reasoning The premises are then erroneously linked to the conclusion In contrast to a formal fallacy the error has to do with issues of inference because language is used to state the propositions natural language allows to say more than the symbolism of formal logic can represent All informal fallacies of deductive reasoning contain a fundamental disconnect between the premises and the conclusion This makes the argument invalid The disconnect often arises because there is a hidden co premise If this co premise were stated it would validate the argument

Inductive informal fallacies are slightly different from their deductive counterparts because their merit rests in the inductive strength of the premise conclusion link rather than in the presence of hidden premises For instance the fallacy of hasty generalization can be roughly stated as

If the populations of P and Q are both too large to sample completely then the statement is inductive In such a case a hasty generalization occurs when the number of Ps and Qs is insufficient to represent the respective populations It is important to distinguish between a principle of reasoning and the premise of an argument

Stimulants are drugs that can increase alertness and awareness usually for a short time only Most stimulants have more side effects than other drugs Some are classified as illegal drugs most can cause addiction For this reason most legal stimulants are only available on prescription Stimulants act on the nerves

Most stimulants fall into one of the following groups

Some of the substances mentioned above can be used to treat certain diseases Some are mostly used as illegal drugs

Benzylpiperazine commonly referred to as BZP is an recreational drug It is also available with trade names such as A2 Frenzy and Nemesis It is a stimulant and may cause Euphoria People believe it works in a way similar to MDMA The effects produced by BZP are comparable to those produced by amphetamine Side effects include acute psychosis problems with the kidneys Adverse effects have been reported following its use including acute psychosis and seizures It does not appear to be very addictive and no deaths have been reported following taking BZP once There have been at least two deaths which resulted from the combination of BZP and MDMA Its sale is banned in a few countries including the United States Australia New Zealand and in parts of Europe However its legal status is currently less restrictive in some other countries such as Ireland and Canada The European Union is currently changing its laws to regulate this substance more

The Turkish new lira is the currency of Turkey and the Turkish Northern Republic of Cyprus The new lira is subdivided into 100 new kurush the equivalent of American Cents or British Pennies The symbol for the currency is YTL

In the last few years the Turkish lira stabilised and even rose against the US Dollars and the Euro

Self injury or self harm when a person hurts their body on purpose It is not suicidal In fact many self harmers hurt themselves because they feel it is the only way to stay alive However in some cases the self harm becomes so bad it can lead to death and those who self harm are more likely to commit suicide than those who do not

There are many different reasons why a person may hurt themselves though it is often hard to find an exact cause Sometimes the self harm helps relieve unbearable emotions or feelings of unreality or numbness Self harm is often a symptom of other problems These problems may include physical abuse sexual abuse or eating disorders Self harm may also stem from mental problems such as low self esteem or perfectionism

Studying the causes of self injury can be difficult or inaccurate because many self harmers try to hide their injuries

Self injury is a general term that includes many different types of deliberate harm to the body There are many things that can be considered self harm If someone works their body too hard for example this can be seen as a mild form of self injury In other mild cases a self harmer may purposely pick off scabs to keep cuts or scratches from healing Hair pulling is another mild form of self harm 

In more severe cases a self harmer could break or sprain a bone or lose a dangerous amount of blood Biting burning and cutting are other forms of self injury Overdosing on medication is another common type of self harm

Self harm may get worse the longer a person has been doing it This is because a persons body builds up tolerance to the pain from their injuries Because of this they have to hurt themselves more to get the same effect In some cases this can lead to fatal or near fatal injuries

A person may go through voluntary pain for other reasons that are usually not considered self injury A self inflicted wound is when someone injures themselves to avoid something not because of psychological problems Some people give themselves a self inflicted wound during wartime so that they do not have to serve in the military

Some people go through pain to change the way they look such as in ear piercing This is called body modification Body modification is not a form of self injury 

Scarification is a type of body modification where someone cuts or burns their skin for decoration This can include branding which is common in some fraternities It can also include cutting the skin repeatedly in a pattern or design This will create very large scars Some African tribes use scarification as a symbol of beauty and strength

Experts estimate that about 1 of the population has self harmed While people of all ages and ethnic groups have self harmed some groups are more likely to self harm than others Age gender and race can be factors in the risk of self injury Some evidence suggests that self injury is also more common in people who have a family history of suicide or self injury

In general more young people are treated for self injury than any other age group One in eight teenagers say they have self injured It is more widespread among those with mental illness One in four or 25 of teenagers with mental illnesses have self harmed For women the ages of 15 19 are when self harm is most common Males are most likely to self harm through the ages 20 24

Recent research focusing on young people suggests that 10 percent of 15 to 16 year olds have self harmed In this case the self harm was usually done by cutting

A study in Oxford in the year 2000 found that around 300 per 100000 of males aged between 15 and 24 years and 700 per 100000 of females of the same age were admitted into a hospital after self harming Based on statistics like these most agree that young white females are most likely to self injure Possibly because of this it is usually believed that women have higher rates of self harm than men However this may not be true because women are more likely to get help for their self injury Males may have the same or similar rates of self injury as women Some findings have even suggested that in the mid 30s age range more men are treated for self harm than women

Minority groups who face discrimination are also more likely to self injure If someone is bullied because they are different this can lead to low self esteem and a feeling of helplessness over emotions This can lead some people to self harm

Studies have show that those who have been abused are more likely to self injure Sexual abuse physical abuse and emotional abuse can cause low self esteem especially in children It can also cause other emotional problems Some people may turn to self harm to relieve these emotions Low self esteem in victims of abuse may lead them to believe that the abuse was their fault They may turn to self injury because of this

Unstable living conditions such as unemployment or divorce may also make a person more likely to self harm

Prisoners are also more likely to self harm This may be because of the ongoing trauma that happens in prisons including sexual and physical violence and intimidation In an environment such as prison where options for inmates are limited prisoners may turn to self injury In England and Wales a report from The Howard League says that over 22000 prisoners harmed themselves in 2007

Those with learning and developmental disabilities such as autism are more likely to self harm The cause of this is unclear Some case studies have shown that it may be a form of self stimulation It may be that autistic children who self harm are trying to express frustration that they cannot explain with words Autistic children who self harm may do so by head banging or biting

Self harm is an addictive behavior Once someone starts self injury it is difficult for them to stop even if they want to This makes professional help and treatment an important part of recovery from self injury

The type of treatment that is most effective is different from person to person There are many different types of therapy that have been used to help self harmers

Cognitive behavioral therapy may help a person understand why they self harm Cognitive behavioral therapy is used to help patients understand the reasons for their problem This is so that the patient may learn what is causing their self harm and learn how to deal with these problems in a way other than self harm

Therapies used for post traumatic stress disorder may also help This is because many people who self harm have been victims of abuse Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing therapy is an example of this

Drugs may also be used to help treat self injury It is thought that self injury can release chemical endorphins into the brain Over time these chemicals can become addictive There are some drugs that can help with this addiction but they have not been proven to help people who self injure Naltrexone and naloxone are two drugs being researched for this kind of treatment However research involving endorphins has been mostly done with retarded or autistic children It is unclear if their unique brain chemistry changes the outcome of the research

The Socratic Method is named after the Greek philosopher Socrates It is a form of philosophical questioning

Elenchus means argument to disprove or refute cross examining testing scrutiny esp for purposes of refutation It is the central technique of the Socratic method The Latin form elenchus is used in English as the technical philosophical term

Our knowledge of Socrates comes mainly from Plato who was one of his pupils No writing by Socrates survives 

Socrates was famous for not answering questions in a direct manner I know that I know nothing he said Socratess stated position was that other person already knew the answer to a question He only drew out what was already in the others mind 

In Platos early dialogues the elenchus is the technique Socrates uses to investigate ethical concepts such as justice or virtue According to one scholar it has the following steps

The exact nature of the elenchus is subject to a great deal of debate in particular concerning whether it is a positive method leading to knowledge or a negative method used solely to refute false claims to knowledge

According to WKC Guthrie the Socratic method was intended to demonstrate ones ignorance Socrates unlike the Sophists did believe that knowledge was possible but believed that the first step to knowledge was recognition of ones ignorance Guthrie writes Socrates was accustomed to say that he did not himself know anything and that the only way in which he was wiser than other men was that he was conscious of his own ignorance while they were not The essence of the Socratic method is to convince the interlocutor that whereas he thought he knew something in fact he does not

Friedrich Hund was a German physicist from Karlsruhe known for his work on atoms and molecules He worked at the Universities of Rostock Leipzig Jena Frankfurt am Main Gttingen and was a member of the International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science

He had published more than 250 papers and essays and made contributions to quantum theory about the structure of the atom and the structure of molecular spectra The Hunds rule was named after him and in 1926 he discovered the later so called tunnel effect

Hund worked with well known physicists as Schrdinger Dirac Heisenberg Max Born and Walter Bothe At that time he was Borns assistant working with quantum mechanics

After his studies of mathematics physics and geography in Marburg and Gttingen he worked as a private lecturer in theoretical physics at Gttingen in 1925 professor at Rostock in 1927 Leipzig in 1929 Jena in 1946 FrankfurtMain in 1951 and from 1957 again in Gttingen Additionally he stayed in Copenhagen with Niels Bohr and lectured on the atom at Harvard University Cambridge Massachusetts in 1928

On the occasion of his 100th birthday the book Friedrich Hund Geschichte der physikalischen Begriffe history of physics terms Spektrum Akademie Verlag 1996 ISBN 3 8274 0083 X was published A review was also written by Werner Kutzelnigg

Friedrich Hund became an honorary citizen of Jena  Saale and a street in Jena was named after him Since June 2004 a part of the new building of the Physics Department was given the Friedrich Hund Platz 1 address The same name was chosen for the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of Gttingen

The Hunds cases which are particular regimes in molecular angular momentum coupling and the Hunds rules which govern electron configurations are important in spectroscopy and quantum chemistry In chemistry the first of Hunds rules is especially important and is often referred to as simply Hunds Rule

According to the PVGA rules an article needs six votes and 80 support to be promoted Red Hot Chili Peppers vote ended yesterday it has 100 support but four votes Anyone else think the current way the PVGA system works is a bit silly and that a consensus that the article is very good is more important than the number of people who sign their name

Giggy 0159 21 September 2008 The current criteria are the result of a lengthy discussion the minimal number of votes have basically been set to warrant for a certain interest in the community Otherwise it would be possible to promote 1 vote articles to VGA If the article in question is unable to reach the quorum then this means it could not gather enough interest in the community If you think this should be changed please re launch the discussion process In any case this would mean to either freeze theGA promotions or work with the old rules until we have agreed on new ones By the way there is also a minimal number of votes for those wanting to become admins and theGA system does not have the restriction that those who proposed the article cannot vote  Eptalon 1701 21 September 2008

If there are no objections in a weeks time I will go ahead and update the Manual Cheers Truths Out There talk 0357 22 September 2008

I would disagree that IPA is pretty easy to learn It does require a bit of effort and I think some people may find it difficult because of the different symbols that it uses some of which look pretty similar to each other Im not saying that a respelled pronunciation is perfect it is less precise than IPA and one may still have to look up the chart at HelpPronunciation respelling key to figure out how to pronounce certain words properly However in many cases readers should be able to figure out how to pronounce a word simply by looking at the respelled pronunciation if they cannot get to grips with IPA As for how to respell the words you mentioned Id render them as respelledWOOL s ree and respelledDOH nut The IPA page needs expansion but for pronunciation purposes I think we need to have a table like enWikipediaIPA We already have HelpPronunciation and IPA chart for English but these only apply to English words and not foreign words Anyway my reason for suggesting the change to the Manual of Style is to give editors the option to add a respelled pronunciation if they think fit At the moment the guideline only prescribes the use of IPA Cheers Truths Out There talk 1819 22 September 2008

Puppets are objects used in theatrical performances They are similar to dolls They usually use strings or other things to make the puppet move and to look alive Some puppets are very simple to make and use but others are very complicated and need skill to use The person who works the puppet and makes it move is a puppeteer The audience cannot usually see the puppeteer Some like a ventriloquist and dummy are in full view of the audience There are many different types of puppets to be found around the world Puppetry is a special art form that is very important in some cultures

Finger Puppet A very simple type of puppet where the puppet is placed on a finger and worked by moving the finger 

Pop up puppets A cone with a rod through and a puppet inside When the rod is pushed up the puppet appears

Paddle Puppet The puppet is on the end of a paddle When the puppeteer steps on the paddles back end the other end lifts up making it seem that the puppet moves by itself

Jumping Jack A puppet where the arms and legs of the puppet are joined to a string When the string is pulled down the arms and legs go up

Hand Puppet Similar to a finger puppet but only larger The puppeteer uses his fingers and hand to work the puppet Punch and Judy are famous glove puppets

Rod Puppet and Bunraku The puppet is worked with rods joined to the puppets arms and legs while another puppeteer moves the head and sometimes the mouth Bunraku is a special type of Japanese rod puppetry

Shadow Puppet Another very simple puppet A cut out figure on a rod is held in front of a light Its shadow is projected onto a screen The puppeteer moves the puppet around giving it some life Sometimes coloured paper is used to give a certain amount of colour to the puppet

Marionette or String Puppet This puppet is moved around with strings that hang from above the theatre This is one of the more complex types of puppetry and is hard to master as some marionettes can have up to thirty strings

Ventriloquist Figure or Dummy This puppet is one of the few where the audience sees the puppeteer The puppeteer moves the puppets head arms and mouth with his hands as well as with levers The performance usually takes the shape of a conversation between the dummy and the puppeteer The puppeteer speaks normally then puts on a different voice when the puppet is supposed to be talking His voice seems to be coming from his stomach His lips are not moving but the puppets lips may move so it seems as if the puppet is talking

Paranthropus is an extinct genus of robust australopithecines They probably descended from the gracile australopithecine Australopithecus

All species of Paranthropus were bipedal and many lived during a time when species of the genus Homo such as Homo ergaster and Homo erectus were living 

Paranthropus first appeared roughly 27 million years ago Most species of Paranthropus had a brain about 40 percent of the size of modern man There was some size variation between the different species of Paranthropus but most stood roughly 13 14 m tall and were quite well muscled Paranthropus is thought to have lived in wooded areas rather than the grasslands of the Australopithecus

Australopithecus and Paranthropus also looked very different from each other These differences were only found in remains of the skull The other parts of the skeleton were still very similar Paranthropus was more massively built as to skull and teeth It often had gorilla like sagittal crests on the cranium which anchored massive temporalis muscles for chewing

Paranthropus did not behave in the same was than Homo They could not adapt to their environment as easily They were also not as resourceful It lived on a diet of grubs and plants This might have made it more reliant on favorable environmental conditions than members of the genus Homo such as Homo habilis which were able to eat a much wider variety of foods

Opinions differ whether the species P aethiopicus P boisei and P robustus should be included within the genus Australopithecus On Wikipedia the genus Paranthropus is used for all articles which mention the species P aethiopicus P boisei and P robustus

For the most part the Australopithecus species A afarensis A africanus and A anamensis either disappeared from the fossil record before the appearance of early humans or seem to have been the ancestors of Homo habilis P boisei and P aethiopicus on the other hand continued to evolve along a separate path distinct and unrelated to early humans Paranthropus shared the earth with some early examples of the Homo genus such as H habilis H ergaster and possibly even H erectus 

Species of Paranthropus had smaller braincases than Homo yet they had significantly larger braincases than Australopithecus Paranthropus is associated with stone tools both in southern and eastern Africa although there is considerable debate whether they were made and utilized by these robust australopithecines Most believe that early Homo was the tool maker Most Paranthropus species almost certainly did not have language or to have controlled fire although they are directly associated with the latter at Swartkrans South Africa

A partial cranium and mandible of Paranthropus robustus was discovered in 1938 by a schoolboy 70 km south west of Pretoria in South Africa It was described as a new genus and species by Robert Broom of the Transvaal Museum A date of at least 195 million years has been obtained for the site 

Paranthropus boisei was discovered by Mary Leakey in July 1959 at the site of Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania Mary was working alone as Louis was ill in camp She rushed back to camp and at the news Louis made a remarkable recovery 

In his notes Louis recorded a first name Titanohomo mirabilis reflecting an initial impression of close human affinity Louis and Mary began to call it Dear Boy Recovery was halted on August 7 Dear Boy was in context with Oldowan tools and animal bones

The fossil was published in Nature on 15 August 1959 but due to a strike of the printers the issue was not released until September In it Louis placed the fossil in Brooms Australopithecinae family creating a new genus for it Zinjanthropus species boisei Zinj is an ancient Arabic word for the coast of East Africa and boisei referred to Charles Boise an anthropological benefactor of the Leakeys Louis based his classification on twenty differences from Australopithecus

Broom had died in 1951 but Dart was still living He is said to have wept for joy on Louis behalf on being personally shown Zinj which Louis and Mary carried around in a tin Louis had considered Brooms Paranthropus genus but rejected it because he believed Zinj was in the Homo ancestral stock but Paranthropus was not He relied heavily on the larger size of Zinjs canines

The battle of the name raged on for many years and drove a wedge between Louis and LeGros Clark who took the Paranthropus view On the other hand it brought the Leakeys and Dr Melville Bell Grosvenor of the National Geographic Society together The Leakeys became international figures and had no trouble finding funds from then on The Zinj question ultimately became part of the AustralopithecusParanthropus question

Toba is a lake in the caldera of a supervolcano 

The lake is 100 kilometres long and 30 kilometres wide and 505 metres at its deepest point 

It is in the middle of the northern part of the Indonesian island of Sumatra with an elevation of about convert900mft0 

The lake stretches from Coord288N9852E to Coord235N991E 

It is the largest lake in Indonesia and the largest volcanic lake in the world

Lake Toba is the site of a supervolcanic eruption that occurred 73000 years ago This the largest eruption in the last two million years was a climate changing event The eruption was two orders of magnitude larger than the largest known historic eruption that of Tambora also in Indonesia

It has been accepted that the eruption of Toba led to a volcanic winter with a worldwide decline in temperatures between 3 5 degrees C and up to 15 degrees C in higher latitudes

According to the Toba catastrophe theory it had global consequences killing most humans then alive and creating a population bottleneck in Central Eastern Africa and India that affected the genetic inheritance of all humans today 

According to the theory only 10000 pairs of humans survived the disaster Perhaps it led to the other hominids becoming extinct though the Neanderthals certainly survived in Europe and Eurasia After this the Earth was colonised again starting from Africa

There is no direct evidence that the theory is correct And there is no evidence for any other animal decline or extinction even in environmentally sensitive species There is evidence that human habitation continued in India after the eruption The theory in its strongest form seems to be incorrect

Dual tone multi frequency or DTMF is a way to use in band signalling on analog telephone lines It is still widely used to transmit phone numbers from the telephone to the network DTMF largely replaced the older pulse dialling Pulse dialling sends one impulse per number To transmit the number 9 9 impulses are necessary DTMF uses a different frequency for each number This is faster than pulse dialling

In addition to the numbers 0 9 the star hash mark and the letters A to D also have frequencies and are used to issue commands while A to D are rarely used

Digital telephone systems like ISDN or Voice over IP use out of band signalling Skype only provides inband DTMF access via its Public API interface

Equilibrioception is the sense of balance This is what prevents a person or animal from falling over while walking or doing other physical activity

In humans equilibrioception is mainly sensed by the detection of acceleration which occurs in the vestibular system Other senses play roles as well eg the visual system and proprioception The importance of visual input for balance is illustrated by its being harder to stand on one foot with eyes closed than with eyes open 

The sense of balance usually deteriorates in the process of aging of a person However it can be improved considerably with the help of special training

Gerard Kitchen Gerry ONeill was an American scientist He taught physics at Princeton University He invented a machine for holding subatomic particles He also invented the mass driver a machine used to broken wikt linklaunchlaunch things into outer space He wrote about building cities in space His space station design is known as the ONeill cylinder He started the Space Studies Institute SSI is a group focused on learning about space manufacturing and colonization

In 1954 ONeill finished school at Cornell University Then he began his work on particle physics at Princeton Two years later he wrote about a device to hold very fast moving subatomic particles In 1965 he used his device to shoot two beams of particles at each other for the first time This experiment was done at Stanford University Scientists used the experiment to discover the size of the electron

While he was teaching ONeill became excited about humans living in outer space He wrote about the ONeill cylinder in The Colonization of Space This was his first paper about people living in space He met with other scientists at Princeton in 1975 There he talked with them about manufacturing in outer space ONeill built his first mass driver with help from scientist Henry Kolm in 1976 Mass drivers were part of his plan to mine the Moon and asteroids His book The High Frontier won an award and got people excited about outer space He died in 1992 after a seven year fight against leukemia

Qazaqsa is the name given to the language of Kazakhstan written in latin alphabet

The language of Kazakshtan in central Asia has been written in cyrillic alphabet since Russia started to occupy that country in the XIX century 

After WWI in the Turkish countries started a linguistic change to use only the Latin alphabet promoted mainly by Kemal Ataturk of Turkey Consequently from 1927 to 1939 in Kazakhstan  that was part of the Soviet Union  was used the Latin alphabet But Stalin reinstated in 1940 the Cyrillic in order to impose a russification of soviet central Asia

In 1991 the newly independent Kazakshtan started to allow the return to the old Latin alphabet but with the use of the Cyrillic as the primary alphabet

In 2006 the actual president Nazarbajev of Kazakhstan has implemented a project to substitute in 15 years the Cyrillic with the latin alphabet of the Qazaqsa in order to officially use the Qazaqsa as the only language of his country after 2020

The Qazaqsa Latin alphabet has 38 letters

A rain gauge is an instrument used by meteorologists and hydrologists to measure precipitation in a certain amount of time It usually measures in millimetresRain gauge is an meteorological instrument for determing the depth of precipitation that occurs over a unit area and thus measuring rainfall amount One millimetre of measured precipitation is the equivalent of one litre of rainfall per metre squared

Usually a tapering funnel of copper or polyester of standard dimension allows the rain water to collect in an enclosed bottle or cylinder for subsequent measurement The gauge is set in open ground with the funnel rim up to 30 cm above the ground surface Some gauges are calibrated to allow the amount of rainfall to be read directly with others it must be calculated from the depth of water in the container and the dimensions of the funnel

The second type of rain gauge is the autographic gauge which can be either of the tilting siphon type or the tipping bucket type The recording chart on an autographic rain gauge is mounted on a drum which is driven by clockwork and typically rotates round a vertical axis once per day For a tilting siphon rain gauge the rainwater in a collector displaces a float so that a marking pen attached to the float makes a continuous trace on the paper The two buckets in a tipping bucket rain gauge rest on a pivot so that when one bucket has received 02 of rain it tips by gravity empties the rainwater and allows the other bucket to start collection During the tip an electrical switch is closed and triggers a nearby autographic recorder to register each tilt thus giving a fairly continuous record of precipitation and in a more sophisticated form even rainfall intensity Rain gauges must be sited in as representative a location as possible but the choice of location is difficult since many precipitation events are highly localized

Zrich S Bahn is a suburban rail system that links the City of Zrich to its agglomeration The system has existed since 1990 when it was the first suburban rail system to begin operating in Switzerland 

Mid 2008 there were 380 kilometres of railway track 171 stations and 28 lines In 2007 about 355653 passengers used the system every day

Each line generally has two trains an hour 

Since 2002 there are also 7 lines that run during the night during week ends in the nights Friday Saturday and Saturday Sunday Usually there is one train per hour Some lines only have one train every two hours These are complemented by a number of bus lines Usually traveling with these night lines is subject to an extra fare which has to be bought in addition to the normal ticket 

At the moment between 75 and 80 million people use the system every year About 70 of the people living in the agglomeration use the system Plans include gradually introducing 4 trains per hour on most lines and to extend the offer to 4 trains per hour between Zrich and Winthertur during the whole day and not just during rush hour A new tunnel is currently being built This will allow trains from Wintherthur Oerlikon to run through Zurich main station without changing direction

Sand may refer to

Amandine Aurore Lucile Dupin later Baroness Dudevant best known by her pseudonym George Sand was a French novelist and feminist

Sands father Maurice Dupin was the grandson of the Marshall General of France Maurice Comte de Saxe He was also a distant relative of Louis XVI Her mother Sophie Victoire Delaborde was a common woman Sand was born in Paris She spent much of her childhood with her grandmother Marie Aurore de Saxe Madame Dupin de Franceuil Her grandmother lived in her estate Nohant in the French region of Berry She later used the setting in many of her novels In 1822 at age 19 she married Baron Casimir Dudevant illegitimate son of Jean Franois She and Dudevant had two children Maurice and Solange In early 1831 she left her prosaic husband and entered upon a four or five year period of romantic rebellion In 1835 she was legally separated from Dudevant

Sand started to wear mens clothes in public This harmed her reputation She said that mens clothes were tougher and also less expensive to buy than womens The clothes she wore were comfortable and they also allowed her to go around Paris more freely than the other women even those of her own social standing 

Sand also smoked in public This led to a scandal At her time women were not supposed to smoke not even those of her standing Franz Liszt had a relationship with a woman called Marie DAgoult who did this as well DArgoult smoked large cigars These and other behaviors were exceptional for a woman of the early and mid 19th century when social codesespecially in the upper classeswere very important 

Poet Charles Baudelaire was a contemporary critic of George Sand She is stupid heavy and garrulous Her ideas on morals have the same depth of judgment and delicacy of feeling as those of janitresses and kept women The fact that there are men who could become enamoured of this slut is indeed a proof of the abasement of the men of this generation

Sand had affairs with several men Some lasted longer others shorter These men included Jules Sandeau Prosper Mrime Alfred de Musset Louis Chrystosome Michel Charles Didier Pierre Franois Bocage Flicien Mallefille and Frdric Chopin 

Later in life she wrote letters to Gustave Flaubert Despite their obvious differences in temperament and aesthetic preference they eventually became good friends 

She was engaged in an intimate friendship with actress Marie Dorval which led to widespread but unconfirmed rumors of a lesbian affair 

In Majorca one can still visit the Carthusian monastery of Valldemossa where she spent the winter of 183839 with Chopin and her children This trip to Majorca was described by her in Un Hiver Majorque published in 1855

Chopin left her two years before his death because of a family disturbance wherein he supported her daughter Solanges marriage choice which had caused Sand to disown the daughter

A liaison with the writer Jules Sandeau heralded her literary debut They published a few stories in collaboration signing them Jules Sand She consequently adopted for her first independent novel Indiana the pen name that made her famous George Sand  

Her first published novel Rose et Blanche was written in collaboration with Jules Sandeau 

Drawing from her childhood experiences of the countryside she wrote the rural novels La Mare au Diable Franois le Champi La Petite Fadette and Les Beaux Messieurs Bois Dor A Winter in Majorca described the period that she and Chopin spent on that island in 1838 9

Her other novels include Indiana Llia Mauprat Le Compagnon du Tour de France Consuelo and Le Meunier dAngibault 

Further theatre pieces and autobiographical pieces include Histoire de ma vie Elle et Lui Journal Intime and Correspondence Sand often performed her theatrical works in her small private theatre at the Nohant estate 

In addition Sand authored literary criticism and political texts Her most widely used quote being There is only one happiness in life to love and be loved 

She was known well in far reaches of the world and her social practices her writings and her beliefs prompted much commentary often by other luminaries in the world of arts and letters A few excerpts demonstrate much of what was often said about George Sand

George Sand died at Nohant near Chteauroux in Frances Indre dpartement on June 8 1876 at the age of 71 and was buried in the grounds of her home there In 2004 controversial plans were suggested to move her remains to the Panthon in Paris

Frequent literary references to George Sand can be found in Possession by A S Byatt The American poet Walt Whitman cited Sands novel Consuelo as a personal favorite and the sequel to this novel La Comtesse De Rudolstady contains at least a couple of passages that appear to have had a very direct influence on him Elizabeth Barrett Browning the English poet produced two poems To George Sand A Desire and To George Sand A Recognition The character Stepan Verkhovensky in Dostoevskys novel The Possessed took to translating the works of George Sand in his periodical before the periodical was subsequently seized by the ever cautious Russian government of the 1840s George Sand is referenced a number of times in the play Voyage the first part of Tom Stoppards The Coast of Utopia trilogy And in the first episode of the Overture to Swanns Way  the first novel in Marcel Prousts In Search of Lost Time sequence  a young distraught Marcel is calmed by his mother as she reads from Franois le Champi a novel which it is explained was part of a birthday package from his grandmother which also included La Mare au Diable La Petite Fadette and Les Matres Sonneurs As with many episodes involving art in la recherche du temps perdu this reminiscence includes commentary on the work

Animal testing also known as animal experimentation animal research and in vivo testing is the use of animals for experiments Fruit flies and mice are often used for animal testing About 50 to 100 million vertebrate animals and many more invertebrate animals are used around the world every year The source of the animals are different according to the country and species Most animals used for experiments are bred for this purpose But others may be caught from the wild or bought from people who buy them from pounds

Animals are used for experiments inside universities medical schools farms large companies and other places that provide animal testing services People who support animal testing argue that almost every medical discovery in the 20th century used animals in some way They say that even complex computers cannot model connections between molecules cells tissues organs organisms and the environment But some scientists and animal rights organizations such as PETA do not support animal testing They say that it is cruel poorly done and costly Others argue that animals have the right not to be used for experiments and that animal models are different from humans The limits to animal testing is different in various countries

The words animal testing animal experimentation animal research in vivo testing and vivisection have similar meaningsdifferently tatiosion means to cut up a living animal It was used only in experiments that dissected live animals The word vivisection is sometimes used negatively about any experiment with live animals For example the Encyclopdia Britannica described vivisection as Operation on a living animal for experimental rather than healing purposes more broadly all experimentation on live animals However dictionaries note that the wider definition is used only by people who are opposed to such work The word makes people think of torture pain and death People who dislike animal testing often use the word vivisection while scientists usually use the expression animal experimentation instead

The earliest mention of animal testing is in the writings of the Greeks in the second and fourth centuries BCE Aristotle and Erasistratus were some of the first people to try out experiments on living animals Galen a doctor in second century Rome who was known as the father of vivisection dissected pigs and goats Avenzoar an Arabic doctor in twelfth century Spain tested out surgical processes on animals before applying them to humans

Animals have often been used in the history of scientific study In the 1880s Louis Pasteur showed the germ theory of medicine by putting anthrax in sheep In the 1890s Ivan Pavlov famously used dogs to describe classical conditioning On November 3 1957 a Russian dog Laika became one of the first animals to orbit the earth In the 1970s antibiotic treatments and vaccines for leprosy were made using armadillos then given to humans In 1974 Rudolf Jaenisch produced the first genetically changed mammal He put DNA from a virus into the genome of mice Genetic study grew quickly after that In 1996 Dolly the sheep was bornthe first cloned mammal

In the 20th century toxicology testing became important In the 19th century laws about drugs were less strict Drugs did not have to be checked for safety But in 1937 a drug called Elixir Sulfanilamide killed more than 100 people They caused great and long lasting pain vomiting and fits After that the US congress made laws that said that drugs had to be tested on animals before they could be sold Other countries passed similar laws

Even back in the 17th century people disagreed about animal testing In 1655 Edmund OMeara said that the miserable torture of vivisection places the body in an unnatural state OMeara and others said that animals could be affected by pain during vivisection making results unreliable Others also disliked animal testing because they felt that animals should not be hurt for humans Others opposed animal testing for different reasons many believed that animals were not as good as humans and that they were so different that results of animal testing would not work on humans

Supporters had different views They argued that experiments on animals were necessary for knowledge Claude Bernard the prince of vivisectors and the father of physiology famously wrote in 1865 that the science of life is a superb and dazzlingly lighted hall which may be reached only by passing through a long and ghastly kitchen He declared that experiments on animals are entirely conclusive for the toxicology and hygiene of man the effects of these substances are the same on man as on animals save for differences in degree Because of Bernard animal testing became a regular scientific method Surprisingly though his wife Marie Franoise Martin began the first anti vivisection society in France in 1883

In 1896 Dr Walter B Cannon said The antivivisectionists are the second of the two types Theodore Roosevelt described when he said Common sense without conscience may lead to crime but conscience without common sense may lead to folly which is the handmaiden of crime The public first began giving its attention to the supporters and opposers of animal testing during the brown dog affair in the early 1990s In the brown dog affair hundreds of medical students and anti vivisectionists and police argued over a memorial to a vivisected dog

Emily Jane Browning is an Australian award winning actress probably best known for her role as Violet Baudelaire in Lemony Snickets A Series of Unfortunate Events

From the Latin trivium is the set of three ways

In Antiquity and the Middle Ages three of the seven liberal arts related to the eloquence grammar rhetoric and dialectics of Rhetoric In the medieval universities the trivium included the three basic aspects of Rhetoric The grammar as mechanics of the language the logic which is the mechanics of thinking and analysis and the rhetoric which involves the verbal mechanics of a language in order to instruct and to persuade In the medieval Scholasticism they were considered camps preparing for the quadrivium which includes arithmetic geometry music and astronomy

Ancient Greek boxing is a very old kind of sport It has been practiced at least since the eighth century BC Homer wrote about it in his poem Iliad At that time Greece was made of many city states that were independent Each city state seems to have had its own version of the sport

Today most of the sources that talk about Greek boxing are either legends or they are fragmentary When a source is fragmentary this means that part of the text has been lost or is missing This makes it difficult to find the rules or where and how the activity was done Several details are missing but it seems boxing with gloves was an important part of the Greek athletic culture of the time

The activity was called pyx or pygme in Ancient Greek Archeologists have found evidence that this activity was probably done by the Minoan and Mycenaean cultures Many legends tell about the origins of boxing in Greece One legend says that the heroic ruler Theseus invented a type of boxing where two men sat face to face and beat each other with their fists until one of them was killed Later the boxers began to fight while standing They also started to wear gloves and wrappings on their arms below the elbows In Ancient Greece most sports were done naked boxing too 

According to Iliad Mycenaean warriors included boxing in their competitions They did this to honor those who had died It is possible that Homer told about what the Greeks did at a later time Boxing was one of the contests held in memory of Achilles friend Patroclus who was killed toward the end of the Trojan War To commemorate Patroclus the Greeks later introduced boxing to the Olympic Games in 688 BC People taking part trained on punching bags Fighters wore leather straps over their hands wrists and sometimes chest to protect themselves from injury The straps also left the fingers free 

Philostratus was a scholar and an historian According to him boxing was originally developed in Sparta in order to harden warriors faces for battle The early Spartans believed helmets were unnecessary and boxing prepared them for when they were hit on the head in battle However Spartans never took part in the competitive version of boxing They thought it was dishonorable to be defeated that way 

Until around 500 BC himantes were used as protection for the knuckles and hand They were thongs of ox hide between 3 and 37 meters long The himantes were wrapped around the hands and knuckles many times

Around 400 BC sphairai were introduced The sphairai were very similar to himantes The biggest difference was that the inside was padded when they were wrapped around the hands The outside of the thong was more rigid too

Soon after the saphirai had been introduced they were replaced by oxys used for boxing Oxys were made of several thick leather bands that were wrapped around the hand wrist and forearm A band of fleece was placed on the forearm to wipe away sweat Leather braces extended up the forearm to give greater support when punching The knuckles were reinforced with leather as well

Korykos were the equivalent to modern punching bags They were used for practice in the Palaestra and were filled with sand flour or millet

The rules currently used for the sport are based on the old rules As pointed out above there are only incomplete sources for the rules The rules needed to be deduced from old texts and images

Nocera Inferiore is a town and comune in Campania Italy in the province of Salerno at the foot of Monte Albino 20 km east south east of Naples by rail convert135ftmabbron above sea level

Nuceria Alfaterna appears to have been the chief town in the valley of the Sarnus Herculaneum Pompeii Stabiae and Surrentum all being dependent upon it 

Hannibal destroyed the town in 216

In 1385 Pope Urban VI was besieged in the castle of Charles of Durazzo

At Nocera had sped a big part of they life the painter Francesco Solimena and the writers Jacopo Sannazzaro and Domenico Rea

Is the birthplace of the footballers Simone Barone and Raffaele De Martino Originally from Nocera are the parents of Italian American Warren Cuccurullo and Mario Cuomo

Nevado del Ruiz also called Mount Ruiz is a volcano in Colombia It is about 

There was a lahar after an eruption in 1985 About 23000 people died when the lahar covered the Armero making this the most deadly lahar in the history of the world People who live near the volcano call it the Sleeping Lion because it was dormant for nearly 150 years before the Armero lahar

Nevado del Ruiz is a broad icy stratovolcano that covers more than convert200kmmi0 Three major edifices composed of andesitic and dacitic lavas and andesitic pyroclastics have built up since the beginning of the Pleistocene The modern cone consists of a wide cluster of lava domes produced within the summit caldera of an ancient Ruiz cum The 1kilometer wide 240meter deep Arenas crater currently occupies the summit The prominent La Olleta pyroclastic cone is on the volcanos southwest flank and may also have been active in historical times The mountains flanks are lined by the steep headwalls of massive landslides Melting of its summit icecap during historical eruptions which date back to the 16th century has resulted in devastating lahars including the famous eruption in 1985 that was the worlds deadliest

In 1595 a lahar flowed down a the valleys of the River Guali and the River Lagunillas killing 636 people In 1845 another massive lahar flooded the upper valley of the River Lagunillas killing over 1000 people It continued for 70 kilometers downstream before spreading across a plain in the lower valley floor It is believed both of these formed from melting of the snow and ice that cover the summit as did the original eruption

Nevado del Ruiz was very active in the three months before it erupted An Italian volcanological mission analyzed gas samples from the fumaroles along the Arenas crater floor and proved them to be a mixture of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide indicating a direct magmatic release into surface environment A very high lahar risk was stressed in the missions report delivered on October 22 1985 and various simple preparedness techniques were proposed to local authorities

During the following quiet period in October the hydrothermal component of the vapor discharge steadily increased The gases were super saturated with elemental sulfur their thermodynamic equilibration temperatures can range from 200 to 600 Celsius Gases and water from fumaroles and thermal springs on the flanks of the volcano are likely to be produced from a two phase vapor brine envelope adjoining the eruptive system within the volcano The chemistry of the fumarole discharges is compatible with the comparison of an eruptive mechanism involving the build up of pressure in an extensive vapor zone by gas released from a stagnant already extensively degassed body of magmatic material at depth Production of such a residual gas over extended periods may account for the large amount of sulfur dioxide being released from the volcano in relation to the small amount of ejected solids

The destruction wrought by the 1985 eruption was partially due to the fact that scientists vacillated over whether or not to evacuate the area Nevertheless a group of scientists informed them that they faced eminent and almost certain death The people in Armero assumed that because the volcano had not erupted in 100 years it had no reason to erupt so abruptly Scientists later looked back to the hours before the eruption and noticed that several long period earthquakes had occurred Long period earthquakes are those which start out strong and then die down very slowly Volcanologist Bernard Chouet said that these earthquakes occurred in the final hours before an eruption According to Chouet the volcano was screaming Im about to explode but scientists at the time doubted his theory

On November 13 1985 at 908 pm Nevado del Ruiz erupted ejecting dacitic tephra more than 30 kilometers into the atmosphere The amount of magma erupted from the volcano was 3 of that from Mount St Helens in 1980 The eruption reached Volcanic Explosivity Index 3 The material ejected was described by scientists as unusually rich in sulfur dioxide

Pyroclastic flows melted ice and snow at the summit forming 4 thick lahars that rushed down several river valleys As most lahars do the mudflows began as flows of water sand and gravel and mixed with clay along the way The lahars were up to 50 meters thick and six feet deep and traveled more than 100 kilometers

The lahars destroyed many houses and towns The town of Armero was completely covered by debris killing approximately 21000 people as well as affecting 13 other villages The eruption caused an estimated 23000 deaths 5000 injuries and destroyed more than 5000 homes This was the second deadliest volcanic disaster in the 20th century ousted only by the 1902 eruption of Mount Pelee and the fourth deadliest eruption in recorded history In addition it was the deadliest lahar in recorded history and Colombias worst natural disaster

The disaster gained some major international notoriety due in part to a photograph taken by photographer Frank Fournier of a young girl named Omayra Snchez who was trapped beneath rubble for three days before she died In response to the eruption the USGS Volcano Crisis Assistance Team was formed in 1986 and the Volcano Disaster Assistance Program

The volcano erupted again in 1988 and 1991

The eruption cost Colombia 77 billion dollars about 20 of the countrys GNP for the year A lack of preparation contributed to the high death toll Armero had been built directly on old mudflows and authorities ignored a hazard zone map which showed the potential damage to the town if lahars were to avalanche down the mountain Habitants were also told to stay inside and avoid the falling ash not thinking the mudflows would bury them Dr Stanley Williams of Louisiana University said that following the eruption With the possible exception of Mount St Helens in the state of Washington no other volcano in the Western Hemisphere is being watched so elaborately

In April 2008 the Nevado del Huila volcano erupted and thousands were evacuated Volcanologists were worried that this could be another Nevado del Ruiz Hundreds of these eruptions have had huge evacuation numbers for similar reasons

Survivors who fled to other towns in the area were gradually housed in new government schemes Armero was not rebuilt because the old lahar traces were discovered and Colombian government declared the site holy ground so that no one would ever suffer again like Armero

Vitaceae are a family of dicotyledonous flowering plants including the grape and Virginia creeper The family name comes from the genus Vitis The name sometimes appears as Vitidaceae but Vitaceae is a conserved name and therefore has priority over both Vitidaceae and another name sometimes found in the older literature Ampelidaceae

The relationships of Vitaceae are unclear and the family does not appear to have any close relatives In the Cronquist system the family was placed near the family Rhamnaceae in order Rhamnales The family was placed in the Rosid clade but not classified in an order by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group The Angiosperm Phylogeny Web places Vitaceae in its own order Vitales Recent phylogenetic analyses support Vitaceae as the sister group to all other rosids

Most Vitis species have 38 chromosomes but 40 in subgenus Muscadinia while Ampelocissus Parthenocissus and Ampelopsis also have 40 chromosomes and Cissus has 24 chromosomes

The family is economically important as grapes are an important fruit crop and when fermented produce wine

Species of the genus Tetrastigma serve as hosts to parasitic plants in the family Rafflesiaceae

Leea sometimes classified in its own family Leeaceae is included in Vitaceae by the APG and the Angiosperm Phylogeny Web

Vitis is a genus of about 60 species of vining plants in the flowering plant family Vitaceae The genus is made up of species most often found in the Northern hemisphere It is economically important as the source of grapes both for direct consumption of the fruit and for fermentation to produce wine The study and cultivation of grapevines is called viticulture

Human nature refers to the characteristics of mankind This means ways of thinking feeling and acting which humans have naturally 

What these characteristics are what causes them and how fixed human nature is are good questions They among the oldest and most important questions in western philosophy These questions affect ethics politics and theology Human nature is a source of advice on how to live well but it also puts limits and obstacles on living a good life

The complex implications of such questions are also dealt with in art and literature while the humanities inquire into human nature and what it means to be human

Humans are mammals and have developed by a process of evolution It follows that what is called human nature is inherited and had been the product of natural selection We are not blank slates our mental life and behaviour has ancient roots This is the question of nature vs nurture and the subject matter of evolutionary psychology Ethology also has always looked at these issues from the perspective of human evolution and heredity

Aristotle Platos most famous student made some of the most famous and influential statements about human nature 

In his works some clear statements about human nature are made

For Aristotle reason is what is most special about humanity compared to other animals and is what we achieve at our best 

Much of Aristotles description of human nature is still influential today but the particular teleological idea that humans are meant or intended to be something has become much less popular in modern times

The first round of the playoffs or Conference Quarterfinals consists of four games in each conference based on the seedings In the second round or Conference Semifinals the top ten conferences that are still in the playoffs seed plays against the lowest remaining seed and the other two conference teams play In the third round the Conference Finals the two teams left in each conference play each other with the conference champions going to the Stanley Cup Finals

For the first three rounds the higher seeded team has home ice advantage In the Stanley Cup Finals it goes to the team with the better regular season record The team with home ice advantage hosts games 1 2 5 and 7 while the opponent hosts games 3 4 and 6

Before the 199394 season the style was completely different The league was split into four divisions and the best four teams in each of the divisions went to the playoffs Also instead of the top team playing the 8th place team in the conference the first place team played the fourth place team in each division and the second place team played the third place team In the second round the two winning teams in each division would face each other for the divisional championship The divisional winners in each conference would play one another in the third round for the right to advance to the Stanley Cup Final This style is still used for deciding the teams in the playoffs in the American Hockey League

The Latin alphabet in Turkish countries is the common alphabet officially used in most countries with Turkish languages The Turkish alphabet can also be written in Arabic Persian and Cyrillic

After World War I many Turkish countries implemented a policy of westernization centered even on the use of the Latin alphabet The first was Turkey in 1926 where Kemal Ataturk substituted the Arab alphabet with the roman alphabet after ordering the end of the Ottoman Empire

Soon all the Turkish speaking countries of the soviet central Asia did the same and used the so called unified Turkish latin alphabet based on the one of Ataturks Turkey but during WWII Stalin ordered a russification process in his Soviet Union and the Latin alphabet was erased and substituted again by the cyrillic alphabet

With the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 most of the newly independent turkish Asian countries reinstated the Latin alphabet but with small local differences in each countrys alphabet in order to get rid of excessive influence from Moscow 

The Turkish alphabet used in Turkey based on Latin capital and lower case letters has 29 letters

Of these 29 letters in the Latin alphabet of Turkey 8 are vowels the 21 others are consonants The letters Q W and X of the English alphabet do not occur in this Turkish Latin alphabet

The Turkish alphabet used in other turkish countries like Kazakhstan when using Latin alphabet like in the case of Qazaqsa has some different letters

For example the Qazaqsa Latin alphabet has 38 letters

An impossible object is a kind of optical illusion Impossible objects are also known as impossible figure or undecidable figure The illusion is made of a two dimensional figure The visual system and the brain subconsciously interpret it as a projection of a three dimensional object This results in an object that cannot exist

For most such objects it becomes obvious that they are impossible after looking at them for a few seconds The impression of a 3D figure may still remain even after there was the contradiction

Some of these figures are more subtle In these cases it is not apparent that they are impossible right away The viewer carefully needs to look at the geometry of the object ot find out that it is indeed impossible

Impossible objects are of interest to psychologists mathematicians and artists 

Notable undecidable figures include

Swedish artist Oscar Reutersvrd was the first to deliberately design many impossible objects He has been called the father of impossible figures In 1934 he drew the Penrose triangle some years before the Penroses In Reutersvrds version the sides of the triangle are broken up into cubes

In 1956 British psychiatrist Lionel Penrose and his son mathematician Roger Penrose submitted a short article to the British Journal of Psychology titled Impossible Objects A Special Type of Visual Illusion This was illustrated with the Penrose Triangle and Penrose stairs The article referenced Escher whose work had sparked their interest in the subject but not Reutersvrd whom they were unaware of The article was only published in 1958

From the 1930s onwards Dutch artist M C Escher produced many drawings with paradoxes of perspective In 1957 he produced his first drawing containing a true impossible object Cube with Magic Ribbons He produced many other drawings of impossible objects sometimes with the entire drawing being an undecidable figure His work did much to draw the attention of the public to impossible objects Some artists of the time are also experimenting with impossible figures for example Jos de Mey Shigeo Fukuda Sandro del Prete Istvn Orosz Guido Moretti Tams F Farkas and Mathieu Hamaekers

The Alliance for the Future of Austria is a liberal political party in Austria that was led by Jrg Haider until he died in October 2008 The current leader is Josef Bucher

The BZ describes itself as ideologiefrei aber zukunftsorientiert und wertebewusst Some of its policies however are quite different from those of the Freedom Party They include

Although the party was often designated as a far right like the Freedom Party the Alliance for the Future of Austria differs somewhat Justic Minster Karin Gastinger a former party member of the Alliance for the Future of Austria wanted gay and lesbian couples to be able to sign a registry and get rights to partners estates and medical care as she told the Austrian Press Agency in 2005 FP and BZ are both Eurosceptic parties and in the 2006 general election the Freedom Party as well as the Alliance for the Future of Austria both claimed they would decrease immigration and opposed Turkish membership in the European Union

In the Austrian legislative election 2008 campaign the VP saw the lowering of brokerage commissions and the charges for arrears letters of debt collection agencies and winter fuel payments for lower income households as appropriate economic recovery measures and the Greens sought to facilitate the changeover to renewable energy in order to reduce energy prices

The SP proposes a stricter controlling of prices in addition to the reduction of brokerage commissions Both the Alliance for the Future of Austria and the Freedom Party see the main problem in the rising fuel prices the FP demands a ceiling price for fuel while the BZ in addition wants to reduce taxes on fuels However the Alliace for the Future of Austria even announced the peoples initiative Preisstop jetzt calling for a stop to rising prices to be held however due to the necessary timeframe the period during which people will be able to sign for the initiative will only start after the election thus limiting its potential impact

SP VP and the Greens ratified the Treaty of Lisbon in parliament without a referendum and only FP and the Alliance for the Future of Austria did not sign But afterwards the SP stated that for future treaties of the European Union referendums should be held to let the people decide like in Ireland Due to SPs position change on the EU not only the two opposition parties are using the possibility of EU referendums before a ratification as subject now The VP and the Greens are against any referendums on the Lisbon Treaty SP demands there should be referendums on future treaties of the European Union the FP is for a referendum for the Lisbon Treaty and even want a referendum for EU Withdrawal However the BZ differs a bit in comparison to the Freedom Party as they are for a referendum about the Lisbon Treaty but not for an EU Withdrawal Due to help of the former FP and till then BZ party leader and Carinthian LH Dr Jrg Haider the party achieved 107 in the 2008 elections and gained 21 representatives so that the BZ is currently the 4th strongest Party in the Austrian Parliament just after SPVP and FP and before Die Grnen

It currently holds 16 seats 

On 2 May 2010 the party became a new programm and the rectlange orange colored logo was first used on the annual hold new years convention which took place in Velden in Carinthia of the year 2011

However opinion polls have shown good chances for a return of the Carinthian branch of the Alliance for the Future of Austria into Carinthian State Diet 

In 2011 the party began a autumn posting campaign and quoted the bible Denn sie wissen nicht was sie tun eng They know not what they do for criticising SP VP and the EU bosses This caused a little scandal whether politics and religion should be separated or not

Crich Tramway Village is an open air museum of trams and tramways in Crich Derbyshire England It is the home of the National Tramway Museum It is set up as an Edwardian village and has a street with shops which include a sweet shop caf and gift shop Other buildings in the open air museum are the Red Lion Pub from Stoke on Trent Derby Assembly Rooms Burnley Tramways Offices and the tram sheds and displays There are tram lines which go out for about convert1mikm1lkon from the village There is also a collection of old street furniture from around the United Kingdom

The trams that are in the museum used to run on tramlines along the streets of different towns and cities Most of the trams at Crich were used in the United Kingdom before the 1960s Some are from other countries Many were saved and restored after the tram services in the cities stopped

History of the museum 

Before World War II tramways were an important type of public transport in many cities in the United Kingdom After World War II they began to close Many people thought that the trams and tramways got in the way of motor cars and buses and that fuel for buses was costing less than the cost of making electricity Most tram networks in the United Kingdom had closed by 1962 Only one remained in use the Blackpool tramway which still runs today 

In 1948 a group of tramway wiktenthusiastenthusiasts decided to buy an open top tram that they had been on during the last tram ride of Southampton Tramways For just 10 they bought Southampton No 45 Although there were trams and locomotives in British museums there were no working museums or heritage railways in Britain at this time so at first the idea of amateurs running a tramway or railway seemed impossible In 1955 the Tramway Museum Society was started and in 1959 the Society chose a place for the museum after a very long search The site was found by the Talyllyn Railway Preservation Society when they were taking apart the old track from George Stephensons railway for a project in Wales 

In the 1840s when Stephenson was building the North Midland Railway from Derby to Rotherham and Leeds he had found coal buried under the ground on the way to Clay Cross He decided to mine it and make some money Crich already had a limestone quarry when he started Stephenson saw that he could use this limestone and coal to make burnt lime for agricultural use and then use his railway to move it To link the quarry at Crich to the limekilns at Ambergate a new metre gauge railway was built which is said to be the first in the world The museum is built on part of the old Cliff Quarry which Stephensons company bought

After the Tramway Museum Societys members visited the quarry they bought part of the site and buildings Since buying them the society has gotten many trams as well as getting track and power for the trams Many of the tramcars were also repaired In 1967 the society decided that they would start a village around the tramway as trams did not run in limestone quarries This was the start of Crich Tramway Village The museum got lots of street furniture and even some entire buildings Many of these buildings have been changed to hold the museums collections of books pictures and archives 

In 1962 the Tramway Museum Society became a company and a year later it was listed as an educational charity Since then the society has grown with the help of people all over the world The Secretary of State for Culture Media and Sport said that the museum has a very good collection It was one of the first 26 museums that was told this in 1995

Since the start of the 2000s the work of the museums volunteers and the income earned by visitors has been added to by grants from the Heritage Lottery Fund The museum is still an independent charity this means that the government does not pay for it 

In the early 1990s the government of the United Kingdom decided that trams were a way of stopping the traffic problems in the UK New light rail systems or second generation tramways opened in cities like Manchester Sheffield and Nottingham Twenty years later more systems are being built like the one in Edinburgh

Timeline 

The museum has over 60 tramcars from places such as Berlin Blackpool Chesterfield Den Haag Derby Douglas Dundee Edinburgh Gateshead Glasgow Grimsby Halle Howth Johannesburg Leeds Leicester Liverpool London New York Newcastle upon Tyne Oporto Paisley Prague Sheffield Southampton and Sydney

Most of these tramcars are double deckers and some have open tops 

The museum has about fifteen fully working tramcars Every day that the museum is open one to four of those trams are in service on the mile long line There is also a 1969 Berlin tram that has been changed into an Access Tram

Many of the trams can be seen at the museum Some such as Blackpool Dreadnought 59 and Blackpool OMO 5 are stored at Clay Cross 

The museum has trams using four different types of operation horse steam diesel and electricity Electricity is used for most of the service trams and works cars but for one weekend each year a horse tram runs The museum has five horse trams Leamington Warwick 1 Chesterfield 8 Oporto 9 Sheffield 15 and Cardiff 21 but only Sheffield 15 is used The rest are on display The museum also has a steam tram engine on display

Most systems have their overhead wire system built to operate with just one form of current collector The museum has been built to use any of them including trolley poles bow collectors and pantographs Conduit current collection is another form of current collection Blackpool 4 uses this and it was usually used in London

Blue Baby Syndrome is an illness that begins when large amounts of nitrates in water are ingested by an infant and converted to nitrite by the digestive system The nitrite then reacts with oxyhemoglobin to form metheglobin which cannot carry oxygen If a large enough amount of metheglobin is formed in the blood body tissues may be deprived of oxygen causing the infant to develop a blue coloration of their mucous membranes and possibly digestive and respiratory problems This condition is also known as methemoglobinemia

The majority of cases have occurred when nitrate levels have been over 100 mglitre However in many cases bacterial contamination of the water causing gut infections was present or suspected

John Ben Benny Benson Jr was born in Chignik Alaska When he was four years old his mother died Then his father sent him and his brother Carl to boarding school This was because Bennys father could not take care of them Benny grew up in Unalaska and later in Seward

Fame came to him from designing the Alaska flag Benny was the winner of the contest run for Alaska students in grades seven to twelve in 1926 The Alaska Legislature adopted the design as the official flag for the Territory of Alaska on May 2 1927 Later the drafters of the Alaska constitution stipulated that the territorial flag would become the official flag of the State of Alaska

The 2005 civil unrest in France was a series of riots in October and November Many cars and public buildings for example schools were burnt The riots started in October 25 2005 in Clichy sous Bois a suburb of Paris Afterwards they spread to other parts of France Together they lasted for about 3 weeks The riots were a reaction to the accidental death of two teenage boys and the serious injuries of another The three boys hid in a power substation and got an electric shock after being chased by police However the boys did not commit a crime

The The New York Times said the event started at 1720 on Thursday 27 October 2005 in Clichy sous Bois They said they know this from a police report The police were called to a constuction site because of a burglary Three teenagers thought they were being chased by the police so they climed a fence of a power substation This was because the feared long questioning by the police Another 6 teenagers were caught by the police for questioning by 1750 At 1812 at the local police station in Livry Gargan the lights went out because of a black out This black out was caused by the death of Zyed Benna and Bouna Traor in the power station and the injury of the third boy

There is a controversy if the boys were chased by police The local prosecuter and Nicholas Sarkozy who was minister of interior at that time said no But the newspaper The Australian who asked some of his friends said yes

The flag of Hawaii is the official flag of Hawaii as a US state as it was kingdom protector government republic and territory It is the only state flag of the United States to have the Union Flag of the United Kingdom on it

The field of the flag is composed of eight horizontal stripes symbolizing the eight major islands A ninth stripe was once shown meaning the island of Nihoa The color of the stripes from the top down has this pattern white red blue white red blue white red The colors were standardized in 1843 although other combinations have been seen and are occasionally still used The flag of Hawaii is the official symbol of Hawaii as a US state as it previously was a kingdom protectorate republic and territory It is the only state flag of the United States to and the only to feature the Union Jack A ninth stripe was once included representing the island of Nihoacitation needed The color of the stripes from the top down following this pattern white red blue white red blue white red The colors were in 1843 although other combinations have been seen and are occasionally still used

There are a lot of reasons for the earliest history of the flag of Hawaii One said how King Kamehameha I flew a British flag given to him by British explorer Captain George Vancouver as a token of friendship with King George III Other visits reported seeing the flag flying from places of honor An adviser to Kamehameha noted that the Union Flag could draw Hawaii into international problems as his kingdom could be seen as an ally of the United Kingdom and he quickly lowered the Union Flag over his home While argued as historically correct one report of events that followed stated that in order to please American interests during the War of 1812 a flag of the United States was raised over Kamehamehas home only to be removed when British officers in the court of Kamehameha powerfully objected to it This account then explains why the resulting flag of Hawaii was a deliberate combination of the two nations flags

In 1816 Kamehameha appointed his own flag to avoid problems As a result the current flag of Hawaii was born There is debate as to the name of the officer some traditions credit Alexander Adams others George Beckley The original flag was designed to feature stripes alternating in the order red white blue However some have argued that the stripes were influenced by the flag of the United States The flag used at the first official flying of the flag of Hawaii erroneously placed the stripes in the order white red blue The number of stripes also changed originally the flag was designed with seven horizontal stripes and in 1845 it was officially changed to eight stripes The arrangement was adopted and is used today

The flag of Alabama was adopted by the Alabama state legislature on February 16 1895

Its believed that the crimson saltire of the Flag of Alabama was designed to look like the blue saltire of the Confederate Battle Flag The Battle Flag was square shaped and Alabamas flag is sometimes shown as a square The authors of a 1917 article in National Geographic expressed their opinion that because the Alabama flag was based on the Battle Flag it should be square In 1987 Don Siegelman issued an opinion in which the Battle Flag derivation is repeated but concluded that the proper shape is rectangular as it had been depicted numerous times in official publications and reproductions

However the saltire design of the Alabama state flag also looks like several other flags It is identical to the flag of St Patrick incorporated into the Union Flag of the United Kingdom to represent the union of the Kingdom of Great Britain with the Kingdom of Ireland This has led to other origins being put forth as possibilities

The Flag of the United Mexican States or Mexico is a tricolor of green white and red with an eagle charged in the center of the white stripe While the meaning of the colors has changed over time these three colors were adopted by Mexico following independence from Spain during the countrys War of Independence The current flag was adopted in 1968 but the design has been used since 1821 The current law of national symbols Law on the National Arms Flag and Anthem that governs the use of the national flag has been in place since 1984 Red white and green are the colors of the national liberation army in Mexico The central emblem is the ancient Aztec city for Tenochtitlan the center of their empire It recalls the legend that inspired the Aztecs to settle on what was originally a lake island The form of the coat of arms was most recently revised in 1968 Aztec legend held that they should found their city on the spot where they saw an eagle on a cactus eating a snake There is a ribbon in the national colors at the bottom of the coat of arms

The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland uses as its national flag the royal banner known as the Union Flag or popularly Union Jack The design today of the Union Flag comes from the union of Ireland and Great Britain in 1801 It has the red cross of Saint George edged in white on top of the Cross of Saint Patrick which are on the Saltire of Saint Andrew

Its correct measurements are 12 However the British Armed Forces sometimes use a 35 version where two of the red diagonals are cropped

The Union Jack has a legacy for flags and most of the former colonies of Britain have this design on their own flags

Sepp Maier is a former German football player He played for Bayern Munich and the German national team



Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig KT GCB OM GCVO KCIE ADC was the senior British Army commander in World War I 

He commanded the British Expeditionary Force from 1915 to the end of the War Most notably he was commander during the Battle of the Somme the Third Battle of Ypres and the Hundred Days Offensive which led to the German surrender in 1918

A popular commander during the immediate post war years his funeral became a day of national mourning 

Later Haig became an object of criticism After his death he was increasingly criticised for issuing orders which led to excessive casualties of British troops earning him the nickname Butcher of the Somme Haigs critics included the wartime Prime Minister Lloyd George and many younger officers who served in the First World War

Alan Clarks book The Donkeys popularised the controversial phrase lions led by donkeys used to describe the British Army leadership Clark attributed this remark to a German general but before his death admitted he lied about the phrase 

All the same some veterans and academic historians have continued to praise Haigs leadership

Weightlifting first started in the so called Dark Ages of the human history It was usually done by the strongest men in villages all over Europe It was considered to be a sport for the lower classes however since then it has changed into the sport for other people as well It has been in the Olympic Games since 1896

As a competitive sport Weightlifting is controlled by the International Weightlifting Federation Based in Budapest it was founded in 1905

The snatch is one of the two olympic weightlifting events The essence of the event is to lift a barbell from the platform to locked arms overhead in a smooth continuous movement The lift requires not only great strength but mastery of technical skills a high degree of shoulder flexibility excellent balance and speed

The clean and jerk is another olympic weightlifting events It is a highly technical lift that is known as the king of lifts because more weight can be lifted above ones head as compared to any other known weightlifting technique

A mullet is a kind of fish Mullet often jump out of water People are not sure why but it might be because they are trying to see where they are going

In recent years mullet also came to be a slang word for a hairstyle that is short at the front and top and long at the back This slang word is said to have been started by Mike D of the Beastie Boys in 1995 and after 2000 was spread by a small group of people in San Francisco through the Internet

Flag semaphore is a system of spreading information at a distance by using two flags Information is told by the positions of the flags Each set of positions has a meaning 

Signalling uses two flags A person signally would commonly stand on a platform about 6 10ft above the ground They would use a bright orange red and white flag The was a problem because it also made it easier for the enemy to see him and shoot him The newer system uses two short poles with square flags The signalman holds one pole in each hand The poles are held in one of eight possible directions Except for in the rest position the flags do not cross over each other Flags of different colours are used based on whether the signals are sent by sea or by land At sea the flags are coloured red and yellow On land they are white and blue There is also a flag alphabet which consists of many different coloured flags with different symbols on them Here is a list of some examples

Asparagales is an order of flowering plants The order must include the family Asparagaceae but other families included in the order have varied markedly between different classifications No one is sure but it is supposed that this group of plants evolved between the late and early Cretaceous But because of the difficult classification of the families it is not entirely certain when they evolved

Asparagaceae is the botanical name of a family of flowering plants Such a family has been recognized by quite a few taxonomists but hardly universally often the plants involved are treated as belonging to the family Liliaceae 

Hesperocallis is a genus of flowering plants that includes a single species Hesperocallis undulata the desert lily found in the desert areas of the southwest of North America

Hesperocallis has traditionally been classified in Liliaceae but until recently its relationships have been unclear Other classifications have included it in Hemerocallidaceae or Funkiaceae In 1972 Hamilton Traub created the family Hesperocallidaceae with Hesperocallis as the sole included genus The APG II system includes it in the family Asparagaceae in the order Asparagales in the monocots clade but allows for the optional segregation of Hesperocallidaceae as a monophyletic family when several other families are likewise segregated Recent molecular systematic studies have confirmed a close relationship with Agave and its inclusion in family Agavaceae has been recommended

The Laurales are an order of flowering plants They are a basal group of dicots related to and formerly sometimes included in the Magnoliales 

The order includes about 2500 2800 species from 85 90 genera which comprise seven families of trees and shrubs Most of the species are tropical and subtropical though a few genera reach the temperate zone The best known species in this order are those of the Lauraceae and the spice bush or Calycanthus of the Calycanthaceae

The earliest lauraceous fossils are from to the early Cretaceous It is possible that the ancient origin of this order is one of the reasons for its highly diverged morphology Indeed presently no single morphological property is known which would unify all the members of Laurales This fact used to cause much argument among botanists regarding the correct circumscription of the order and the presently accepted classification is based on recent molecular and genetic analysis

Mercury is a dense opaque metallic gray liquid Mercury was often used in thermometers as it expands uniformly with any rise in the temperature However mercury is expensive toxic and cannot be used to measure temperatures lower than 39C Mercury has been replaced largely by alcohol for use in thermometers as alcohol is cheaper and safer than mercury The mercury thermometer was invented by Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit 

Language reform is a type of language planning Language reforms make big changes to a language These changes are usually done to either make a language simpler to understand or to write Sometimes changes are done to make the language purer that is to get rid of foreign parts of the language or to get rid of parts of the language that are not grammatical

Simplification makes the language easier to use It tries to regularise vocabulary and grammar Purification makes the language similar to a version of the language that people think is more pure

Sometimes language reforms were done to unite the people speaking the language For this reason many language reforms happened in 19th century Europe when there was a rise of nationalist movements

The most common form of language reform involves changing the spelling of words This is known as spelling reform Sometimes the grammar of the language is changed Inflection syntax vocabulary and word formation can sometimes be simplified in addition to spelling English uses many different prefixes that mean the opposite of like un in im a de A language reform might suggest that there is only one prefix to mean the opposite of for example un On top of this there are words such as good and bad that roughly mean the opposite of each other but would be better portrayed as good and ungood so the word bad is not part of the language anymore

Another good example of what language simplification can do is the word flammable Flammable means that something can catch fire easily Originally the word was inflammable from Latin inflammare  put something on fire In is also a prefix that can mean the opposite of like with transparent intransparent Today most instructions use flammable rather than inflammable in order not to confuse people that the in in this case does not mean the opposite of 

Several major world languages have been subject to big spelling reforms Spanish Portuguese German and Russian

Some people feel that it is bad to change a language They want to keep a language the way it is now or they want to take back changes to the language that have been done earlier Sometimes purism can make a language more complex because people add false etymologies

Examples of language reforms are

The Beaufort scale is a scale for measuring wind speeds It is based on observation rather than accurate measurement It is the most widely used system to measure wind speed today The scale was developed in 1805 by Sir Francis Beaufort

There are twelve levels plus 0 for no wind From 1946 to 1970 there were also beaufort levels 13 to 17 All of them were labelled as Hurricane Because they were only used in special cases they are no longer in use internationally China and Taiwan still use them because they often have typhoons 

The wave heights given are for waves on the open ocean not near the shore

The early modern period is a term used by historians for the period in Western Europe and its first colonies which spans the three centuries between the Middle Ages and the Industrial Revolution 

The early modern period is characterized by the rise to importance of science and technological progress civic politics and the nation state Capitalism began its rise beginning in northern Italian republics such as Genoa The early modern period also saw the rise and dominance of the economic theory of mercantilism As such the early modern period represents the decline and eventual disappearance in much of the European sphere of feudalism serfdom and the power of the Catholic Church 

The period includes the Protestant Reformation the Thirty Years War the European colonization of the Americas and the peak of the European hunt of witches

The beginning of the early modern period is not clear cut but is generally accepted to be in the late 15th century or early 16th century Significant dates in this phase from medieval to early modern Europe are

The end date of the early modern period is associated with the Industrial Revolution which began in Britain in about 1750 or the beginning of the French Revolution in 1789 which drastically transformed the state of European politics

Among the most important political changes of this time are the broken wikt linkabolitionabolition of serfdom and the change of kingdoms into nation states Then the Reformation that meant that Christendom was no unified entity any more Many kings and rulers used this radical shift in the understanding of the world to further consolidate their sovereignty over their territories For instance many of the Germanic states converted to Protestantism in an attempt to slip out of the power of the Pope

The intellectual developments of the period included the creation of the economic theory of mercantilism and the publication of works of political and social philosophy such as Machiavellis The Prince and Thomas Mores Utopia

The expression early modern is sometimes and incorrectly used as a substitute for the term Renaissance However Renaissance is properly used in relation to a diverse series of cultural developments which occurred over several hundred years in many different parts of Europeespecially central and northern Italyand span the transition from late Medieval civilization and the opening of the early modern period

The term early modern is most often applied to Europe and its overseas empire However in Japan the Edo period from 1590 to 1868 is also sometimes referred to as the early modern period

A drive shaft driving shaft propeller shaft or Cardan shaft is a mechanical device for transferring power from the engine or motor to the point where useful work is applied Most engines or motors deliver power as torque through rotary motion this is extracted from the linear motion of pistons in a broken wikt linkreciprocatereciprocating engine water driving a water wheel or forced gas or water in a turbine From the point of delivery the components of power transmission form the drive train

Drive shafts are carriers of torque they are subject to torsion and shear stress which represents the difference between the input force and the load They thus need to be strong enough to bear the stress without imposing too great an additional inertia by virtue of the weight of the shaft

Most automobiles today use rigid drive shafts to deliver power from a transmission to the wheels A pair of short drive shafts is commonly used to send power from a central differential transmission to the wheels 

In British English the term drive shaft is restricted to a transverse shaft which transmits power to the wheels especially the front wheels A drive shaft connecting the gearbox to a rear differential is called a propeller shaft or prop shaft A drive shaft connecting a rear differential to a rear wheel may be called a half shaft The name comes from the fact that two such shafts are required to form one rear axle

There are different types of drive shafts in Automotive Industry

The Slip in Tube Drive shaft is the new type which also helps in Crash Energy Management It can be compressed in case of crash It is also known as a collapsible drive shaft

Drive shafts have been used on motorcycles almost as long as there have been motorcycles As an alternative to chain and belt drives drive shafts offer relatively maintenance free operation and long life A disadvantage of shaft drive on a motorcycle is that gearing is needed to turn the power 90 from the shaft to the rear wheel losing some power in the process On the other hand it is easier to protect the shaft linkages and drive gears from dust sand and mud

The drive shaft has served as an alternative to a chain drive in bicycles for the past century although never becoming very popular A shaft driven bicycle is described as acatane When used on a bicycle a drive shaft has several advantages and disadvantages

The term power loom corresponds to a mechanized loom powered by a driveshaft The first power loom was designed in 1784 by Edmund Cartwright and first built in 1785 later to be perfected by William Horrocks It allowed textile making to be done far faster than if a human had done the same work By 1850 Cartwrights designs were used in over 250000 machines in England James Henry Northrop invented the automatic weft replenishment loom It revolutionized the weaving industry Some 700000 Northrop automatic looms were sold worldwide

Originally power looms used a shuttle to throw the weft across but in the early part of the 20th century the faster and more efficient shuttleless loom came into use Today advances in technology have produced a variety of looms designed to maximize production for specific types of material The most common of these are air jet looms and water jet looms Computer driven looms are now also available to individual home weavers

Ahmadiyya is a movement founded in the 19th Century by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad from Qadian It was started before India was split into the modern day states of India Pakistan and Bangladesh

Ahmad wanted to make small changes or reforms to Islam In 1914 the movement split into two different groups over a question of who should become the next Caliph Both groups still exist today 

Mirza Ghulam Ahmad was an important religious leader He claimed to have fulfilled the prophecies about the world reformer of the end times Such things were told in the stories and writings of many World religions These stories call the reformer the Mujaddid of the 14th Islamic century the promised Messiah or Mahdi

Ahmadis consider themselves Muslims and claim to practice the Islam that was taught and practised by Muhammad and his followers Mirza Ghulam Ahmad founded the movement in 1889 and named it the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community His goal was to restore life into Islam 

The original Ahmadiyya movement split into two separate groups after the death of Nooruddin the first successor of Ghulam Ahmad

These movements are the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community and the smaller Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement for the Propagation of Islam The groups have different interpretations of Ahmads teachings and claims They also have different opinions on who should have come after Mirza Ghulam Ahmad and how this person should be chosen

The larger faction of the Ahmadiyya Movement known as the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community is active in 190 countries of the world The International Headquarters of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community is currently in London England Further they have created a place called Islamabad in Tilford Surrey the London Mosque and also Western Europes biggest mosque the Baitul Futuh House of Victories in Morden south west London 

The smaller faction known as the Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement is active in 17 countries of the world They are most notable in Germany Australia and Pakistan The International Headquarters of the Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement is in the town of Lahore Pakistan where the Lahore Movement started Within Lahore Pakistan are the Ahmadiyya Buildings Lahore which act as the international administrative base for the Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement 

The views of Ahmadiyya are controversial to popular Islam The majority of Muslims have not accepted Mirza Ghulam Ahmads claims They do not consider Ahmadis to be Muslims Controversial points include the Ahmadiyya view on the death and return of Jesus and their concept of Jihad The Ahmadiyya community also has a different interpretation of verse Quran 3340 of the Quran This verse talks about the finality of Muhammad The members of the Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement are not subject to such criticism because they do not believe in Mirza Ghulam Ahmad was a prophet For this reason they are more close to traditional mainstream Islam Ahmadis argue that their beliefs are in accordance with Islam and using arguments from the Quran Hadith and opinion of Islamic jurists and theologians challenge the contention of the groups calling them non Muslims

Prussian blue also known as Berlin blue is a dark blue colour that is artificially made

It is one of the first pigments made synthetically It was accidentally found in 1704 by two chemists in Berlin

The dark blue uniforms of the Prussian army were dyed this colour

A colour can be shown by hex triplet is a six digit three byte hexadecimal number used in HTML CSS and other computing applications The hex triplet to represent Prussian blue is 003153

When using the RGB color model where red green and blue light are added together Prussian blue has the RGB code of 0 49 83

Prussian blue is a medicine that is sometimes given by doctors to help remove certain radioactive materials from peoples bodies It has been used this way since the 1960s

Prussian blue is a chemical compound One of the chemical elements in this compound is iron 

Researchers have experimented replacing some of the iron atoms in Prussian blue with cobalt When the Prussian blue compound is lit with a red light at 150 C the compound shifts from being non magnetic to magnetic The magnetic shift does not change back except if deliberately reversed with heat

This magnetism is due to the transfer of an electron from the cobalt to the iron with light providing the energy while the electron moves back when heat is applied the researchers said

This magnetic property means the compound can be used in computer storage Because the compound can be turned on and off in a controlled way it can remember binary information Binary information is used for computer storage

This way of using the compound is still being developed

He has announced his intention to run again for the post of London mayor in 2012 In the meantime he has been appointed as an adviser for urban planning to Hugo Chvez

Livingstone was born in Lambeth London England the son of Ethel Ada a professional dancer and Robert Moffat Livingstone who was of Scottish descent and worked as a ships master in the Merchant Navy Livingstone has described his parents as working class Tories 

Livingstone attended Tulse Hill Comprehensive School He did not pass the eleven plus examination in 1956 but still managed to obtain a few O levels He worked for eight years as a cancer research technician between 1962 and 1970 He also trained as a teacher qualifying in 1973 but was never active in the profession Livingstone joined the Labour Party in 1968 at a time when party membership was falling and few new young members were joining and rose rapidly in the local party He was elected to the Lambeth Borough Council in May 1971 and served as Vice Chair of the Housing Committee from 1971 to 1973 At the Greater London Council Election in 1973 elections Livingstone won the Norwood seat on the Greater London Council and served as Vice Chair of Housing Management in 1974 1975 before being dismissed when he opposed spending cuts urged by council leader Sir Reg Goodwin He also served on the film censorship committee and urged the abolition of censorship Coming up to the Greater London Council Election of 1977 Livingstone realised that it would be difficult to retain his seat and managed to be selected for Hackney North and Stoke Newington a safe seat following the retirement of Dr David Pitt Baron Pitt of Hampstead This ensured that he was one of the few left wing Labour councillors to remain on the council

Livingstone had been selected as the Labour Parliamentary candidate for the Hampstead constituency He moved to Camden just before the deadline to stand for the council in 1978 and was elected there Livingstones performance in Hampstead in the United Kingdom 1979 general election was good although he did not come close to winning what was at that time a safe Conservative seat

He married Christine Pamela Chapman in 1973 and the marriage ended in divorce in 1982 Around that time he became involved with Kate Allen now director of Amnesty International in the UK but the couple separated in November 2001

Livingstone and his current partner Emma Beal also his office manager have a son Thomas born 14 December 2002 at the University College Hospital London and a daughter Mia born on 20 March 2004 at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead He also has three other children from previous relationships whose existence was only publicly revealed during the London mayoral election in 2008 Livingstone is a noted bon vivant having twice worked as a food critic for Londons Evening Standard newspaper and various magazines

He is known for his enthusiasm for keeping and breeding newts

Livingstone again stood for Parliament in the 1987 general election winning a seat in the north west London constituency of Brent East He replaced Labour MP Reg Freeson who was a committed left winger but his relatively moderate views made him vulnerable to the hard left in the early 1980s Freeson was able to retain his seat at the 1983 general election but was deselected in 1985 after a bitter struggle described as political murder in his Guardian obituary and replaced as Labour candidate in Brent East by Livingstone 

In his maiden speech to Parliament in July 1987 Livingstone used Parliamentary privilege to raise a number of allegations made by Fred Holroyd a former MI6 operative in Northern Ireland Despite the convention of maiden speeches being non controversial Livingstone alleged that Holroyd had been mistreated when he tried to expose MI5 collusion with loyalist paramilitaries in the 1970s and the part Captain Robert Nairac is alleged to have played He also voiced Colin Wallaces allegations of MI5 dirty tricks levelled at Harold Wilson part of what became known as the Wilson plot

As a Labour backbencher Livingstone lost the public platform he possessed as head of the GLC furthermore his brand of radical socialism was increasingly out of step with the Labour leadership which had moved sharply towards the centre under the leadership of Neil Kinnock who now blamed left wingers like Livingstone for Labours unelectability Over the long term though it was Livingstone rather than Kinnock who was to achieve electoral success In September 1987 he was elected to the partys National Executive Committee although he lost this position two years later he regained it in 1997 beating Peter Mandelson in what some interpreted as a rebuke to Tony Blair He was re elected MP in the general election of 1992 with a 6 swing to Labour in his Brent East constituency Besides serving in the Commons Livingstone held a number of other odd jobs during this period including game show contestant and host after dinner speaker and restaurant reviewer for the Evening Standard In 1987 he published an autobiography cum political tract If Voting Changed Anything Theyd Abolish It

As a politician comfortable in light hearted and satirical situations in 1990 Livingstone made the first of seven appearances on the topical panel show Have I Got News For You For a long time his first six appearances would stand as the shows record his current tally of seven  the last being in 2002  fall one short of the record for guest appearances currently held by Germaine Greer and Will Self

In 1995 Livingstone appeared on the track Ernold Same by the band Blur taken from the album The Great Escape Livingstone provided spoken word vocals and was listed as The Right On Ken Livingstone

Livingstone appeared in one of a series of advertisements extolling the virtues of cheese in the 1980s appropriately endorsing red Leicester On the other side of politics Edward Heath advertised Danish Blue Their respective choices are down to the colour red being associated with the Labour Party and blue with the Conservative Party

Livingstone was again re elected in the 1997 general election in which Labour was returned to power under the leadership of Tony Blair Among Labours proposals was the establishment of a Greater London Authority which was to be a strategic body unlike the GLC the Greater London Authority would not provide any services to Londoners directly The new Greater London Authority would be headed by a directly elected mayor who would be watched over by a 25 member Assembly

Despite having earlier criticised the specific proposals for a new London wide authority Livingstone was widely tipped for the new post of Mayor The mayoral election was scheduled for 2000 and in 1999 Labour began the long and trying process of selecting its candidate Despite Blairs personal antipathy Livingstone was included on Labours shortlist in November 1999 having pledged that he would not run as an independent if he failed to secure the partys nomination William Hague then Leader of the Opposition taunted Blair at Prime Ministers Question Time Why not split the job in two with Frank Dobson as your day mayor and Ken Livingstone as your nightmare

Labour chose its official candidate on 20 February 2000 Although Livingstone received a healthy majority of the total votes he nevertheless lost the nomination to former Secretary of State for Health Frank Dobson under a controversial system in which votes from sitting Labour MPs and MEPs were weighted more heavily than votes from rank and file members On 6 March Livingstone announced that he would run against Dobson as an independent confirming speculation that he would renege on his earlier pledge He was suspended from the Labour Party the same day and expelled on 4 April Tony Blair said that Livingstone as mayor would be a disaster for London he later said he was wrong in that prediction

The result of the election held on 4 May was a foregone conclusion Dobson who it was alleged had been pressured into running by the party leadership unsuccessfully based his campaign on claims that Livingstone was an egomaniac and the Conservatives remained becalmed after their catastrophic national defeat in 1997 Livingstone came out ahead in the first round of balloting with 38 of first preference votes to Conservative Steven Norriss 27 Dobson finished third with 13 of all first preference votes just ahead of Liberal Democrat Susan Kramer with 12 Under the modified instant runoff voting system employed for the election only the votes cast for Livingstone and Norris were considered in the second round where Livingstone won with 58 of first and second preference votes versus 42 for Norris

Livingstone continued to sit in parliament as an independent having had the Labour whip withdrawn until standing down at the 2001 General Election

Livingstone applied for readmittance to the Labour Party in 2002 but was rejected In November 2003 however rumours emerged that the Labour Party would allow Livingstone to rejoin just ahead of the 2004 London mayoral election Opinion polls consistently gave a poor showing to Labours official candidate Nicky Gavron and many in the party leadership feared that Labour would be humiliated by a fourth place finish In mid December Gavron announced she would stand down as the Labour candidate in favour of a unity campaign with Gavron as Livingstones deputy with Labours National Executive Committee voting 25 2 to pave the way for Livingstones readmittance The deal hinged on a loyalty test administered by a special five member NEC panel on 9 January The panel recommended that Livingstone be allowed back in the party The move towards readmittance came amid considerable opposition from senior party members including Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott and former party leader Neil Kinnock In a ballot of Labour Party members in London Livingstone was overwhelmingly endorsed as the Labour candidate for the 2004 Mayoral election

Livingstone was re elected Mayor of London on 10 June 2004 He won 36 of first preference votes to Conservative Steven Norriss 28 and Liberal Democrat Simon Hughess 15 Six other candidates shared the remainder of the votes When all the candidates except Livingstone and Norris were eliminated and the second preferences of those voters who had picked neither Livingstone or Norris as their first choice were counted Livingstone won with 55 to Norriss 45

Livingstone sought re election in 2008 but was defeated by Conservative candidate Boris Johnson on a night that saw the Labour Party suffer its worst electoral defeats for forty years Once first and second votes were taken into account Johnson had 1168738 votes Livingstone 1028966  a margin of 139 772 votes or just over 6 of those who voted

Speaking immediately after the count Johnson paid public tribute to his defeated rival praising the very considerable achievements of the last mayor of London and describing Livingstone as a very considerable public servant Johnson went on to say You shaped the office of mayor You gave it national prominence and when London was attacked on 7 July 2005 you spoke for London

Johnson also spoke of Livingstones courage and the sheer exuberant nerve with which you stuck it to your enemies and expressed a desire that the new Conservative administration could discover a way in which the mayoralty can continue to benefit from your transparent love of London

Livingstones greatest challenge as Mayor of London has been dealing with the citys ageing transportation infrastructure Despite conflict over appropriate funding schemes and engineering challenges to modernising both the London Underground and the citys bus system an Association of London Government survey conducted by MORI towards the end of Livingstones first term in 2004 suggested growing public satisfaction with public transport with buses in particular being seen as more frequent and reliable

In accordance with his pre election pledge bus fares were frozen for four years but then the standard single cash fare on buses more than doubled Further and contrary to his pledge during his first election campaign when he said only a de humanised moron would get rid of the Routemaster Livingstone removed the famous Routemaster buses from routine service on 9 December 2005 claiming it was because the new buses were wheelchair accessible although several of the old buses are used on shortened heritage routes There was some question over the legality of using the old Routemaster under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 as the Routemasters effectively banned wheel chair users

In tandem with the removal of Routemaster buses Livingstone oversaw the introduction of bending articulated buses These buses have faced criticism for allegedly being fire prone dangerous to cyclists and unable to navigate some winding streets see London articulated bus controversy

Livingstone has been a strong proponent of the Oyster card smartcard ticketing system for Londons public transport network introduced in 2003 In late 2005 Livingstone proposed large fare increases for on the spot tickets across the Tube and bus network to encourage regular travellers to use the automated Oyster system to reduce queuing at Underground stations and avoid delays in conductorless buses as drivers issue tickets The plans although ratified by the GLA and introduced in January 2006 were condemned by those who argued that the increases would increase the cost of travelling in London to tourists and others who do not travel regularly Civil liberties groups have expressed concern over the way in which Transport for London is able to track the movements of passengers using the Oyster card system Livingstone moved to make all bus journeys free for passengers under the age of 18 enrolled in full time education who travel with an Oyster card and introduced initiatives to enable visitors to buy an Oyster card before arriving in London

One of the key points of conflict between Livingstone and the Labour Party had been the proposed Public Private Partnership for the London Underground Livingstone had run in 2000 on a policy of financing the improvements to Tube infrastructure by a public bond issue which had been done in the case of the New York City Subway However the Mayor did not have power in this area at the time as the Underground operated independently of Transport for London The PPP deal went ahead in July 2002 but it did not diminish Livingstones desire to re join Labour Metronet one of the winners of the contract for PPP subsequently went into administration in July 2007

Livingstone introduced the London congestion charge with the purpose of reducing traffic congestion in central London Since being introduced the charge has proved to be controversial though Transport for London maintains that traffic has fallen by 20 within the charge zone since the scheme began One reason for the controversy is that whilst the scheme has been lucrative for its private sector operator Capita some people argue it has not made enough money for public transport because the money has been spent on other things

However its apparent success in reducing congestion has led to similar schemes being proposed in other major cities such as New York

In November 2003 Livingstone was named Politician of the Year by the Political Studies Association which said his scheme was bold and imaginative

The United States Embassy for many years has refused to pay the charge because they argue it is a tax and not a charge on congestion

Ken Livingstone has been called an environmentalist a leftist a lover of newts and has made a significant effort to reduce Londons impact on the environment He began by creating the London Hydrogen Partnership and the London Energy Partnership in his first term as Mayor of London The Mayors Energy Strategy green light to clean power commits London to reducing its emissions of carbon dioxide by 20 relative to the 1990 level by 2010 However he does support the Thames Gateway Bridge in East London that Friends of the Earth say would bring few benefits to the local people and lead to more traffic more noise and air pollution and an increase in climate changing emissions In October 2007 London Councils stated Livingstone had gone back on his promise to help chair the developing London Waste and Recycling Board and to provide 6 million of funding for the project because the government had failed to provide him with absolute control of the Board

In June 2007 Livingstone criticised a planned 200 million desalination plant at Beckton which would be the United Kingdoms first calling it misguided and a retrograde step in UK environmental policy and that we should be encouraging people to use less water not more

In 2001 Livingstone set up Britains first register for same sex couples while falling short of legal marriage rights the register was seen as a step towards such rights Legal status was later passed by the government through the Civil Partnership Act 2004

Vatnajkull is the largest glacier in Iceland It lies in the south east of the island covering more than 8 of the country 

The average thickness of the ice is 400 m with a maximum thickness of 1000 m Icelands highest peak Hvannadalshnkur is located in the southern periphery of Vatnajkull near Skaftafell National Park It is classified as an ice cap glacier

Vatnajkull has been shrinking for some years now possibly because of climatic changes and recent volcanic activity Until 1930 it was growing 

According to Guinness World Records Vatnajkull is the object of the worlds longest sight line 550 km from Slttaratindur the highest mountain in the Faroe Islands GWR state that owing to the light bending effects of atmospheric refraction Vatnajkull Iceland can sometimes be seen from the Faroe Islands 340 miles away This may be based on a claimed sighting by a British sailor in 1939 The validity of this record is analysedundermined in mathematical and atmospheric detail by JC de Ferranti 

The InterCity 225 is a locomotive operating in the United Kingdom Its top speed is 225kmh hence its name

British Rail was the national railway company in the United Kingdom from 1948 when the railways were nationalised until 1997 when it was privatised

The rail transport system in Great Britain started to grow in the 19th century It was very dense had many small branch lines and many competing firms Four of these lines were Londons Staines and West Drayton Railway the Sheppey Light Railway in Sussex the Welsh Cambrian Railways and Welsh Highland Railway

During World War One the railways were run by the government until 1921 Railways Act 1921 merged most of the minor lines like the Cambrian Railways into the four biggest firms who took them over Complete nationalisation had been considered but was rejected until the Transport Act 1947 The Cambrian Railways joined the Great Western Railway The Staines and West Drayton Railway had already been taken over by the GWR many years earlier

Some of the lines were to be under shared ownership and jointly run by some of the the Big Four railway firms These lines included the jointly owned Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway between the LMS and the LNER in eastern England and the LMS and LNER owned Cheshire Lines Committee in Cheshire and Lancashire The Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway became owned by the LMS and the SR in south western England GWR and LMS also jointly ran some lines in outer London

The London area railway firms such as the Metropolitan Railway which become part of London Underground in 1933 were not merged Industrial lines like the Oxfordshire Ironstone Railway narrow gauge railways like the Ffestiniog Railway and some light railways like the West Sussex Railway were also excluded The London Passenger Transport Board who run London Underground was a state run firm

After the smaller firms were merged in 1923 under the Railways Act 1921 there were four large regional railway companies The Big 4 were the Great Western Railway the London Midland and Scottish Railway the London and North Eastern Railway and the Southern Railway The Transport Act 1947 made provision for the nationalisation of the network

The Welsh Highland Railway had been deemed unnecessary and too costly to run It was closed in 1937 The Second World War had caused damage to all the railways They had lost a large part of their trains buildings and equipment

The Transport Act 1947 set out the nationalisation of the rail network as part of a plan by Clement Attlees Labour Government to nationalise public transport The London Underground some industrial lines and some remaining light railways like Shropshire and Montgomeryshire Railway were again excluded For a short time during World War II the Shropshire and Montgomeryshire Railway line was taken over by the military After the war the line re opened to public use in 1946 The Bicester Military Railway had been built by the government in 1941

The Transport Act 1947 took effect on 1 January 1923 By that date most of the mergers had taken place some from the previous year The Railway Magazine in its issue of February 1923 dubbed the new companies as The Big Four of the New Railway Era

These Big Four were

The nationalised Ulster Transport Authority ran the railways in Northern Ireland from 1948 until 1966 They were then taken over by Translink and called NI Railways also known as Northern Ireland Railways

The government of Northern Ireland and Ireland ran the former Great Northern Railway jointly under a Great Northern Railway Board until 1958 Most of the lines in Northern Ireland were closed in the 1960s

In 1955 a major modernisation programme costing 12 billion was authorised by the government The period of nationalisation saw sweeping changes occur as steam trains were scrapped 1968 in favour of diesel trains and electric trains Freight now replaced passengers as the main source of business One third of the network was closed by the highly critical Beeching report of the 1960s

A major railway survey in April 1961 was used in the writing of a government report on the future of the network This report was called The Reshaping of British Railways It was published by the BRB in March 1963 as A third of all passenger trains would be scrapped and more than 4000 of the 7000 stations would be closed

InterCity was introduced by British Rail in 1966 as a brand name for its long haul express passenger services

Passenger levels fell steadily from the late 1950s to the late 1970s but experienced a sharp increase after the introduction of the high speed Intercity 125 trains in the late 1970s and early 1980s

Between 1934 and 1975 the Northern line ran the Northern City Line as its Highbury Branch London Underground gave it to British Rail in 1975

Before the sectorization of BR in 1982 the system was split into regions Working around London they were London Midland Region Southern Region Western Region and Eastern Region This was perceived to be a source of inefficiency so sectorization made the regions into a single organisation covering all commuter services At the same time InterCity took over express services and Regional Railways took over regional services The group was originally called Provincial

BR built 2537 steam locomotives from 1948 to 1960 some to pre nationalisation designs and some to its own new standard designs Eventually BR chose to end the use of steam trains in 1968

The official report known as the Modernisation Plan of December 1954 was intended to bring the railway system into the 20th century The aim was to increase speed reliability safety and line capacity by making the railways more attractive to passengers and freight operators The important areas were

Long distance trains from Marylebone began to be cut back from 1958 after the line was given from BR Midland Western to the BR Midland Region Then BR Midland Region thought it was an unnecessary rival of their Midland Main Line By 1960 there were no daytime trains running to destinations north of Nottingham and only a few still ran at night Many Express services were cut By 1963 local stopping services beyond Aylesbury were cut In 1965 freight services were ended Between 1963 and 1966 only a few remaining long distance services stayed in use A large part of the former Great Central Railway was closed as part of the Beeching axe This meant that Marylebone was now used only by local trains to Aylesbury and High Wycombe After the 1960s lack of investment meant the station itself became run down 

Some of the early models were of poor quality and design but many later kinds proved their worth in time

British Rail Class 127 diesel trains were chosen to operate on the services from Marylebone usually to places such as High Wycombe Aylesbury and Banbury which are on the Chiltern Main Line and Great Central Main Line Strangely the 115 were under Table 115 in the British Rail timetable They were similar to British Rail Class 127 but were superior as the class had larger windows better seats lights and wall surfaces Both classes were made in the early 1960s

The British Rail Class 47 is a class of British railway diesel electric locomotive that was developed in the 1960s by Brush Traction Their reliable and trusted service lasted well in to the 2000s

British Rail gave Class 52 to the class of 74 large Type 4 diesel hydraulic locomotives built for the Western Region of British Railways between 1961 and 1964 All were given two word names with the first word being Western and so the type was nicknamed Westerns

Some of the early models were of poor quality and design but many later kinds proved their worth in time

The British Rail Class 207 versatile diesel electric multiple units were built by BR at Eastleigh in 1962

The British Rail Class 423 electrical multiple units were built by BR at York Works from 1967 to 1974 They feature manually opening doors next to every seating row and mostly found working outer suburban services in South London and rural services in Kent and Sussex up to replacement in 2005

The British Rail Class 303 is a type of electric multiple unit They are also known as Blue Train units since they were originally painted blue all over They were first used in 1960 for the electrification of the North Clyde and the Cathcart Circle lines in Strathclyde 

The British Rail Class 73 electro diesel locomotives are very unusual in that they can operate from a 750 V DC third rail supply but also have a diesel engine to allow them to work on non electrified routes

The British Rail Class 86 was the standard electric locomotive built during the 1960s It was made after the repeated testing of the earlier classes like the 81 and 85 The tests led to a much improved loco design

The British Rail Class 312 is a type of alternating current electric multiple unit built in 19661974 intended for use on outer suburban passenger services It was the last class of multiple unit to be constructed to the British Rail Mark 2 body shell and also the last with slam doors Their passenger seats were an improvement on former types

British Rail Class 313 electric multiple units were built by BREL at York Works from 1976 to 1977 thus the first second generation EMUs to be constructed for British Rail They were capable of both drawing power via 25 kV AC overhead or 750 V DC third rail They were the first units in Britain to have fully automatic couplers which allowed both physical coupling and also the connection of control electric and air supplies to be carried out without the drivers need to leave the cab Their passenger seats were also an improvement on former types

During the late 1950s railways continued to worsen and in 1959 the government acted limiting the amount the BTC could spend on British Rail

The government proposed that many services could be provided more cheaply by buses and said that most abandoned rail services would have their places taken by bus services Only main lines would be untouched Many other minor lines would be cut back or scrapped

The business man Lord Beeching saw South Wales as a failing industrial region So it lost the majority of its network Since 1983 it has experienced a major rail revival with new stations such as Llanharan reopening Four lines reopened within 20 miles of each other AbercynonAberdare BarryBridgend via StnlnkLlantwit Major BridgendMaesteg and the Ebbw Valley Line via Newbridge

The station at Laurencekirk on the mainline between Arbroath and Aberdeen was shut in 1967 but 42 years later in May 2009 it reopened Other reopened stations include StnlnkGretna Green StnlnkDyce and StnlnkNew Cumnock all closed in the mid 1960s

Haddenham in Buckinghamshire lost its little used station in 1963 but a more popular station opened in 1987 as the town grew

A major part of the report proposed that British Rail electrify some major main lines and the use of containerised freight traffic instead of outdated and uneconomic wagon load traffic Some of these plans were eventually adopted however such as the creation of the Freightliner concept and further electrification of the West Coast Main Line from Crewe to Glasgow in 1974 Also the staffs terms and conditions were improved over time

Since the Beeching cuts of the 1960s road traffic levels grew heavily in some areas This has come close to gridlock Furthermore in recent years there have been record high levels of passengers on the railways A modest number of the railway closures have therefore been reversed

In addition a small but significant number of closed stations have reopened and passenger services been restored on lines where they had been closed or removed Many of these were in the urban metropolitan counties and towns where Passenger Transport Executives have a role in promoting local passenger rail use

A notable reopening was the Robin Hood Line in Nottinghamshire between Nottingham and Worksop via Mansfield which reopened in the early 1990s Before the line reopened Mansfield had been the largest town in Britain without a railway station

Profits from the railways began to fall in the early 1980s In 1983 the civil servant Sir David Serpell wrote what became known as the Serpell Report He wanted even more cutbacks

In the early 1980s there was a proposal to close Marylebone and divert British Rail services via High Wycombe into nearby Paddington There was also a plan to extend the Metropolitan Line to Aylesbury so London trains via Amersham would be sent to Baker Street Marylebone station was to be converted into a bus and coach station London Underground said the Metropolitan Line could not cope with any more trains and was full up However these plans were deemed stupid and clumsy and were quietly dropped

The funding of BR was reduced so they created the cheaper Pacer trains The British Rail Class 143 is a diesel multiple unit part of the Pacer family of trains introduced between 1985 and 1986 They originally worked around North East England but were later transferred to Wales It was made out of bus parts put on to lorry chassis and train wheels Earlier units proved to be unreliable but later units were of a better design

The British Rail Class 156 Super Sprinter diesel multiple unit were built from 1987 to 1989 to replace elderly First Generation Heritage DMUs and locomotive hauled passenger trains

As funding increased before privatisation the successful British Rail Class 158 Express Sprinter was made It is a type of diesel multiple unit train They were built for British Rail between 1989 and 1992 by BREL at their Derby Works

On 12 December 1988 three commuter trains crashed just south west of Clapham junction station in London 35 people died and more than 100 were injured British Rails 30 year old vintage Mark 1 carriages were found out to be dangerous and the broken signalling equipment was fixed and improved

The British government under John Major said that privatisation would help passenger services but this did not happen until much later

The Scottish Assembly Government have re opened the lines between Hamilton and Larkhall Alloa and Stirling and is working on a link from Airdrie to Bathgate The biggest line reopening project is the former Waverley railway Edinburgh to Borders line

The Welsh Assembly Government has re opened the Vale of Glamorgan Line between Barry Bock and Bridgend in 2005 The Ebbw Valley Line reopened between Ebbw Vale and Cardiff in the year 2008 It will later go on to services to Newport in Gwent in 2011 The BarryBridgend route was closed after the Beeching report of March 1963 The lines passenger service was officially shut down in June 1964 but freight continued until the late 1990s

Some English stations like Corby and Mansfield were reopened after privatisation

Regional Railways was one of the three passenger sectors of British Rail It was created in the year 1982 It finished operation in 1996 two years after privatisation In the privatisation of British Rail InterCity trains were divided up into several franchises The Caledonian Sleeper are transferred to ScotRail now First ScotRail

Since privatisation the number of companies has changed a number of times as rules have changed and the areas covered altered The companies that took over passenger rail services include

  

Six sub brands also occurred in the early 2000s

Wales and Borders now part of Arriva Trains Wales

Wessex Trains now part of First Great Western

 Silverlink Metro now London Overground

 Silverlink County now part of London Midland

 Great Northern Electrics now part of National Express East Anglia

The British Rail double arrow logo was said to show direction of travel on a double track railway on a railway map and was nicknamed the arrow of indecision It is now employed as a general symbol on street signs in Great Britain but not in Northern Ireland denoting railway stations and as part of the Association of Train Operating Companiess joint managed National Rail brand still being printed on railway tickets

Sometimes strikes happened among British Rail staff over staff pay safety working hours and alike There were several strikes in the late 1970s but decreased after privatisation There were also several other strikes in the late 1970s Other firms like the UKs coal mines also struck at this time

The King Cobra is a species of the Elapidae family It is the worlds longest venomous snake with a length that can be as large as 56 m This species is found in a number of areas found throughout south eastern Asia and into Pakistan and India Its genus name Ophiophagus literally means snake eater and its diet primarily consists of other snakes including larger pythons and even smaller members of its own species The venom of the King Cobra is primarily neurotoxic and the snake is fully capable of killing a human with a single bite The mortality rate can be as high as 75 without antivenom

Cobras are venomous snakes of the familys Elapidae of several genera but particularly Naja Cobras generally inhabit tropical and desert regions of Asia and Africa When feeling threatened cobras can tilt back and flatten their heads into their known by sight warning posture The rest of the time their heads are symmetrical and they look much like any other snakes

The Cape Cobra is a cobra inhabiting the regions of South Africa It averages 4 feet long but may grow to be 6 feet long The color varies from location to location and those from the Kalahari are normally yellow with brown speck uniformly all over the body

The Kalahari Desert is a large arid to semi arid sandy area in southern Kgalagadi Africa extending 900000 km covering much of Botswana and parts of Namibia and South Africa It has huge tracts of excellent grazing after good rains

The Kalahari Desert is the southern part of Africa and the geography is a portion of desert and a plateau The Kalahari supports some animals and plants because most of it is not a true desert There are small amounts of rainfall and the summer temperature is very high It usually receives 37 12 inches of rain per year 

The surrounding Kalahari Basin covers over 25 million km extending farther into Botswana Namibia and South Africa and encroaching into parts of Angola Zambia and Zimbabwe The only permanent river the Okavango flows into a delta in the northwest forming marshes that are rich in wildlife Ancient dry riverbedscalled omurambatraverse the Central Northern reaches of the Kalahari and provide standing pools of water during the rainy season Previously havens for wild animals from elephant to giraffe and for predators such as lion and cheetah the riverbeds are now mostly grazing spots though leopard or cheetah can still be found

The Kalahari has a number of game reservesthe Central Kalahari Game Reserve Khutse Game Reserve and the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park Animals that live in the region include brown hyenas lions meerkats giraffe warthogs jackals and several species of antelope and many species of bird and reptiles Vegetation in the Kalahari consists mainly of grasses and acacias but there are over 400 identified plant species present Camel rides across the desert are also offered

The Bushmen of the Kalahari were huntergatherers They hunted for meat and gathered the food of the desert to eat They did not keep animals They moved from place to place to find food and water They owned very few things because they had to carry everything themselves Very few people still live this way anywhere in the world

Mahmud I was the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1730 to 1754 He was the son of Mustafa II and his mother Emetullah Sultan was of Greek ethnic descent Mahmud I was the older brother of Osman III

Mahmud II was the 30th Sultan of the Ottoman Empire He ruled from 1808 until his death Mahmud was the son of Sultan Abdl Hamid I His time as sultan is notable mostly for the major legal and military changes he caused

Mahmud II proclaimed himself the Seljuk sultan of Baghdad in 1118 following the death of Mehmed I Mahmud fought against the Seljuk Sultan of Khorasan Ahmed Sanjar whom Mehmed I had revolted against in 1105 Mahmud was succeeded by Dawud

Mahmud of Ghazni also known as Ymn al Dawlah Mamd was the ruler of the Ghaznavid Empire from 997 until his death Mahmud turned the former provincial city of Ghazni into the wealthy capital of an extensive empire which included modern day Afghanistan most of Iran as well as regions of north west India including modern day Pakistan He was also the first ruler to carry the title Sultan signifying his break from the suzerainty of the Caliph

The Ghaznavid Empire was a Khornian Sunni Muslim state founded by a dynasty of Turkic mamluk origin which existed from 975 to 1187 It was centered in Ghazni a city in present Afghanistan and ruled much of Persia Transoxania and the northern parts of the Indian subcontinent Due to the political and cultural influence of their predecessors  that of the Persian mn dynasty  the originally Turkic Ghaznavids had become thoroughly Persianized

Sultan Mahmud Shah ruled Malacca from 1488 to 1528 He was the son of Sultan Alauddin Riayat Shah

The Durrani Empire was a large state founded in what is now Afghanistan and Pakistan and later included northeastern Iran and even parts of western Republic of India

Cognitive psychology is a branch of psychology that looks at basic actions of the mind like problem solving memory and language Cognitive psychologists most often look at mental changes than happen after a stimulus and before a behavioral response 

Cognitive psychology had its beginnings in the Gestalt psychology of Max Wertheimer Wolfgang Khler and Kurt Koffka and in the work of Jean Piaget who came up with a theory of stages or phases that describe childrens cognitive development

Social psychology is the study of how people and groups interact Scholars in this interdisciplinary area are typically either psychologists or sociologists though all social psychologists employ both the individual and the group as their units of analysis 

Despite their similarity psychological and sociological researchers tend to differ in their goals approaches methods and terminology They also favor separate academic journals and professional societies The greatest period of collaboration between sociologists and psychologists was during the years immediately following World War II Although there has been increasing isolation and specialization in recent years some degree of overlap and influence remains between the two disciplines

Neuropsychology is the scientific discipline that studies the structure and function of the brain related to more common psychological processes and overt behaviors The term has been applied to lesion studies in humans and animals It has also been applied to efforts to record electrical activity from individual cells in higher primates

Abnormal psychology is the interpretive and scientific study of abnormal thoughts and behavior in order to understand and correct abnormal patterns of functioning The definition of what constitutes abnormal has varied across time and across cultures and varies among individuals within cultures It is often associated with a mental disorder Abnormal psychology can be described as an area of psychology that studies people who are consistently unable to adapt and function effectively in a variety of conditions

John Broadus Watson was an American psychologist who established the psychological school of behaviorism after doing research on animal behavior 

Watson was forced to resign his chair at Johns Hopkins University Baltimore because his affair with a graduate student became a public scandal After this Watson worked for many years for J Walter Thompson a leading American advertising agency He is credited with popularizing the coffee break during an ad campaign for Maxwell House coffee

Watson founded behaviorism in the spring of 1913 with his paper Psychology as the behaviorist views it In this article Watson outlined the major features of his new philosophy of psychology called behaviorism The first paragraph of the article concisely described his position

 Psychology as the behaviorist views it is a purely objective experimental branch of natural science Its theoretical goal is the prediction and control of behavior Introspection forms no essential part of its methods nor is the scientific value of its data dependent upon the readiness with which they lend themselves to interpretation in terms of consciousness The behaviorist in his efforts to get a unitary scheme of animal response recognizes no dividing line between man and brute The behavior of man with all of its refinement and complexity forms only a part of the behaviorists total scheme of investigation 

In 1913 Watson viewed Ivan Pavlovs conditioned reflex as primarily a physiological mechanism controlling glandular secretions He had already rejected Edward L Thorndikes Law of Effect because of what Watson believed were unnecessary subjective elements The article is also notable for its strong defense of the objective scientific status of applied psychology which at the time was considered to be much inferior to the established experimental psychology

With his behaviorism Watson put the emphasis on external behavior of people and their reactions on given situations rather than the internal mental state of those people In his opinion the analysis of behaviors and reactions was the only objective method to get insight in the human actions This outlook was thought to be extreme or radical behaviorism

Watson wrote the book Psychological care of infant and child in 1928 with help from his mistress turned wife Rosalie Rayner Rosalie later entitled a self penned article I am a mother of behaviorist sons In the book Watson explained that behaviorists were starting to believe psychological care and analysis was required for infants and children

His slogan was not more babies but better brought up babies Watson argued for the nurture side of the nature nurture debate claiming that the world would benefit from extinguishing pregnancies for twenty years while enough data was gathered to ensure an efficient child rearing process Watsons description of a happy child was rather detached It included ideas such as that the child can occupy himself through his problem solving abilities should only cry when in physical pain and that the child stray from asking questions Behavior analysis of child development as a field may have begun with the writings of Watson

Watsons views and life have been the subject of a number of works

Indian English comprises several dialects or varieties of English spoken primarily in India and by first generation members of the Indian diaspora This dialect evolved during and after the British colonial rule of India English is the co official language of India with about 90 million speakers but with fewer than quarter of a million calling it a first language

In nineteenth century India Britain first faced the possibility of having to teach English to a body of people who were important to Britain There were a number of English medium schools in India mostly under the control of missionaries and many primarily targeted at European and Eurasian children and orphans The products of these schools provide the first generation of teachers

Ivan Petrovich Pavlov was a Russian physiologist psychologist and physician 

He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1904 for research about the digestive system Pavlov is widely known for first describing classical conditioning

The son of a priest and a theology student Pavlov turned to science after being influenced by progressive ideas He took natural sciences at the University of St Petersburg and got a doctorate in 1878

In the 1890s Pavlov was investigating the gastric function of dogs by externalizing a salivary gland so he could collect measure and analyze the saliva and what response it had to food under different conditions He noticed that the dogs tended to salivate before food was actually delivered to their mouths and set out to investigate this psychic secretion as he called it Pavlov performed and directed experiments on digestion eventually publishing The work of the digestive glands in 1897 after 12 years of research His experiments earned him the 1904 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine

The concept for which Pavlov is famous is the conditioned reflex he developed with his assistant Ivan Tolochinov in 1901

As Pavlovs work became known in the West particularly through the writings of John B Watson the idea of conditioning as an automatic form of learning became a key concept in the developing specialism of comparative psychology and the general approach to psychology called behaviourism 

The British philosopher Bertrand Russell was an enthusiastic advocate of the importance of Pavlovs work for philosophy of mind

Pavlovs research on conditional reflexes greatly influenced not only science but also popular culture The phrase Pavlovs dog is often used to describe someone who merely reacts to a situation rather than using critical thinking Pavlovian conditioning was a major theme in Aldous Huxleys dystopian novel Brave New World and also to a large degree in Thomas Pynchons Gravitys Rainbow 

It is popularly believed that Pavlov always signalled the food by ringing a bell However his writings also record the use of many stimuli including electric shocks whistles metronomes tuning forks and a range of visual stimuli Catania did not believe Pavlov ever actually used a bell in his famous experiments Littman tentatively attributed the popular imagery to Pavlovs contemporaries Vladimir Bekhterev and John B Watson until Thomas found several references that clearly said Pavlov did indeed use a bell

It is less widely known that Pavlovs experiments on the conditional reflex included children some of whom apparently underwent surgical procedures similar to the dogs for the collection of saliva

The Quagga also called the Cape Quagga is a recently extinct zebra It was one of the six subspecies of plains zebra It was a yellowish brown zebra with stripes only on its head neck and forebody The Quagga was native to dry grassy plains in the south of the African continent It was found as far north as the Orange River It is believed to have separated from other other plains zebras between 12000 and 290000 years ago The name Quagga comes from the noise that they made

The Quagga was hunted for food and also because farmers did not want it to eat the grass they needed for their sheep and goats The last wild Quaggas died during a drought in 1878 The last captive Quagga died in the Amsterdam Zoo on 12 August 1883 Her body is now a museum There are 23 Quagga specimens in museums seven skeletons and some skulls and other bones

Perry is separated from her husband comedian actor Russell Brand she previously dated Gym Class Heroes lead singer Travie McCoy

One of the Boys is the first album by pop singer Katy Perry 

A music video for the song was released on May 16 2008 on Perrys personal website and on MySpace The video was directed by Kinga Burza and features a Moulin Rouge and burlesque type setting with scenes containing Katy along with many other flamboyantly dressed women dancing to the song Eventually she wakes up next to a male companion Katys real life boyfriend Gym Class Heroes band member Travis McCoy Despite the songs title there isnt any depiction of same sex kissing Katy features her real life friend and DJ Mia Moretti and her main gay Markus Molinaris dog Bella in the video Even her cat Kitty Purry makes an appearance 

The video made its television debut on June 12 on TRL with the visit and interview by Perry in set show And on June 24 2008 it became 1 on TRL The video obtained high airplay on this music video channel as well as on VH1 It debuted at 20 on VH1s VH1 Top 20 Video Countdown on June 28 2008 On June 30 2008 the video was premiered on MTV Latin America On July 6 2008 it rose to 4 on VH1s VH1 Top 20 Video Countdown The video received five nominations for the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards including Best Female Video and Best New Artist The video has had over 24 million views on YouTube Due to the video and the songs popularity around the world there are several videos on YouTube which imitate and mock the song such as I Kissed A Pig and I Kissed A Dog both of which use the same tune and similar lyrics while the videos use similar scenes to the original

I Kissed a Girl has drawn mixed reviews from critics Blogcritics Magazine called it an instantly catchy number and Aboutcom said fueled by an instrumental wallop provided courtesy of producer Dr Luke I Kissed a Girl is the perfect breakthrough

However Rolling Stone while giving her album 25 stars despite describing the song as a New Wave y club single says the supposedly rebellious attention grabbing lyrics are a vanilla recounting of her chick on chick exploits and that this acting out is just to get a dudes attention AllMusic praises the stomping Gary Glitter beat before criticizing the producers for turning it into a leaden stumble and burying Perrys voice underneath Pro Tools overdubs so it all winds up as a faceless wash of sound designed to be placed in TV shows movie trailers and malls

Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine wrote Perrys lead single I Kissed a Girl features a throbbing beat and an infectious bi curious hook but its self satisfied in your face posturing rings phony in comparison to the expertly constructed ambiguities of Justify My Love or practically anything in the first decade of Ani DiFrancos catalogue its like a tween version of DiFrancos tortured bisexual confession Light of Some Kind Hiponlinecom wrote that the song is not nearly as interesting or exciting as youd expect Its not even half as good as Jill Sobules song I Kissed a Girl Glitterati Gossip agrees Sobules song was ten times better because there was actual emotional content to her lyrics

The song was premiered on BBC Radio 1 in the UK on July 21 2008 on The Scott Mills Show It was praised by many fans on their text lines and was made his record of the week On July 23 2008 I Kissed a Girl was added to the stations C List The Playlist being where most songs on daytime Radio 1 are selected from The song has since made it to the stations more popular A list 

Previous to its debut on Radio 1 it had been on the playlist of some of the UK radio stations which are part of The One Network for a number of weeks In addition it had received at least one play a week on BBC Radio 2 on its Saturday evening Americas Greatest Hits show hosted by Paul Gambaccini due to the songs number status in the Billboard chart

The song gained a significant amount of controversy after its rise in popularity due to its perceived promotion of bisexuality and promiscuity While community members and parents may be concerned over the the coarseness of the sexual behavior including its public nature and intoxicated state they may or such as Unitarian minister Debra W Haffner may not be concerned over the sex or gender of the person shes talking about

While Haffner who holds a degree in public health believes Perry obviously is using the whole issue of sexual orientation in a positive way raising awareness or shes doing it because it gets attention AllMusic concludes that the problem is not with Katys gender bending its that her heart isnt in it shes just using it to get her places so she sinks to crass craven depths Slant Magazine agrees saying the song isnt problematic because it promotes homosexuality but because its appropriation of the gay lifestyle exists for the sole purpose of garnering attentionboth from Perrys boyfriend and her audience

Adam Holz of PluggedinOnline a division of Focus on the Family wrote an article entitled A Tale of Two Katys about the singers image transformation from a Contemporary Christian Music artiste to one of the girls gone wild He criticizes the song for being the latest high profile message to young women and men that our sexuality is a malleable commodity that can be reshaped at will Holz also argues that Perrys message carries with it no need to worry about who might get used or objectified in the process causing Katy to live down to a damaging demeaning stereotype

In some areas of the world the songs bi curious lyrics have kept it from reaching the Top 40 or to even be released at all Though the Toronto Star of Canada describes it as a lesbian friendly tune whether anti gay bias fuels negative reactions to the song or the song itself appears to divide critics While Slant and other critics suggest that Perry may be homophobic especially given her single Ur So Gay which makes I Kissed a Girl seem like a classic example of the Guys kissing is gross girls kissing is hot line of thought The Star Ledger quotes a listener who proposes that negative reactions to the song are due to homophobia saying that it would not draw disapproval if sung by a male artist and who compares the level of explicitness in the lyrics with other songs on the radio such as rap lyrics MomLogiccom writer Vuv A Licious agrees asking Whats the big dealWhen this tune is playing and my son and daughter are dancing I will be trying to dance along or trying to acknowledge that they may one day dance to the beat of a different drummer than me

During her Washington concert at Warped Tour Perry actually did kiss a girl from the audience

In an August 2008 interview with the Daily Mail Perrys mother Mary Hudson who is an evangelical Christian preacher was reported as saying that she disliked the song stating It clearly promotes homosexuality and its message is shameful and disgusting However Perry took to her official blog stating that her mothers supposed comments were completely fabricated while also saying her parents love and support her and attend many of her shows

Regarding the question of her own sexuality that the song has raised Perry told Santa Barbara magazine I like to kiss boys but there is no doubt in my mind if Angelina Jolie or Gisele Bndchen came a callin who wouldnt pucker up

It is a large crow sized falcon with a blue grey back barred white underparts and a black head and moustache It can fly at up to 322 kmh which means it is the fastest animal in the world As with other bird eating raptors the female is bigger than the male There are 1719 subspecies recorded and each varies slightly in appearance and where they live There is disagreement over whether the distinctive Barbary Falcon is a subspecies of the Peregrine or just a different species

The use of certain pesticides especially DDT was not good for the animals It could be shown that in areas where DDT was used the thickness of the shells of their eggs was reduced This caused a dramatic decline in their numbers in certain countries Since the use of DDT has been forbidden in many countries their numbers are increasing again This recovery was helped because their nesting places were protected in many countries some countries also bred these falcons and released them into the wild

The music video for Dead Memories was directed by P R Brown On September 30 2008 the bands record label Roadrunner Records released a 15 second teaser video on YouTube which showed vocalist Corey Taylor in what looks like to be a grave in heavy rainfall The video came out on MTVs Headbangers Ball on October 25 2008 as part of the Headbangers Ball 20th anniversary special programming The concept of the music video was percussionist Shawn Crahans idea Crahan calls the music video a short film and said that it was a very expensive video to make Crahans original idea was to have several rooms he shared his idea with to vocalist Corey Taylor who decided what each room would be

The video starts off with Taylor seen without his mask and dressed in casual clothes carrying a shovel and smoking a cigarette He walks from an urbanized area in to a more rural area in the fields and begin to dig at the ground He then seemingly falls through the ground and into a room below dressed in his Slipknot mask and cover alls The first room which is a dark room with faint red lighting shows turntablist Sid Wilson who is seen barefoot climbing all over the walls and is covered in dust and cobwebs Taylor opens the drapes to attempt to look out of the window but can only see dirt Wilson is then seen physically trying to stop Taylor from leaving the room by grabbing his pant leg However Taylor eventually leaves the room and enters a second which is occupied by drummer Joey Jordison with tree branches instead of fingers and a crown of thorns on his head The room features many photographs of Jordison on the walls and he is sitting in a chair surrounded by several females Taylor walks around the scene looking at them without interacting with Jordison or the females there is a moment in which Jordison is looking in a mirror and Taylor suddenly appears Taylor then leaves the room and enters a third which is occupied by sampler Craig Jones who is standing straight upright and does not move throughout the scene When Taylor enters the room the video is solarized and remains so throughout the time Taylors in there Taylor walks around Jones and inspects his mask and is seen touching the nails protruding from it Jones then lights a smoke flare which blinds Taylor and is seen holding it in his right hand but he Taylor finds the door then leaves the room and enters a fourth which is occupied by bassist Paul Gray

This room is filled with mirrors similar to that of a house of mirrors Taylor is seen walking through the room while Gray seemingly follows him Taylor then focuses on Gray and makes a waving gesture to seemingly establish if its a mirror Gray then gets aggravated looks up and hits the mirror viciously and Taylor is seen looking at a broken mirror and a reflection of himself Taylor after he looks himself in the mirror screams and looks around anxiously before he falls backwards out Paul Grays rooms door and lands into a fifth room which is occupied by percussionist Shawn Crahan Crahan is seen with several females dancing around him while holding his baseball bat Taylor is seen returning to his feet and he pushes his way through the crowd Two of the females are seen trying to physically stop him from leaving the room by grabbing his clothes Taylor then enters a sixth room which is a thin blank corridor occupied by guitarist Mick Thomson The two seemingly stand off Taylor is seen trying to push past Thomson several times but is knocked backward several times with Taylor is then seen stood at another door as if Thomson was simply a mirage He enters a seventh room which is occupied by guitarist James Root Root is seen with several females in a room which is classically decorated Throughout this room the video is reversed Taylor is seen walking through the crowd almost unnoticed He then enters an eighth room which is occupied by percussionist Chris Fehn Fehn is seen lighting candles in the room which has walls covered in art Taylor is seen observing and gaining interest in his actions while a female is seen walking around the room Fehn is then seen lighting a candle and gives it to Taylor who blows it out Taylor is then seen in casual clothes again outside in the rain digging when a second Taylor rises from the hole dressed in his Slipknot mask and uniform and the two see each other as it fades to black

During album reviews for All Hope Is Gone Dead Memories was given good feedback for its melody and accessibility Reviewing for Blabbermouthnet Ryan Ogle says that the single shows Slipknots diversity he went on to say that it is well written and melodious Dan Martin from The Guardian compared it to Metallicas song Enter Sandman and went on to say it is so listenable its almost conventional However Jim Kaz of IGN said that the song almost detracts from the intensity of the album stating its at this point the band loses a little momentum Additionally Ogle of Blabbermouthnet also said that its a song that lacks the white hot fire that allows the rest of the disc to burn our asses

Immigration is people moving into a country to live People who immigrate for political asylum are called refugees People who immigrate are called immigrants

Immigrant and emigrant do not mean the same thing An emigrant is a person that leaves his or her own country or region and an immigrant is a person that comes from other country or region

The phrases many people emigrated from Europe in the 19th century AD to America and many people immigrated to America from Europe in the 19th century have the same meaning

People immigrate for several reasons

Immigration has always been difficult When people immigrates they leave behind their friends families and culture They also have to sell what they have like a house farm or anything else too big to bring

Travelling can also be very expensive Many immigrants have to use all their money to pay fees or plane tickets

Once immigrants arrive in the new countries they can face many difficulties They may be have get a job find a house and learn a new language Immigrants can also be victims of racism

Sadism is a medical condition in which people get pleasure from humiliating or hurting others Often the pleasure is of a sexual kind When a person finds pleasure in being hurt or humiliated their condition is called Masochism

The terms sadism and masochism were both invented by Richard von Krafft Ebing a German psychiatrist He named Sadism after the Marquis de Sade a French nobleman who in the eighteenth century wrote many books stories and plays Sades books include many characters who find pleasure in cruelty including torture and even murder

At first Sadism meant only cruelty for sexual pleasure but as the word became more widely used its meaning changed Nowadays any person who enjoys being cruel to others can be called sadistic even if they get no sexual excitement from what they do

Some people who have sadistic sexual fantasies mean no real harm to anyone In BDSM a top or dominant person will bind his or her partner or punish them in different ways but what they do will not go beyond limits which the partner has agreed on On the other hand a small minority are severely perverted or mentally ill and wish to act out their sadistic fantasies for real Such people are rare but they can be very dangerous Many serial killers and psychopaths have been sexual sadists

Treating sadism is difficult but it looks like psychotherapy can help in certain cases

In computer networking network address translation is a technique of modifying the network address information in the IP packet headers while transferring the packet across a traffic routing device such technique remaps a given address space into another address space 

Today NAT is used to hide networks or to hide IP Masquerading is the mechanism that hides an entire address space usually consisting of private network addresses behind a single IP address usually in the public domain address space 

The NAT mechanism is implemented inside a routing device that uses a certain type of firewalls that keep track of the state of the network connections Such kind of firewalls use translation tables to map the hidden addresses into a single address and then rewrites the outgoing IP packets on exit from the router so that they appear to originate from the router In the reverse communications path responses to the outgoing packets are mapped back to the originating IP address using the reverse of the rules stored in the translation tables The outgoing IP packets establish the device translation tables

The translation table rules established in the above way are cleared after a short period without new traffic refreshing their state However most NAT devices today allow the network administrator to configure translation tables entries for permanent use This feature is often referred to as static NAT or port forwarding and allows traffic originating in the outside network to reach selected hosts in the masqueraded network

A router is a computer whose software and hardware are customized to move data between computer networks They are responsible for making sure traffic between computers gets where it needs to go They do this by choosing the shortest path between the computers using a complicated system of rules called Routing Protocols Routers generally contain a specialized operating system RAM NVRAM flash memory and one or more processors as well as two or more network interfaces They come in a variety of sizes from something you could hold in your hand to something too large for one person to lift 

If you have an internet connection you probably have a router somewhere that your computer sends data to This is the first router your computer will connect to in order to get to the internet It is also known as a default gateway By convention the gateway has the lowest IP address in the subnet Anytime you make a connection your computer looks up the IP address using the look up service called DNS Once the destination address has been found your computer connects to your gateway router The gateway then sends data to a router at your ISP that router can be said to be part of the internet and connects to other routers until the data reaches the destination

In small networks such as homes small businesses and small schools the router also performs NAT which makes all outgoing connections look like they come from one address Typically incoming connections are only allowed if they are replies to connections made by a computer inside the NAT

Routers connect two or more networks and direct traffic between them These networks may be physical or logical The term layer 3 switch often is used used the same as router but it is a general term without a technical definition Layer 3 switch implies a device that is built to connect Ethernet devices in a LAN but can also perform routing

Router operating systems are split into two parts

Masochism is a medical condition People who suffer from it can get pleasure from being hurt or humiliated by others Often the pleasure is sexual When a person gets pleasure from being the one who causes hurt or humiliation their condition is called Sadism

The word masochism was invented by Richard von Krafft Ebing a German psychiatrist He named it after Leopold von Sacher Masoch a writer whose books and stories often featured men in love with women who treated them cruelly

Many people with masochistic feelings do not really want to be ill treated They want to act out their daydreams such as being tied up and kidnapped or becoming the slave of another person In BDSM people often agree who will be top and bottom before they do anything together and talk about exactly what they will do People who practise this kind of masochism usually do it for sexual excitement and have sex afterwards It is a kind of foreplay

Most people who practise BDSM are concerned about their partners safety When people are careless about safety or have no partner and play masochistic games when they are alone it can be very dangerous In some cases people have died from such games especially when they involve making it difficult to breathe for instance by putting a rope or cord around their neck or a rubber mask over their head and putting themselves in handcuffs

Some people suffer from emotional masochism They are more comfortable when they feel sad or consider themselves failures in life or prefer to be in a relationship with someone who cheats or insults them People who have these kind of feelings may have been bullied or abused earlier in life or may feel that they do not deserve success and happiness

Treating masochism is difficult but it looks like psychotherapy can help in certain cases People who like to be hurt during sex often dont want to be treated and say that they are happy the way they are

In Internet terminology a private network is typically a network that uses private IP address space following the RFC 1918 standard Computers may be allocated addresses from this address space when it is necessary for them to communicate with other computing devices on an Intranet network

Private networks are quite common in home and office local area network designs as many organizations do not see a need for globally unique IP addresses for every computer printer and other devices that the organizations use Private IP addresses were created due to the shortage of publicly registered IP addresses created by the IPv4 standard One of the reasons IPv6 was created is to overcome this limitation of the IPv4 standard However IPv6 still did not achieve a widespread use

Routers on the Internet should be configured to discard any packets containing private IP addresses in the IP packet header This isolation gives private networks a basic form of security as it is not usually possible for the outside world to establish a connection directly to a machine using these private addresses As connections cannot be made between different private networks via the internet different organizations can use the same private address range without risking address conflicts

If a device on a private network needs to communicate with other networks a mediating gateway is needed to ensure that the outside network is presented with an address that is real so that Internet routers allow the communication This gateway is typically a NAT device or a proxy server Public Internet Routers by default will not forward packets with RFC 1918 addresses Unlike public Internet routers that need additional configuration to forward these packets internal routers do not need any additional configuration to forward these packets

This can cause problems however when organizations try to connect networks that both use the same private address spaces There is a potential for clashes and routing problems if both networks use the same IP addresses for their private networks or if both networks depend on NAT to connect them through the Internet

The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority is the entity that manage global IP address allocation DNS root zone management media types and other Internet protocol assignments It is operated by ICANN

For someone familiar with the boundaries of classful addressing it is important to note that even though the RFC 1918 range of 1721600 17231255255 falls in the traditional class B range the block of addresses reserved is not a 16 but a 12 The same applies for the range of 19216800 192168255255 this block is not a 24 but a 16 However someone can still use addresses from these CIDR blocks and apply a subnet mask appropriate for the traditional classful boundary of the address

The current IANA private internet addresses are

To reduce the load on root nameservers caused by the reverse DNS lookups of these IP addresses a system of black hole nameservers is provided by anycast network AS112

Reverse DNS lookup is the process of determining the hostname or the host computer associated with a given IP address or any other type of network address

Typically the Domain Name System is used to determine what IP address is associated with a given domain name So to reverse resolve a known IP address to determine the hostname is simply the process of searching what host and domain name belongs to that IP address 

A reverse lookup is often referred to as reverse resolving or more specifically reverse DNS lookup and is accomplished using a reverse IN ADDR entry in the form of a PTR record

RFC 1033 in the INSTRUCTIONS section and later RFC 1912 Section 21 states Every Internet reachable host should have a name and Make sure your PTR and A records match

A polis means a city a city state and also citizenship and body of citizens In context with Ancient Greece polis means nearly always city state 

The word originates from the ancient Greek city states which developed during the broken wikt linkArchaicArchaic period and existed well into Roman times when the equivalent Latin word was civitas that means citizenhood as well

The bounds of the ancient polis often centered around a citadel called the acropolis Nearly always it had an agora and typically one or more temples and a gymnasium Many of a polis citizens did not live in the central city but in the suburbs or countryside The Greeks regarded the polis as a religious and political association while the polis would control territory and colonies beyond the city itself the polis would not simply consist of a geographical area

There are a lot of words in many modern European languages that come from polis In English there are policy polity police and politics In Greek words coming from polis include polits and politismos

A number of words end in the word polis Most refer to a special kind of city andor state Some examples are

Other refer to part of a city or a group of cities such as

The names of several other towns and cities in Europe and the Middle East have contained the suffix polis since antiquity or currently feature modernized spellings such as pol Some of the examples are

The names of other cities were also given the suffix polis after antiquity either referring to ancient names or simply unrelated

In cryptography Triple DES is a block cipher derived from the Data Encryption Standard cipher by using it three times Triple DES is also known as TDES or more standard TDEA 

When it was discovered that a 56 bit key of DES is not enough to protect from brute force attacks TDES was chosen as a simple way to enlarge the key space without a need to switch to a new algorithm The use of three steps is essential to prevent meet in the middle attacks that are effective against double DES encryption

In general TDES with three different keys has a key length of 168 bits three 56 bit DES keys but due to the meet in the middle attack the effective security it provides is only 112 bits A variant called two key TDES uses k1 k3 thus reducing the key size to 112 bits and the storage length to 128 bits However this mode is susceptible to certain chosen plaintext or known plaintext attacks  and thus it is designated by NIST to have only 80 bits of security 

By design DES and therefore TDES suffer from slow performance in software TDES is better suited to hardware implementations and indeed where it is still used is likely to be within a hardware implementation

TDES is slowly disappearing from use largely replaced by the Advanced Encryption Standard One large scale exception is within the electronic payments industry which still uses 2TDES extensively and continues to develop and spread standards based upon it This guarantees that TDES will remain an active cryptographic standard well into the future

In cryptography the Advanced Encryption Standard which is also known as Rijndael is a block cipher algorithm used as an encryption standard by the US government It has been looked at a lot and is now used all over the world as was the case with its predecessor the Data Encryption Standard AES was announced by National Institute of Standards and Technology as US FIPS PUB 197 on November 26 2001 after a 5 year standardization process in which fifteen competing designs were presented and evaluated before Rijndael was selected as the most suitable It became effective as a standard May 26 2002 As of 2008 AES is one of the most popular algorithms used in symmetric key cryptography It is available by choice in many different encryption packages This marks the first time that the public has had access to a cipher algorithm approved by NSA for top secret information

This cipher algorithm was developed by two Belgian cryptographers Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen and submitted to the AES selection process under the name Rijndael a portmanteau of the names of the inventors

Strictly speaking AES is not precisely Rijndael following are the main differences

The design and strength of all key lengths of the AES algorithm are sufficient to protect classified information up to the SECRET level TOP SECRET information will require use of either the 192 or 256 key lengths The implementation of AES in products intended to protect national security systems andor information must be reviewed and certified by NSA prior to their acquisition and use

Many AES public products use 128 bit secret keys by default it is possible that the NSA may assume that 128 bit secret keys are weak and they may prefer longer keys for top secret documents 

Unlike DES AES is a substitution permutation network not a Feistel network AES is fast in both software and hardware is relatively easy to implement and requires little memory As a new encryption standard it is currently being deployed on a large scale on various platforms

Shnen is a type of media meant for boys usually between the ages of about 10 and 17 It often refers to manga Examples include Dragon Ball Bleach One Piece InuYasha Naruto YuYu Hakusho and Yu Gi Oh

Shounen is usually noticed by its high amounts of fighting It often has humorous plots with male characters It often has themes of friendship Fighting teams and similar groups are often shown Attractive female characters are also common but not always present The art style of shounen is usually less pretty than shjo

Beyond shnen manga manga for men is called seinen manga Very few seinen manga have been published outside of Japan In Japan many older men read shounen magazines Because of this in Japan shounen manga magazines are the most popular manga magazines

Smile In Your Sleep is a 2006 single released by emo band Silverstein Its from their second album Discovering the Waterfront

The music video for smile in your sleep is loosely based on the board game clue Some shots show the band members with various weapons used in the game and each of them has their own character At the end of the video they all walk off 1 by 1 and an old looking guy comes and covers the camera

There is one shot of the victim being dragged on the black and white corridor

The Amazing Race is a reality televisiongame show It is broadcast on CBS

In The Amazing Race 11 or 12 teams of two people race around the world for 1000000 with information provided by clues or Route Info There are certain legs of the race culminated by Pit Stops At Pit Stops teams check in for a mandatory 12 hour rest period although sometimes the period can be 24 hours 36 hours or even once 60 Usually the first team to arrive at a Pit Stop will receive a prize such as a trip to a Caribbean country On most of the Pit Stops on the race the last team to arrive is eliminated from the race However two or three of those points are non elimination In Seasons 1 4 there was no penalty for coming in last in a non elimination From Seasons 5 9 teams had to give up all of their money and start the next leg without money Even stricter in Seasons 7 9 teams had to turn over all of their luggage In Seasons 10 and 11 teams would start the next leg Marked for Elimination That meant that if they did not come in first at the next Pit Stop they would have to wait out a 30 minute penalty Starting from Season 12 teams coming in last on Non Eliminations have to do a Speed Bump A Speed Bump is a task that no other teams have to do

The Amazing Race has several different tasks that teams must complete 

A Detour is a choice between two tasks The team can choose which one it wants to complete Teams are allowed to switch between Detour choices but there is a harsh 24 hour penalty if you quit a Detour 

A Roadbock is a task for only one member of team can do it Teams do not to switch a member as do the task but there is a harsh 4 hour penalty if you quit a Roadbock

A Fastforward is a task for skip all the task in that leg to the pit stop

The Amazing Race was created by Bertram van Munster and Elise Doganieri in 2001 It has been airing from 2001 to present

The Amazing Race is seen as hard to produce Producers need to find places come up with tasks and pick teams Cameramen have to keep up with the teams and people are not allowed to give away the results However The Amazing Race has won 6 Emmy awards

Besides the original American version The Amazing Race has generated several versions from around the world

The carbon cycle is the way carbon is stored and replaced on Earth Some of the main events take hundreds of millions of years others happen annually

The main ways that carbon gets into the carbon cycle are volcanoes and the burning of fossil fuels like coal and gas Through most of history volcanoes were the biggest source of carbon to the carbon cycle but in the last hundred years people burning fossil fuels have added much more CO2 to the air than volcanoes have by about a hundred times That is for every ton of CO2 added to the air by volcanoes about 100 tons of CO2 have been added to the air by people

The main way carbon gets taken out of the atmosphere is by photosynthesis by living organisms Some of this gets released as they die and decompose but a proportion gets buried in sediment This is shown in the diagram Sediment turns to rock and it is the carbonate rocks like limestone which contain the now solid CO2 Some of the carbon from plants also becomes part of the soil where it can stay for a long time before decomposing

Another process takes CO2 out of the air Weathering by rain washes out CO2 in the form of dilute carbonic acid This reacts with rock helping to dissolve and destroy it This also ends up as sediment

Some CO2 is also dissolved in the ocean Right now the oceans are taking in more CO2 than they are releasing every year However this is making the oceans more acidic

The store of carbon in sedimentary rock is far greater than the CO2 in the atmosphere Eventually it returns to the air as oceanic plates subduct in plate tectonics At the margins of plate boundaries volcanoes form and spew out CO2 This completes the cycle

The Carbon Cycle is a process where carbon is recycled through the ecosystem The concentration of carbon in living matter is almost 100 times greater than its concentration in the earth So living things extract carbon from their nonliving environment For life to continue this carbon must be recycled See the diagram for a detailed look at the carbon cycle An example of a route carbon takes in this cycle is carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by plants and used in photosynthesis to produce sugars which the plant uses for energy When the plant dies it decomposes and the carbon stored in the plant will over millions of years form into coal The coal is burnt and gives off carbon dioxide which goes into the atmosphere Also the carbon cycle has to relate to quantum mechanics due to the restoration of water 

At the moment the carbon cycle and how human activity is affecting it is a big topic in international news Fossil fuels are a non renewable resource which means that once weve burned them all there is not any more and our use of fossil fuels has nearly doubled every 20 years since 1900 Also the burning of fossil fuels produces pollution which contributes to the greenhouse effect and acid rain

The carbon cycle was initially discovered by Joseph Priestley and Antoine Lavoisier and popularized by Humphry Davy

Skepticism or scepticism refers to any view involving doubt

Skepticism has its roots in ancient Greek philosophy The Greek Sophists of the 5th century BC such as Protagoras of Abdera were for the most part skeptics Gorgias said that Nothing exists if anything does exist it cannot be known if anything exists and can be known it cannot be communicated In the 4th century BC Pyrrho of Elis who travelled and studied as far as India adopted practical skepticism Carneades denied absolute truth and falsity He criticized the Dogmatists especially supporters of Stoicism asserting that absolute certainty of knowledge is impossible Sextus Empiricus the main authority for Greek skepticism incorporated empiricism into the basis for asserting knowledge

The nub of the argument is the proposition that unless we know something for certain then we cannot know anything at all The interest lies in the way great philosophers have sought to counter this problem Some like Descartes retreat into the mind I think therefore I am Others such as the British empiricists John Locke and David Hume would rely on our sense perception Certain kinds of knowledge may be especially vulnerable to skepticism For example an agnostic believes that knowledge of supernatural things cannot be attained 

Skepticism is widely used as a method for research in science and in modern legal procedure Here doubt suspending judgement methodical investigation testing and discussion precede any statement of facts Sometimes the process takes years before consensus is reached This systematic approach is called methodological skepticism It is probably the most important legacy of the skeptics

The Secretary of War was a member of the United States Presidents Cabinet beginning with George Washingtons administration A similar position called either Secretary at War or Secretary of War was appointed to serve the Congress of the Confederation under the Articles of Confederation between 1781 and 1789 Benjamin Lincoln and later Henry Knox held the position When Washington was inaugurated as the first president under the Constitution he appointed Knox to continue serving 

The Secretary of War led the War Department At first he was responsible for all military affairs In 1798 the Secretary of the Navy was added to the cabinet and the scope of this office was reduced to a general concern with the Army In 1947 the departments were recombined under the Secretary of Defense The Secretary of War was replaced by the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Air Force non Cabinet positions under the Secretary of Defense

The United States Secretary of the Navy is the civilian head of the Department of the Navy The position was a member of the Presidents Cabinet until 1947 when the Navy Army and newly created Air Force were placed in the Department of Defense and the Secretary of the Navy was placed under the Secretary of Defense

The United States Postmaster General is the executive head of the United States Postal Service The office in one form or another is older than both the United States Constitution and the United States Declaration of Independence Benjamin Franklin was appointed by the Continental Congress as the first Postmaster General serving slightly longer than 15 months

In 1971 the Post Office Department was re organized into the United States Postal Service a special agency independent of the executive branch Thus the Postmaster General is no longer a member of the Cabinet and is no longer in line to be President

The White House Chief of Staff is the highest ranking member of the Executive Office of the President of the United States and a senior aide to the President

Formentera is the smallest of the 4 baleraric islands with population

It is located south of Ibiza south west of Mallorca Its area is 8324 km Formentera has about 7500 inhabitants The island was built by vulcano erruptions It has two high areas in the east and the south and a falt area in between Main town is Sant Francesc Xavier

First people who settled on Formentera were the Carthaginians later the Romans came there Often the island lost its complete population for example after the Vandals came there In the middle age Arabs governed the balearic island then Catalans took over the island Formentera became part of the new kingdom of Mallorca Later that kingdom became a part of Spain

The island lives mainly on tourism Most tourist are from Germany the United Kingdom and Italy and France Even the other economic activities like fishing deal with tourism 

Minorca is the most east of the Balearic Islands

Minorca is located east of Mallorca It has an area of convert69439km2abbron About 88000 people live there The main town is Mahon which has about 27000 people

Minorca was influenced by the Minons Later it was ruled by the Carthageans after the Punic Wars by the Romans From the 5th century AD there was a seat of a bishop on Minorca Then the Vandals invaded it After they left the Moors took over Later Minorca was ruled by the Kingdom of Mallorca and then it became a part of Spain For a few decades Minorca was ruled by the British but the Spanish recovered it again

Minorca lives mainly on tourism There is one airport near the main city

It became the flag in 1950 following the recommendations of a committee appointed by the 1st Prime Minister of Sri Lanka DS Senanayake

In cryptography RC4 is one of the most common software stream ciphers It is used in popular protocols like Secure Sockets Layer and WEP 

RC4 is known for being simple and quick but attacks are likely to happen when the start of the output keystream is not removed or one keystream is used twice some ways of using RC4 can turn into very insecure cryptosystems such as WEP

RC4 was created by Ron Rivest of RSA Security in 1987 While its official name is Rivest Cipher 4 the RC acronym is also known to stand for Rons Code

RC4 was first created as a trade secret but in September 1994 a description of it was posted to the Cypherpunks mailing list It was soon posted on the scicrypt newsgroup and from there to many websites on the Internet The code was confirmed to be genuine as its output matched that of proprietary software using licensed RC4 Because the algorithm is known it is no longer a trade secret The name RC4 is trademarked however RC4 is often referred to as ARCFOUR or ARC4 to avoid possible trademark problems It has become part of some commonly used encryption protocols and standards including WEP and WPA for wireless cards and TLS

The two main reasons which helped its use over such a big range of applications are its speed and simplicity Uses of RC4 in both software and hardware are extremely easy to develop

The RC4 encryption algorithm is started with a different key length usually between 40 and 256 bits using the key scheduling algorithm Once this has been completed the stream of encrypted bits is created using the pseudo random generation algorithm

RC4 fails the standards set by cryptographers for a secure cipher in many ways and is not recommended for use in new applications as there are a lot of methods of attacking RC4

Where a cryptosystem is marked with RC4 is one of several ciphers the system can be set to use

In cryptography Blowfish is a keyed symmetric block cipher made in 1993 by Bruce Schneier and since 1993 has been included in a large number of encryption products Blowfish has a good encryption rate in software and until 2008 no cryptanalytic attack model of it has been found However the AES block cipher algorithm now has more attention

Schneier made Blowfish as a general purpose algorithm to be used as a replacement for the old DES algorithm and to remove the problems and difficulties of other encryption algorithms At the time Blowfish was released many other algorithms were proprietary or were secrets Schneier has said that Blowfish is unpatented and will remain so in all countries The algorithm is hereby placed in the public domain and can be freely used by anyone

Main features of the design include key dependent S boxes and a very complex key schedule Blowfish is one of the fastest block ciphers used by many people except when changing keys Each new key needs to be pre processed which takes the same time as encrypting about 4 kilobytes of text which is very slow compared to other block ciphers This stops its use in certain applications but it is not a problem in other applications In one of the applications it is actually good the password hashing method used in OpenBSD uses an algorithm that comes from Blowfish which makes use of the slow key schedule the idea is that the extra computational effort required gives protection against dictionary attacks See key strengthening

Blowfish has a 64 bit block size and a variable key length from 0 up to 448 bits It is a 16 round Feistel cipher and uses large key dependent S boxes It is similar in structure to CAST 128 which uses fixed S boxes

In 1996 Serge Vaudenay found a known plaintext attack needing 28r 1 known plaintexts to break where r is the number of rounds Moreover he also found a class of weak keys that can be detected and broken by the same attack with only 24r 1 known plaintexts This attack cannot be used against the regular Blowfish it assumes knowledge of the key dependent S boxes Vincent Rijmen in his PhD papers introduced a second order differential attack that can break four rounds and no more Still there is no known way to break the full 16 rounds apart from a brute force search A sign extension bug in one of the published C code has been found in 1996

There is no good cryptanalysis on the full round version of Blowfish known publicly till 2008 However in 2007 Bruce Schneier noted that while Blowfish is still in use he recommended using the new Twofish algorithm instead

In computing the SSH File Transfer Protocol is a network protocol that implemetns file transfer between computers It is often used as more secure alternative of an FTP protocol which transmits file contents folder contents and even passwords without encryption

SFTP protocol is built on top of SSH protocol which is used as a transport layer over the port 22 and is implemented by an SSH server such as OpenSSH SFTP is different from SCP which is another protocol relying on an SSH connection It is also different from FTPS which used SSL to encrypt the connection itself rather than sending the data through an SSH tunnel 

Many popular FTP programs have added support for SFTP Access to the SFTP server can be granted either through username and password or by using public key

Computer security is a branch of information technology known as information security which is intended to protect computers Computer security has three main goals

The Line of Actual Control is the effective border between India and China The LAC is 4057 km long and traverses three areas of northern Indian states western middle and eastern Quote India is used to incursions by Chinese troops across the 4057 km LAC in all the three sectorswestern middle and eastern in a bid to strengthen Chinas claim over disputed areas and ensure New Delhi does not change its Tibet policy 

Chinese Prime Minister Zhou Enlai used the phrase in a letter addressed to Indian Prime Minister Nehru dated October 24 1959 In a letter dated November 7 Zhou told Nehru that the LAC consisted of the so called McMahon Line in the east and the line up to which each side exercises actual control in the west During the Sino Indian War Nehru claimed not to know where the line was There is no sense or meaning in the Chinese offer to withdraw twenty kilometers from what they call line of actual control What is this line of control Is this the line they have created by aggression since the beginning of September Advancing forty or sixty kilometers by blatant military aggression and offering to withdraw twenty kilometers provided both sides do this is a deceptive device which can fool nobody

The McMahon Line is a demarcation line drawn on map referred to in the Simla Convention a treaty between Britain and Tibet signed in 1914 Although its legal status is disputed it is currently the effective boundary between China and India This dispute was used a pretext in a war between China and India in 1962

The Indo Bangladeshi barrier is a 4000 kilometer fence that India is presently constructing to seal off the Indian Bangladeshi international border from what was formerly East Bengal East Bengal was a partitioned region of Bengal belonging to East Pakistan from 1947 to 1971 This obstruction will virtually isolate Bangladesh from the rest of India by the end of 2012

The Indian Kashmir barrier is a 550 km separation barrier along the 740 km disputed 1972 Line of Control between Indian and Pakistani controlled Kashmir Jammu and Kashmir India and Pakistan Controlled Kashmir The rest of the Line of Control is too inaccessible for construction of a barrier The fence constructed by India is well inside territory on the Indian controlled side Its stated purpose is to exclude arms smuggling and infiltration by Pakistani based separatist militants who wish to merge Kashmir into Pakistan or gain independence for Kashmir as a whole

The barrier itself consists of double row of fencing and concertina wire eight to twelve feet in height and is electrified and connected to a network of motion sensors thermal imaging devices and alarms in stretches where power supply is available The small stretch of land between the rows of fencing is mined

The construction of the barrier was begun in the 1990s but slowed in the early 2000s as hostilities between India and Pakistan increased After a November 2003 ceasefire agreement building resumed and was completed in late 2004 According to Indian military sources the fence has reduced by 80 the numbers of militants who routinely cross into the Indian side of the disputed state to attack soldiers

Pakistan has objected to the construction of the barrier saying it violates both bilateral accords and relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions on the region In Pakistans view the border between Jammu and Kashmir is undemarcated and border fencing is not allowed

A town crier is a person who is employed by a town council to make public announcements in the streets The crier can also be used in court or official announcements Criers often dress elaborately a tradition known from the 18th century in a red and gold robe white breeches black boots and a tricorne hat 

They carry a handbell to make a loud noise and they shout the words Oyez Oyez Oyez before making their announcements The word Oyez means hear ye which is a call for silence and attention Oyez is from an Anglo Norman word for listen Some town criers announcements are recorded in books called a Proclamation Book The proclamations book in Chester from the early 19th century records the town criers call as O Yes O Yes

In Medieval England town criers were the most important way of spreading news with the people of a town Many could not read newspapers Royal proclamations local bylaws market days advertisments and even selling loaves of sugar were all proclaimed by a bellman or town crier for centuries During Christmas 1798 the Chester Canal Company sold some sugar that was damaged in their packet boat and this was advertised by the town crier

Chesters first belman was in 1540 His was paid one penny for going for anything that is lost and 4 old pennies for leading a funeral procession In 1681 a fire safety law that all houses should have tiled rooves not thatched was to be published throughout the city by the day bellman In 1553 the crier was paid 13 old pennies for ridunge the banes for the Chester Mystery Plays In 1598 bellman Richard Woodcock must have been dressed in a similar way to the London bellman for he had a tymber mast typt at both endes and embellished in the middest with silver 

In 1620 there was a fight at the crossroads between the butchers and the bakers where the Cryer brake his Mace in peeces Amonge them In 1607 one public notice read by George Tunnall the bellman that putting rubbish in the river was illegal In 1715 a local man recorded that the Belman at the Cross Reads publicly a proclamation in the Mayors name commanding all persons in the City to bee of peaceable and civil behaviour not to walk around the Streets or Rows at unreasonable hours of night In 1743 John Posnitt took over as Day and Night BellmanfactdateMarch 2008

In 1792 Chester had a day time and night time bellman John Yarwood and a crier William Ratcliffe but by 1835 there seems to have been only one position It was not until 1998 that Chester had both a crier and a bellman again

Town criers were protected by royalty as they sometimes brought bad news such as tax increases To this day any town crier in the British Commonwealth is protected under old English law that they are not to be hindered or heckled while performing their duties To injure or harm a town crier was seen as an act of treason against the ruling monarchy The term Posting A Notice comes from the act of the town crier who having read his message to the townspeople would attach it to the door post of the local inn

The same as England town criers were the most important way to deliver news to the people of the town because many people could not read newspapers or write Proclamations local bylaws market days adverts were all proclaimed by a bellman or crier

Criers were not always men many town criers were women Bells were not the only way to make noise  in Holland a gong was often used and in France a drum was used or a hunting horn

The best dressed town crier and escort at the last World Championships are Peter and Maureen Taunton from the county town of Stafford UK They also hold the title of the best dressed town crier in Britain 2008 Competition held at Alnwick for the Loyal Company of Town Criers They are also the Best Dressed Crier at the National Town Crier Competition in Hastings 2007

Peter Moore has been The London Town Crier for more than 30 years He is Town Crier for The Mayor of London The City of Westminster and London Boroughs He is also Freeman and Liveryman of The City of London

Alan Myatt holds the world record as the loudest town cryer at 1128 decibels

The need for town criers has disappeared and they became part of the local folklore There are European and World Championship competitions for modern town criers The World Champion town crier is the town crier of Ninove Hans Van Laethem

The Plague of Justinian was a pandemic in the Byzantine Empire in the years 541542 AD Its capital Constantinople suffered as well It is estimated that the Plague of Justinian killed as many as 100 million people across the world because it returned about every twelve years till 770 when it stopped for about 500 years 

It caused Europes population to drop by around 50 between 541 and 700 It also may have contributed to the success of the Muslim conquests Its social and cultural impact is comparable to that of the Black Death

The plague may have come from Ethiopia or Egypt and it was eventually carried north to the large city of Constantinople Ships carrying grain which the city imported had many rats that carried the plague 

At its height the plague killed 10000 people in Constantinople everyday It eventually killed 40 of the citys population In all about 25 million people died because of the plague

Secret Water is the eighth book in Arthur Ransomes Swallows and Amazons series of childrens books It was published in 1939

This book is set in and around Hamford Water in Essex close to the resort town of Walton on the Naze It brings the Swallows and the Amazons together and introduces a new group of characters the Eels and the Mastodon Ransome sailed to Hamford Water an area of salt marshes and low lying islands in his boat Nancy Blackett He set the book in this tidal place which offered a new setting for his characters and chances to explore and map the area

The Swallows mean to sail in the Goblin to Hamford Water and camp with their father but he is called away on naval business Instead he maroons them with a small boat on an island Before he leaves Father gives them a basic map of the area they call Secret Water and suggests they map the area before he returns to pick them up For a surprise he has arranged for the Amazons to come down from the Lake District and join them with another dinghy

They see some mysterious footprints which turn out to belong to the Mastodon a local boy He mistakes them for the Eels another family who camp in the area regularly Later the Eels arrive and are initially hostile before they settle down for a friendly war

It seems that due to the distractions of war and being cut off by the tides the chart will not be completed However early in the last morning two separate groups of children complete it

Aramids are polymers The name stands for aromatic polyamide Structurally aramids are similar to proteins

Stephanie Louise Kwolek developed aramids at DuPont in 1965 DuPont uses the trade name Kevlar for them 

Aramids are very present in security helmets in splinter resistant glass in Ballistic vests but also in other domains They are used as a replacement for asbestos as a building material for gaskets and other sealings but also as helpers to make sails parachutes and similar tools

In cryptanalysis a brute force attack is a method of breaking a cryptographic system by trying a large number of possibilities using fast computers for example a large number of the possible keys in a key space in order to decrypt an encrypted message 

The theoretical possibility of a brute force attack is recognized by the cryptographic system designers they work to make the cryptographic system computationally infeasible to break using brute force attack For that reason one of the definitions of breaking a cryptographic scheme is to find a method faster than a brute force attack

The selection of an appropriate key length depends on how much it will be difficult to break it using a brute force attack By obfuscating the data before encryption brute force attacks are less effective and more difficult to determine

The brute force attack could be combined with a dictionary attack

Information theory is a branch of applied mathematics and electrical engineering Information theory measures the amount of information in data which could have more than one value In its most common use information theory finds physical and mathematical limits on the amounts of data in data compression and data communication Data compression and data communication are statistical because they guess unknown values The amount of information in data measures how easily it is guessed by a person who does not know its value 

In cryptography a block cipher is a symmetric key cipher which operates on a groups of bits of fixed length called blocks using an exact transformation During encryption a block cipher algorithm might take a 128 bit block of plaintext as input and output a corresponding 128 bit block of ciphertext The exact transformation is controlled using a second input the secret key Decryption is similar the decryption algorithm takes in this example a 128 bit block of ciphertext together with the secret key and output the original 128 bit block of plaintext

One of the early block cipher designs was the Data Encryption Standard developed at IBM and published as a standard in 1977 A successor to DES the Advanced Encryption Standard also using block cipher was adopted in 2001

Authentication is the actions taken to establish or verify something as authentic It is the method of verifying claims made by someone about the thing This might involve confirming the identity of a person the origins of an object or to make sure that a computer program is a trusted one

In cryptography DES X is an alternative to the DES block cipher designed to increase the complexity of a brute force attack using a technique called key whitening As DES suffers from brute force attack DES X was a trial to overcome such drawbacks

A hostname is the unique name by which a network device is defined and known on a network The hostname is used to identify a particular host in various electronic communication networks such as the World Wide Web e mail or Usenet 

On the Internet the terms hostname and domain name are often misused interchangeably but there are small technical differences between them

The National Institute of Standards and Technology known between 1901 and 1988 as the National Bureau of Standards is a measurement standards laboratory which is a non regulatory agency of the United States Department of Commerce The institutes mission is to promote US innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science Standards and Technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve quality of life

In cryptography key size or key length is the size of the key used in a cryptographic algorithm

Wassily Kandinsky was a Russian painter printmaker and art theorist 

He was one of the most important and most famous 20th century artists He was a major figure in modern art and painted some of the first modern abstract works His art changed several times during his life It was abstract expressionist and constructivist in turn

Born in Moscow Kandinsky spent his childhood in Odessa He enrolled at the University of Moscow and chose to study law and economics Quite successful in his professionhe was offered a professorship at the University of Dorpathe started painting studies at the age of 30 

In 1896 he settled in Munich and studied first in a private school then at the Academy of Fine Arts Munich He went back to Moscow in 1914 after World War I started He was unsympathetic to the official theories on art in Moscow and returned to Germany in 1921 There he taught at the Bauhaus school of art and architecture from 1922 until the Nazis closed it in 1933 He then moved to France where he lived the rest of his life and became a French citizen in 1939 He died at Neuilly sur Seine in 1944

Public key cryptography also known as asymmetric cryptography is a form of cryptography in which the key used to encrypt a message differs from the key used to decrypt it In public key cryptography each user has a pair of cryptographic keysa public key and a private key The private key is kept secret while the public key may be widely distributed and used by other users Incoming messages would have been encrypted with the recipients public key and can only be decrypted with his corresponding private key The keys are related mathematically but the user private key cannot be derived from the widely used public key 

On the other hand secret key cryptography also known as symmetric cryptography uses a single secret cryptographic key for both encryption and decryption To use symmetric cryptography for communication both the sender and receiver need to know the key earlier or the key would have to be sent along with the message 

The two main branches of public key cryptography are

John David Ashcroft is an American politician who was the 79th United States Attorney General He served during the first term of President George W Bush from 2001 until 2005 Ashcroft was previously the Governor of Missouri and a US Senator from Missouri

The first Arab Muslim conquests also referred to as the Islamic conquests or Arab conquests began after the death of the Islamic prophet Muhammad He established a new unified political polity in the Arabian peninsula which under the following Rashidun and Umayyad Caliphates saw a century of rapid expansion of Arab power well beyond the Arabian peninsula in the form of a vast Muslim Arab Empire with an area of influence that stretched from northwest India across Central Asia the Middle East North Africa southern Italy and the Iberian Peninsula to the Pyrenees 

The Arab conquests brought about the collapse of the Sassanid Empire and a great territorial loss for the Byzantine Empire Though spectacular the Arab successes are not hard to understand in hindsight The Sassanid Persian and Byzantine empires were militarily exhausted from decades of fighting one another This prevented them from dealing effectively with the mobile Arab raiders operating from the desert Moreover many of the peoples living under the rule of these empires for example Jews and Christians in Persia and Monophysites in Syria were disloyal and sometimes even welcomed the Arab invaders largely because of religious conflict in both empires

Some of the individual conquests are mentioned here

The Byzantine Arab Wars were between the Byzantine Empire and at first the Rashidun and then the Umayyad caliphates

Under the Rashidun there were the conquests of Syria Armenia Egypt and North Africa Under the Umayyads the continuing conquest of North Africa the second Arab siege of Constantinople and the conquest of Tbilisi In 827 there followed the conquest of southern Italy

The last ruler of the Sassanid Empire in Persia was defeated by the Rashidun in 633 and 636 but the final military victory didnt come until 642 when the Persian army was destroyed 

During the seventh century the Umayyad fought successfully against the early Rajput in north India and in Central Asia 

In 711 a Muslim expedition defeated Raja Dahir at what is now Hyderabad in Sindh and established Umayyad rule by 712 The Umayyad brought under control the whole of what is modern Pakistan from Karachi to Kashmir and reached the borders of Kashmir within three years But rather soon afterwards semi independent Arab ruled states developed

The conquest of the Iberian Peninsula began when the Moors invaded Visigothic Christian Iberia in the year 711 They landed at Gibraltar on April 30 and worked their way northward This territory under the Arab name Al Andalus became first an Emirate and then an independent Umayyad Caliphate after the overthrowing of the dynasty in Damascus by the Abbasids In 1031 the territory split into small territiries and gradually the Christian kingdoms started the Reconquest up to 1492 when Granada the last kingdom of Al ndalus fell under the Spanish Kings

In Sub Saharan Africa the Sahelian kingdom expanded Muslim territories far from the coast Muslim traders spread Islam

The modern era saw the rise of three powerful Muslim empires the Ottoman Empire of the Middle East and Europe the Safavid Empire of Persia and Central Asia and the Mughal Empire of India along with their contest and fall to the rise of the colonial powers of Europe

The Mughal Empire declined in 1707 after the death of Aurangzeb and was officially abolished by the British after the Indian Rebellion of 1857 

In cryptography the key space of an algorithm refers to the set of all possible keys that can be used to initialize the cryptographic algorithm For example if an algorithm works using a key that is a string of 10 bits then its key space is the set of all binary strings of length 10 bits ie we have key space of size 210 1024

To avoid attackers from guessing the key using a brute force attack the key space is usually designed to be very large Another needed attribute is that the key space designed to be flat having no or very few weak keys

The block cipher RijndaelAES uses a key of up to 256 bits resulting in a key space containing about 2256 which is over 11579 1077 keys This makes it computationally infeasible to check each possible key by brute force

In the DES block cipher a 56 bit key is used resulting in a relatively small key space of size 256

The ROT13 cipher is only designed to prevent people from accidentally reading messages As there is no key the key space is therefore empty

Roger Williams was an English theologian He was widely known as a supporter of religious toleration and separation of church and state He also supported fair dealings with Native Americans In 1644 he received a charter creating the colony of Rhode Island named for the main island in Narragansett Bay He is believed to have started the first or second Baptist church in the United States He is known to have left the church soon afterwards saying God is too large to be housed under one rooffactdateApril 2009

Unitarianism is a term that describes some forms of Christianity Unitarianism can be described as the belief that God has one personality This is different form what most other Christians think called Trinitarianism Unitarian Christians believe in Jesus of Nazareth They think that Jesus was a great leader and prophet but they generally do not think that Jesus is part of God himself

The Son of God is a being that existed before Jesus human life It is called the Logos who dwelt with God in the beginning and then was born as the man Jesus However he is not eternal but had a beginning of existence God created him This theology is commonly called Arianism but there are many varieties of this form of Unitarianism They range from the belief that the Son before he came to earth was a divine spirit of the same nature as God to the belief that he was an angel or other lesser spirit creature of a wholly different nature from God Arius views are only one variation of this theology

Whatever the case in this belief system Jesus is beneath God but higher than humans This concept could be referred to as elevated subordinationism It is associated with early church figures such as Justin Martyr Lucian of Antioch Eusebius of Caesarea Arius Eusebius of Nicomedia Asterius the Sophist Eunomius and Ulfilas as well as Felix Bishop of Urgel and others who believed that Jesus was God in his divine nature but his divinity in his human nature was through adoption Arian forms of Unitarianism remain among Unitarians in Transylvania Hungary France and several countries in AfricaFactdateMay 2007 Famous Arian Unitarians include Isaac Newton Andrews Norton and Dr William Ellery Channing

Since the 19th century several Evangelical or Revivalist movements also used an elevated subordinationist theology This can be best described as Nontrinitarianism rather than Unitarianism Important figures include Barton W Stone and Charles Taze Russell Theologies among Evangelical Unitarians are sometimes classed as Arian and sometimes Sabellian and the Chinese based sabbatarian True Jesus Church Other modern non trinitarian churches such as the Filipino based Iglesia ni Cristo may also be included although they reject the unitarian name to avoid confusion Jehovahs Witnesses also have a nontrinitarian theology with specific traits The Christian Churches of God is another Unitarian Church with a World Conference It has a lot of material on Unitarian theology and history and holds the doctrine of the Pre existence of Jesus Christ CCG like other Sabbatarian Churches of God trace their ancestry back to the early church and follow biblical law The CCG and Sabbatarians are sometimes erroneously called Arians due to the pejorative Trinitarian use of that term and also that of Subordinationists

This theology ranges from the belief that Jesus was merely a great man filled with the Holy Spirit to the belief that he is the incarnation of Gods impersonal Logos It is associated with early church figures like the Ebionites Theodotus of Byzantium Artemon and Paul of Samosata in the early Church Marcellus of Ancyra and his pupil Photinus in the 4th century AD and Michael Servetus Ferenc Dvid and Faustus Socinus in the Protestant Reformation It is from the latter that we get the word Socinianism but the teaching of Socinus is unique in more than just its Christology and so the name is best not used as merely a Christological term

In modern times we see the psilanthropist view manifested in Rationalist Unitarianism which emerged from the German Rationalism and the liberal theology of the 19th century Its proponents took a highly intellectual and humanistic approach to religion They rejected most of the miraculous events in the Bible They embraced evolutionary concepts stated that man was good by default and abandoned the doctrine of biblical infallibility Rationalist Unitarianism is distinguished from Deism by its belief in a personal deity who directly acts on creation while Deists see God as holding aloof from creation

Notable Rationalist Unitarians include Ralph Waldo Emerson and Theodore Parker in theology and ministry Joseph Priestley and Linus Pauling in science Susan B Anthony and Florence Nightingale in humanitarianism and social justice Charles Dickens in literature and Frank Lloyd Wright in arts Many Hungarian Unitarians embrace the principles of Rationalist Unitarianismthe only Unitarian high school in the world John Sigismund Unitarian Academy in Cluj Napoca Romania teaches Rationalist Unitarianism The psilanthropist concept of the nature of Jesus is similar to the viewpoint held by the Islamic faith which regards Jesus as a non divine and human Prophet The Christadelphians the Church of God of the Abrahamic Faith and the Biblical Unitarians are Evangelical Unitarians

Procopius of Caesarea was a prominent Eastern Roman scholar He took part in the wars of the Emperor Justinian I and was the major historian of the 6th century AD writing the Wars of Justinian the Buildings of Justinian and the celebrated Secret History He is commonly held to be the last major historian of the ancient world

The writings of Procopius are the primary source of information for the rule of the Roman emperor Justinian Procopius was the author of a history in eight books of the wars fought by Justinian I a broken wikt linkpanegyricpanegyric on Justinians public works throughout the empire and a book known as the Secret History that claims to report the scandals that Procopius could not include in his published history

A number of historical novels based on Procopius works have been written of which the best Count Belisarius was written by poet and novelist Robert Graves in 1938

Binda is a village in the Southern Tablelands region of New South Wales Australia in Upper Lachlan Shire 

It is about 261 km south west of Sydney and 19 km north of Crookwell Other near by towns or locations are

In 2006 the population of Binda was 131 people

The word Binda is thought to be from the Gandangara Aboriginal word for deep water

The first Europeans in the Binda area were the explorers James Meehan and John Oxley in 1820 People began living in the area in the 1840s Police were based at Binda in 1840 to protect local farmers from bushrangers The town was begun in 1851 Blocks of land in the town were made ready for sale in 1852 It was the first town in the area to have a school post office police station and a courthouse At Funny Hill a sheep farm a racing track for horses was made and the Binda Picnic Races began in 1848

The Royal Hotel is on the site of another hotel owned by Robinson A sign on the wall says this was where Ben Halls gang had their party Other important buildings include the nursing home the Junction Hotel Finns Building the Victoria Hotel the former Bank of NSW and the former CBC Bank The Trading Post is a homewares shop that won a tourism award for 2006

Canowindra is also known as the Balloon Capital of Australia One of the largest festivals in Australia used to take place here every April This was called Martis Fiesta which is no longer held due to lack of money

Australian country music star Captain Flange makes his home in Canowindra

The town is the site of one of the worlds great fossil discoveries A road worker in 1956 found 360 million year old fish fossils These were from the Devonian period in the Paleozoic era The Canowindra slab was taken to the Australian Museum Sydney The fish had been trapped in a pool of water that dried up The fish found were two armoured antiarch placoderms Remigolepis walkeri and Bothriolepis yeungae They also found Canowindra grassi a lobe finned crossopterygian fish with two rare young arthrodire placoderms Groenlandaspis species

More fossils were found in January 1993 using an excavator to dig down to the fossil layer Many fish were preserved in detail Specimens can be seen in the Age of Fishes Museum This was built with support and funding from the Australian Museum The Canowindra site has now been listed as part of Australias National Heritage because of its international scientific importance

A particle accelerator also called an atom smasher or mass driver is a machine that makes tiny things called particles travel at very high speeds  Accelerators work by pushing particles like electrons protons or nuclei with electric fields and by steering them with magnetic fields 

The largest accelerators are used to study subatomic particles smaller accelerators are used to study atomic nuclei and make radioactive materials  There are two kinds of particle accelerators linear accelerators and circular accelerators Linear accelerators move the particles in a line while circular accelerators move the particles in a circle  One example of a particle accelerator is the Large Hadron Collider at CERN It is very big stretching through several countries Another example is the Tevatron in the United States

This helps people see particles smaller than an atom Normally those particles cannot be seen but they can in the particle accelerator This is because in some ways energy and matter are the same thing At the high speed created in these machines some of the movement energy is changed into matter It is the reverse process that atomic weapons use This being when matter is turned into energy Small amounts of antimatter are also created during the process

The particle accelerator at CERN was set up to search for the Higgs Boson particle which would complete the Standard Model of Particle Physics

Particle accelerators often use very advanced technology This makes them cost a lot of money which is usually paid by governments

A digital signature or digital signature scheme is a type of asymmetric cryptography For messages sent through an insecure channel a good implementation of digital signature algorithm is the one that makes the receiver believe that the message was sent by the claimed sender and trust the message 

Digital signatures are equivalent to traditional handwritten signatures in many respects properly implemented digital signatures are more difficult to copy than the handwritten type Digital signature are implemented using cryptography Digital signatures can also provide acknowledgement meaning that the signer cannot successfully claim they did not sign a message while also claiming their private key remains secret

Digital signatures are often used to implement electronic signatures a broader term that refers to any electronic data that holds a meaning of a signature but not all electronic signatures use digital signatures In some countries including the United States and in the European Union electronic signatures may have legal significance 

A digital signature system typically consists of three algorithms

Two main properties are required by the digital signature system

The GMR signature scheme

In 1984 Shafi Goldwasser Silvio Micali and Ronald Rivest became the first to strictly define the security requirements of digital signature schemes They described a hierarchy of attack models for signature schemes they also present the GMR signature scheme GMR scheme was proven to be secure against adaptive chosen message attacks even when an attacker receives signatures for messages of his choice this does not allow him to copy a signature for a single additional message

In their foundational paper Goldwasser Micali and Rivest lay out a hierarchy of attack models against digital signatures

They also describe a hierarchy of attack results

The strongest notion of security therefore is security against existential forgery under an adaptive chosen message attack

DIGITAL SIGNATURES

A digital signature is an electronic signature

It can be used to authenticate the identity of the sender of a message

It ensures that the original content of the message or document that has been sent is unchanged

Digital signatures cannot be imitated by someone else

It can be automatically time stamped

The sender too cannot deny sending the message whether it is encrypted or not

It ensures the receiver of the senders identity

It demonstrates the authencity of a digital message or document

These are commonly used for software distribution financial transactions etc

Digital signatures are equivalent to hand written signatures but are more difficult to forge than handwritten signatures

USES OF DIGITAL SIGNATURES

a Authentication

b Integrity

c Non repudition

a Authentication

Digital signatures can be used to authenticate the source of messages

b Integrity

If a message is digitally signed any change in the message after signature will invalidate the signature 

The message cannot be modified and if modified a new message with a valid signature cannot be produced

c Non  repudation 

It is an important aspect of digital signatures

A sender cannot deny having sent the document after signing it

Key generation is the process of generating keys for cryptography The key is used to encrypt and decrypt data whatever the data is being encrypted or decrypted

Modern cryptographic systems include symmetric key algorithms and public key algorithms Symmetric key algorithms use a single shared key keeping data secret requires keeping this key secret Public key algorithms use a public key and a private key The public key is made available to anyone A sender will encrypt data with the public key only the holder of the private key can decrypt this data

Since public key algorithms tend to be much slower than symmetric key algorithms modern systems such as TLS and its predecessor SSL as well as the SSH use a combination of the two in which 

The simplest method to read encrypted data is a brute force attacksimply attempting every number up to the maximum length of the key Therefore it is important to use a sufficiently long key length longer keys take exponentially longer time to attack making a brute force attack invisible and impractical 

Currently commonly used key lengths are

In computer cryptography keys are integers In some cases keys are randomly generated using a random number generator or pseudorandom number generator the latter being a computer algorithm that produces data which appears random under analysis Some types the PRNGs algorithms utilize system entropy to generate a seed data such seeds produce better results since this makes the initial conditions of the PRNG much more difficult for an attacker to guess 

In other situations the key is created using a passphrase and a key generation algorithm using a cryptographic hash function such as SHA 1

Symmetric key algorithms are a class of algorithms for cryptography that use trivially related often identical cryptographic keys for both decryption and encryption

The encryption key is simply related to the decryption key in that they may be identical or there is a simple relation between the two keys The keys in practice represent a shared secret between two or more parties that can be used to maintain a private secure connection

Other terms for symmetric key encryption are secret key single key shared key one key and eventually private key encryption Make sure that the use of the latter term does conflict with the term private key in public key cryptography

Symmetric key algorithms can be divided into stream ciphers and block ciphers Stream ciphers encrypt the bits of the message as a stream of bits one at a time and block ciphers take a number of bits and encrypt them as a single unit Blocks of 64 bits have been commonly used though modern ciphers like the Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm uses 128 bit blocks

Symmetric ciphers have historically been susceptible to known plaintext attacks chosen plaintext attacks differential cryptanalysis and linear cryptanalysis 

Symmetric keys are generated using the process of cryptographic keys generation though it is recommended to use highly entropy systems to generate the initial seed

Examples of popular symmetric cyphers include Twofish Serpent AES Blowfish CAST5 RC4 TDES and IDEA

Unlike symmetric algorithms asymmetric key algorithms use a different key for encryption than for decryption Ie a user knowing the encryption key of an asymmetric algorithm can encrypt messages but cannot derive the decryption key and cannot decrypt messages encrypted with that key A short comparison of these two types of algorithms is given below 

Symmetric key algorithms are generally much less computationally intensive than asymmetric key algorithms In practice asymmetric key algorithms are typically hundreds to thousands times slower than symmetric key algorithms

One disadvantage of symmetric key algorithms is the requirement of a shared secret key with both parties holding the same copy at each end In order to ensure secure communications between everyone in a group of n people a total of n2 keys are needed which is the total number of possible communication channels To limit the impact of a potential discovery by a cryptographic attacker they should be changed regularly and kept secure during distribution and in service The process of selecting distributing and storing keys is known as key management and is difficult to achieve reliably and securely

In modern cryptosystems designs both asymmetric and symmetric algorithms are used to take advantage of the best of both  Asymmetric algorithms are used to distribute symmetric keys at the start of a session Once a symmetric key is known to all parties of the session faster symmetric key algorithms using that key can be used to encrypt the remainder of the session This simplifies the key distribution problem because asymmetric keys only have to be distributed authentically while symmetric keys need to be distributed in both an authentic and confidential manner

Systems that use such a hybrid approach include SSL PGP and GPG etc

John Marshall was an American statesman and jurist who shaped American constitutional law and made the Supreme Court more powerful Marshall was Chief Justice of the United States working from February 4 1801 until his death in 1835 He worked in the United States House of Representatives from March 4 1799 to June 7 1800 and under President John Adams was Secretary of State from June 6 1800 to March 4 1801 Marshall was from the Commonwealth of Virginia and a leader of the Federalist Party

The longest working Chief Justice in Supreme Court history Marshall ruled the Court for thirty years and was an important part of making the American legal system His most important addition was judicial review the power to stop laws that violate the Constitution Marshall has been called the one that made the judicial branch special and powerful Marshall also balanaced the power between the federal and state government He made sure the federal law was more powerful than state law and agreed with an expansive reading of the enumerated powers

William Harris Crawford was an important American politician as well as a judge during the early 19th century He served as United States Secretary of War from 1815 to 1816 and United States Secretary of the Treasury from 1816 to 1825 and was a candidate for President of the United States in 1824

In 1875 Crawford appeared on the 50 cent bill

James McHenry was an early American statesman McHenry was a signer of the United States Constitution from Maryland and the namesake of Fort McHenry the bombardment of which inspired the American national anthem Star Spangled Banner He was also a delegate to the Continental Congress from Maryland and the third United States Secretary of War from January 27 1796 to May 131800 under Presidents George Washington and John Adams

Timothy Pickering was a politician from Massachusetts who served in a variety of roles most notably as the third United States Secretary of State serving in that office from 1795 to 1800 under Presidents George Washington and John Adams

John Jay was an American politician statesman revolutionary diplomat a Supreme Court Chief Justice and a Founding Father of the United States Jay served in the Continental Congress and was elected President of that body During and after the American Revolution he was a minister to Spain and France helping to fashion American foreign policy and to secure favorable peace terms from the British and French He co wrote the Federalist Papers with Alexander Hamilton and James Madison

Jay served on the US Supreme Court as the first Chief Justice of the United States from 1789 to 1795 In 1794 he negotiated the Jay Treaty with the British A leader of the new Federalist party Jay was governor of New York from 1795 to 1801 He was the leading opponent of slavery and the slave trade in New York His first attempt to pass emancipation legislation failed in 1777 and failed again in 1785 but he succeeded in 1799 signing the law that eventually emancipated the slaves of New York the last were freed before his death

Duke Nukem 3D is a first person shooter computer game It was made by 3D Realms and sold by Apogee Software It was first sold on January 29 1996 Duke Nukem 3D is based on the main character from the platform games Duke Nukem and Duke Nukem II which were also published by Apogee The character is voiced by Jon St John

In the game players control Duke Nukem an action hero from Earth Players must fight invading aliens that want to take over Earth The game is made up of 28 levels spread over three chapters An add on pack called The Plutonium Pak later added a fourth episode of 11 new levels new enemies and one new weapon

The game is a first person shooter so the player sees the game from Dukes eyes Instead of following the character around like a third person shooter Duke Nukem is like being inside Duke and the player can see Dukes hands and weapons on the screen The player fights the aliens most often by shooting at them with different guns but Duke can also kick and throw pipe bombs like grenades The player must also sometimes solve puzzles to find the way through the level

Duke Nukem 3D is set sometime in the early 21st century starting in a badly worn down Los Angeles The game moves on to places such as lunar space stations An alien transgenic species has invaded Earth while Duke has been fighting in space Duke crash lands back on Earth and finds most humans are gone Only a few women remain as slaves for the aliens America has been turned into a wasteland and pornography has become the only entertainment

The levels of Duke Nukem 3D take the player outdoors and indoors on the street inside military bases deserts flooded cities space stations moon bases and Japanese villas Levels were designed with many routes so that players can climb through air ducts back doors and sewers to avoid enemies or find hidden secrets This makes the levels well suited to multiplayer deathmatchs The secret items also include or simply provide a touch of diversion and strippers who Duke tells jokes to and sometimes they open up their clothes

The game includes a range of weapons some of which even today are still unique to the Duke Nukem series They range from Dukes foot for kicking a pistol a Chain gun pipe bombs freeze and shrink rays and laser trip mines

Aside from weapons Nukem can also find medkits to heal himself whenever the player chooses Steroids make the player move faster as well as removing the effects of the shrink ray Nightvision goggles allow players to see enemies in the dark The HoloDuke device projects a fake hologram of Duke that can be used to trick enemies Protective boots allow the player to cross dangerously hot or toxic floors For underwater scenes scuba gear can be used to let Duke breathe One of the favorite items is the jetpack which allows the player to fly up in the sky often to reach hidden weapons or extra health Many of the secret items such as the jetpack the scuba gear and the night vision goggles only last for a short time Weapons also have a limited number of ammunition

There are many monsters in the game Some of these are aliens others mutated humans Similar to many first person shooter games Nukem encounters a large number of weaker enemies and a small number of boss enemies Like Duke these boss enemies have a wide range of weapons and equipment

In 1996 at the time of the games release Internet based gaming was just beginning and Duke Nukem 3D could be played on IPX LAN or modem Duke Nukem 3D players often used the IPX network utility Kali or the Total Entertainment Network online service Kali allowed users to join a chat room to find opponents The Total Entertainment Network had hundreds of Duke 3D players online at any time but players had to pay money monthly for it The games levels are often used as the battlegrounds for these online players bur users are able to create their own levels The game also features co operative play which allows players to fight against the aliens instead of each other In the Atomic version a new game play mode was introduced Duke Tag a capture the flag style mode

Ken Silvermans Build engine allowed complicated levels The game could use slopes in the floors It also supports upwards and downwards mouse aiming

Duke Nukem 3D Build engine had doorswalls that can move sideways The Build scripting system allows a whole string of moving and sliding parts with sound effects such as buildings falling down earthquakes and walls that break apart when hit with explosives One of the more advanced effects is the horizontal sliding platform that can move the player inside a small sliding room which made it possible to create subway cars moving in a timed sequence around a ring shaped track

The Build engine makes horizontally moving platforms possible by allowing several objects to pass through the same 2D space While inside one of these spaces it is not possible to see into the other space and so the Byuild 25D engine has no problem rendering one space or the other even though the map data literally shows the two areas to be occupying the same place Several Duke Nukem 3D maps use this feature to create bizarre mind bending maps where multiple large rooms all seem to be occupying one 3D space One secret level in particular has a map where the player can travel 720 degrees around a circle and not cross their path This would be much more difficult to duplicate with modern true 3D map editors and engines 

An early beta version of Duke Nukem 3D called LameDuke was released by 3D Realms as a bonus one year after the release of the official version It has been released as is with no support and is currently available to download from the 3DRealms FTP ftpftp3drealmscommisclamedukezip

LameDuke features four episodes Some weapons were removed andor altered from the original versions

Duke Nukem 3D is often thought of as one of the first videogames to have adult humor and sexual themes especially in the first person shooter genre Jokes about American consumerism Hollywood culture and sex in the media are made all through the game Dukes world is out of control and virtually all forms of entertainment in this future have been reduced to pornography by the aliens

The game has been heavily attacked by some critics who claim that it supports pornography and murder Media Watch made the following comments about the game

 Duke Nukem 3D moves the shooter through pornography stores where Duke can use XXX sex posters for target practice Duke throws cash at a prostituted woman telling her to Shake it Baby his gun ever ready In the game bonus points are awarded for the murder of these mostly prostituted and partially nude women Duke blows up stained glass windows in an empty church or goes to strip clubs where Japanese women lower their kimonos exposing their breasts Duke is encouraged to kill defenseless often bound women Media Watch Teaching Boys To Kill 

In reality Duke Nukem 3D does not contain a bonus points system even accidental shooting of innocents in the game is sometimes punished by a sudden group of enemies attacking

Duke Nukem 3D was banned in Brazil along with Quake Doom and several other violent first person shooters As a response to complaints censored versions of the game were sold in some countries to avoid being banned In Germany the BPjM placed the game on the List of Media Harmful to Young People

Many spin offs and modifications to the original Duke Nukem 3D were produced after the games initial launch

Plutonium PAKAtomic Edition The Atomic Edition of Duke Nukem 3D was first sold in November 1996 and contained the original 3 episode game as well as a new eleven level fourth episode The Plutonium PAK was also sold as an upgrade package to convert the first available version of Duke Nukem 3D to the new Atomic Edition It includes three new enemies the Protector Drone the Pig Cop Tank and a new boss known as The Alien Queen It also includes a new weapon the Microwave Expander with its own special ammunition It also has several improvements to the software of the game which allow the games players to create new enemies and items Also this version includes a computer controlled second player to simulate multiplayer games

EDuke created by Matthew Saettler was given away as a patch for Atomic Edition users on July 28 2000 On this version 3D Realms removed the copyrights from the software so that players could do anything they liked with it and included a demo mod made by several beta testers The demo included new Sector Based Effects Sprite Based Elevators Ladders a Bouncing Particle Fountain a Personal Teleporter and a Sophisticated Translucent Water Effect Saettler has kept records of his original Eduke site hee for reference

Duke Caribbean Lifes a Beach This is an add on created by Sunstorm Interactive Duke relaxes on a tropical island when he discovers that the aliens are having their own vacation there This unofficial add on has a sunny Caribbean atmosphere nice beaches and hotels as well as some of the original Duke Nukem 3D stuff fit in It includes levels created by Charlie Wiederhold who later worked for 3D Realms to work on Duke Nukem Forever the upcoming sequel to Duke Nukem 3D

Duke it out in DC In this storyline President Bill Clinton is captured by alien forces and it is up to Duke to save him This pack has levels that are based on real locations of Washington DC such as the White House the FBI headquarters the Smithsonian museum and the Washington Monument and others This game was also developed by Sunstorm Interactive

Duke Nuclear Winter This one was developed by Simply Silly Software In the storyline Santa Claus is mind controlled by aliens into causing trouble on Earth Several of the levels take place near the North Pole This game has sometimes been criticized for using content from the original Duke Nukem 3D

Duke Xtreme An add on developed by Sunstorm Interactive and contained 50 levels and many items This version had many technical problems

DukeZone Was sold by WizardWorks and had over 500 levels made by fans of Duke Nukem 3D DukeZONE II contained three episodes designed by WizardWorks

Duke Nukem 3D has been included in several compilations A bundle called East Meets West included the full versions of Duke Nukem 3D Atomic Edition and Shadow Warrior A bundle called Duke Nukem Kill A Ton Collection featured Duke Nukem 3D Atomic Edition Duke Xtreme DukeZONE II Duke Nukem I Duke Nukem II and various other utilities Both of these compilations are no longer sold Earlier packages of Duke Nukem 3D also included the complete versions of Duke Nukem I and II as a bonus

In 1998 3D Realms filed a lawsuit against Micro Star over its add on pack Nuke It and won 

The source code to the Duke Nukem 3D v15 executable which uses the Build engine was released as free software under the GPL on April 1 2003 The artwork remains copyright protected Many programmers altered so that it can be played on modern computers As of 2007 these projects gave the game a second life in multiplayer games through the Internet and a growing community is still actively playing

The first modern Duke Nukem 3D project was from icculusorg It is a cross platform project that allows the game to be played on BeOS FreeBSD Linux Mac OS X Solaris Windows and prossibly others The icculusorg software would later be used in the Rancidmeat and later the xDuke projects

One popular project is Jonathon Fowlers JFDuke3D which the original creator of Duke Nukem 3D Ken Silverman gave support to in December 2003 Fowler and Silverman produced a new version of JFDuke3D using Polymost an OpenGL software product for Build which uses much more advanced 3D models and 32 bit color Another project JFDuke3D called xDuke was created for play on the Xbox

Silverman has helped Fowler with a lot of other software work related to the game 

Here is a list of some of the most popular Duke Nukem 3D versions played in 2008

Projects such as the Duke Nukem 3D High Resolution Pack were started to give the game the same quality as modern games There are plans to continue enhancing the Duke Nukem 3D software but no new versions of JFDuke3D have appeared since 2005

A few projects have been created from the EDuke version but it was not until the release of Richard Gobeilles EDuke32 in 2004 that EDuke became a the most popular with programmers EDuke32 has been capable of playing OGG music since September 2007 A pack of music was compiled is planned to be part of future versions of the High Resolution Pack In June 2008 EDuke32 became the first Duke Nukem 3D project to be played as 64 bit software thanks to the DOSBox team

In 1997 Duke Nukem 3D versions were sold for all the major consoles of the time 

The PlayStation version Duke Nukem Total Meltdown includes six extra areas and a secret level which was also included in the PC version It has some music from the PC version some from the original in Streaming XA Audio made by Mark Knight new enemies and a new boss

The Sega Saturn version was created by Lobotomy Software and sold by Sega It uses Lobotomys SlaveDriver software This version uses the Sega NetLink for online play and is played with the Saturns analog pad It also includes a hidden multiplayer mini game called Death Tank Zwei The Nintendo 64 version was named Duke Nukem 64 and can be played by four players on a split screen There is no music in this version and many items have been renamed to avoid drug and sex references Other changes include a fully 3D model for the final boss

In 1998 a Sega Mega Drive version was sold by Tec Toy The artwork is very simple and only one third of the original game was included This version was sold in Brazil only 

A version of Duke Nukem 3D was also released for the Gamecom Tigers handheld system

A Duke Nukem 3D version has been sold for Xbox Live since September 24 2008 This version includes the ability to rewind the game to any point if Duke gets killed video recording and online multiplayer games The music is slightly better quality using modern MIDI tools

William Hubbs Rehnquist was an American lawyer jurist and a political figure who served as an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of the United States and later as the Chief Justice of the United States Considered a conservative Rehnquist favored a federalism under which the states meaningfully exercised governmental power Under this view of federalism the Supreme Court of the United States for the first time since the 1930s struck down an Act of Congress as exceeding federal power under the Commerce Clause

Hyderbd and Berar under the Nizams was the largest princely state in the erstwhile Indian Empire The Berar region of present day Vidarbha in Maharashtra was merged with the Central Provinces in 1903 to form Central Provinces and Berar

Hyderabad state was located in south central Indian subcontinent from 1724 until 1948 ruled by a hereditary Nizam During partition of India in 1947 the Nizam of Hyderabad declared his intentions of not joining either newly formed India or Pakistan Sensing trouble India launched Operation Polo which resulted in the absorption of Hyderabad into the Indian Union in 1948

The Two Nation Theory was the basis for the Partition of India in 1947 It stated that Muslims and Hindus were two separate nations by every idealogical definition and therefore Muslims should have an autonomous homeland in the Muslim majority areas of British India for the safeguard of their political cultural and social rights within or without a United India However some Pakistanis including a retired Pakistani Brigadier believe that the theory could only be disproved with the reunification of independent Bangladesh and Republic of India

Attack models or attack typesrefsecondname specify how much information a cryptanalyst has access to when breaking or cracking an encrypted message commonly known as codebreaking or cracking the code Some common attack models are

The ciphertext only attack model is the weakest because it implies that the cryptanalyst has just the encoded message

Different attack models are used for other cryptographic systems or more generally for all kind of security systems Examples for such attack models are

Three singles were released from the album Straight from the Heart Cuts Like a Knife and This Time the three made Adams very popular

The first single Lonely Nights was a big hit in the US and two other singles Coming Home and Fits Ya Good were top 40 hits in Canada

Many songs from this album were covered by other artists they are Lonely Nights by Uriah Heep Jealousy by Prism Tonight by Randy Meisner and Fits Ya Good by Tove Naess and more others

After Dave Taylor listened to this album he decided to become Bryan Adams bass player

In early 1978 Bryan Adams and Jim Vallance made a song writing duo together They made the album in 1979 and released it in February 1980

The first single was Hidin from Love in 1980 the next one was Give Me Your Love and then Remember

The known plaintext attack is an attack model for cryptanalysis where the attacker has samples of both the plaintext and its encrypted version then he can use them to expose further secret information after calculating the secret key 

Encrypted file archives such as ZIP are very prone to this attack For example an attacker with an encrypted ZIP file needs only one unencrypted file from the archive which forms the known plaintext Then using some publicly available software they can instantly calculate the key required to decrypt the entire archive

Classical ciphers are typically susceptible to known plaintext attack For example a Caesar cipher can be solved using a single letter of corresponding plaintext and ciphertext to decrypt entirely 

East Side Story was originally going to be released on Chicanes canceled Album Easy To Assemble with Bryan Adams on vocals albeit with a completely different composition

Three singles have been released from the album I Thought Id Seen Everything Tonight We Have the Stars and Shes Got a Way The album was also released in the US exclusively through Wal Mart and Sams Club retail stores on May 13 2008 To promote the album Adams toured around Europe on the 11 Days 11 Cities acoustic tour playing new songs and old classics

In support of the release of 11 Adams started the 11 concerts 11 cities tour having concerts in 11 different countries in just 11 days The intimate shows at some spectacular venues will see Adams perform an acoustic set on stage with just his guitar and harmonica The London show was on March 11 2008 at St James Church in Piccadilly The last stop of his 11 days concert tour was in Copenhagen Denmark on 17 March After the 11 concerts 11 cities Adams went and acoustic tour where he toured with Foreigner and Rod Stewart to support his new album Zimbio asked Adams With the acoustic tour which of your songs do you feel sound best acoustically

A chosen plaintext attack is an attack model for cryptanalysis which assume that the attacker has the capability to choose random plaintexts to be encrypted and obtain the corresponding ciphertexts The goal of the attack is to gain some further information which reduces the security of the encryption scheme In the worst case a chosen plaintext attack could expose secret information after calculating the secret key 

Modern cryptography is implemented in software or hardware and is used for a diverse range of applications for many applications a chosen plaintext attack is often very feasible Chosen plaintext attacks become extremely important in the context of public key cryptography where the encryption key is public and attackers can encrypt any plaintext they choose

Any cipher that can prevent chosen plaintext attacks is then also guaranteed to be secure against known plaintext and ciphertext only attacks this is a conservative approach to security

Two forms of chosen plaintext attack can be distinguished

In cryptography a ciphertext only attack or known ciphertext attack is an attack model for cryptanalysis where the attacker is assumed to have access only to a set of ciphertexts 

The attack is completely successful if the corresponding plaintexts can be deduced or even better the key The ability to obtain any amount of information from the underlying ciphertext is considered a success 

Every modern cipher attempts to provide protection against ciphertext only attacks The process of Selecting a new cipher design standard usually takes many years and includes exhaustive testing of large quantities of ciphertext for any statistical different approach from random noise On the other hand poor cipher depends on home grown proprietary algorithms that have not been subjected to extensive testing and inspection for this reason many computer age encryption systems are still subject to ciphertext only attack but still in use Examples include

A chosen ciphertext attack is an attack model for cryptanalysis in which the cryptanalyst gathers information at least in part by choosing a ciphertext and obtaining its decryption under an unknown key 

When a cryptosystem is susceptible to chosen ciphertext attack implementers must be careful to avoid situations in which an attackers might be able to decrypt chosen ciphertexts This can be more difficult than it appears as even partially chosen ciphertexts can permit subtle attacks Additionally some cryptosystems use the same mechanism to sign messages and to decrypt them This permits attacks when hashing is not used on the message to be signed A better approach is to use a cryptosystem which is provably secure under chosen ciphertext attack including RSA OAEP Cramer Shoup and many forms of authenticated symmetric encryption

Chosen ciphertext attacks like other attacks may be adaptive or non adaptive In a non adaptive attack the attacker chooses the ciphertext or ciphertexts to decrypt in advance and does not use the resulting plaintexts to inform their choice for more ciphertexts In an adaptive chosen ciphertext attack the attacker makes their ciphertext choices adaptively that is depending on the result of prior decryptions

A specially noted variant of the chosen ciphertext attack is the lunchtime or midnight attack in which an attacker may make adaptive chosen ciphertext queries but only up until a certain point after which the attacker must demonstrate some improved ability to attack the system The term lunchtime attack refers to the idea that a users computer with the ability to decrypt is available to an attacker while the user is out to lunch This form of the attack was the first one commonly discussed obviously if the attacker has the ability to make adaptive chosen ciphertext queries no encrypted message would be safe at least until that ability is taken away This attack is sometimes called the non adaptive chosen ciphertext attack here non adaptive refers to the fact that the attacker cannot adapt their queries in response to the challenge which is given after the ability to make chosen ciphertext queries has expired 

Many chosen ciphertext attacks of practical importance are lunchtime attacks including for instance when Daniel Bleichenbacher of Bell Laboratories demonstrated a practical attack against systems using the PKCS 1 invented and published by RSA Security

A adaptive chosen ciphertext attack is an attack in which ciphertexts may be chosen adaptively before and after a challenge ciphertext is given to the attacker with ONE condition that the challenge ciphertext may not itself be queried This is a stronger attack notion than the lunchtime attack and is commonly referred to as a CCA2 attack as compared to a CCA1 attack  Few practical attacks are of this form Rather this model is important for its use in proofs of security against chosen ciphertext attacks A proof that attacks in this model are impossible implies that any practical chosen ciphertext attack cannot be performed 

Cryptosystems proven secure against adaptive chosen ciphertext attacks include the Cramer Shoup system and RSA OAEP 

He got to know a girl that lived in Trubschachen It was a real lovestory When he went at her home he had the idea to make a biscuit after his grandmothers recipe this was in 1906 In 1910 he could absorb the store of his instructor

Today Kambly is Switzerlands largest biscuit producer and leading exporter Kambly is represented in more than 30 different countries It is the most famous and most liked biscuit brand of SwitzerlandsFactdateApril 2009 There are two factories one in Trubschachen and one in Lyss both in the canton of Berne Today its Oscar Kambly the third who administrates the factory he has done this since 1983 Oscar Kambly who founded the factory leaded it from 1910 1953 The first factory was only in Trubschachen but because Kambly bought the Arni AG in Lyss in 1999 they now have got another station There are 420 employees 2007 there was a conversion of 164 million Swiss francs Kambly got the award Brand Excellence Swiss Trophy in 2003 In 2003 20052007 2008 the international price Saveur de lAnne

There are 2 factory stores One in Lyss and another one in Trubschachen There you can buy the biscuits much cheaper

The oldest product is the Bretzeli that has been produced since 1906 and that was invented by Oscar Kambly the first Some other known products are Biscuits Butterfly Caprice Mignon and the Petit Beurre They also produce salted biscuits 

Differential cryptanalysis is a general form of cryptanalysis applicable to block ciphers but also can be applied to stream ciphers and cryptographic hash functions It is the study of how differences in the input can affect the resultant differences at the output In the case of a block cipher it refers to a set of techniques and methods for tracing differences through the network of transformations discovering where the cipher demonstrates non random behaviour and extend such properties to recover the secret key

Differential cryptanalysis attacks are usually chosen plaintext attacks meaning that the attacker must be able to obtain encrypted ciphertexts for some set of plaintexts of his choosing

In cryptography linear cryptanalysis is a general form of cryptanalysis based on finding affine approximations to the action of a cipher Attacks have been developed for block ciphers and stream ciphers Linear cryptanalysis is one of the two most widely used attacks on block ciphers the other being differential cryptanalysis

A variety of refinements to the attack have been suggested including using multiple linear approximations or including non linear expressions 

Evidence of security against linear cryptanalysis is usually expected of new cipher designs

Tropical Storm Cristobal was the third tropical storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season It began on July 19 as a weather system away from the Southeast US Coast It became a tropical storm later that day Cristobal stayed away from land and reached its highest strength as a strong tropical storm on July 21 It moved to the northeast next to the US East Coast and died out on July 23 near Nova Scotia Because it was a weak storm and never moved onto land Cristobals damages were mostly moderate rainfall The storm dropped 343 in of rain in Wilmington North Carolina where minor flooding happened Also the remnants helped produce rainfall on Nova Scotia which caused some flooding on roads and in basements

On July 14 2008 a weakening weather system stretched across northern Florida causing thunderstorms A weak low pressure area formed on July 15 near Tallahassee which moved towards the southeast into the Gulf of Mexico Late on July 16 it moved onto land near Tampa and strengthening was not expected However late on July 17 thunderstorms became stronger around the low pressure area and the system started to get better organized Late on July 18 the National Hurricane Center said that a tropical depression was forming At 11 pm EST on July 18 it was classified as Tropical Depression Three about 65 miles to the southeast of Charleston South Carolina

It was located between an area of high pressure to its southeast and another one to the northwest the depression moved slowly towards the northeast It became a weak tropical storm during the early afternoon of July 19 In the beginning the storm was not strong with few strong thunderstorms Dry air in the middle to upper levels of the atmosphere caused the storm to not strengthen However late on July 20 thunderstorms became more active Cristobal stayed as a weak tropical storm during the time that it moved close to the South Carolina and North Carolina coast and the storm never moved onto land It reached its highest intensity as a strong tropical storm on July 21 while it passed east of Cape Hatteras and stayed the same over the warm Gulf Stream The storm started to enter cooler waters and the cyclone quickly moved towards the east northeastward on July 21 and July 22 In the afternoon of July 22 Cristobal began to weaken while to the south of Nova Scotia The storms cloud pattern became weak and on July 23 it became an extratropical cyclone and was no longer a tropical storm The National Hurricane Center issued its last advisory on the system at 500 am EDT on July 23

Before the storm the National Hurricane Center started a tropical storm warning from Cape Lookout North Carolina to the VirginiaNorth Carolina border Before Cristobal formed it produced light rain in Florida At Lake Wales about 6 inches of rainfell mostly in a two hour period The rain clogged storm drains which caused light flooding The rain caused no serious problems and helped get rid of dry conditions The storm dropped convert343inmmabbron in Wilmington North Carolina Minor flooding happened there Because most of the storm stayed out to sea winds along the coast were light On the coast storm surge reached convert1ftmabbron above normal Winds that were of tropical storm strength were reported offshore No severe damage was reported

Cristobal helped produce heavy rain and flooding in Atlantic Canada At Baccaro Point on the southern tip of Nova Scotia 224 mm of rain fell There was flooding to basements and streets in Cape Sable A sailor from Connecticut was rescued to the southeast of Halifax by a Canadian helicopter because his ship capsized in the strong waves

Gorillaz are an animated English rock band The band was invented by Damon Albarn a member of the band Blur and Jamie Hewlett who has worked on the comic book series Tank Girl Even though the band members are fictional they have released several albums and music videos The bands members are 2D Noodle Russell Hobbs and Murdoc Niccals

The bands genre is mostly a combination of alternative rock alternative hip hop and electronica It also has elements of experimental trip hop dub and psychedelic rock

Since they are an animated group they cannot perform live like real bands can At Gorillaz concerts the real members of the band stand behind screens which show computer generated images of the animated group performing

The Pantanal is the worlds largest wetland or swamp 

It covers a region of 140000 sq km larger than the area covered by the country Greece 

The Pantanal is located in South America and shared by Brazil Bolivia and Paraguay

There are many threats to the Pantanal such as pollution mercury from gold mining and ranching Although the Pantanal can wash some of the chemicals away the increased amount is becoming a concern

In winter nearly 80 of the area is flooded

Kaiserswerth is a settlement with a more than 1000 year history It is one of the oldest parts of Dsseldorf 

It is in the north of Dsseldorf next to the river Rhine Kaiserswerth has 7712 inhabitants and an area of 471 km

About the year 700 the monk St Suitbert founded a Benedictine abbey there It was destroyed 88 years later

The Kaiserpfalz was built in 1045 

In 1062 the young German King Heinrich IV was kidnapped by the archbishop of Cologne 

In 1174 Friederick I Barbarossa moved the Rhine customs collection to Kaiserswerth So the bishop took over control over the whole empire

Following emperors used Kaiserswerth as temporary seat like as prison for high range prisoners

Between 1212 and 1215 the Count of Berg tried to get out prisoners and made the ground around the Castle dry

In 1273 the Emperor pledged Kaiserswerth to the archbishop of Cologne

In 1689 Kaiserswerth was particularly destroyed by France during the War of the Palatine Succession During the Spanish war of succession the Bishop of Cologne stayed with France

Kaiserswerth got a French garrison In 1702 the city was therefore besieged by the Grand Alliance After that war the castle was mostly destroyed

In the 19th century Kaiserswerth was famous by its deaconess clinic Florence Nightingale visited in 1850 and learned from Pastor Theodor Fliedner and the deaconesses working there for the sick and the deprived Nightingale published The Institution of Kaiserswerth on the Rhine for the Practical Training of Deaconesses etc in 1851  her first publication

Kaiserswerth became a part of Dsseldorf in 1929

Ive been on Simple for approx 3 months now and Id like to see what the community thinks about me becoming an admin here Id like to think I have a pretty good understanding of how simple works its policies and guidelines and I believe I meet the requirements Im sure Simple will benefit by having me on the admin team Why do I need the tools Often times I find a lot of articles and a few of the other admins arent watching Or there are times where I know I would block someone who is constantly vandalizing and Majorly does it before I can file a report Thank you Synergy 0006 24 October 2008

Candidates acceptanceI accept Synergy 0022 24 October 2008Id forget my head if it wasnt in the process of simplifying something

I apologize if there were times where it wasnt at all clear where the article was coming from I figured by placing the iw link to en on the page at the same time as creating the article and saying so in the edit summary was enough Maybe Im wrong I just didnt think that creating at least 6 to 7 hundred talk pages here on simple only saying what the edit summary says was not very productive possibly unneeded and a waste If you suggest a better edit summary to use I will of course use it Synergy 1608 28 October 2008

In physics mechanical energy describes the potential energy and kinetic energy present in the components of a mechanical system

When a given amount of mechanical energy is transferred it is said that this amount of mechanical work has been done Both mechanical energy and mechanical work are measured in the same units as energy in general It is usually said that a component of a system has a certain amount of mechanical energy whereas mechanical work describes the amount of mechanical energy a component has gained or lost

The conservation of mechanical energy is a principle which states that under certain conditions the total mechanical energy of a system is constant This rule does not hold when mechanical energy is converted to other forms such as chemical nuclear or electromagnetic However the principle of general conservation of energy is so far an unbroken rule of physics  as far as we know energy cannot be created or destroyed only changed in form

Vitiligo is a long lasting skin disease that causes the losing of color from the skin It occurs when the melanocytes cells that give skin their color die or do not work

The exact cause of vitiligo is complex and not fully understood It may be caused by the immune system genetic and environmental factors Vitiligo may also be caused by stress that affects the immune system leading the body to react and start eliminating skin pigment

People over 20 years old rarely develop this disease These patches often occur to both sides symmetrically and may change shape

This disease can also affect the mental state of the patient 

Today doctors do not understand what causes the disease so right now it can not be cured Some things can be done to fight its effects though Makeup or cosmetics can cover up the parts of the skin with vitiligo Also staying out of the sun to prevent tanning is good But the treatment given by most skin doctors is cortico steroid cream Breakthrough discovery in 2004 allowed for the transplant of melanocytes to vitiligo affected areas repigmenting the region

Virtue is a kind of behaviour which is thought to be good The adjective is virtuous Someone who lives a virtuous life is someone who leads a good moral life doing things that society thinks are good The opposite of virtue is vice 

Philosophers throughout the ages have written their ideas about what they think virtue is The Ancient Greek philosophers from Plato onwards said that virtue consisted of four things Justice Courage Wisdom and Moderation In the Christian religion the three virtues were Faith Hope and Charity These are mentioned in the Bible in the First Book of Corintheans ch13v13 These virtues are also very important in the Judaic and Muslim traditions

In cryptography Twofish is a symmetric key block cipher with a block size of 128 bits and key lengths up to 256 bits 

In 1997 the NIST announced for competition to choose a successor to DES to be known as AES Twofish was one of the five finalists of the Advanced Encryption Standard competition but was not selected as a standard 

Twofish is related to the earlier block cipher Blowfish Twofishs main features are the use of pre computed key dependent S boxes and a relatively complex key schedule One half of an n bit key is used as the actual encryption key and the other half of the n bit key is used to modify the encryption algorithm Twofish uses some elements from other designs for example the pseudo Hadamard transform from the SAFER family of ciphers Twofish uses the same Feistel structure as the DES

On most software platforms Twofish is slightly slower than Rijndael for 128 bit keys but somewhat faster for 256 bit keys

Twofish was designed by Bruce Schneier John Kelsey Doug Whiting David Wagner Chris Hall and Niels Ferguson the extended Twofish team who met to made further cryptanalysis of Twofish and other AES competitors included Stefan Lucks Tadayoshi Kohno and Mike Stay

Twofish algorithm is free for anyone to use without any restrictions whatsoever The Twofish cipher has not been patented and the software example of its specification has been placed in the public domain However Twofish is not widely used like the Blowfish which has been available for a longer period of time

As of 2008 the best published cryptanalysis on the Twofish block cipher is a truncated differential cryptanalysis of the full 16 round version The paper claims that the probability of truncated differentials attacks is 2 573 per block and that it will take about 251 chosen plaintexts to find a good pair of truncated differentials

Bruce Schneier responds in a 2005 blog entry that this paper does not present a full cryptanalytic attack but only some hypothesized differential characteristics But even from a theoretical perspective Twofish is not even remotely broken There have been no extensions to these results since they were published in 2000

In cryptography truncated differential cryptanalysis is a generalization of differential cryptanalysis an attack model against block ciphers In 1994 Lars Knudsen designed the technique during this period ordinary differential cryptanalysis analyzes the full difference between two texts the truncated version considers differences that are only determined to some extent It has been applied to SAFER IDEA Skipjack E2 Twofish Camellia CRYPTON and the stream cipher Salsa20 as well

The Fatimid Caliphate was ruled by the al Ftimiyyn dynasty from 5 January 909 to 1171 It was an Arab Shia dynasty It ruled the fourth and final Arab caliphate In different times different areas of the Maghreb Egypt and the Levant belonged to the caliphate 

The Fatimids established the Egyptian city of Cairo as their capital The term Fatimite is sometimes used to refer to the citizens of this caliphate as well The ruling elite of the state belonged to the Ismaili branch of Shiism The leaders of the dynasty were also Shia Ismaili Imams They had a religious significance to Ismaili Muslims They are also part of the chain of holders of the office of Caliph as recognized by most Muslims the only period in which the Shia Imamate and the Caliphate were united to any degree

The Fatimids were famous for religious tolerance towards non Ismaili sects of Islam as well as towards Jews Maltese Christians and Coptic Christians but there were some exceptions nevertheless

The Fatimids had their origins in Ifriqiya The dynasty was founded in 909 by Abdullh al Mahd Billah who legitimised his claim through descent from Muhammad by way of his daughter Ftima as Zahra and her husband Al ibn Ab Tlib the first Sha Imm hence the name al Ftimiyyn Fatimid

Abdullh al Mahdis control soon extended over all of central Maghreb an area consisting of the modern countries of Morocco Algeria Tunisia and Libya which he ruled from Mahdia his newly built capital in Tunisia

In the 1040s the Zirids declared their independence from the Fatimids and their conversion to Sunni Islam which led to the devastating Ban Hilal invasions After about 1070 the Fatimid hold on the Levant coast and parts of Syria was challenged first by Turkish invasions then the Crusades so that Fatimid territory shrank until it consisted only of Egypt 

After the decay of the Fatimid political system in the 1160s the Zengid ruler Nr ad Dn had his general Shirkuh seize Egypt from the vizier Shawar in 1169 Shirkuh died two months after taking power and the rule went to his nephew Saladin This began the Kurdish Ayyubid Dynasty

The Maghreb is a region in North Africa The term is generally applied to all of Morocco Algeria and Tunisia but in older Arabic usage meant only the area of the three countries between the high ranges of the Atlas Mountains and the Mediterranean Sea Historically some writers also included muslim ruled regions in Spain Portugal Sicily and Malta in the definition Malta in particular still speaks a language based on its own Maghrebi Arabic variety Maltese 

In cryptography plaintext is the information which the sender want to transmit to the receiver Before computers plaintext simply means text in the language of the communicating parties Since computers the definition has been expanded to include not only the electronic representation of text such as emails and word processor documents but also the computer representation of speech music pictures videos ATM and credit card transactions sensor data and so forth basically any information which the communicating parties might wish to hide from others The plaintext is the normal representation of the data before any action has been taken to hide it

The plaintext is used as input to an encryption algorithm the output is termed ciphertext In some systems however multiple layers of encryption are used in which case the ciphertext output of one encryption algorithm becomes the plaintext input to the next

In cryptography ciphertext refers to the output of the encryption process the process of transforming information using an algorithm to make it unreadable to anyone except those who own special information about it usually referred to as a key 

decryption is the reverse process of encryption it takes the unreadable ciphertext as an input and makes it readable again in the form of plaintext

In cryptography a stream cipher is a symmetric key cipher where plaintext bits are combined with a pseudorandom cipher bit stream using an exclusive or operation In a stream cipher the Plaintext digits are encrypted one at a time and the transformation of successive digits varies during the encryption state An alternative name is a state cipher as the encryption of each digit is dependent on the current state In practice the digits are typically single bits or bytes

Stream ciphers represent a different approach to symmetric encryption from block ciphers Block ciphers operate on large blocks of fixed length Stream ciphers typically execute at a higher speed than block ciphers and have lower hardware requirements However stream ciphers can be susceptible to serious security problems if used incorrectly for example in particular the same starting state must never be used twice

A stream cipher makes use of a much smaller and more convenient cryptographic keys for example 128 bits keys Based on this key it generates a pseudorandom keystream which can be combined with the plaintext digits in a similar way to the one time pad encryption algorithm However because the keystream is pseudorandom and not truly random the security associated with the one time pad cannot be applied and it is quite possible for a stream cipher to be completely insecure

A stream cipher generates successive elements of the keystream based on an internal state This state is updated in two ways 

In a synchronous stream cipher a stream of pseudo random digits is generated independently of the plaintext and ciphertext messages and then combined with the plaintext or with the ciphertext In the most common form binary digits are used and the keystream is combined with the plaintext using the exclusive or operation This is termed a binary additive stream cipher

In a synchronous stream cipher the sender and receiver must be in synchronous for decryption to be successful If digits are added or removed from the message during transmission synchronisation is lost To restore synchronisation various offsets can be tried systematically to obtain the correct decryption Another approach is to mark the ciphertext with markers at regular points in the output

If however a digit is corrupted in transmission rather than added or lost only a single digit in the plaintext is affected and the error does not propagate to other parts of the message This property is useful when the transmission error rate is high however it makes it less likely that the error would be detected without further mechanisms Moreover because of this property synchronous stream ciphers are very susceptible to active attacks if an attacker can change a digit in the ciphertext he might be able to make predictable changes to the corresponding plaintext bit for example flipping a bit in the ciphertext causes the same bit to be flipped in the plaintext

Self synchronizing stream ciphers is another technique that uses part of the previous N ciphertext digits to compute the keystream Such schemes are known also as asynchronous stream ciphers or ciphertext autokey The idea of self synchronization was patented in 1946 and has the advantage that the receiver will automatically synchronise with the keystream generator after receiving N ciphertext digits making it easier to recover if digits are dropped or added to the message stream Single digit errors are limited in their effect affecting only up to N plaintext digits It is somewhat more difficult to perform active attacks on self synchronising stream ciphers rather than synchronous counterparts

An example of a self synchronising stream cipher is a block cipher in cipher feedback mode

Binary stream ciphers are often constructed using linear feedback shift registers because they can be easily implemented in hardware and can be quickly analysed mathematically However the use of LFSRs only is insufficient to provide good security Various schemes have been designed to increase the security of LFSRs 

Because LFSRs are inherently linear one technique for removing the linearity is to feed the outputs of a group of parallel LFSRs into a non linear Boolean function to form a combination generator Various properties of such a combining function are important for ensuring the security of the resultant scheme for example in order to avoid correlation attacks 

Normally LFSRs are stepped regularly One technique to introducting non linearity is to have the LFSR clocked irregularly controlled by the output of a second LFSR Such generators include the stop and go generator the alternating step generator and the shrinking generator

The stop and go generator consists of two LFSRs One LFSR is clocked if the output of a second is a 1 otherwise it repeats its previous output This output is then combined with the output of a third LFSR clocked at a regular rate

The shrinking generator uses a different technique Two LFSRs are used both clocked regularly in the following way

This technique suffers from timing attacks on the second generator since the speed of the output is variable in a manner that depends on the second generators state This can be improved by buffering the output 

Another approach to improving the security of an LFSR is to pass the entire state of a single LFSR into a non linear filtering function

Instead of a linear driving device one may use a nonlinear update function For example Klimov and Shamir proposed triangular functions with a single cycle on n bit words

To be secure the period of the keystream needs to be large enough If the sequence repeats then the overlapping ciphertexts can be aligned against each other in depth and there are techniques which allow extraction of the plaintext form ciphertexts generated using these methods 

Stream ciphers are often used in applications where plaintext comes in quantities of unknowable length as in secure wireless connections If a block cipher were to be used in this type of application the designer would need to choose either transmission efficiency or implementation complexity since block ciphers cannot directly work on blocks shorter than their block size For example if a 128 bit block cipher received separate 32 bit bursts of plaintext three quarters of the transmitted data need padding Block ciphers must be used in ciphertext stealing or residual block termination mode to avoid padding while stream ciphers eliminate this issue by operating on the smallest transmitted unit

Another advantage of stream ciphers in military cryptography is that the cipher stream can be generated by an encryption device that is subject to strict security measures then fed to other devices eg a radio set which will perform the xor operation as part of their function The other device can be designed for used in less securely environments

RC4 is the most widely used stream cipher in software others include A51 A52 Chameleon FISH Helix ISAAC MUGI Panama Phelix Pike SEAL SOBER SOBER 128 and WAKE

Letterkenny is a town in County Donegal of the Ireland It is on the River Swilly and has a population of 17586

In 1824 when the first description of Letterkenny as a modern town was written it was stated that Within half a mile is the Port of Ballyraine whither vessels of 100 tons bring iron salt and colonial produce and whence they export hides and butter Nothing is left of the port now except the warehouses

Letterkenny achieved town status in the early 1920s following the partition of Ireland 

Thalwil is a municipality in the district of Horgen in the canton of Zrich in Switzerland

Early Middle Ages Thalwil was Alemannic farmland 

Thalwil was originally four Wachten or hamlets

In the Middle Ages most income was made in farming vineyards and a small amount of fishing on the lake Thalwil also has the oldest wood corporation in the Canton of Zurich the Bannegg Waldung It was first mentioned in 1483 

Today the economy of Thalwil is mostly some small and medium sized businesses and a wide range of shops Most of the shops are located around Gotthardstrasse the town centre

The main source of Thalwils wealth lies with its 7000 commuters These people live in Thalwil but work in Zurich city Today Thalwil has left most of its farming past behind in exchange for a town of commuters with its public transportation links low tax and good quality of life

A hearth is a brick or stone lined fireplace or oven that is used for cooking and heating Historically the hearth was the center of the home as it provided heat for the house Its Latin name is focus as it could be called the focus of the house

In more modern times the hearth can also be section of the fireplace that can be seen This often includes tileing around the base of the fireplade onto the floor

A jack o lantern is a carved pumpkin It is used as a decoration during Halloween and was named after the phenomenon of strange light flickering over peat bogs called ignis fatuus or jack o lantern 

The lakes of Titan a moon of Saturn are made of liquid methane The lakes were found by the Cassini Huygens space probe The larger lakes are known as maria and the smaller ones as lacs

It was possible that there were seas of liquid methane on Titan and first suggested after reading Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 information that showed Titan to have a thick atmosphere capable of supporting lakes but exact evidence was not found until 1995 when pictures from the Hubble telescope and other telescopes had already shown some proof of liquid methane possibly in lakes or planet wide oceans similar to oceans on Earth

The Cassini mission proved there are liquid lakes on Titan but not at first When the probe arrived in the Saturnian system in 2004 scientists hoped that hydrocarbon lakes or oceans might be seen in reflected sunlight from the surface but no reflections were found 

Scientists still believed that liquid ethane and methane would be found near Titans poles where they expected to find lots of liquid At Titans south pole an large dark area named Ontario Lacus was the first lake identified possibly created by rain as clouds are often seen in the area A possible shoreline was also identified at the pole in radar images As the Huygens Cassini probe flew by on July 22 2006 its radar took pictures of the northern part of the planet a number of large smooth areas were found on the surface near the northern pole Based on this data scientists announced definitive evidence of lakes filled with methane on Saturns moon Titan in January 2007 The CassiniHuygens team decided that the smooth areas are the hydrocarbon lakes they had been searching for the first lakes found off Earth Some valleys appear to have rivers

The satellite was not able to show pictures of lakes moving in the wind The heavy moisture and clouds of methane near Titans surface could be a sign of evaporation from lakes The lakes cover 0002002 of the saturns surface

The Cassini Huygens probe flew by in February 2007 taking radar and camera pictures of some large areas near the north pole that may be large areas of liquid methane andor ethane including one sea larger than 100000 km and another area similar in size to the Caspian Sea Pictures taken near Titans southern pole in October 2007 showed similar but far smaller areas that look like lakes

The Cassini Huygens probe flew very close to Titan in December 2007 and took infrared pictures of the chemicals on the surface and found a lake called Ontario Lacus near the south pole Scientists studying the infrared pictures decided that one or more of the large lakes in the pictures of Saturns moon Titan does hold liquid and that the liquid is made of hydrocarbons They have also found ethane on Titan This mission proves Titan to be the only other planet known to have liquid on its surface The lakes make Titan a very important planet for studying weather science Liquids gases and temperatures are at play on Titan This should help the science of weather forecasting 

Lakes were not found near near Titans center of Titan which was studied on January 14 2005 A part of the Huygens Cassini probe landed there The pictures taken by the probe as it fell showed no open areas of liquid but showed rivers that had dried It was at first thought that dark areas near the center of Titan could be a lake of a liquid or tar like substance but the probe landed on the dark area and it is solid without any liquid A device known as a penetrometer studied the surface as the probe landed and seemed to find wet clay Scientists believe that the penetrometer may have landed on a large pebble and they say that the surface is similar to sand made of ice Pictures taken after the probe landed show a large flat area covered in pebbles The pebbles may be made of water ice and are partly rounded which indicates fluids

On February 13 2008 scientists said that Titans polar lakes contain hundreds of times more natural gas and other hydrocarbons than all the known natural gas on Earth The desert near the center of the planet are not liquid but do have more organics than Earth In June 2008 Cassinis Visible and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer confirmed the presence of liquid ethane beyond doubt in a lake in Titans southern hemisphere

Predictions of Titans clouds are that during in a Saturnian year liquid moves from the equator to the poles in clouds and falls as rain

Titanian maria are named after sea monsters of Earth

Areas named Lacus are believed to be methane lakes They are named after lakes on Earth

The West Coast blues is a type of blues music related to jazz and jump blues with lots of piano sounds and jazz guitar solos which originated from Texas blues musicians that moved to California in the 1940s West Coast blues also uses smooth honey toned vocals often sounding similar to urban blues

Texas and the West Coast

The best known West Coast blues musicians may be guitarist T Bone Walker famous for the song Call It Stormy Monday originally from Texas he had made his first recordings in the late 1920s During the early 1940s Walker moved to Los Angeles where he recorded a lot of music for Capital Black White and Imperial Walker an electric guitar sound to the blues prossibly doing more to make the use of electric guitar popular in blues than anyone else Much of his material had a jazzy jump blues feel which is typical of popular blues from California in the 1940s and 1950s Other Texas bluesmen followed Pianistsongwriter Amos Milburn singer Percy Mayfield famous for the song Hit the Road Jack and Charles Brown moved to Los Angeles Guitarist Pee Wee Crayton divided his time between Los Angeles and San Francisco while Lowell Fulson from Texas by way of Oklahoma moved to Oakland

After the efforts of Tom Mazzolini producer of the San Francisco Blues Festival started in 1974 and the efforts of recording companies like Arhoolie and HighTone the West Coast is one of the most important blues areas in the country

Sir Frederick William Pottinger 2nd Baronet police inspector was born on April 27 1831 in India He became famous for leading the New South Wales police in their hunt for the bushrangers Ben Hall John Gilbert Frank Gardiner and John Dunn

He was the son of Lieutenant General Sir Henry Pottinger of the British East India Company and his wife Susanna Maria ne Cooke of Dublin Henry Pottinger was the first Governor of Hong Kong Frederick went to Eton from 1844 to 1847 Between 1850 and 1854 Pottinger was an officer in the Grenadier Guards in England He lost a lot of his mothers money gambling on horse races In 1856 he took the place of his father as second baronet He soon gambled away all his money He owed people a lot of money

He went to Australia to search for gold He joined the New South Wales police force as a mounted trooper He was an excellent horse rider and spent the next few years working on the gold escort between Gundagai and Goulburn

Pottinger kept his title secret but in 1860 the inspector general of police John McLerie found out He was quickly given better jobs In November he became clerk of petty sessions at Dubbo and on October 1 1861 assistant superintendent of the Southern Mounted Police Patrol He wanted to do a good job in the police but he got into a drunken brawl at Young on 2021 December 1861 He was a publicly warned about his bad behaviour He was sent to the Lachlan River area He showed he was a busy but unlucky hunter of bushrangers

In 1862 Pottinger was made an inspector of police for the Western District of New South Wales In April 1862 he arrested Ben Hall at Forbes on a charge of robbery Hall he was released because there was not enough evidence to prove he was a robber Soon afterward Hall joined Frank Gardiners gang On June 15 1862 they robbed the Lachlan gold escort of some 14000 at Eugowra This was Australias biggest gold robbery Pottinger was able to capture two of the bushrangers quickly They escaped several days later in a gun battle Pottinger got back some of the stolen gold

People thought Pottinger made a lot of mistakes He was in trouble for not having enough police guards on the gold escort and letting his prisoners escape On the night of August 9 Pottinger and a group of police surrounded the house of Gardiners mistress Kate Brown The bushranger escaped when Pottingers pistol fired accidentally They arrested a young boy who they thought was a friend of the bushrangers When he died from a fever in gaol in March 1863 this was seen to be caused by Pottingers cruelty In February 1862 Pottinger was in court at Yass for assault During a game of billiards he had been called a cheat a liar and a scoundrel He hit the person with the billiard cue and smashed his head through a window On September 27 1862 Pottinger had appeared before a Bathurst court on a charge of assault In February 1863 Pottinger went to Sydney for the trial of the escort robbers He was pushed in the street by people in the crowd He also threatened a Member of Parliament J J Harpur with his whip He didnt like things that Harpur had said about him

The bushrangers in his area became more active He captured Patrick Daley On August 17 1864 he nearly caught James Alpin McPherson

In May 1863 the inspector general told police to think of new ways to catch the bushrangers Early in January 1865 Pottinger rode a horse in the Wowingragong races This was against the rules of the police force He was sacked on February 16 1865 Pottinger said that he was just trying to get Ben Hall and John Dunn to come out of hiding His plan worked and the bushrangers went to the races only Pottinger didnt see them Protest meetings against his sacking were held on the gold diggings and in the towns People signed petitions for him to get his job back He was regarded as a brave and tireless policeman Pottinger went to Sydney to try and get back his job On March 5 1865 at Wascoes Inn in the Blue Mountains Pottinger accidentally shot himself in the stomach while trying to get onto a moving coach He was moved to the Victoria Club in Sydney where he died on April 9 1865 His brother Henry became the 3rd Baronet He was buried at St Judes Anglican Church Randwick

A bushfire is a wildfire that happens in the Australian bush Bush is the word for scrub woodland or grassland of Australia and New Zealand In south east and south west of Australia bushfires are most common in the summer and early autumn In the north of Australia bushfires usually happen during winter which is the dry season Many Australian plants burn easily Eucalyptus trees have a high oil content which makes them burn Over the last 40 years Australian bushfires have cost A25 billion In the same period Australian bushfires caused the death of around 250 people and the destruction of 4554 homes And these figures do not include the 173 people who died and the 2000 homes destroyed in the 2009 Victorian bushfires They can also kill wildlife including rare koala

Artificial selection is the intentional breeding of plants or animals It means the same thing as selective breeding 

Selective breeding is a technique used when breeding domesticated animals such as dogs pigeons or cattle Some of these animals will have traits that a breeder will want to preserve The breeder will therefore select those animals to breed that have such a quality rather than those that do not

Selective breeding often leads to inbreeding and loss of fertility To control this most breeds are outcrossed or backcrossed to wild type individuals or at least less inbred stock This is done every so many generations the details differ from breed to breed

Charles Darwin used the example of artificial selection to introduce his idea of natural selection Artificial selection may be contrasted with the process of natural selection In natural selection the differential reproduction of organisms with certain traits happens This is because some variations help the organism to have better survival and reproduction The process maintains or enhances the fitness of a population in its natural habitat 

Artificial selection may sometimes be unintentional it is thought that domestication of crops by early humans was largely unintentional

Inbreeding is a particular kind of selective breeding designed to produce a population which is genetically virtually identical Such populations are rarely viable outside the laboratory

A selectable marker is a reporter gene introduced into a cell along with a gene insert What this means is the experimenter can tell the right gene is in the cell because the marker can be seen or detected

Most often this is used for bacteria or for cells in culture Selectable markers show the success of a transfection or other procedure meant to introduce foreign DNA into a cell 

Selectable markers are often antibiotic resistance genes bacteria that have been subjected to a procedure to introduce foreign DNA are grown on a medium containing an antibiotic The antibiotic knocks out cells which do not have the resistant marker Those bacterial colonies that can grow have successfully taken up and expressed the introduced genetic material

An alternative to a selectable marker is a screenable marker which allows the researcher to distinguish between wanted and unwanted cells

Examples of selectable markers include

In Computer Science especially in artificial intelligence evolutionary algorithms are a kind of algorithm that simulate evolution to optimise something Each generation of solution is subjected to some kind of fitness function those that survive are then recombined in some way to make the next generation of solution This is done until a certain level of fitness is reached or a determined number of generations have been used

Artificial life is a field of study which examines systems related to life its processes and its evolution This is done with simulations using computer models robotics and biochemistry There are three main kinds of alife named for their approaches soft from software hard from hardware and wet from biochemistry Artificial life imitates traditional biology by trying to recreate biological phenomena The term artificial life is often used to specifically refer to soft alife

Nils Aall Barricelli was a Norwegian Italian mathematician 

Barricellis early computer assisted experiments in symbiogenesis and evolution are considered pioneering in artificial life research Barricelli who was independently wealthy held an unpaid residency at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton New Jersey in 1953 1954 and 1956 He later worked at the University of California Los Angeles at Vanderbilt University in the Department of Genetics of the University of Washington Seattle and then at the Mathematics Institute of the University of Oslo Barricelli published in a variety of fields including virus genetics DNA theoretical biology space flight theoretical physics and mathematical language

Genetic algorithms are a kind of algorithm used to find approximations in search problems Genetic algorithms are a class of evolutionary algorithms that use ideas inspired by evolution to find a solution

The concept of genetic algorithms is a search technique often used in computer science to find complex non obvious solutions to algorithmic optimisation and search problems Genetic algorithms are categorised as global search heuristics refcga and have a wide variety of applications particularly in generating useful Artificial Intelligence agents in computer games

For decades games and the field of game theory have provided competitive dynamic often unpredictable environments that make ideal test beds for computational intelligence theories architectures and algorithms Natural evolution can be modelled as a game in which the rewards for an organism that plays a good game of life are the propagation of its genetic material to its successors and its continued survival refkendell In natural evolution the performance of an individual is defined with respect to its competitors and collaborators as well as to the environment More simply described genetic algorithms are a simulation in which a population of abstract representations of candidate solutions to an optimisation problem

Candidates are evaluated and crossbred in an attempt to generate high quality solutions which would be non obvious and extremely time consuming to a human programmer An evolutionary phase is initialised with a population of randomly generated entities The process is subdivided into different generations In each generation the fitness of every individual in the population is evaluated and multiple individuals are stochastically selected from the current population and modified to form a new population The new population is then used in the next iteration of the algorithm The algorithm terminates when either a maximum number of generations has been produced or a satisfactory fitness level has been reached for the population If the algorithm has terminated due to a maximum number of generations a satisfactory will not necessarily have been obtained

Genetic algorithms have been successfully used in many fields of computer science including but not limited to the optimisation of complex algorithms the training of text classification systems and the evolution of intelligent artificial agents in stochastic environments

Board games are a very relevant part of the area of genetic algorithms as applied to game theory problems Much of the early work on computational intelligence and games was directed toward classic board games such as tic tac toe refyao chess and checkers refsamuel Board games can now in most cases be played by a computer at a higher level than the best humans even with blind exhaustive search techniques Go is a noted exception to this tendency and has so far resisted machine attack The best Go computer players now play at the level of a good novice refmuller refbouzy Go strategy is said to rely heavily on pattern recognition and not just logical analysis as with chess and other more piece independent games The huge effective branching factor required for finding high quality solutions heavily restricts the look ahead that can be used within a move sequence search

The genetic algorithm can be utilised in computer games  for example to allow an enemy opponent to adapt in order to cater against an effective but repetitive tactic exhibited by a human player This allows for a more realistic game experience if a human player can find a sequence of steps which repeated in different games always lead to success there can be no challenge left Conversely if a learning technique such as a genetic algorithm for a strategist can avoid repeating past mistakes the game will have increased playability

Genetic algorithms require the following components

The fitness function accepts a mutated instantiation of an entity and measures its quality This function is customised to the problem domain In many cases particularly those involving code optimisation the fitness function may simply be a system timing function Once a genetic representation and fitness function are defined a genetic algorithm will instantiate initial candidates as described previously and then improve through repetitive application of mutation crossover inversion and selection operators

The concept of having a full or partial view of the game changes the approach required significantly An important point to note is that despite a computer obviously having a full view of the game state making this fully available to the decision making process of an artificial player is going to make them behave unrealistically Human centered games are limited by what can easily be manipulated given human mental capacity and dexterity Video games on the other hand operate under no such constraints and typically have a vastly more complex state space than even the most complex of human centered games This richer complexity encourages the development or evolution of more general purpose AI agents than are necessary for playing board or card games with sufficiently simulated skill levels Currently most computer controlled players in games implemented using manual scripting which is quite tedious and time consuming to develop and test The use of computational intelligence techniques offers an interesting alternative to scripted approaches whereby the agent behavior can be controlled using an evolved neural network for example rather than being programmed Since such a neural approach may result in unique novel behaviour impossible to achieve with manual implementation the resulting quality of the product could be far higher Such approaches often result in significantly more original results for every different player the replayability of the game is extended Furthermore evolved AI players tend to be excellent at exploiting loopholes in a game Identifying and eliminating these elements can be achieved by genetic algorithms In addition to this through the life of a game human players will also discover these giving them an unfair advantage If an AI player can also take advantage of these the playing field is levelled To have game characters that effectively exhibit such human characteristics improves the game extends its lifetime and increases total revenue These techniques must be developed very carefully especially in cases where agent difficulty is curved to compete fairly with the player It has been an established technique in such games for a human player to intentionally play badly earlier on in the game thus easing the difficulty which in the end will decrease the quality and longevity of the game Unfortunately players tend to blame the developer for allowing it to be possible

Ingo Rechenberg is a German computer scientist and professor Rechenberg is a pioneer of the fields of evolutionary computation and artificial evolution  In the 1960s and 1970s he invented a highly influential set of optimization methods known as evolution strategies His group successfully applied the new algorithms to challenging problems such as aerodynamic wing design These were the first serious technical applications of artificial evolution an important subset of the still growing field of bionics

Rechenberg was educated at the Technical University of Berlin and at the University of Cambridge Since 1972 he has been a full professor at the Technical University of Berlin where he is heading the Department of Bionics and Evolution Techniques

His awards include the Lifetime Achievement Award of the Evolutionary Programming Society and the Evolutionary Computation Pioneer Award of the IEEE Neural Networks Society In 1954 Rechenberg also became world champion in the field of model airplanes FactdateJune 2007

A Penetrometer is a device to test the strength of soil There are many different types of penetrometer They are usually round or cone shaped The penetrometer is dropped on soil or it is pressed against soil to measure how deep a hole it makes This is a way to decide if soil is strong enough to build a road on Scientists can use a penetrometer to measure how much moisture is in soil Penetrometers are used on space probes such as the Cassini Huygens probe to measure the amount of moisture in soil on other planets

Crme brle is a dessert made of custard and topped with a layer of hard caramel Although often served cold in North America traditionally it is to be served warm The custard is baked and then sprinkled with sugar that is caramelized under a broiler or with a hot iron called a salamander

The custard base is normally flavoured with vanilla but it can be flavoured with chocolate liqueur fruit or other Sometimes the hardened sugar on top will be covered in liqueur and set on fire

Various countries claim to have invented the Crme brle including the French Spanish and British In England it is claimed by some that the food was invented in Trinity College Cambridge University

Ancient Roman cooks were the first known to mix and beat eggs They were experts at making several egg based dishes such as omelets These foods were either savory or sweet

Food historians think that custard came from the Middle Ages At that time custard was eaten alone or used as fillings for pies tarts pastry and more However custard was not special in Europe

Crme brulee is a classic dish of smooth custard with a caramelized sugar topping The origin of crme brulee is argued over a lot

The Spanish also have a similar dessert they called crema catalana and claim to have invented it in the 18th century It was not until the 19th century that the French translation of burnt cream or crme brulee came into popular culture causing many to believe that the dessert is actually from French in origin

The popularity of crme brulee in todays food culture is proved by the sale of prepared mixes and kitchen torches for use in the home There are many kinds of recipes and flavors of the dessert such as Asian Mexican and others

Kraken Mare is the largest known lake on the surface of Saturns moon Titan It was discovered in 2007 by the Cassini probe and was named in 2008 after the Kraken a legendary sea monster

Kraken Mare is believed to be the largest of seas and lakes near Titans north pole It was discovered as a sea of hydrocarbons by radar pictures Only a small part of the sea has been pictured by radar but its full size is seen in visible light pictures Kraken Mare is believed to be similar in size to the Caspian Sea

An island in the sea is named Mayda Insula

Ligeia Mare is a lake on Titan at 790 N 2480 W measuring around 500 km in width It is named after Ligeia one of the sirens in Greek mythology

In cryptography a keystream is a stream of random or pseudorandom characters that are combined with a plaintext message to produce an encrypted message

The characters in the keystream can be bits bytes numbers or actual characters like A Z depending on the usage case

Usually each character in the keystream is either added subtracted or XORed with a character in the plaintext to produce the ciphertext using modular arithmetic

Keystreams are used in the one time pad cipher and in most stream ciphers Block ciphers can also be used to produce keystreams For example the CTR mode is a block mode that makes a block cipher produce a keystream then turns the block cipher into a stream cipher

In this simple example we will use only the English alphabet of 26 characters from a z therefore we will not encrypt numbers commas spaces and other symbols As we have only 26 characters the random numbers in the keystream have to be at least between 0 and 25

To encrypt we add the keystream numbers to the plaintext And to decrypt we subtract the same keystream numbers from the ciphertext to get the plaintext

If a ciphertext number becomes larger than 25 we wrap it to a value between 0 25 Ie 26 becomes 0 and 27 becomes 1 and so on

Here the plaintext message attack at dawn is combined by addition with the keystream kjcngmlhylyu and produces the ciphertext kcvniwlabluh

Kashmir Solidarity Day has been celebrated on 5 February each year since 1990 as a day of protest against Indian control of part of Kashmir It is a national holiday in Pakistan

The National Emblem of Bangladesh was adopted shortly after independence in 1971 

Located on the emblem is a water lily that is bordered on two sides by rice sheaves Above the water lilly are four stars and a three leaf clover of tea leaves The water lily is the countrys national flower and is representative of the many rivers that run through Bangladesh Rice represents its presence as the staple food of Bangladesh and for the agriculture of that nation The four stars represent the four founding principles that were originally enshrined in the first constitution of Bangladesh in 1972 nationalism secularism socialism and democracy Bangladesh has adopted education nationalism and democracy as its national motto

On December 10 1971 the first feeler for surrender in East Pakistan was conveyed to the United Nations On December 17 1971 a formal surrender was submitted and accepted Forty five thousand troops and an almost equal number of civilians of West Pakistan were taken as prisoners of war 

The text of the Instrument of Surrender document was as follows 

INSTRUMENT OF SURRENDER 

The PAKISTAN Eastern Command agree to surrender all PAKISTAN Armed Forces in BANGLA DESH to Lieutenant General JAGJIT SINGH AURORA General Officer Commanding in Chief of the Indian and BANGLA DESH forces in the Eastern Theatre This surrender includes all PAKISTAN land air and naval forces as also all para military forces and civil armed forces These forces will lay down their arms and surrender at the places where they are currently located to the nearest regular troops under the command of Lieutenant General JAGJIT SINGH AURORA 

The PAKISTAN Eastern Command shall come under the orders of Lieutenant General JAGJIT SINGH AURORA as soon as this instrument has been signed Disobedience of orders will be regarded as a breach of the surrender terms and will be dealt with in accordance with the accepted laws and usages of war The decision of Lieutenant General JAGJIT SINGH AURORA will be final should any doubt arise as to the meaning or interpretation of the surrender terms 

Lieutenant General JAGJIT SINGH AURORA gives a solemn assurance that personnel who surrender will be treated with dignity and respect that soldiers are entitled to in accordance with the provisions of the GENEVA Convention and guarantees the safety and well being of all PAKISTAN military and para military forces who surrender Protection will be provided to foreign nationals ethnic minorities and personnel of WEST PAKISTAN origin by the forces under the command of Lieutenant General JAGJIT SINGH AURORA 

Signed Lieutenant General General Officer Commanding in Chief Indian and BANGLA DESH Forces in the Eastern Theatre Lieutenant General Martial Law Administrator Zone B and Commander Eastern Command 

16 December 1971 

The surrender led to the disintegration of East and West Pakistan and the establishment of Bangladesh After 25 years the East Pakistanis declared themselves independent and renamed their Province as Bangladesh Pakistan finally recognized Bangladesh at the Islamic Conference in Lahore on February 22 1974 and fully restored diplomatic relations with the PEOPLES REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH on January 18 1976

In cryptography a product cipher is a popular type of block ciphers that works by executing in sequence a number of simple transformations such as substitution permutation and modular arithmetic 

Product ciphers usually consist of iterations of several rounds of the same algorithm While individual rounds are not themselves secure it is hoped that a sufficiently long chain of rounds would load the cipher with sufficient confusion and diffusion properties as to make it resistant to cryptanalysis 

A product cipher that uses only substitutions and permutations is called a SP network Feistel ciphers are another important class of product ciphers

Islamic Republic is the name given to forms of government of several states These states often have Islam as a state religion and are governed by the principles of Sharia islamic law Laws made by the state cannot contradict Sharia 

The following states call themselves Islamic Republic

Despite the similar name the countries differ greatly in their governments and laws

In cryptography the so called product ciphers are a certain kind of ciphers where the decryption of data is done in rounds The general setup of each round is the same except for some hard coded parameters and a part of the cipher key called a subkey A key schedule is an algorithm that given the key calculates the subkeys for these rounds 

Knudsen and Mathiassen give some experimental evidence that indicate that the key schedule plays a part in providing strength against linear and differential cryptanalysis For toy Feistel ciphers it was observed that those with complex and well designed key schedules can reach a uniform distribution for the probabilities of differentials and linear hulls faster than those with poorly designed key schedules

In modern cryptography symmetric key ciphers are generally divided into stream ciphers and block ciphers Block ciphers operate on a fixed length string of bits The length of this bit string is the block size Both the input and output are the same length the output cannot be shorter than the input this is logically required by the Pigeonhole principle and the fact that the cipher must be invertible and it is simply undesirable for the output to be longer than the input

The DES is using a block size of 64 bits while the AES is using a block size of 128 bits Rijndael supports block sizes of 128 192 and 256 bits although the extra block sizes were not adopted by the AES standard

A few block ciphers such as RC5 support a variable block size The Luby Rackoff construction and the Outerbridge construction can both increase the effective block size of a cipher 

Few ciphers have unusual block sizes for example the 3 Way block cipher have an unusual block size of 96 bits

In cryptography the EFF DES cracker is a machine built by the Electronic Frontier Foundation to perform a brute force search of DES ciphers key space that is to decrypt an encrypted message by trying every possible key The aim in doing this was to prove that DESs key is not long enough to be secure

The DES uses a 56 bit key meaning that there are 256 possible keys under which a message can be encrypted This is approximately 721e16 When DES was approved as a federal standard in 1976 a machine fast enough to test such amount of keys in a reasonable time would have cost an unreasonable amount of money to build

Classified information is sensitive information to which access is restricted by law or regulation to particular classes of people A formal security clearance is required to handle classified documents or access classified data The clearance process requires a satisfactory background investigation There are typically several levels of sensitivity with differing clearance requirements This sort of hierarchical system of sharing information among a group of people is almost used by every national government The operation of assigning the level of sensitivity to data is called data classification 

The purpose of classification is to protect information from being used to damage or cause danger to national security Classification formalizes what constitutes a state secret and deals with different levels of protection based on the expected damage the information might cause if it reached the wrong hands 

Certain non government organizations and corporations also have classified information normally rather referred to as trade secrets

Although the classification systems vary from country to country most have levels corresponding to the following British definitions

Depending on the level of classification there are different rules controlling the level of clearance needed to view such information and how it must be stored transmitted and destroyed Additionally access is restricted on a need to know basis Simply possessing a clearance does not automatically authorize the individual to view all material classified at that level or below that level The individual must present a legitimate need to know in addition to the proper level of clearance

A security clearance is a status granted to individuals allowing them access to classified information eg state secrets It is something like permission or a license The term security clearance is also sometimes used in private organizations that have a formal process of selecting employees to access sensitive information 

A clearance by itself is normally not sufficient to gain access the organization must determine that the cleared person needs to know the information No one is supposed to be granted access to classified information only because of rank position or a security clearance

Sensitive information is information or knowledge that might result in loss of an advantage or level of security if exposed to others who might be unfriends or have low or unknown trustability

Loss misuse modification or unauthorized access to sensitive information can negatively affect the privacy of an individual trade secrets of a business or even the security internal and foreign affairs of a nation depending on the level of sensitivity and nature of the information 

The term classified information generally refers to information that is subject to special security classification regulations imposed by many national governments The term Unclassified as used in the below refers to information that is not subject to security classification regulations Information can be reclassified to a different level or declassified depending on changes of situation or new intelligence

A trade secret is a formula practice process design instrument pattern or a collection of information which is not generally known invented or created by which a business can obtain an economic advantage over competitors or customers In some jurisdictions such secrets are referred to as confidential information or classified information

There are three factors that are common to all definitions of a trade secret a trade secret is information that

Rock Steady is the fifth studio album by the American alternative rock band No Doubt It was released on December 11 2001 The album was influenced a lot by reggae dancehall and electronica compared to their previous albums A lot of music critics saw this and gave the album good reviews For example Rolling Stone magazine put the album as the 316th greatest album of all time in their book Rolling Stones List of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time

The iTunes version of the album has two extra songs

where E is the encryption function and K1 and K2 are the two keys

In cryptography key whitening is a technique used to increase the security of block ciphers It consists of steps that combine the data with portions of the key before the first round and after the last round of encryption DES X was the first block cipher that used key whitening

eSTREAM is a project to identify new stream ciphers that might become suitable for widespread adoption organized by the EU ECRYPT network It was set up because of the failure of all six stream ciphers submitted to the NESSIE project The call for primitives was first issued in November 2004 The project was completed in April 2008 The project was divided into separate phases and the project goal was to find algorithms suitable for different kinds of application

In cryptography MacGuffin is a block cipher created in 1994 by Bruce Schneier and Matt Blaze at a Fast Software Encryption workshop It was intended as a catalyst for analysis of a new cipher structure known as Generalized Unbalanced Feistel Networks 

Schneier and Blaze based MacGuffin on DES their main change was spliting the DES 64 bits data block into two unequal halves in the Feistel network 48 bits of the 64 bit data block are fed through the round function whose output is XORed with the other 16 bits of the data block 

MacGuffins key schedule is a modified version of the encryption algorithm itself Since MacGuffin is a Feistel network decryption is easy simply run the encryption algorithm in reverse

The algorithm was experimental intended to explore the security properties of unbalanced Feistel networks The cryptanalysis proceeded very quickly so quickly that the cipher was broken using differential cryptanalysis at the same workshop by Vincent Rijmen and Bart Preneel They also tried attacking MacGuffin with different S boxes taken directly from DES This version was slightly stronger 

Rijmen and Preneel warn that designing an algorithm to resist only known attacks is generally not a good design principle

Schneier and Blaze recommended using 32 rounds and specified MacGuffin with a 128 bit key

The Feistel construction is also used in cryptographic algorithms other than block ciphers For example the Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding scheme uses a simple Feistel network to randomize ciphertexts in certain asymmetric key encryption schemes

He journeyed to England for two years and returned to the colonies in 1760 marrying again this time to Elizabeth Corbin and represented King William County in the Virginia House of Burgesses He joined the patriots Committee of Safety in Virginia in 1774 and represented his county in the Virginia Convention 

When Peyton Randolph died in 1775 Braxton was appointed to take his place in the Continental Congress He served in the Congress from February 1776 until August when Virginia reduced its delegation to five members Afterwards he returned to the House of Burgesses and later served on the States Executive Council 

Islamic theology deals with the beliefs associated with the Islamic faith

Islamic theology is the theology that comes from the Quran Hadith and the story of Muhammads life 

Kalam is the Islamic philosophy of seeking theological principles through dialectic In Arabic the word literally means speech A scholar of kalam is referred to as a mutakallim

Eschatology is literally understood as the last things or ultimate things and in Muslim theology eschatology refers to the end of this world and what will happen in the next world Eschatology covers the death of human beings their souls after their bodily death the total destruction of this world the resurrection of human souls the final judgments of human deeds by Allah after the resurrection and the rewards and punishments for the believers and non believers The places for the believers are known as Paradise and for the non believers as Hell 

Comparative religion in Muslim theology is about the differences and similarities between Muslim theology and other theologies such as Christian Jewish theologies as explained in the Quran and the Prophetic traditions

In the history of Muslim theology there have been theological schools among Muslims with both similarities and differences with each other in regard to beliefs

Sunni Muslims hold that there are six articles of belief belief in Allah in angels in divinely revealed scripture like Quran in prophets in the Last Day or end times and in predestination

Shiite Muslims hold that there are five articles of belief the Divine Oneness and Justice the Prophethood the Imamate and eschatology

In terms of the relationship between human beings and their creator Mutazilites emphasize human free will over predestination and Gods justice over Gods omnipotence Mutazilites also believe in the use of logic to broken wikt linkdeductdeduct the true meanings of the Quran This combined with the principal of Ijtihad led to their belief in dynamic Fiqh

Mac OS X v105 Leopard is an operating system made by Apple Inc for its Macintosh line of computers It is a version of Mac OS X and carries the release number 105 It was released on October 27 2007 and came in one release for both Intel Macs and PowerPC processors According to Apple Leopard contains over 300 changes and improvements since Mac OS X v104 Tiger

A MacBook is a type of laptop computer made by Apple Inc It runs Mac OS X and comes with a built in webcam and microphone and a power adapter that is attached by magnets MacBooks are currently available housed in white plastic

Many college students purchase MacBooks to help with their studies and to stay connected with their family and friends MacBooks play most CDs and DVDs even if they are copy protected

The newest version of the MacBook came out on October 18 2009 It now has the same unibody construction as the MacBook Pros

The Macbook was introduced by Apple in May 2006 It replaced the iBook and 12 inch PowerBook series of notebooks because Apple was switching all of their CPUs to Intel from Power PCs

Apple upgrades or makes the MacBook better about every six months or half a year This makes them faster and more reliable

In October 2008 Apple decided to make a MacBook housed in aluminum It was pretty much the same as the one housed in plastic except that it was a little better and that it was housed in metal In June 2009 during WWDC this laptop was renamed the MacBook Pro 13 inch

An SMS or short messaging service is a type of communication used in mobile phones They are more commonly called text messages With SMS someone can send text to another person

SMS can be slow as normal calls take priority over sending text messages on a network There is also a limit of 160 characters that a text message can send Longer messages than this will be sent as multiple messages where the sender has to pay for each individual message 

Text messages are often sent between phone users when an actual phone call is not wanted or needed For example they may be used in a situation where silence is needed or to send something private that one person does not want people near them to hear Message price depends on the phone network of the user Some mobile phone plans allow for unlimited texting

International waters is a body of water that does not belong to any country This is because it is farther than two hundred miles away from a country

Alternative hip hop is a form of hip hop music that is very different from gangsta rap crunk and snap A way to explain it would be that if regular hip hop was on the middle of a number line gangsta rap crunk and snap would be on one side and alternative hip hop would be on the other Even though it is a form of hip hop fans of alternative hip hop tend to also be fans of alternative rock more than regular hip hop or especially pop

Alternative hip hop originally came from the United States and some artists like Gorillaz sprang up from the United Kingdom Examples of American alternative hip hop artists are Talib Kweli Mos Def Common Nas Kanye West A Tribe Called Quest Jurassic 5 and Styles of Beyond It started as a movement of sorts from hip hop artists against the tasteless hip hop that was popular in the 1990s

Thomas Paine was an English pamphleteer revolutionary radical inventor and intellectual He lived and worked in Britain until he was 37 when he emigrated to the British American colonies during American Revolution His main contribution was the powerful widely read pamphlet Common Sense It promoted the idea of colonial Americas independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain He also wrote the The American Crisis a pro revolutionary pamphlet series Thomas Paine after the American Revolution wrote the Age of Reason This pamphlet promoted using of reason when it came to religious claims and was critical of organized religion Paine along with other American founders such as Thomas Jefferson and James Madison were supporters of reason when it comes to religion in lieu of revelation Paine was part of the greater Age of Enlightenment movement that dated back to about the early 17th century

Professor Schrock was born in Berne Indiana and went to Mission Bay High School in San Diego California He was given a BA degree in 1967 from the University of California Riverside and a PhD in 1971 from Harvard University At Harvard he was a student of J A Osborn Between 1971 and 1972 he studied at the University of Cambridge with Lord Jack Lewis In 1972 he began working for George Parshall in the Experimental Station of the E I du Pont de Nemours and Company in Wilmington Delaware He joined the faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1975 and became a professor in 1980

Schrock now works as the Frederick G Keyes Professor of Chemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology He has worked there since 1989 Schrock is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences National Academy of Sciences and was elected to the Board of Overseers of Harvard University in 2007 

He married Nancy Carlson in 1971 and has two children Andrew and Eric Nancy Schrock is the Thomas F Peterson Jr Conservator of Special Collections for the MIT Libraries The family live in Winchester Massachusetts

In 2005 Professor Schrock received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry along with Robert H Grubbs and Yves Chauvin for his work on olefin metathesis which is a method of organic synthesis Schrock was the first scientist to make sense of black box olefin metathesis Olefin Metathesis is used when making petroleum and reduces the amount of dirty waste

Professor Schrocks work is continuing with metathesis as well as projects such as dinitrogen fixation and single molecule catalysts which make ammonia from dinitrogen similar to nitrogenase enzymes in biology

Mandaeism or Mandaeanism is a monotheistic religion The religion has a strong dualistic world view Its followers the Mandaeans think highly of Adam Abel Seth Enosh Noah Shem Aram and especially John the Baptist

Originally Mandaeism was practiced mainly in the countries around the lower Euphrates and Tigris and the rivers that surround the Shatt al Arab waterway Today this area belongs to Iraq and Khuzestan Province in Iran Because they were persecuted in that area many Mandaeans have left that area and now live abroad This is commnoly called diaspora Most left for Europe Australia and North America

There are thought to be between 60000 and 70000 Mandaeans worldwide and until the 2003 Iraq war almost all of them lived in Iraq The 2003 Iraq War reduced the population of Iraqi Mandaeans to approximately 5000 by 2007 Most Iraqi Mandaeans fled to Syria and Jordan under the threat of violence by Islamic extremists and the turmoil of the war

The Mandaeans have remained separate and intensely privatewhat has been reported of them and their religion has come primarily from outsiders particularly from the Orientalists J Heinrich Petermann Nicholas Siouffi and Lady Ethel Drower

Mandeism is the religion of the Mandaean people It is based on a common history and heritage There is no fixed set of religious creeds and doctrines A basic guide to Mandaean theology does not exist The corpus of Mandaean literature is quite large It also covers topics such as eschatology the knowledge of God and the afterlife It only does this in an unsystematic manner Apart from the priests very few people know it 

According to ES Drower the Mandaean Gnosis is characterized by nine features which also appear in various forms in other gnostic sects

Mandaeans believe in marriage and procreation and in the importance of leading an ethical and moral lifestyle in this world They put a high priority on family life Consequently Mandaeans do not practice celibacy or asceticism Mandaeans will however abstain from strong drink and red meat They look forward to a future liberated from the influence of the Torah which they consider to be evil in origin While they agree with other gnostic sects that the world is a prison governed by the planetary archons they do not view it as a cruel and inhospitable one

The Mandaeans have many religious texts The most important of them is the Genz Rabb or Ginza The Ginza is a collection of history theology and prayers The Genz Rabb is divided into two halves the Genz Sml or Left Ginza and the Genz Yemin or Right Ginza 

Before the printing press was invented people copied texts by hand The people doing this were called scribes Each persons handwriting is special in certain ways This was the same with scribes A scribe might join two letters in a certain way or he might do the dots on those letters that have them in a special way Jorunn J Buckley looked at these special marks the copyists left in the Left Ginza That way he was able to show that the copying of that text goes back to the to the late 2nd or early 3rd century AD These special marks show that the Mandaeans existed during the late Arsacid period at the very latest A legend called Harrn Gwet also strengthens this According to this legend the Mandaeans left Palestine after the destruction of Jerusalem in the 1st century AD and settled inside the Arsacid empire Although the Ginza continued to evolve under the rule of the Sassanians and the Islamic empires few textual traditions can lay claim to such extensive continuity

Other important books include the Qolast the Canonical Prayerbook of the Mandaeans which was translated by ES Drower One of the most important works of Mandaean scripture is the Draa d Iahia the Book of John the Baptist This book is accessible to both laymen and initiates There are also many other religious texts such as ritual commentaries which are generally only consulted by the members of the priesthood

The language in which the Mandaean religious literature was originally written is known as Mandaic and is a member of the Aramaic family of dialects It is written in a cursive variant of the Parthian chancellory script The majority of Mandaean lay people do not speak this language Some members of the Mandaean community in Iran continue to speak Neo Mandaic a modern version of this language

Mandaeans have several prophets Iahia or Iuhana John the Baptist has a special status higher than his role in Christianity and Islam Mandaeans do not consider John to be the founder of their religion They only worship him as one of their greatest teachers They trace their beliefs back to Adam

Mandaeans maintain that Jesus was a miha kdaba false messiah who changed the teachings given to him by John The Mandaic word kdaba however comes from two roots the first root meaning to lie is the one traditionally given to Jesus the second meaning to write might provide a second meaning that of book Some Mandaeans who are motivated perhaps by an ecumenical spirit maintain that Jesus was not a lying Messiah but a book Messiah The book in question presumably being the Christian Gospels This seems to be a folk etymology without support in the Mandaean texts

Likewise the Mandaeans believe that Abraham Moses and Muhammad were false prophets but recognize other prophetic figures from the monotheistic traditions such as Adam his sons Hibil and itil and his grandson Anu as well as Nuh his son Sam and his son Ram The latter three they consider to be their direct ancestors

There is a strict division between Mandaean laity and the priests According to ES Drower

There are three grades of priesthood in Mandaeism the tarmidia disciples the ganzibria treasurers and the riamma leader of the people This last office the highest level of the Mandaean priesthood has lain vacant for many years At the moment the highest office currently occupied is that of the ganzer a title which appears first in a religious context in the Aramaic ritual texts from Persepolis and which may be related to the kamnaskires title of the rulers of Elymais during the Hellenistic age Traditionally any ganzer who baptizes seven or more ganzern may qualify for the office of riamma though the Mandaean community has yet to rally as a whole behind any single candidate

The contemporary priesthood can trace its immediate origins to the first half of the 19th century In 1831 an outbreak of cholera devastated the region and eliminated most if not all of the Mandaean religious authorities Two of the surviving acolytes Yahia Bihram and Ram Zihrun reestablished the priesthood on the basis of their own training and the texts that were available to them

According to the Fihrist of ibn al Nadim Mani the founder of Manichaeism was brought up within the Elkasaites sect The Elkasaites were a Christian baptismal sect which may have been related to the Mandaeans The members of this sect wore white and performed baptisms like the Mandaeans They lived in east Judea and northern Mesopotamia According to the Harran Gawait legend the Mandaeans migrated to southern Mesopotamia from there Mani later left the Elkasaites to start his own religion Mandaean scholar Sve Sderberg showed that Manis Psalms of Thomas were closely related to Mandaean texts This would imply that Mani had access to Mandaean religious literature

Other groups which have been identified with the Mandaeans include the Nasoraeans described by Epiphanius and the Dositheans mentioned by Theodore Bar Kn in his Scholion Ibn al Nadim also mentions a group called the Mughtasila the self ablutionists who may be identified with one or the other of these groups The members of this sect like the Mandaeans wore white and performed baptisms

It is difficult to say if groups such as the Elkasaites the Mughtasila the Nasoraeans and the Dositheans are related to the Mandaeans or to one another The names say that there are a number of different groups Much of the teaching of these groups is secret This makes it difficult to see the nature of these groups or the relationships between them

Under Saddam Hussein the Mandeans were recognised as a religious minority Many of them are craftspeople like smiths or traders of gold and silver These people belonged to the middle classes Since the change of government in Iraq islamic extremists have harassed them There are also reports of attacks on women who refuse to veil themselves Most Iraqi Mandaeans have fled as a result and the Mandaean community in Iraq faces extinction

In Iran Mandeans do not have a problem with violence but they are prohibited from fully participating in civil life because of Gozinesh Law This law and other gozinesh provisions require a religious screening for people who want to access employment education and a range of other areas A very important part of this screening procedure is devotion to the tenets of Islam These laws are regularly applied to discriminate against religious and ethnic groups that are not officially recognized such as the Mandaeans

There were over 60000 Mandaeans in Iraq in the early 1990s In 2007 only about 5000 to 7000 remain there over 80 of Iraqi Mandaeans were refugees in Syria and Jordan This is a result of the Iraq War There are small Mandaean populations in Australia Canada the USA the UK and Sweden

The current status of the Mandaeans has prompted a number of American intellectuals and civil rights activists to call for their government to extend refugee status to the community In 2007 the New York Times ran an op ed in which Swarthmore professor Nathaniel Deutsch called for the Bush administration to take immediate action to preserve the communityQuotationThe United States didnt set out to eradicate the Mandeans one of the oldest smallest and least understood of the many minorities in Iraq This extinction in the making has simply been another unfortunate and entirely unintended consequence of our invasion of Iraq though that will be of little comfort to the Mandeans whose 2000 year old culture is in grave danger of disappearing from the face of the earth   When American forces invaded in 2003 there were probably 60000 Mandeans in Iraq today fewer than 5000 remain  Of the mere 500 Iraqi refugees who were allowed into the United States from April 2003 to April 2007 only a few were Mandeans And despite the Bush administrations commitment to let in 7000 refugees in the fiscal year that ended September 30 2007 fewer than 2000 including just three Iraqi Mandean families entered the country If all Iraqi Mandeans are granted privileged status and allowed to enter the United States in significant numbers it may just be enough to save them and their ancient culture from destruction If not after 2000 years of history of persecution and tenacious survival the last Gnostics will finally disappear victims of an extinction inadvertently set into motion by our nations negligence in IraqNathaniel Deutsch professor of religion Swarthmore CollegeOctober 7 2007

In cryptography a S Box is a basic component of symmetric key algorithms In block ciphers the S Boxes are used to make the relation between the plaintext and the ciphertext difficult to understandShannons property of confusion The S Boxes are carefully chosen to resist cryptanalysis

In general an S Box takes some number of input bits m and transforms them into some number of output bits n an mn S Box can be implemented as a lookup table with 2m words of n bits each Fixed tables are normally used as in the Data Encryption Standard but in some ciphers the tables are generated dynamically from the key eg the Blowfish and the Twofish encryption algorithms Bruce Schneier describes IDEAs modular multiplication step as a key dependent S Box

One good example is this 64 bit S Box from DES

Given a 6 bit input the 4 bit output is found by selecting the row using the outer two bits and the column using the inner four bits For example an input 011011 has outer bits 01 and inner bits 1101 the corresponding output would be 1001

The 8 S Boxes of DES were the subject of intensive studies for many years cause of a concern that a method of bypassing the DES cipher to obtaining access to the plaintexta vulnerability known only to its designersmight have been planted in the cipher In 1994 the S Box design criteria were finally published by its designers after the public rediscovery of differential cryptanalysis showing that they had been carefully tuned the design to increase resistance against differential cryptanalysis attacks Other research had already indicated that even a very small modification to one of the 8 S Box used by the DES could weaken it very much

The design of good S Boxes was the subject of a great amount of research now much more is understood about their use in block ciphers than when the DES S Boxes were released

In cryptography confusion and diffusion are two properties of the operation of a secure cipher

Confusion and diffusion were identified by Claude Shannon in his paper Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems published in 1949 In Shannons original definitions

Diffusion is associated with the dependency of the output bits on the input bits In a cipher with good diffusion flipping an input bit should change each output bit with a probability of one half 

Substitution has been identified as a mechanism for primarily confusion on the other hand transposition using P box is a technique for diffusion although other mechanisms are also used in modern practice such as linear transformations Product ciphers use alternating substitution and transposition phases to achieve both confusion and diffusion respectively

Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems is a paper published by Claude Shannon discussing cryptography from the viewpoint of information theory It is one of the foundational treatments of modern cryptography It is also a proof that all theoretically unbreakable ciphers must have the same requirements as the one time pad encryption algorithm

Shannon published an earlier version of this research in the classified report A Mathematical Theory of Cryptography Memorandum MM 45 110 02 Sept 1 1945 Bell Laboratories

In 1948 Shannon published his great paper A Mathematical Theory of Communication which is considered one of the founding works of the field of information theory

Come as You Are is a song by the American grunge band Nirvana It was the second single from their second album Nevermind the first was the enormously popular Smells Like Teen Spirit It is one of the bands most famous songs Rolling Stone magazine named it as the 445th on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time

There was a music video for the song It has a lot of random scenes such as Kurt Cobain sitting on a chandelier hanging from a ceiling a handgun floating in a swimming pool and a baby swimming in that pool

After the single was released the English post punk band Killing Joke became angry at Nirvana for supposedly ripping off their song Eighties

Nirvana thought that Smells Like Teen Spirit the previous single from Nevermind would not be very popular and that Come as You Are would be a big hit However Smells Like Teen Spirit became the bands most famous song and one of the most famous songs ever even though Come as You Are was also popular

On November 18 1993 Nirvana played Come as You Are on their show on MTV Unplugged The show contained mostly their unpopular songs and covers of other artists songs Come as You Are was the only hit they played

In cryptography the International Data Encryption Algorithm is a block cipher designed by Xuejia Lai and James Massey of ETH Zurich in 1991 It was meant to be a replacement for the Data Encryption Standard IDEA very like an earlier cipher called Proposed Encryption Standard but with some improvements Because of this IDEA was first called IPES

The cipher is patented in a number of countries but can be used by anyone for non commercial use The name IDEA is also a trademark The patents will expire in 20102011 Today IDEA is licensed worldwide by a company called MediaCrypt

IDEA was used in Pretty Good Privacy v20 after the cipher used in v10 BassOmatic was found to be breakable IDEA can be used with the OpenPGP standard

IDEA operates on 64 bit blocks using a 128 bit key It contains a series of eight identical transformations and one output transformation It does this for a total of 85 rounds The processes for encryption and decryption are similar 

IDEA derives much of its security by interleaving operations from different groups modular addition and multiplication and bitwise eXclusive OR which are chosen to be algebraically incompatible

Each of the eight round uses six sub keys while the half round uses four for a total of 52 sub keys Each sub key is a 16 bit in length The first eight sub keys are extracted directly from the 128 bit key with K1 being the lowest sixteen bits and K8 is the highest sixteen bits further groups of eight keys are created by rotating the main key left 25 bits after the creation of the previous group six rotations generate all sub keys 

The designers analyzed IDEA to measure its strength against differential cryptanalysis and concluded that it is unsusceptible only under certain assumptions No successful linear or differential attacks have been reported Some classes of weak keys have been found Eg but these are of little importance being so rare to be explicitly avoided As of 2007 the best attack which applies to all keys can break IDEA if reduced to 6 rounds

In 1996 Bruce Schneier wrote about IDEA In my opinion it is the best and most secure block algorithm available to the public at this time However by 1999 he was no longer recommending IDEA due to the availability of faster cryptographic algorithms some progress in its cryptanalysis and the issue of patents

The 2008 Yemen floods took place on October 23 leaving 65 dead and 20000 without shelter The Yemeni governorates of Hadhramaut Lahij Al Mahrah and Taizz were affected the worst by the floods and most of the deaths were in Hadhramaut

Before the flooding was several days of rain starting on October 23 as the remains of a tropical cyclone moved over the area Rain continued with weather systems coming in from neighbouring Saudi Arabia and northern Somalia causing severe flooding in some areas of Yemen Better conditions are expected by Sunday

Thousands of families fled Hadhramaut alone many schools were used as evacuee shelters but these could only hold 10 of the affected Search and rescue teams said that the number of deaths may increase due to the likelihood of people trapped in flooded houses Electricity and telephone lines were cut off and many homes were damaged

The Yemeni government promised to supply tents as a means of emergency shelter along with other emergency supplies with six transport aircraft loaded with supplies taking off from Sanaa on Saturday and more scheduled for later President Ali Abdullah Saleh ordered the creation of a committee to provide aid to affected civilians Also the United Arab Emirates declared their intent to provide relief However several residents in the city of Shibam say that government assistance and support if any is low

The Organisation of the Islamic Conference declared the situation a national catastrophe and started a drive on Saturday to collect funds for the relief of flood victims

Yemeni president Ali Abdullah Saleh said The damages are great and the catastrophe is also great

Along with deaths about 730 homes were destroyed along with businesses and other building projects The severe thunder of the thunderstorms resulted in at least nine deaths from lightning in the Al Mahrah Taizz and Lahij governorates The rain also destroyed large amounts of farmland and killed large numbers of livestock

Hurricane Dean was the strongest tropical cyclone of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season It was also the strongest Atlantic hurricane since Hurricane Wilma of 2005 Also it made the third strongest Atlantic hurricane landfall Dean moved west northwest from the eastern Atlantic Ocean through the Saint Lucia Channel and into the Caribbean Sea It became into a very strong hurricane reaching Category 5 status on the Saffir Simpson Hurricane Scale before moving south of Jamaica on August 20 The storm moved onto land on the Yucatn Peninsula on August 21 as a Category 5 storm It moved across the peninsula and entered the Bay of Campeche as a weakened storm but still a hurricane It strengthened for a short time before making a second landfall in Veracruz near Tecolutla Mexico on August 22 Dean slowly moved to the northwest weakening into a low pressure area which dissipated over the southwestern United States

The hurricanes strong winds waves rains and storm surge caused over 45 deaths across ten countries and caused estimated damages of US15 billion First impacting the islands of the Lesser Antilles Deans path through the Caribbean severely damaged agricultural crops especially those of Martinique and Jamaica When it reached Mexico Hurricane Dean was a Category 5 storm but it missed large cities and its exceptional Category 5 strength landfall caused no deaths and less damage than in the Caribbean islands it passed as a Category 2 storm Because of the damage the name Dean was retired and will not be used again for a tropical cyclone

Arts and crafts is a term which is used to describe a wide variety of activities involving making things with ones own hands Arts and crafts is usually a hobby Some crafts have been practised for centuries others are more recent inventions

Both children and adults enjoy arts and crafts Children in schools may learn skills such as woodwork carving sewing or making things with all sorts of other things  Many community centres and schools have evening or day classes and workshops where one can learn arts and craft skills

Although crafts today are usually hobbies enjoyed by amateurs the word was used many centuries ago by professional people who had a guild system Young people were learned from a master craftsman and they often took many years to learn their skills to perfection

Sir William Sterndale Bennett was a distinguished English composer of the Romantic period

Bennetts father Robert Bennett was organist of what is now Sheffield Cathedral At the age of three he was an orphan so he was brought up by his grandfather in Cambridge At the age of seven he became a chorister at Kings College Chapel Choir In 1826 he entered the Royal Academy of Music where he spent ten years studying His piano teachers were W H Holmes Dr William Crotch and later Cipriani Potter 

In 1833 he was made organist of St Annes Church Wandsworth and in that same year met Felix Mendelssohn who invited him to Germany He went there four times making long tours He was welcomed and admired by famous musicians including Mendelssohn and Robert Schumann Schumann later dedicated his Symphonic Studies to Bennett He also often performed at the Leipzig Gewandhaus

Although he knew the works of Bach and Mozart very well many of his compositions were clearly influenced by Mendelssohn As well as being known as one of Europes most brilliant pianists his music was well known for its new ideas excitement and poetic beauty  His compositions include four overtures six piano concertos four symphonies a chamber trio sextet several piano works and two song cycles to be followed later in life by a cello duo a late Symphony in G minor a Cantata The May Queen for the opening of Leeds Town Hall in 1858 and an oratorio The Woman of Samaria for the 1867 Birmingham Triennial Music Festival Of his 80 published compositions nearly half are now available on CD the most popular being the Overture The Naiades Op 15 the Chamber Trio Op 26 and the Piano concerto No 4 in F minor Op 19

In computer science a space time or time memory tradeoff is a way of solving a problem or calculation in less time by using more storage space or by solving a problem in very little space by spending a long time Most computers have a large amount of space but not infinite space Also most people are willing to wait a little while for a big calculation but not forever So if your problem is taking a long time but not much memory a space time tradeoff would let you use more memory and solve the problem more quickly Or if it could be solved very quickly but requires more memory than you have you can try to spend more time solving the problem in the limited memory

The most common condition is an algorithm using a lookup table This means that the answers for some question for every possible value can be written down One way of solving this problem is to write down the entire lookup table which will let you find answers very quickly but will use a lot of space Another way is to calculate the answers without writing down anything which uses very little space but might take a long time

A space time tradeoff can be used with the problem of data storage If data is stored uncompressed it takes more space but less time than if the data were stored compressed 

Dynamic programming is another example where the time of solving problems can be decreased by using more memory

In cryptography an SP network or substitution permutation network is a series of linked mathematical operations used in block cipher algorithms such as AES

These networks consist of S boxes and P boxes that transform blocks of input bits into output bits 

S boxes substitute or transform input bits into output bits A good S box will have the property that changing one input bit will change about half of the output bits It will also have the property that each output bit will depend on every input bit P boxes permute or rearrange bits across S box inputs In addition at each round the key is combined using some group operation typically XOR

In cryptography Square is a block cipher invented by Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen The design was published in 1997

SQUARE is a predecessor to the Rijndael algorithm which has been adopted in 2001 as the Advanced Encryption Standard by the US government 

Square was introduced together with a new form of cryptanalysis discovered by Lars Knudsen called the Square attack

The structure of Square is a substitution permutation network with eight rounds operating on 128 bit block size and using a 128 bit key size

Square is not patented

In cryptography a permutation box is a method of bit shuffling used to permute or transpose bits across S boxes inputs maintaining diffusion while transposing

In block ciphers the S boxes and P Boxes are used to make the relation between the plaintext and the ciphertext difficult to understand 

Carnvorous plants are plants which get nutrients from trapping and eating animals They are often called insectivorous plants because they usually trap insects Since they get some of their food from animals carnivorous plants can grow in places where the soil is thin or poor in nutrients This is true for soils with little nitrogen such as acidic bogs and rock outcrops Charles Darwin wrote the first well known book on carnivorous plants in 1875

This ability of plants to catch animals is called true carnivory There are more than twelve genera in five families These include about 625 species that attract and trap prey produce digestive enzymes and use their nutrients In addition there are more than 300 species in several genera that show some but not all of these characteristics These are usually called protocarnivorous plants

Insectivorous plants have leaves that are made like pitchers or bladders which catch insects Today five different ways of trapping are known

These traps are all classified as active or passive Triphyophyllum is a liana It has three types of leaves When needed it puts out long leaves These are passive flypapers which hide mucus The leaves of the plant do not grow or move as a response to moving prey The Sundew Drosera on the other hand is an active flypaper All species of Sundew are able to move their sticky tentacles in response to a contact The tentacles are very sensitive and will bend toward the center of the leaf in order to bring the insect into contact with as many stalked glands as possible According to Darwin the touch of legs of a small gnat with a single tentacle is enough to cause this response This helps the catch and digestion of prey

The Venus Flytrap Dionaea muscipula is one of a very small group of plants able to move fast When an insect or spider crawls along the leaves and touches a hair the trap closes only if a different hair is contacted within twenty seconds of the first touch The two touch trigger avoids wasting energy on objects with no food value

A carnivorous plant must attract kill and digest prey It must then also benefit from digesting the prey In most cases this will yield amino acids and ammonium ions There are some cases where plants catch the prey but they do not digest it Rather they have a symbiosis with another organism which feeds on the prey One such case is the species of the sundew Roridula which forms a symbiosis with the assassin bug The bugs eat the trapped insects The plant benefits from the nutrients in the bugs faeces

Few fossil carnivorous plants have been found and then usually as seed or pollen Carnivorous plants are generally herbs without wood or bark True carnivory has probably evolved independently at least six times 

Some think all trap types have a similar basic structurethe hairy leaf Hairy leaves do catch and hold drops of rainwater which helps bacterial growth Insects land on the leaf are caught by the surface tension of the water and suffocate Bacteria start to decay the insect and release nutrients from the corpse The plant then absorbs the nutrients through its leaves This leaf feeding can be found in many non carnivorous plants Plants that were better at holding water and insects therefore had a selective advantage Rainwater can be retained by cupping the leaf leading to pitfall traps Alternatively insects can be caught by making the leaf stickier leading to flypaper traps

The flag of Azerbaijan is one of the national symbols of Azerbaijan and consists of three equal horizontal bands from top blue red and green a white crescent and an eight pointed star are centered in the red band The eight points of the star stand for the branches of the Turkic peoples FactdateAugust 2008 The blue band is the colour of the TurksFactdateAugust 2008 the green is for Islam and red is for progress and Europeanisation The official colours and size were adopted on February 5 1991 The flag is used on land as the civil state and war flag and at sea as the civil state and naval ensign and naval jack The specific shades of the national flag were laid out in a 2004 law

The Coat of arms of Azerbaijan mixes traditional and modern symbols The focal point of the emblem is the fire symbol This symbol comes from the fact that Azerbaijan has many everlasting fires which also gives the name land of eternal fire The colors used in composing the emblem are taken from the national flag These colors are found in the background behind the eight pointed star upon which the flame is shown The star itself stands for the eight branches of the Turkic peoples FactdateAugust 2008 and between each point of the star there is a smaller eight pointed star found 

Like other post Soviet republics whose arms do not predate the October Revolution the current arms retains some components of the Soviet one At the bottom of the emblem is a stalk of wheat representing the main agricultural product of the nation which was also part of the earlier arms The other plant represented at the bottom is oak

Barrel is an old English word for a big holder of liquids such as petrol beer wine or oil Barrels are most commonly made of either wood or metal

A barrel is also used to measure liquids One barrel of oil is about 158987 litres It is shortened as b This use may have come from the early Pennsylvanian oil fields where wooden barrels were used to store and move oil around In 1866 the people of West Virginia started using it regularly At this time the amount was set to 42 gallons It was later world wide for measuring amounts of oil and pricing it

The size of some standard barrels is not the same in all countries Some countries have different sizes for different liquids

The movie is about a spolied chihuahua from Beverly Hills named Chloe Her owner Aunt Viv has to go to Italy so she leaves Chloe with her niece Rachel Ashe Lynn Rachel and her friends go on vacation to Mexico and Chloe gets dognapped by an evil Mexican dognapper who at first wants to use her in dog fights but sees her value and wishes to put her at randsome In the meantime Papi a male chihuahua who is in love with her is on the lookout for her Chloe makes friendship with a lonely German Shepherd named Delgado who travels with her to protect her from the evil Doberman who wants to kill her and steal her diamond collar to return it to the dognapper who owns him

Flower is a skunk character from Disneys animated movie Bambi voiced by Stan Alexander Sterling Holloway and Nicky Jones He also appeared in Bambi II and is widely considered to be one of the worlds most famous skunks rivaled only by Warner Brothers Pepe le Pew He is very popular in France 

In the first Bambi movie Bambi is exploring with Thumper and meets a butterfly Bambi thinks its a bird but Thumper tells him what it is Bambi then comes acrros a patch of flowers and calls one of the flowers butterfly Thumper explains this and says that the flowers are pretty He then shows Bambi how to sniff the flowers Bambi then comes nose to nose with a skunk which he calls flower Thumpers rolls over laughing and tries to explain but the skunk says he likes the name The name then sticks and it is never revealed what his real name is In Bambi II Flower has a fear of turtles Flower and Thumper try to help teach Bambi how to be brave for his father 

Although Flower was meant to have a big role in Bambis life his part in the movie turned out to be only a minor one His role in the first movie suffers somewhat from the fact that Thumper very much stole the show Even in Bambi II where he had considerably more screentime he was still not in the movie as much as Thumper He is lovable shy and very effeminate Although somewhat of a scaredy cat he will do what he can when the going gets tough

Because of his feminine nature Flower is often mistaken to be a girl

The Battle of the Mediterranean was the name given to the naval campaign fought in the Mediterranean Sea during World War II

For the most part the campaign was fought between the forces of the Italian Royal Navy supported by other Axis naval forces and the forces of the British Royal Navy supported by other Allied naval forces

Each side had three overall goals in this battle The first was to attack the supply lines of the other side The second was to keep open its own supply lines the Axis to their own armies in North Africa and the Allies to supply the island of Malta The third was to destroy the ability of the opposing navy to wage war at sea 

Outside of the Pacific ocean the Mediterranean saw the largest conventional naval warfare during the war In particular Allied forces struggled to supply and retain the key naval and air base of Malta

Italian warships had a general reputation as well designed and good looking But some Italian cruiser classes were rather deficient in armour All Italian warships lacked radar for most of the war although the lack of radar was partly offset by the fact that Italian warships were equipped with good rangefinder and fire control systems In addition whereas Allied commanders at sea had discretion on how to act Italian commanders were closely and precisely governed by Italian Naval Headquarters This could lead to action being avoided when the Italians had a clear advantage 

The Italian Navy entered the war with only one year of fuel required to operate normally

The Allies had Ultra intercepts which predicted the Italian movements and radar which enabled them to locate the ships and range their weapons at distance and at night The better air reconnaissance skills of the Fleet Air Arm and their close collaboration with surface units were other major causes of the initial Italian defeats

The Axis forces in this campaign were 

The Allied forces in this campaign were 

On 10 June 1940 Italy declared war on Britain and France On the following day Italian bombers attacked Malta on what was to be the first of many raids

The first clash between the rival fleets the Battle of Calabria took place on 9 July 1940 just four weeks after the start of hostilities This was inconclusive and was followed by a series of small ship actions during the autumn

In spring 1940 the British Royal navy attacked at Mers el Kebir the French navy of Vichy sinking 2 battleship with other minor ships

In November the RN mounted an aerial attack on the Italian fleet in Taranto harbour crippling 3 capital ships and changing the balance of power in the Mediterranean

Three months later the fleets clashed again at the Battle of Cape Matapan This was a major Allied victory 3 Italian cruisers were sunk and a battleship damaged in a 2 day battle ending in a night action

Following this the Allies suffered heavy losses in the Battle of Crete supporting the army when the island was invaded by the Germans

In spring 1941 the Greek and Yugoslavian navy were destroyed andor made captive by the Italians during the Italo German war in the western Balkans against Greece and Yugoslavia

Following the battle of Crete in the summer of 1941 the Royal Navy got the better of things in the central Mediterranean in a series of successful convoy attacks until the events around the First Battle of Sirte and the Raid on Alexandria in December swung the balance of power in the Axis favour

The Italian Navys most successful attack was when divers planted mines on British battleships during the raid on Alexandria harbour HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMSValiant were sunk During those ten months the Italian Navy enjoyed a temporary control of the Mediterranean sea

A series of hard fought convoy battles were victories for the Axis but ensured Maltas survival until the Allies regained the advantage in November 1942

In Sept 1943 with the Italian collapse and the surrender of Italian fleet naval actions in Mediterranean became restricted to actions against U boats and by small craft in the Adriatic and Aegean seas

The following are the major amphibious operations staged during the Battle of the Mediterranean
