A karyotype is the number and appearance of chromosomes in the nucleus of a eukaryote cell The term is also used of the complete set of chromosomes in a species or an individual organism It describes the number of chromosomes and what they look like under a light microscope Attention is paid to their length the position of the centromeres any differences between the sex chromosomes and any other physical characteristics The preparation and study of karyotypes is part of cytogenetics

The basic number of chromosomes in the somatic cells of an individual or a species is called the somatic number and is designated 2n Thus in humans 2n 46 In the the sex cells the chromosome number is n

So in normal diploid organisms chromosomes are present in two copies There may or may not be sex chromosomes Polyploid cells have multiple copies of chromosomes and haploid cells have single copies The study of whole sets of chromosomes is sometimes known as karyology 

The chromosomes are depicted in a standard format known as a karyogram or idiogram in pairs ordered by size and position of centromere for chromosomes of the same size This may be used for many purposes such as to show genetic disease what sex the animal is and its diploid number In humans cytologists have used karyotypes to help identify genetic abnormalities a baby might have before it is born

Karyotypes may be studied to gather information about past evolutionary events such as polyploidy

Idomeneo is an opera by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart The libretto are in Italian and were written by Giambattista Varesco who based it on a French text by Antoine Danchet  In 1780 Mozart and Varesco were asked by the Elector of Bavaria to write an opera for a court carnival 

Idomeneo was first performed in Munich on 29 January 1781 Mozart was only 24 years old It was the first of his great operas

Mozart wrote three different types of opera Idomeneo is an opera seria These were written in Italian and are about serious dramatic stories often stories from Ancient Greece or Rome La Clemenza di Tito is also an opera seria Don Giovanni is an example of a mixture of comic and serious opera while The Magic Flute is a German opera in the Singspiel tradition

Idomeneo has traditional recitatives and arias The choruses marches and ballets were very much like French opera tradition Mozart was inspired by the operas of Gluck

The story based on an Ancient Greek story takes place on the Island of Crete shortly after the Trojan War Ilia is the daughter of the Trojan King Priam who has lost the war Ilia has been taken to Crete She loves Prince Idamante son of Idomeneo but does not want to tell him about her love for him Idamante is kind and frees the Trojan prisoners He tells Ilia that it is not his fault that their fathers were enemies The Trojans and Cretans both welcome the return of peace but Electra daughter of the Greek King Agamemnon is jealous of Ilia She is annoyed that Idamante had been kind and let the prisoners free Arbace the kings trusted friend brings news that Idomeneo has been drowned at sea while returning to Crete from Troy Electra is worried that Ilia a Trojan soon will be Queen of Crete feels the furies of Hades tormenting her

Idomeneo is not lost at sea but instead is saved by Neptune and is washed up on a Cretan beach There he remembers the promise he made to Neptune he had promised to sacrifice the first creature he should meet whether it be a human or an animal The first person he meets is his own son Idamante Because the two have not seen each other for a long time they do not recognize one another at first When Idomeneo finally realizes it is his own son he must kill he tells Idamante to go away and never see him again Idamante does not understand why his father is saying this He is terribly upset but runs off The Cretan soldiers get off Idomeneos ship and are met by their wives and all praise Neptune

At the kings palace Idomeneo asks Arbace what he should do because he has disobeyed the god Arbace says that Neptune would be happy if another victim could be sacrificed so long as Idamante is sent into exile Idomeneo tells his son to take Electra to her home Argos Idomeneos kind words to Ilia make her say very kindly that because she has lost everything he will be her father and Crete will be her country As she leaves Idomeneo realizes that sending Idamante into exile has made Ilia unhappy Electra is happy about going to Argos with Idamante

At the port of Sidon Idomeneo says goodbye to his son and tells him to rule like a good king Before the ship can sail however a storm breaks out and a sea serpent appears It is a messenger from Neptune who is angry with Idomeneo Idomeneo offers his life to the god

In the royal garden Ilia asks the gentle winds to carry her love to Idamante Idamante says he must go to fight the serpent When he says he would like to die because Ilia does not love him This makes Ilia tell him that she loves him They are surprised by Electra and Idomeneo When Idamante asks his father why he sends him away Idomeneo cannot tell him the truth Ilia asks Electra for some kindness but Elektra is madly jealous of Ilia now and she wants revenge Arbace comes with news that the people led by the High Priest of Neptune are shouting that they want Idomeneo The High Priest tells the king that Neptunes monster is destroying things and asks Idomeneo to say the name of the person whose sacrifice is demanded by the god When the king says that his own son is the victim the people are horrified 

Outside the temple the king and High Priest join with Neptunes priests to pray that the god will be kind and merciful Arbace brings news that Idamante has killed the monster Idomeneo is now worried that Neptune will want even more revenge Idamante enters in sacrificial robes saying he understands his fathers terrible worries and he is ready to die Idomeneo says a tragic goodbye to his own son and is about to kill him when Ilia steps forward and offers to die instead  Neptune now changes his mind We hear his voice saying that if Idomeneo gives up being king and lets Idamante and Ilia rule as king and queen he will forgive Everyone is happy except Electra who wants to die Idomeneo says that Idamante and his bride as the new rulers The people call upon the god of love and marriage to bless the royal pair and bring peace

Carbohydrates are chemical compounds that contain only oxygen hydrogen and carbon They consist of joined up sugars with the general formula Cmn They are also known as saccharides

Certain carbohydrates are an important storage and transport form of energy in most organisms including plants and animals

There are four types of carbohydrates named by the number of sugar molecules they contain 

Humans can live without eating foods with carbohydrates because the human body can change proteins into carbohydrates As long as the human can eat foods with protein they will be fine People of some cultures eat food with very little carbohydrates but they still remain healthy 

Still carbohydrates are the most common source of energy for the human body Protein builds tissue and cells in the body Carbohydrates are very good for energy but if a person eats more than needed the extra is changed into fat

Researches in the United States and Canada have shown that people get about 40 to 60 of energy from carbohydrates However studies suggest that people should eat carbohydrates to get at least 55 to 75 of energy from carbohydrates 

Some foods have high carbohydrates in them These foods include breads pastas potatoes bran and cereals

A Spreadsheet is a computer program that imitates a paper worksheet It shows a large sheet that has many cells in a grid of rows and columns Users can put words or numbers into the cells to make headings and store information You can also move the grid lines around so that some cells are bigger than others and change the color or size of textfont the same way fonttext is changed in a word processor You can even put pictures in the worksheets make multiple pages and print out their results on real paper

The primary reason most people use spreadsheets is for automatic calculations Spreadsheets can be designed to add up the itemsamounts on a bill calculate sales tax and even calculate income tax A user can add and subtract the numbers here even if the numbers are not next to each other This means the computer does all the math and people only need to give the correct information

Another strength of spreadsheets is that they can produce diagrams like graphs and pie charts based on the data the user enters Sometimes the numbers make more sense when the computer turns them into a picture

Non scientific ideas how life arose on Earth can be found at creation myth creationism guided evolution 

Abiogenesis is the study of how the first life forms grew out of non living matter The word is made of two parts One part comes from the Ancient Greek bios which means life The other comes from genesis which means birth or origin Some people talk about chemical evolution others talk about the beginnings of biological evolution The study of abiogenesis uses many sciences It is related to chemistry molecular biology cell biology earth science and astronomy 

People like Jean Baptiste de Lamarck and Charles Darwin saw that the plants and animals on earth change over time They developed theories to explain this phenomenon Lamarck developed Lamarckism and Darwin developed the Darwinian theory of Evolution This article is not about biological theories of evolution it looks at the borderland between chemistry and life

A scientific study from 2002 shows that geological formations of stromatolites 345 billion years old contain fossilized cyanobacteria It is now widely agreed that stromatolites are oldest known life on earth which have left a record of their existence

Therefore it follows that abiogenesis happened sometime between 44 billion years ago when water vapor first liquefied and 35 billion years ago 

By 25 million years ago the ratio of stable isotopes of carbon iron and sulfur point to a biogenic origin of minerals and sediments and molecular biomarkers indicate photosynthesis

Even though it has a great potential impact on how people understand the world abiogenesis is a limited field of study It is not well funded and progress is slow This is mainly because there are few established facts and it is not clear how research should proceed A single well established fact such as the discovery of clear evidence of life on another planet would have a great effect This is because the question investigated is so important 

There are several main theories The most notable are called iron sulfur world theory and RNA world hypothesis

Until the early 19th century many people believed in the regular spontaneous generation of life from non living matter 

The theory known as spontaneous generation held that complex living organisms appear in decaying organic substances Mice might appear in stored grain or maggots could appear in meat

According to Aristotle it was an easily seen truth that aphids arise from the dew which falls on plants fleas from decaying matter mice from dirty hay crocodiles from logs rotting at the bottom of bodies of water and so forth 

In the 17th century these things started to be questioned Sir Thomas Browne wrote a book called Pseudodoxia Epidemica in 1646 He gave it the subtitle Enquiries into very many received tenets and commonly presumed truths Browne wrote it as an attack on false beliefs and vulgar errors Others did not accept his views Brownes contemporary Alexander Ross wrote To question this is to question reason sense and experience If he doubts of this let him go to Egypt and there he will find the fields swarming with mice begot of the mud of Nylus to the great calamity of the inhabitants

In 1546 the physician Girolamo Fracastoro thought epidemic diseases were caused by tiny invisible particles or spores which might not be living creatures This was a landmark idea but it was not widely accepted Next Robert Hooke published the first drawings of a microorganism in 1665 He was the first to use the term cell for the things he saw in cork samples In 1676 Anthony van Leeuwenhoek discovered microorganisms that were probably protozoa and bacteria This sparked new interest in the microscopic world 

The first experiments were done by the Italian Francesco Redi In 1668 Redi showed that no maggots appeared in meat when flies were prevented from laying eggs From the 17th century onwards it was gradually shown that at least in the case of all the higher and readily visible organisms the previous ideas were false The alternative seemed to be omne vivum ex ovo that every living thing came from a pre existing living thing 

In 1768 Lazzaro Spallanzani proved that microbes came from the air and could be killed by boiling Yet it was not until 1861 that Louis Pasteur performed a series of careful experiments With these experiments Pasteur proved that organisms such as bacteria and fungi do not appear in nutrient rich media of their own accord in non living material This experiment supported the cell theory All ideas of antisepsis in surgery date from this work

By the middle of the 19th century Pasteur and other scientists had shown that living organisms did not arise spontaneously from non living matter This raised the question of how life might have come about within a naturalistic framework 

In a letter to Joseph Dalton Hooker on 11 February 1871 Charles Darwin proposed a natural process for the origin of life 

He suggested that the original spark of life may have begun in a warm little pond with all sorts of ammonia and phosphoric salts lights heat electricity etc A protein compound was then chemically formed ready to undergo still more complex changes He went on to explain that at the present day such matter would be instantly devoured or absorbed which would not have been the case before living creatures were formed 

In other words because there is life on Earth a laboratory with its controlled conditions is needed to search for the origin of life

No real progress was made until 1924 when Alexander Oparin reasoned that atmospheric oxygen prevented the synthesis of the organic molecules Organic molecules are the necessary building blocks for the evolution of life In his The Origin of Life Oparin argued that a primeval soup of organic molecules could be created in an oxygen less atmosphere through the action of sunlight These would combine in ever more complex fashions until they formed droplets These droplets would grow by fusion with other droplets and reproduce through fission into daughter droplets and so have a primitive metabolism in which those factors which promote cell integrity survive those that do not become extinct Many modern theories of the origin of life still take Oparins ideas as a starting point

Around the same time JBS Haldane also suggested that the Earths pre biotic oceans which were very different from what oceans are now would have formed a hot dilute soup In this soup organic compounds the building blocks of life could have formed This idea was called biopoiesis the process of living matter evolving from self replicating but nonliving molecules

A study done in 1998 suggests that oceans may have appeared in the Hadean eon about 200 million years after the earth had formed According to the study it was very hot then The environment helped chemical reductions The pH was about 58 at first but it rapidly rose towards neutral Another study supports this theory The date of the zircon crystals found in the metamorphosed quartzite of Mount Narryer in Western Australia has been pushed to 4404 billion years Beforehand they were thought to be 4142 billion years old This means that oceans and continental crust existed within 150 million years of Earths formation 

Despite this the environment that existed in the Hadean was hostile to life but how much so is not known Large objects which could be up to 500 km across often collided This might have been enough to make the ocean disappear within a few months of the impact This would lead to high altitude vapour clouds covering the planet After a few months the height of these clouds would have begun to decrease but the cloud base would still have been elevated for about the next thousand years After that it would have begun to rain at low altitude For another two thousand years rains would slowly have drawn down the height of the clouds returning the oceans to their original depth only 3000 years after the impact event

There was a time between 38 and 41 billion years ago that is known as Late Heavy Bombardment today It is named that way because many lunar craters are thought to have formed then The situation on other planets such as Earth Venus Mercury and Mars must have been similar These impacts would likely have sterilised the earth if it had existed at that time

Different environments existed between such devastating events The time when life came to be depends on where it came into existence A study shows that if life came to be in the deep ocean near a hydrothermal vent life could have originated as early as 4 to 42 billion years ago If on the other hand life originated at the surface of the planet a common opinion is it could only have done so between 35 and 4 billion years ago

Life might also have started in a colder environment A study has shown that freezing temperatures have advantages for the origin of life This is because precursors such as HCN are more concentrated at lower temperatures Another study suggested that adenine and guanine require freezing temperatures for synthesis but cytosine and uracil are better synthesised at boiling temperatures Based on this research it was suggested the beginning of life involved freezing conditions and exploding meteorites An article in a scientific publication suggests that seven different amino acids and 11 types of nucleobases formed in ice when ammonia and cyanide were left in a freezer from 19721997 This article also describes research showing the formation of RNA molecules 400 bases long under freezing conditions using an RNA template a single strand chain of RNA that guides the formation of a new strand of RNA As that new RNA strand grows it adheres to the template The explanation given for the unusual speed of these reactions at such a low temperature is eutectic freezing As an ice crystal forms it stays pure only molecules of water join the growing crystal while impurities like salt or cyanide are excluded These impurities become crowded in microscopic pockets of liquid within the ice and this crowding causes the molecules to collide more often

Evidence of the early appearance of life comes from the Isua supercrustal belt in Western Greenland and from similar formations in the nearby Akilia Islands Carbon entering into rock formations has a concentration of elemental 13C of about 55 where because of a preferential biotic uptake of 12C biomass has a 13C of between 20 and 30 These isotopic fingerprints are preserved in the sediments and Mojzis has used this technique to suggest that life existed on the planet already by 385 billion years ago 

Lazcano and Miller suggest that the rapidity of the evolution of life is dictated by the rate of recirculating water through mid ocean submarine vents Complete recirculation takes 10 million years thus any organic compounds produced by then would be altered or destroyed by temperatures exceeding 300 C They estimate that the development of a 100 kilobase genome of a DNAprotein primitive heterotroph into a 7000 gene filamentous cyanobacterium would have required only 7 million years

The origin of the basic biomolecules while not settled is less controversial than the significance and order of steps 2 and 3 The basic chemicals from which life is thought to have formed are

Molecular oxygen and ozone were either rare or absent

As of 2008 no one has yet synthesized a protocell using basic components which would have the necessary properties of life Without such a proof of principle explanations have tended to be short on specifics However some researchers are working in this field notably Steen Rasmussen at Los Alamos National Laboratory and Jack Szostak at Harvard University Others have argued that a top down approach is more feasible One such approach attempted by Craig Venter and others at The Institute for Genomic Research involves engineering existing prokaryotic cells with progressively fewer genes attempting to discern at which point the most minimal requirements for life were reached The biologist John Desmond Bernal coined the term Biopoesis for this process and suggested that there were a number of clearly defined stages that could be recognised in explaining the origin of life

Bernal suggested that evolution may have commenced early some time between Stage 1 and 2

There are three sources of organic molecules on the early Earth 

Recently estimates of these sources suggest that the heavy bombardment before 35 Gyr ago within the early atmosphere made available quantities of organics comparable to those produced by other energy sources

In 1953 a graduate student Stanley Miller and his professor Harold Urey performed an experiment that showed how organic molecules could have formed on early Earth from inorganic precursors 

The now famous MillerUrey experiment used a highly reduced mixture of gases methane ammonia and hydrogen to form basic organic monomers such as amino acids

Whether the mixture of gases used in the Miller Urey experiment truly reflects the atmospheric content of early Earth is a controversial topic Other less reducing gases produce a lower yield and variety It was once thought that a large amount of molecular oxygen was present in the prebiotic atmosphere which would have stopped the formation of organic molecules however this is not the case We now know that for more than the first half of the Earths history its atmosphere had almost no oxygen 

The next most important step in research on prebiotic organic synthesis was the demonstration by John Or that the nucleic acid purine base adenine was formed by the simple heating of solutions of ammonium cyanide

Simple organic molecules are of course a long way from a fully functional self replicating life form But in an environment with no pre existing life these molecules may have accumulated and provided a rich environment for chemical evolution 

The spontaneous formation of complex polymers from amino acids and purines is not at all a straightforward process Besides the necessary basic organic monomers compounds that would have prohibited the formation of polymers were formed in high concentration during the experiments

The most crucial unanswered challenge is how the relatively simple organic building blocks form more complex structures and form a protocell

In the 1950s and 1960s Sidney W Fox studied the spontaneous formation of peptide structures under conditions that might plausibly have existed early in Earths history 

He demonstrated that amino acids could spontaneously form small peptides These amino acids and small peptides could be encouraged to form closed spherical membranes called microspheres This was a step forward in spontaneous biosynthesis

Some scientists have suggested special physical conditions which could make cell synthesis easier 

A clay model for the origin of life was suggested by A Graham Cairns Smith Clay theory postulates that complex organic molecules arose gradually on a pre existing non organic platform namely silicate crystals in solution

In the 1970s Thomas Gold proposed the theory that life first developed not on the surface of the Earth but several kilometers below the surface The discovery in the late 1990s of nanobes might be seen as lending support to Golds theory

It is now reasonably well established that microbial life is plentiful at shallow depths in the Earth in the form of extremophile archaea rather than the better known eubacteria It is claimed that discovery of microbial life below the surface of another body in our solar system would lend significant credence to this theory 

Gold also asserted that a trickle of food from a deep unreachable source is needed for survival because life arising in a puddle of organic material is likely to consume all of its food and become extinct Golds theory is that flow of food is due to out gassing of primordial methane from the Earths mantle more conventional explanations of the food supply of deep microbes is that the organisms subsist on hydrogen released by an interaction between water and iron compounds in rocks

Chirality is a special issue Some process in chemical evolution must account for the origin of homochirality ie all building blocks in living organisms having the same handedness Amino acids are left handed nucleic acid sugars right handed 

Chiral molecules can be synthesized but in the absence of a chiral source or a chiral catalyst are formed in a 5050 mixture of both kinds This is called a racemic mixture Clark has suggested that homochirality may have started in space as the studies of the amino acids on the Murchison meteorite showed L alanine to be more than twice as frequent as its D form and L glutamic acid was more than 3 times prevalent than its D counterpart It is suggested that polarised light has the power to destroy one kind within the proto planetary disk Noyes showed that beta decay caused the breakdown of D leucine in a racemic mixture and that the presence of 14C present in larger amounts in organic chemicals in the early Earth environment could have been the cause 

Robert M Hazen reports upon experiments conducted in which various chiral crystal surfaces act as sites for possible concentration and assembly of chiral monomer units into macromolecules Once established chirality would be selected for 

Work with organic compounds found on meteorites tends to suggest that chirality is a characteristic of abiogenic synthesis as amino acids show a left handed bias whereas sugars show a predominantly right handed bias

Features of self organization and self replication are the hallmark of living systems There are instances of abiotic molecules exhibiting such characteristics under proper conditions For example Martin and Russel show that cell membranes separating contents from the environment and self organization of self contained redox reactions are the most conserved attributes of living things 

They argue that inorganic matter with such attributes would be lifes most likely last common ancestor

The question How do simple organic molecules form a protocell is largely unanswered but there are many hypotheses Some of these postulate the early appearance of nucleic acids whereas others postulate the evolution of biochemical reactions and pathways first Recently trends are emerging to create hybrid models that combine aspects of both

The RNA world hypothesis suggests that relatively short RNA molecules could have spontaneously formed that were capable of catalyzing their own continuing replication It is difficult to gauge the probability of this formation A number of theories of modes of formation have been put forward Early cell membranes could have formed spontaneously from proteinoids protein like molecules that are produced when amino acid solutions are heated when present at the correct concentration in aqueous solution these form microspheres which are observed to behave similarly to membrane enclosed compartments Other possibilities include systems of chemical reactions taking place within clay substrates or on the surface of pyrite rocks Factors supportive of an important role for RNA in early life include its ability to act both to store information and catalyse chemical reactions its many important roles as an intermediate in the expression and maintenance of the genetic information in modern organisms and the ease of chemical synthesis of at least the components of the molecule under conditions approximating the early Earth Relatively short RNA molecules which can duplicate others have been artificially produced in the lab

Researchers have pointed out difficulties for the abiogenic synthesis of nucleotides from cytosine and uracil Cytosine has a half life of 19 days at 100 C and 17000 years in freezing water Larralde et al say that the generally accepted prebiotic synthesis of ribose the formose reaction yields numerous sugars without any selectivity and they conclude that their results suggest that the backbone of the first genetic material could not have contained ribose or other sugars because of their instability The ester linkage of ribose and phosphoric acid in RNA is known to be prone to hydrolysis

A slightly different version of this hypothesis is that a different type of nucleic acid such as PNA TNA or GNA was the first one to emerge as a self reproducing molecule to be replaced by RNA only later

Many think the idea that a naked gene replicates all by itself is false Rather they say that a primitive metabolism emerged This metabolism would provide an environment so that RNA replication could emerge later 

One of the first to think this idea could be true was Oparin In 1924 Oparin talked about primitive vesicles that replicated themselves This was before the structure of the DNA was found In the 1980s and 1990s Gnter Wchtershuser came up with the iron sulfur world theory and Christian de Duve introduced models based on the chemistry of thioesters Some people also had more abstract and theoretical models as an explanation why a metabolism could emerge without genes Freeman Dyson introduced a mathematical model in the 1980s Stuart Kauffman developed the notion of autocatalytic sets which was discussed later in that decade 

However the idea that a closed metabolic cycle such as the reductive citric acid cycle could form spontaneously remains unsupported According to Leslie Orgel a leader in origin of life studies for the past several decades there is reason to believe the assertion will remain so In an article entitled Self Organizing Biochemical Cycles Orgel summarizes his analysis of the proposal by stating There is at present no reason to expect that multistep cycles such as the reductive citric acid cycle will self organize on the surface of FeSFeS2 or some other mineral It is possible that another type of metabolic pathway was used at the beginning of life For example instead of the reductive citric acid cycle the open acetyl CoA pathway would be even more compatible with the idea of self organisation on a metal sulfide surface The key enzyme of this pathway carbon monoxide dehydrogenaseacetyl CoA synthase harbours mixed nickel iron sulfur clusters in its reaction centers and catalyses the formation of acetyl CoA in a single step

Waves breaking on the shore create a delicate foam composed of bubbles Winds sweeping across the ocean have a tendency to drive things to shore much like driftwood collecting on the beach It is possible that organic molecules were concentrated on the shorelines in much the same way Shallow coastal waters also tend to be warmer further concentrating the molecules through evaporation While bubbles composed mostly of water burst quickly water containing amphiphiles forms much more stable bubbles lending more time to the particular bubble to perform these crucial experiments

Amphiphiles are oily compounds containing a hydrophilic head on one or both ends of a hydrophobic molecule Some amphiphiles have the tendency to spontaneously form membranes in water A spherically closed membrane contains water and is a hypothetical precursor to the modern cell membrane If a protein came along that increased the integrity of its parent bubble then that bubble had an advantage and was placed at the top of the natural selection waiting list Primitive reproduction can be envisioned when the bubbles burst releasing the results of the experiment into the surrounding medium Once enough of the right stuff was released into the medium the development of the first prokaryotes eukaryotes and multicellular organisms could be achieved

Similarly bubbles formed entirely out of protein like molecules called microspheres will form spontaneously under the right conditions But they are not a likely precursor to the modern cell membrane as cell membranes are composed primarily of lipid compounds rather than amino acid compounds

A recent model by Fernando and Rowe suggests that the enclosure of an autocatalytic non enzymatic metabolism within protocells may have been one way of avoiding the side reaction problem that is typical of metabolism first models

An alternative to Earthly abiogenesis is the hypothesis that primitive life may have originally formed extraterrestrially either in space or on a nearby planet A supporter of this theory was Francis Crick

Organic compounds are relatively common in space especially in the outer solar system where volatiles are not evaporated by solar heating Comets are encrusted by outer layers of dark material thought to be a tar like substance composed of complex organic material formed from simple carbon compounds after reactions initiated mostly by irradiation by ultraviolet light It is supposed that a rain of material from comets could have brought significant quantities of such complex organic molecules to Earth

An alternative but related hypothesis proposed to explain the presence of life on Earth so soon after the planet had cooled down with apparently very little time for prebiotic evolution is that life formed first on early Mars Due to its smaller size Mars cooled before Earth allowing prebiotic processes there while Earth was still too hot Life was then transported to the cooled Earth when crustal material was blasted off Mars by asteroid and comet impacts Mars continued to cool faster and eventually became hostile to the continued evolution or even existence of life Earth is following the same fate as Mars but at a slower rate

Neither hypothesis actually answers the question of how life first originated but merely shifts it to another planet or a comet However the advantage of an extraterrestrial origin of primitive life is that life is not required to have evolved on each planet it occurs on but rather in a single location and then spread about the galaxy to other star systems via cometary andor meteorite impact Evidence to support the plausibility of the concept is scant but it finds support in recent study of Martian meteorites found in Antarctica and in studies of extremophile microbes Additional support comes from a recent discovery of a bacterial ecosytem whose energy source is radioactivity

A recent experiment led by Jason Dworkin subjected a frozen mixture of water methanol ammonia and carbon monoxide to UV radiation mimicking conditions found in an extraterrestrial environment This combination yielded large numbers of organic material that self organised to form bubbles when immersed in water Dworkin considered these bubbles to resemble cell membranes that enclose and concentrate the chemistry of life separating their interior from the outside world

The bubbles produced in these experiments were between 10 to 40 micrometers or about the size of red blood cells Remarkably the bubbles fluoresced or glowed when exposed to UV light Absorbing UV and converting it into visible light in this way was considered one possible way of providing energy to a primitive cell If such bubbles played a role in the origin of life the fluorescence could have been a precursor to primitive photosynthesis Such fluorescence also provides the benefit of acting as a sunscreen diffusing any damage that otherwise would be inflicted by UV radiation Such a protective function would have been vital for life on the early Earth since the ozone layer which blocks out the suns most destructive UV rays did not form until after photosynthetic life began to produce oxygen

Other sources of complex molecules have been postulated including extraterrestrial stellar or interstellar origin For example from spectral analyses organic molecules are known to be present in comets and meteorites In 2004 a team detected traces of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in a nebula Those are the most complex molecules so far found in space The use of PAHs has also been proposed as a precursor to the RNA world in the PAH world hypothesis The Spitzer Space Telescope has recently detected a star HH 46 IR which is forming by a process similar to the sun In the disk of material surrounding the star there is a very large range of molecules including cyanide compounds hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide PAHs have also been found all over the surface of galaxy M81 which is 12 million light years away from the Earth confirming their widespread distribution in space

There is a theory that ascribes the first self replicating object to be lipid like It is known that phospholipids form bilayers in water while under agitation the same structure as in cell membranes These molecules were not present on early earth however other amphiphilic long chain molecules also form membranes Furthermore these bodies may expand and under excessive expansion may undergo spontaneous splitting which preserves the same size and composition of lipids in the two progenies The main idea in this theory is that the molecular composition of the lipid bodies is the preliminary way for information storage and evolution led to the appearance of polymer entities such as RNA or DNA that may store information favorably Still no biochemical mechanism has been offered to support the Lipid World theory

The problem with most scenarios of abiogenesis is that the thermodynamic equilibrium of amino acid versus peptides is in the direction of separate amino acids What has been missing is some force that drives polymerization The resolution of this problem may well be in the properties of polyphosphates Polyphosphates are formed by polymerization of ordinary monophosphate ions PO43 Several mechanisms for such polymerization have been suggested Polyphosphates cause polymerization of amino acids into peptides They are also logical precursors in the synthesis of such key biochemical compounds as ATP A key issue seems to be that calcium reacts with soluble phosphate to form insoluble calcium phosphate so some plausible mechanism must be found to keep calcium ions from causing precipitation of phosphate There has been much work on this topic over the years but an interesting new idea is that meteorites may have introduced reactive phosphorus species on the early earth

Different forms of life may have appeared quasi simultaneously in the early history of Earth The other forms may be extinct leaving distinctive fossils through their different biochemistry survive as extremophiles or simply be unnoticed through their being analogous to organisms of the current life tree Hartman for example combines a number of theories together by proposing that The first organisms were self replicating iron rich clays which fixed carbon dioxide into oxalic and other dicarboxylic acids This system of replicating clays and their metabolic phenotype then evolved into the sulfide rich region of the hotspring acquiring the ability to fix nitrogen Finally phosphate was incorporated into the evolving system which allowed the synthesis of nucleotides and phospholipids If biosynthesis recapitulates biopoesis then the synthesis of amino acids preceded the synthesis of the purine and pyrimidine bases Furthermore the polymerization of the amino acid thioesters into polypeptides preceded the directed polymerization of amino acid esters by polynucleotides

There are 4 types of resources They are

Pig Iron is for upgrading buildings and also to help create Metal

Metal is harder more resistant and more mouldable than pig iron and is used mostly for ship construction and better structures This is the most used substance in the game

Kryptonite is used for almost all types of ships and buildings Its also used for research

Spice is a mostly a rare raw material As a result it is that much more valuable Spice provides a good performance in ship drives in research and also in alloys Spice even plays a vital role in food production It is essential for an up and coming empire

In this game you can trade the various resources with the rule of thumb being 6341 in the order Pig Iron Metal Kryptonite Spice

eg 6k Pig Iron would be traded for 3k Metal or 4k Kyrptonite or 1k Spice

Mining is the first task you start in the game In order to mine the four resources you must upgrade each mine Every upgrade increases the amount of resources the mine produces every hour But every upgrade uses more energy So accordingly you must also upgrade the Fusion Plant which produces energy for the mines 

Every upgrade uses another field On your first planet there is 230 fields

This is the second possibility after mining You can build and upgrade the Development Center which decreases your building times for factories and such The research lab unlocks different types of research and decreases research times The weapons factory is needed for all ships and defenses With every level the weapons factory decreases production time

Stromatolites are special rock like structures They usually form in shallow water 

They are formed by bacteria such as cyanobacteria There may also be other types of bacteria and single celled algae 

The mucus secreted by the bacteria collects grains of sediment and they are stuck together with calcium carbonate also from the bacteria This builds up into the structures seen in certain sea shore bays Cyanobacteria use water carbon dioxide and sunlight to create their food and put out oxygen as a by product 

The real significance of stromatolites is that they are the earliest fossil evidence of life on Earth The oldest stromatolites are dated to 3450 million years ago during the Archaean eon

Early cyanobacteria in stromatolites are thought to be largely responsible for increasing the amount of oxygen in the primaeval Earths atmosphere through their continuing photosynthesis

Makemake is a dwarf planet It was discovered on March 31 2005 by astronomers Michael E Brown Chad Trujillo and David Rabinowitz It was announced as a dwarf planet on June 11 2008 Makemake is a Trans Neptunian object because it orbits the Sun after Neptune

It is called Makemake after the god of the ancient civilization that lived on Easter island

Originally the object was nicknamed Easter Bunny as it was discovered around Easter time The International Astronomical Union said this wasnt a good name so it was given the name Makemake the creator god of the Easter Island people to keep its connection to Easter

Makemake appears to be made mainly of ice and rock However at its very low temperature ice is as hard as many types of rock

Hello I am requesting the SysOp tools as I think I can help the Simple English Wikipedia better with them

Currently I have been closing RfDs often as there has been a freqent backlog However since I am not an admin I cannot delete pages So I have to wait for a admin to delete the page This takes a long time to do therefore defeating the purpose of closing the RfD in the first place One of the reasons I am after the tools is that I believe waiting for a admin to QD a RfDd page is merely a waste of time

Secondly I do a lot of new page patrol Sometimes this involves vandals I therefore would find it quicker if I had the tools to delete and block the vandals This way I can stop the vandals earier

I would be happy to answer questions from the community about why I need the tools and what makes me qualified to use them Thank you   Da Punk 95 talk 2100 17 July 2008

Pre cambrian is an obsolete term used to describe the eons before the Cambrian It lasted from about 455 billion yeas ago to about 542 million years ago It starts with the beginning of the Earth about 454 billion years ago When it ends there were many hard shelled animals around It is named after the Roman name for Cymru Wales because rocks thought to be from this time were first studied there

The trophy was introduced at the start of the 198586 NHL season by the leagues Board of Governors Before the 198586 NHL season the best team in the league during the regular season was allowed to hang a banner stating NHL League Champions The winning team is also awarded 350000 Canadian dollars to be shared between the team and its players The Presidents Trophy winner is guaranteed home ice advantage in all four rounds of the Stanley Cup playoffs provided the team goes that far so it remains the most likely position to produce the cup winner

From 1937 to 1968 the same rules now used for winning the Presidents Trophy were used to award the Prince of Wales Trophy With the Modern Era expansion in the 196768 season and the start of the West Division the Wales Trophy was awarded to the team that finished in first place in the East Division during the regular season However no trophy was awarded to the team that finished with the best overall record in the league during this period and no trophy at all was awarded from the 198182 season through the 198485 season the Wales and Campbell trophies were transferred to the playoff champions of those conferences in 198182 A cash bonus was given to each player on the team with the leagues best regular season record during these years to which the Presidents Trophy was added in 198586

The only team to have won the Presidents Trophy more than twice is the Detroit Red Wings with six However the Montreal Canadiens have finished first overall 21 times the most times in league history although they have yet to win the Presidents Trophy Detroit is second with 18 first overall finishes

The Prince of Wales Trophy or simply the Wales Trophy is a National Hockey League trophy awarded to the Eastern Conference playoff champions The trophy is awarded prior to the final series which are the championship games to decide the winner for the Stanley Cup against the Western Conferences champions The trophy was first established in the 1923 24 NHL season for the champion of the NHL playoffs but it has been the trophy for eight different accomplishments which also include being the NHL regular season champions American Division regular season champions regular season champions East Division regular season champions Wales Conference regular season champions Wales Conference playoffs champions and Eastern Conference playoffs champions The current holder of the Prince of Wales Trophy is the Boston Bruins after defeating the Tampa Bay Lightning in the 2011 Eastern Conference finals 

The Prince of Wales Trophy was donated by His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales in 1924 It was first presented to the playoff champion of the NHL who then went on to face the Western Hockey League champion for the Stanley Cup

After the WHL folded and the Stanley Cup was awarded only to the NHL playoff champion the Prince of Wales Trophy was awarded to the regular season champion From 192728 onwards it was awarded to the champion of the NHL American Division while the OBrien Trophy was awarded to the NHL Canadian Division It was then repurposed to being the trophy for the overall regular season champion in the 1938 39 NHL season when the NHL reverted to a single division

With the Modern Era expansion in the 196768 season and the creation of the West Division the Wales Trophy was awarded to the team that finished in first place in the East Division during the regular season When the league formed two conferences in the season of 197475 the award was transferred to the team that finished with the best regular season record in the Wales Conference Starting with the 198182 campaign when the league changed its playoff format so that the two teams meeting in the Stanley Cup finals could no longer come from the same conference the trophy was presented to the Wales Conference playoff champions and since the 199394 season the Eastern Conference playoff champions have won the award

Once awarded the deputy commissioner currently Bill Daly would present the trophy to the winning teams captain However a traditional superstition that is prevalent among many of todays NHL players is that no player should either touch or hoist the Wales Trophy when they have won the conference playoffs as the Eastern Conference champions Players feel that the Stanley Cup is the only true championship trophy and thus it should be the only trophy that should be hoisted

Pet Sounds is the tenth album by the American band The Beach Boys The album was released in 1966 

The album was very popular because it was different from most of the bands other music Most of The Beach Boys albums before it had all been about surfing summer cars girls and fun They were all quite basic in their music They were mostly Rock and roll and surf music Pet Sounds was different because of its more complex arrangements The bass player for the band Brian Wilson used a system of recording songs that was different than the system they had used before In the recording stringed and wind instruments were used They also used instruments that were very unusual for rock music These included vibraphones harps French horns harpsichords electro theremins Also things like bicycle whistles and Coca Cola cans with stones inside of them were used The lyrics of the songs were more serious They talked about the problems disappointments and sadness of a young man Because all the songs had a similar mood and themes it is considered to be a concept album

Much of the album was recorded by Wilson himself using professional studio musicians  people who are hired to play songs for an album Some of the other band members did not like this They felt he was ignoring their talents Mike Love thought that it would be too hard to play these songs live and that their fans would not understand the songs 

After the album was released Pet Sounds did not sell very well It reached 10 in the American hit parade Wilson felt this was a failure but music critics loved it The album got real recognition in 1990s 2000s when many music magazines listed it in their lists of the best albums in popular music

Wilson decided to make another album in the same way The new album he called Smile

Smile was a Beach Boys album Their bass player Brian Wilson wanted the album to be the follow up to the album Pet Sounds For some reasons it was not released for over 30 years

After seeing the success that Pet Sounds had been Wilson wanted to make an album that was even better In late 1966 he started work on what he said would be the greatest rock album ever made He asked Van Dyke Parks to write words for new songs 

SMiLE was not completed on time for at least three reasons

When the time came to release the album Brian said that the album was not finished and would be delayed for an unknown length of time People still hoped that he would finish it but in May 1967 the album was cancelled Wilson had stopped working on it and it would never be finished 

Later in 1967 The Beach Boys released another album called Smiley Smile The album had songs that were written for Smile Smiley Smile was not the great success that Wilson thought Smile would have been The Beach Boys lost many fans because of the albums failure The failure also cost Capitol Records much money because not enough people bought the album

As Carl lamented they tried for a homerun with Smile and ended up hitting a bunt with Smiley Smile

In 2004 Brian finished Smile The album was a success People were happy that SMiLE could finally be heard as it was meant to be heard

Greek salad countryvillage salad is a dish from Greece It is commonly served as a part of a traditional Greek meal It is one of the most popular salads in Greece and Cyprus This is because it is light refreshing and easy to make It is especially popular during the summer months True Greek salad is essentially a tomato salad made of sliced or chopped tomatoes with a few slices of cucumber and red onion It is usually seasoned with salt black pepper and oregano and dressed with olive oil Common additions include feta cheese bell peppers capers anchovies sardines and kalamata olives Lettuce and vinegar are not used in a Greek salad 

A lettuce salad is a different salad It is also popular especially in the autumn and spring It is made of finely sliced lettuce scallions and fresh dill and dressed with salt black pepper olive oil and red wine vinegar or lemon juice

In North America Australia South Africa and the United Kingdom Greek salad has a different meaning It is a lettuce salad with Greek inspired ingredients The dressing is usually vinegar and oil Lettuce tomatoes feta and olives are the most standard elements in an American Greek salad but cucumbers bell peppers onions radishes dolmades anchoviessardines and pickled hot peppers are common In the Detroit Michigan area for example a Greek salad also includes beets Rather than simple olive oil and vinegar as in a  lettuce salad prepared dressings containing various herbs and seasonings are frequently used This style of Greek salad is rarely encountered in Greece except in the homes of American Greeks or restaurants that cater to tourists In these countries the true Greek salad when encountered may be called by the Greek term horiatikipronounced hritkior by such terms as country salad peasant salad or village salad to avoid confusion 

Greek salad is also found in other European countries for example Germany France Hungary and Spain

Various other salads have also been called Greek in the English language in the last century Some of them have a very old connection to Greek cuisine For example one 1938 American recipe called for a mayonnaise dressed lettuce salad with shredded cabbage carrots and diced smoked herring

The salads of Greek cuisine are wide and varied Each region of Greece has or has had a salad specific to the village or area The most common described above start most meals today in Greece at home or when dining out Others include

Some spreads and dips found in the meze of Greek cuisine are also affectionately called salad in Greek Melitzanosalata is an eggplant puree that includes olive oil red wine vinegar flat leaf parsley and garlic Taramosalata is fish roe mixed with lemon juice onions and olive oil and breadcrumbs or mashed potato

The Books of Kings are a set of books in the Old Testament Both Judaism and Christianity see it as a part of the Bible The Books of Kings describes the history of Israels kings from the end of the rule of David until the time of the Babylonian exile After a long description of Solomons rule 12 Kings writes of how the kingdom of Israel was divided and then shows how the Kingdom of Israel and the Kingdom of Judah developed

1 and 2 Kings like 1 and 2 Samuel and 1 and 2 Books of Chronicles are actually one book It was simply called Kings However it was divided into two books by the translators of the Septuagint and so it was written as 1 and 2 Kings by the Latin translation and many other versions

The division between 1 and 2 Kings was made after the death of Ahab in the northern kingdom and Jehoshaphat in the southern kingdom

It is not known for sure who is the author of 12 Kings Jewish tradition says that Jeremiah wrote 12 Kings but people do not usually think so today Whoever the author was he knew the book of Deuteronomy like many of Israels prophets He also used lots of sources like the books of the annals of Solomon the book of the annals of the kings of Israel and the book of the annals of the kings of Judah Probably other sources were used like those inside Chronicles

12 Kings gives lots of chronological information The length of time each king rules is given and often other information is given such as the age of the ruler at the time of becoming king

By putting in Biblical data with those given from Assyrian chronological records the year 853 BC is probable as the year of Ahabs death and the year 841 as the year Jehu began to reign So it can be known that the division of the kingdom happened in 930 BC and that Samaria was defeated by the Assyrians in 722 721 and that Jerusalem fell to the Babylonians in 586

The information about the connection between the reigns of the kigns of Israel and Judah have some problems which have for a long time been wondered at Recently though most of these problems have been solved by recognizing things like possibilities of reigns that overlap sons ruling with their fathers differences in the time of the year in which the rule of a king officially began and differences in the way a kings first year was seen

12 Kings does not exactly say its purpose or theme but it is most probable that the author wanted to write his material as a sequel the next book after the books of Samuel a history about the kings by covenant

The writer was not trying to show a social or political or economical history of Israels kings like most histories today He writes about Omri who was a very powerful king and an important political person in only six verses simply saying that he did evil in the eyes of the Lord Also Jeroboam the second who was king over northern Israel when it was most powerful is written about very shortly

He also writes nothing about the first years of Josiah king of Judah but says a long description of how they begin again to keep the covenant in his 18th year as king Nothing is said about why Josiah fought with Pharaoh Neco of Egypt at Megiddo

The kings who is most written about in the books of Kings are the kings who either kept the covenant well broke it very badly or had an important encounter with one of Gods prophets Ahab son of Omri and Manasseh broke the covenant so that it was dangerous to Israel so the author wrote a lot about them both Hezekiah and Josiah are written a lot about because they tried to remind the people of their covenant promises They are the only two kings who the writer is really happy with for their loyalty to the Lord

Another important part of 1 and 2 Kings is that the writer shows the relationship between prophecy and how it is fulfilled in history At least 11 prophecies are written to be true The writer also shows the importance of the prophets as messengers from God to tell the kings and people of Israel to come back to God Uusally nobody listened to their warnings but the writer writes very much about Elijah and Elisha

Books of the Bible are listed differently in the canons of Jews and Catholic Protestant Greek Orthodox Slavonic Orthodox Georgian Armenian Apostolic Syriac and Ethiopian Churches although there is substantial overlap A table comparing the canons of some of these denominations appears below for both the Old Testament and the New Testament For a detailed discussion of the differences see Biblical canon

The Eastern Orthodox Oriental Orthodox and Eastern Catholic churches may have minor differences in their lists of accepted books The list given here for these churches is the most inclusive if at least one Eastern church accepts the book it is included here The books included by the Roman Catholic Church are universally included in the Eastern canons

A table cell with an asterisk indicates that a book is present but in a different order Empty cells indicate that a book is absent from that canon such books are often called apocrypha a term that is sometimes used specifically to describe the books in the Catholic and Orthodox canon that are absent from the Protestant Bible Orthodox and Catholic Christians describe these books as deuterocanonical meaning second canon

In general among Christian groups the New Testament canon is agreed upon although book order can vary

The Ethiopian Orthodox Church has a few additional books in its canon Jubilees Book of Enoch and the Rest of the Words of Baruch 

The Peshitta excludes 2 3 John 2 Peter Jude and Revelation but Bibles of the modern Syriac Orthodox Church include later translations of those books along with the Letter of Baruch Still today the official lectionary followed by the Syrian Orthodox Church presents lessons from only the twenty two books of Peshitta the version to which appeal is made for the settlement of doctrinal questions 

Third Epistle to the Corinthians was once considered part of the Armenian Orthodox Bible but is no longer printed with modern editions

These are the Anglican Apocrypha as defined by the 39 Articles The Apocrypha Books are ordered according to the Vulgate The Lutheran Apocrypha is different

Bambis Children The Story of a Forest Family is a book written by Felix Salten first printed and translated from German to English in 1939 It is a sequel to Saltens book Bambi A Life in the Woods It was first published in German only in the following year

The main characters are Bambis twin fawns Geno male and Gurri female it also stars their friends another pair of fawns named Lana and Boso Lana and Boso are the children of Aunt Rolla a doe met later in the course of the novel Two more new characters are introducedNello and Membo the orphans The overall storyline is how Geno and Gurri learn the pleasures as well as downsides of nature and their forest home Bambi A Life in the Woods the original story of Bambi is much darker than the sequel Unlike its predecessor Bambis Children ends when Geno begins to grow his antlers whereas Bambi A Life in the Woods continues until Bambis children are born In the end Faline knowing the time is right sends off her children to live their own lives

What may be interesting to readers is that it is not possible to determine whether Bambis Children is a sequel to the book Bambi or a midquel as there are no references to the former which makes one able to place the latter The language of Bambis Children is more gentle than that of Bambi A Life in the Woods

The Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States is a treaty Today it is part of customary international law The treaty was signed at Montevideo Uruguay on December 26 1933 at the Seventh International Conference of American States At this conference United States President Franklin D Roosevelt and Secretary of State Cordell Hull declared the so called Good Neighbor Policy which opposed US armed intervention in inter American affairs Franklin D Roosevelt tried to reverse the perception of Yankee imperialism with this treaty The view of Yankee imperialism was brought about by policies instituted by his predecessor President Herbert Hoover The convention was signed by 19 states three with reservations

The convention is about what is a state and what rights and duties it has Most well known is article 1 which sets out the four criteria for statehood that have sometimes been recognized as an accurate statement of customary international law

In addition the first sentence of article 3 explicitly states that The political existence of the state is independent of recognition by the other states This is known as the declarative theory of statehood

Some have questioned whether these criteria are sufficient as they allow less recognized entities like the Republic of China or even entirely non recognized entities like the Principality of Sealand to claim full status as states According to the alternative constitutive theory of statehood a state exists only insofar as it is recognized by other states It should not be confused with the Estrada doctrine

There have also been attempts to further broaden the conventions definition although they have gained less support Founders of non territorial micronations commonly assert that the requirement in the Montevideo Convention of a defined territory is in some way wrong headed for largely unspecified reasons Some non territorial entities notably the Sovereign Military Order of Malta are indeed considered subjects of international law but these do not aspire to statehood

The states that signed this convention are Honduras United States of America El Salvador Dominican Republic Haiti Argentina Venezuela Uruguay Paraguay Mexico Panama Guatemala Brazil Ecuador Nicaragua Colombia Chile Peru Cuba The Montevideo Convention only codified existing norms there is nothing new in the convention For this reason it does not only apply to those who signed it but to all subjects of international law as a whole

The European Union in the principal statement of its Badinter Committee follows the Montevideo Convention in its definition of a state by having a territory a population and a political authority The committee also found that the existence of states was a question of fact while the recognition by other states was purely declaratory and not a determinative factor of statehood 

Switzerland although not a member of the European Union adheres to the same principle stating that neither a political unit needs to be recognized to become a state nor does a state have the obligation to recognize another one At the same time neither recognition is enough to create a state nor does its absence abolish it

In architecture a folly is a building usually constructed strictly for aesthetic pleasure Originally buildings were made to provide shelter or to house people Follies are just decoration they no longer have a buildings original function They were first constructed to put accents into parks and estates Folly is used in the sense of fun or light heartedness not in the sense of something ill advised

In general follies have the following properties

In England these structures are also called eye catchers This points to their basically decorative nature

Follies fall within the general realm of fanciful and impractical architecture and whether a particular structure is a folly is sometimes a matter of opinion However there are several types which are related but which can be distinguished from follies

Follies began as decorative accents on the great estates of the late 16th and early 17th centuries but they flourished especially in the two centuries which followed Many estates were blessed with picturesque ruins of monastic houses and Roman villas others lacking such buildings constructed their own sham versions of these romantic structures Such structures were often dubbed name of architect or builders Folly after the single individual who commissioned or designed the project However very few follies are completely without a practical purpose Apart from their decorative aspect many originally had a use which was lost later such as hunting towers Follies are misunderstood structures according to The Folly Fellowship a charity that exists to celebrate the history and splendour of these often neglected buildings

Follies are often found in parks or large grounds of houses and stately homes Some were deliberately built to look partially ruined They were especially popular from the end of the 16th century to the 18th century Theme parks and worlds fairs have often contained follies although such structures do serve a purpose of attracting people to those parks and fairs

The Irish Potato Famine of 1845 49 led to the building of several follies The society of the day held that laissez faire not a welfare state was the appropriate form of civil management The concept of a welfare state was a century away and at that time reward without labour even to those in need was seen as misguided However to hire the needy for work on useful projects would deprive existing workers of their jobs Thus construction projects termed famine follies came to be built These include roads in the middle of nowhere between two seemingly random points screen and estate walls piers in the middle of bogs etc

Follies can be found worldwide but there seem to be many in Great Britain

Strawberry Fields Forever is a song composed by John Lennon recorded by his band The Beatles in 1966 at Abbey Road Studios and issued by Parlophone Records and Capitol Records in February 1967 as the broken wikt linkB sideB side to Penny Lane

Lennon began work on Strawberry Fields Forever while he was in Almera Spain during the time he was appearing in a Dick Lester comedy movie How I Won the War which starred Michael Crawford The lyrics drew on Lennons memories of Strawberry Field a Salvation Army home in Liverpool England where Lennon went as a boy to broken wikt linkgarden partygarden parties with neighborhood friends We always had fun at Strawberry Fields he later told Playboy Magazine They also drew on his feelings of broken wikt linkalienationalienation and being different No one I think is in my tree I mean it must be high or low he explained as not being able to find other people who looked at life the way he did

Lennons first demo of Strawberry Fields Forever was made with a simple tape recorder by Lennon himself He explored different broken wikt linkarrangementarrangements of instruments with the Beatles and George Martin in the recording studio as they began broken wikt linkrecording sessionsessions for Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band 

One recorded version of the song used a slide guitar Another used a Mellotron and was considered a finished work Lennon wanted to try another arrangement though and asked Martin to compose a score for brass instruments for another session This broken wikt linkremakeremake was also considered finished

Lennon could not decide which of the two finished versions of the song was best He liked how the first one began but preferred the ending of the second and asked George Martin if they could be edited together Martin did not see an easy way to do that because the key and tempo of each version was different

It turned out that studio technology made it possible to join the two versions in an effective way The first version was speeded up on tape raising its pitch and tempo and the second slowed down lowering its pitch and tempo With edits between verses Martin changed from one version to the other Most listeners never noticed the change or knew about the edit

To go with the recording the Beatles filmed a promo an early kind of music video in January 1967 The band had begun to grow mustaches and Lennon began to wear eyeglasses in public which he rarely did before The changes made the Beatles look very different from how the public saw them earlier The kind of glasses Lennon wore were issued in England by the broken wikt linkNational Health ServiceNational Health Service and the military and he wore them making How I Won the War Lennon disliked the style as a boy but now made it a broken wikt linkfadfad by broken wikt linkembraceembracing it

The Beatles planned to issue Strawberry Fields Forever and Penny Lane as part of their next album but EMI asked for a single at the beginning of 1967 The two songs were issued as a single with Penny Lane as the A side While Penny Lane only reached Number Two in the British record sales chart it reached Number One in the United States chart Strawberry Fields Forever charted at Number Eight in the US

It is sometimes believed that Strawberry Fields Forever describes or suggests the use of drugs like LSD or even heroin Lennon admitted that using LSD and other drugs influenced his songwriting but made no references to any drug or drug use in the song

In the years after Lennons death his cowriter and fellow Beatle Paul McCartney sometimes performed Strawberry Fields Forever during concerts A section of Central Park in New York City where Lennon lived after the Beatles disbanded was named Strawberry Fields in Lennons honour

Italian Mare Nostrum was the name given during World War II by Benito Mussolini and his fascist propaganda to the Mediterranean Sea under the domination of the Kingdom of Italy

The Mediterranean was called Mare Nostrum during the centuries of the Roman Empire an empire that Fascism intended to recreate after the conquest of Ethiopia in 1936

Mussolini wanted to re establish the greatness of the Roman Empire and believed that Italy was the most powerful of the Mediterranean countries after World War I He declared that the twentieth century will be a century of Italian power and created one of the most powerful navies of the world in order to control the Mediterranean Sea

However the nation that really dominated the Mediterranean in 1940 was the United Kingdom as the British had strong naval bases in Gibraltar Malta and Cyprus The British also controlled the Suez Canal along with the French the French Third Republic had a relatively powerful navy and controlled the African Maghreb Only after the conquest of Greece and Yugoslavia in April 1941 Mussolini started to talk about an Italian dominated Mediterranean sea

In 1942 Mussolini dreamed to create a Greater Italia in his Mare Nostrum and promoted the fascist project to be realized in a future peace conference after the expected Axis victory of an enlarged Italian Empire stretching from the Mediterranean shores of Egypt to the Indian Ocean shores of Somalia and eastern Kenya All these projects disappeared with the final Italian defeat of September 1943

Italy controlled the seashores of these Mediterranean countries when Mussolini spoke and boasted of an Italian Mare Nostrum in 194119421943

When France collapsed in 1940 Mussolini started to expand the Italian maritime control on the central Mediterranean attacking British possessions The ensuing Battle of the Mediterranean had many changes of fortune and finished with the victory of the Allies

There were a series of surface actions between Allied navies and the Italian Regia Marina during which the British able to replace losses with warships redeployed from other theatres finally gained the upper hand 

The Battle of Taranto in 1940 was a successful air attack on the Italian Navy at anchor when 21 British torpedo bombers sunk one battleship and damaged two othersThe Italian Navy slowly recovered from that attack later copied by the Japanese in Pearl Harbour

The Italian Navys most successful attack however was when human torpedo divers planted mines on British battleships in Alexandria harbour and the HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Valiant were sunk After these sinkings the Italian Navy obtained for some months the nearly complete control of the central Mediterranean In this way the Regia Marina was able to deliver the military supply and oil for the Axis victory of Tobruk and for the advance toward El Alamein in Egypt

The Italian Regia Aeronautica entered the war with 3296 airplanes distributed in all the Italian Empire but only 1796 were in perfect fighting conditions Most were old wood models and could not match the British aircraft in 1940 

But in April 1941 when Italy started together with the Germans the coordinated Axis attack in the Mediterranean the Italian Air Force had the new and competitive Macchi C202 able to fight successfully the British Spitfires These airplanes took control of the Malta and Libyan airspace during the successful campaign of General Rommel in Tobruk 

Only at the beginning of 1943 appeared the modern Macchi C205 and Reggiane Re2005 but they could not match the overwhelming superiority of the American Air Force

One of the most renown and important branches of the Regia Aeronautica was the torpedo bomber group In 1941 and 1942 Italian pilots mostly flying the three engined medium bomber Savoia Marchetti SM79 Sparviero inflicted considerable losses to Allied shipping in the Mediterranean Sea

The only four engine heavy bomber of the Regia Aeronautica was the Piaggio P108 B In the 274th Long Range Bombardment group these bombers made many long range bombardments of Gibraltar from Sardinia in summer 1942 and reinforced in this way the Regia Aeronautica supremacy during those of months in the Italian Mare Nostrum

The Italian Army entered the war with 73 divisions but only 19 were fully operational for combat in June 1940 Italy during the first years of WWII had only small and medium tanks that were no match for the Allies tanks Only in summer 1943 the Italians developed a heavy tank but just 5 were ready for combat when Italy signed the armistice The Italian Army had good antitanks  and reliable armoured cars 

Slowly the initial Italian setbacks were corrected with German help and in spring 1941 the Italians started an offensive in the Balkans and in North Africa

In summerautumn 1942 Italy controlled the European seashores of the Mediterranean from the Rhone river in occupied France to Mount Olympus in Aegean Greece A similar situation happened in the African shores of the Mediterranean Sea where Mussolinis control went from Tunisia to El Alamein in Egypt This Italian domination was increased by the fact that most of the remaining shores of the Mediterranean were controlled by the fascist Spain of General Franco the France of Vichy and the Turkey of Kemal Ataturk all of them with friendliness toward Mussolini

In those months Mussolini referred to the Mediterranean Sea as Mare Nostrum in the same manner as the Romans had done when they dominated the Classical World However the Roman Mare Nostrum lasted for roughly six hundred years while Mussolinis Mare Nostrum lasted a few years until the Italian armistice in September 1943

All the overseas possessions of Italy in the Mediterranean Sea were lost formally as a result of the Treaty of peace with Italy

When Italy entered World War II on 10 June 1940 the Italian Royal Navy was the fourth largest navy in the world The Italian Navy had a mix of modernised and new battleships and challenged the Allies mostly the British Royal Navy for supremacy of the Mediterranean Sea 

Air support was provided by the Italian Air Force Auxiliary to the Navy the naval air service during wartime The Air Force Auxiliary was in charge of all land based aircraft shore based hydroplanes amongst of vessel based aircraft and hydroplanes of Italian Navy

Italian warships had a general reputation as well designed and good looking But some Italian cruiser classes were rather deficient in armour All Italian warships lacked radar for most of the war although the lack of radar was partly offset by the fact that Italian warships were equipped with good rangefinder and fire control systems In addition whereas Allied commanders at sea had discretion on how to act Italian commanders were closely and precisely governed by Italian Naval Headquarters This could lead to action being avoided when the Italians had a clear advantage 

The Allies had Ultra intercepts which predicted the Italian movements and radar which enabled them to locate the ships and range their weapons at distance and at night The better air reconnaissance skills of the Fleet Air Arm and their close collaboration with surface units were other major causes of the initial Italian defeats

The most successful attack performed by the Italian Navy involved divers planting mines on British battleships in Alexandria harbour HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Valiant were sunk in shallow water by the maiali of Luigi Durand De La Penne  

On the same night Force K comprising three cruisers and four destroyers based at Malta became stranded in an Italian minefield off Tripoli A cruiser and a destroyer were lost three other ships were seriously damaged and more than 900 men died Force K was put out of action and Maltas offensive capabilities were reduced to a minimum

This sudden series of Allied defeats allowed the Regia Marina to achieve naval supremacy in the central Mediterranean her supply routes were almost untouched by the enemy for several months This is the beginning of nearly one year in which the Mediterranean sea was effectively an Italian Mare Nostrum

The Italian fleet also took advantage of the situation and moved onto the offensive blocking or decimating at least three large Allied convoys bound for Malta This led to a number of naval engagements such as the Second Battle of Sirte the Battle of Mid June or Operation Harpoon and finally to Operation Pedestal all of them favourable to the Axis but sufficient supplies had been delviered to Malta for it to survive as a British base The biggest success of the Italian Fleet was the aerial and surface attack on the Harpoon convoy which sank several Allied warships and damaged others Only two transports of the original six reached Malta This was the only undisputed squadron size victory for Italian surface forces in World War II 

During these months the Regia Marina even planned an attack to New York harbour for December 1942 but it was delayed for many reasons and was never done 

However this was only a brief happy time for Mussolini The oil and supplies brought to Malta despite heavy losses by Operation Pedestal in August and the Allied landings in North Africa Operation Torch in November 1942 turned the fortunes of war against Italy After years of stalemate the Axis forces were ejected from Libya and Tunisia in six months after the Battle of El Alamein while their supply lines were harassed day after day by the growing and overwhelming aerial and naval supremacy of the Allies in what has just been the Mussolinis Italian Mare Nostrum

The Regia Marina performed well and bravely in its North African convoy duties but remained at a technical disadvantage The Italian ships relied on a speed advantage but could easily be damaged by shell or torpedo due to their relatively thin armour The fatal and final blow to the Italian Navy was a shortage of fuel which forced her main units to remain at anchor for most of the last year of the Italian alliance with Germany 

From summerfall 1941 to November 1942 the Mediterranean sea was effectively an Italian Mare Nostrum These were the main battlesevents in those months

The Red necked Wallaby is a medium sized macropod common in parts of eastern Australia As one of the largest wallabies it looks like a kangaroo Males can weigh more than 20 kg and have a head body length of 90 cm 

Red necked Wallabies have a black nose and paws white stripe on the upper lip and a medium grey coat with a red color on their neck

Red necked Wallabies are found along the coast and forests of eastern Australia from Rockhampton Queensland to the South Australian border in Tasmania and on many of the Bass Strait islands 

In Tasmania north east New South Wales and coastal Queensland their numbers have got bigger over the past 30 years This is because they are no longer hunted A lot of forest has been cleared for grass where wallabies can feed at night alongside trees where they can shelter by day It is less common in Victoria

Like most macropods the Red necked Wallaby lives by itself Groups also called mobs share feeding areas They feed at night and in the late afternoon generally eating grass and herbs close to forest shelter

There are two subspecies The Tasmanian form Macropus rufogriseus rufogriseus also called Bennetts Wallaby is smaller has longer fur and breeds in the late summer mostly between February and April They can live close to people and are seen feeding on lawns in the suburbs of Hobart and other towns

The mainland form Macropus rufogriseus banksianus breeds all year round A female can have babies at the about 14 months old A baby red necked wallaby called a joey lives in the mothers pouch for 9 months and continues to feed from the mother till about 12 15 months of age



The Battle of Baghdad in 1258 was a victory for the Mongol leader Hulagu Khan a grandson of Genghis Khan Baghdad was captured sacked and over time burned 

Baghdad was the capital of the Abbasid Empire This was an Islamic empire in what is now Iraq The Abbasid caliphs were the second of the Islamic dynasties

The Mongol army led by Hulagu Khan and the Chinese commander Guo Kan in vice command set out for Baghdad in November of 1257 Hulagu marched with what was probably the largest army ever fielded by the Mongols By order of Mongke Khan one in ten fighting men in the entire empire were gathered for Hulagus army The attacking army also had a large contingent of Christian forces 

Hulagu demanded surrender the caliph refused Many accounts say that the caliph failed to prepare for the fight he neither gathered armies nor strengthened the walls of Baghdad 

Hulagu divided his forces so that they threatened both sides of the city on the east and west banks of the Tigris The attacking Mongols broke some dikes and flooded the ground behind the caliphs army trapping them Much of the army was slaughtered or drowned

Under Guo Kans order the Chinese counterparts in the Mongolian army then laid siege to the city constructing a palisade and ditch wheeling up siege engines and catapults The siege started on January 29 The battle was swift by siege standards By February 5 the Mongols controlled a stretch of the wall Al Mustasim tried to negotiate but was refused 

On February 10 Baghdad surrendered The Mongols swept into the city on February 13 and began a week of massacre looting rape and destruction

Sahelanthropus tchadensis is a fossil hominid From evidence at the fossil site in Chad in the African Sahel it is thought to have lived about 7 million years ago 

The split of the line into humans and chimpanzees probably happened between 63 and 54 million years ago This can be seen from genetic data Because the fossil is older than this spilt its status is unclear The first fossil found is known as Touma today

Some fossils a cranium five pieces of jaw and some teeth make up a head that has features that are like both modern and primitive humans The braincase is only 340 cm to 360 cm in volume about the same as chimpanzees It is much less than the human volume of about 1350 cm

The teeth and structure of the face are very different from Homo sapiens The cranium found is damaged it is very distorted so no 3D computer reconstruction has been made There are no bones other than parts of the skull It is unknown if Sahelanthropus tchadensis was bipedal The placement of the foramen magnum suggests they were though Its canine wear is similar to other Miocene apes

Sahelanthropus may be an ancestor of both humans and chimpanzees no consensus has been reached yet by the scientific community The difficulty is caused by its mosaic of primitive and derived features Probably it lived in semi open woodland and savannah rather than the rainforest of present day apes

Another possibility is that Touma is related to both humans and chimpanzees but is the ancestor of neither Brigitte Senut and Martin Pickford the discoverers of Orrorin tugenensis suggested that the features of S tchadensis are consistent with a female proto gorilla Even if this claim is upheld the find would still be significant for at present few chimpanzee or gorilla ancestors have been found anywhere in Africa Thus if S tchadensis is an ancestral relative of the chimpanzees it represents the first known member of their lineage 

Furthermore S tchadensis does indicate that the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees is unlikely to resemble chimpanzees very much as had been previously supposed by some paleontologists

The fauna found at the site suggest an age of more than 6 million years as these species were probably extinct already by that time

Murray Langston is a Canadian comedian and writer His television work includes The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour Make Me Laugh and The Gong Show

Langston is best known oddly enough as The Unknown Comic a comedian who appears onstage wearing a paper bag over his head He first appeared as the Unknown Comic on The Gong Show He did not want his true identity known because an appearance on an amateur show could have hurt his comedy career when he was already well known

Audiences liked the Unknown Comic and Langston began to appear as that character on other shows and in live performances In time Langston was as famous for the character as for himself When he was finally unmasked in public the two careers became one Langston has performed both as himself and as the Unknown Comic ever since

Langston partly retired from his career during the 1990s to focus on raising his daughter

The term Australopithecine refers to any species in the related genera Australopithecus or Paranthropus These species occurred in the PliocenePleistocene era and were bipedal The arrangement of their teeth especially the dental arcade was similar to humans 

They had a brain size not much larger than modern apes lacking the large brain of the genus Homo 

They are classified within the Hominina subtribe of the Hominini tribe These are sub divisions of the Hominid family They appeared in the Pliocene

When used alone the term refers to both genera together Australopithecus is sometimes referred to as the gracile australopithecines while Paranthropus are also called the robust australopithecines

A likely ancestor of the Australopithecines is the genus Ardipithecus genus which lived in East Africa The genus Homo appears about 24 million years ago with Homo habilis They may be descended from australopithecine ancestors more precisely from Kenyanthropus platyops branching off Australopithecus some 35 million years ago 

An alternative possibility is that Homo derived directly from Ardipithecus with an as yet undiscovered link connecting Ardipithecus and Homo habilis existing in parallel to the Australopithecines in the period 4 to 25 million years ago

The Saraha Pump Theory attempts to explain how plants and animals from Africa moved into the Middle East and then Europe and Asia 

At the time Africa was rainier than it is today and the Sahara was wetter with bigger lakes and more rivers 

African rainy periods are associated with a wet Sahara phase during which larger lakes and more rivers exist This causes changes in the type of animals found in the area 

Regardless of the aridity of the greater Sahara migration along the river corridor was halted when during a desert phase 18 08 million years ago the Nile ceased to flow completely and possibly flowed only temporarily in other periods due to Nubian Swell uplift

During the periods of a wet Sahara the Sahara and Arabia become a savanna grassland and African flora and fauna become common During the following dry period the Sahara reverts to desert conditions usually as a result of the retreat of the West African Monsoon southwards Evaporation exceeds precipitation the level of water in lakes like Lake Chad falls and rivers become dry wadis 

Flora and fauna previously widespread retreat northwards to the Atlas Mountains southwards into West Africa or eastwards into the Nile Valley and thence either south east to the Ethiopian Highlands and Kenya or north east across the Sinai into Asia This separates populations of some of the species in areas with different climates forcing them to adapt possibly giving rise to speciation

The Saharan pump has been used to date four waves of human emigration from Africa namely

Stuttering or Stammering is a problem some people have when they speak 5 6 of children have a stammer while 1 of adults have a stammer Men are 4 times more likely to have a stammer than women Stammers normally start at 2 6 years and run in families The person knows what they want to say but the flow of their speech is bumpy and may have some of the following features

Stammering can be very upsetting and knock a persons confidence Joseph Sheehan compared stuttering to an iceberg with the bumpy parts you can hear of stuttering above the waterline and the larger block of how the person feels invisible below the surface These people may feel embarrassment shame frustration fear anger and guilt These feelings may increase stress and effort making the person stammer more  Such negative feelings may be an important part of a treatment program Stammers affect peoples lives as they may not have the confidence to apply for job interviews or make friends

Stuttering therapy

This therapy is also known as speak more fluently prolonged speech or connected speech It trains stutterers to speak fluently by controlling their breathing and how they move their lips jaw and tongue Stutterers are trained to slow down their speaking rate by stretching vowels and consonants  Other methods include soft speech contacts This helps to make very slow but non bumpy speech used only in the speech clinic To make more normal sounding speech for daily life speed of speech is increased Sadly many people find their speech does not sound natural at the end of therapy Fluency shaping approaches are normally taught in groups therapy programs which may take two to three weeks to complete More recently the Camperdown program using a much shorter schedule has been shown to work well

The goal of stuttering modification therapy is not to get rid of stuttering but to change it so that stuttering is easier and less stressful As fear and worry make people stutter by getting rid of these feelings stuttering will decrease The most widely known approach was made by Charles Van Riper in 1973 and is also known as block modification therapy Stuttering modification therapy has four stages

There were many famous stutterers

Life expectancy is how long a person is expected to live It is based on many factors such as place of living life style including etc

There are great changes in life expectancy between different parts of the world mostly caused by differences in public health medical care and diet Much of the excess mortality in poorer nations is due to war not enough food and diseases 

Over the past 200 years countries with Black or African populations have generally not had the same improvements in mortality rates that have been enjoyed by European people Even in countries with a majority of White people such as USA Britain Ireland and France Black people tend to have shorter life expectancies than their White counterparts For example in the US White Americans are expected to live until age 78 but African Americans only until age 71

Climate may also have an effect and the way data is collected may also influence the figures According to the CIA World Factbook Macau has the worlds longest life expectancy of 844 years

There are also significant differences in life expectancy between men and women in most countries with women typically outliving men by around five years Economic circumstances also affect life expectancy For example in the United Kingdom life expectancy in the richest areas is several years longer than in the poorest areas This may reflect factors such as diet and lifestyle as well as access to medical care It may also reflect a selective effect people with chronic life threatening illnesses are less likely to become wealthy or to reside in rich areas

Demosthenes was a well known Greek statesman and orator of ancient Athens His speeches show well how agile Athenians were when speaking They also give an insight into the politics and culture of ancient Greece during the 4th century BC Demosthenes learned rhetoric by studying the speeches of previous great orators He delivered his first judicial speeches when he was twenty He argued effectively to gain from his guardians what was left of his inheritance For a time Demosthenes made his living as a professional speech writer and a lawyer writing speeches for use in private legal suits 

At the age of 21 Demosthenes took the job of the commander of warships in the classical Greek world

Demosthenes grew interested in politics during the time he wrote speeches for others In 354 BC he gave his first public political speeches He went on to devote his most productive years to opposing Macedons expansion He idealized his city and tried throughout his life to restore Athens supremacy and motivate his compatriots against Philip II of Macedon He sought to preserve his citys freedom and to establish an alliance against Macedon in an unsuccessful attempt to impede Philips plans to expand his influence southwards by conquering all the Greek states After Philips death Demosthenes played a leading part in his citys uprising against the new King of Macedon Alexander the Great However his efforts failed and the revolt was met with a harsh Macedonian reaction To prevent a similar revolt against his own rule Alexanders successor Antipater sent his men to track Demosthenes down Demosthenes took his own life in order to avoid being arrested by Archias Antipaters confidant

The Alexandrian Canon compiled by Aristophanes of Byzantium and Aristarchus of Samothrace recognized Demosthenes as one of the ten greatest Attic orators and logographers According to Longinus Demosthenes perfected to the utmost the tone of lofty speech living passions copiousness readiness speed Cicero acclaimed him as the perfect orator who lacked nothing and Quintilian extolled him as lex orandi and that inter omnes unus excellat

A rain dance is a ceremonial dance It is performed by people who believe it will cause rain and keep their harvest safe 

Many different types of rain dances can be found in many cultures from Ancient Egypt to certain Native American tribes In the 20th century Balkans a ritual known as Paparuda or Perperuna is a type of rain dance 

The Cherokee tribe an ethnic Native American tribe from the Southeastern United States used rain dances to both create rain and to remove evil spirits from the earth The legend of the tribe says that the rain created has the spirits of the former leaders of the tribe During the rain these spirits fight the evil spirits in a place between our reality and the spirit worldFactdateMarch 2009 These raindances are also seen as acts of worship

Lice are wingless insects that live in hair They are all external parasites on every species of bird and most mammalian orders They are not found on Monotremes and a few eutherian orders namely the bats whales dolphins and porpoises and pangolins There are more than 3000 different species three are classified as human lice 

Lice spend their whole life on the host They are adapted to keep close contact with the host These adaptations are reflected in their size stout legs and claws which are adapted to clinging tightly to hair fur and feathers They are also wingless and flattened

Lice feed on skin debris feather parts sebaceous secretions and blood A louses color varies from pale beige to dark grey however if feeding on blood it may become considerably darker

A louses egg is commonly called a nit Lice attach their eggs to their hosts hair with specialized saliva which results in a bond that is very difficult to separate without specialized products Living lice eggs tend to be pale white Dead lice eggs are more yellow Lice are very annoying and are difficult to remove but not impossible The process is called nit picking and is often done with a close toothed metal comb For humans anti insect shampoos are available

The order has traditionally been divided into two suborders the sucking lice and chewing lice Four suborders are now recognised

It has been suggested that the order is contained by the Troctomorpha suborder of Psocoptera What this means is that lice may have evolved from free living species of that group

Humans are unique in that they host three different species of lice head lice body lice and pubic lice The DNA differences between head lice and body lice provide corroborating evidence that humans started wearing clothes at approximately 70000 BCE

Recent DNA evidence suggests that pubic lice spread to the ancestors of humans approximately 33 million years ago from the ancestors of gorillas by sharing the same bed or other communal areas with them and are more closely related to lice endemic to gorillas than to other lice species infesting humans

In Object oriented programming an object is an instance of a Class Objects are an abstraction They hold both data and ways to manipulate the data The data is usually not visible outside the object It can only be changed by using a well specified mechanism

Suppose there is a bank account this bank account has a current balance but it also has a history of things that were done These fields are however not directly accessible There are methods like deposit and withdraw and checkBalance Most applications only change this object through this interface 

Banks usually impose a credit limit Suppose there are 1000 dollars on the account If the client does not have a special agreement with the bank he cannot take out more money than there is on the account so he can withdraw a maximum of 1000 dollars He might have an agreement with the bank so he can borrow money from the bank In that case he might be able to withdraw 1500 dollars So the withdraw method has to do a lot of checks as described above The account manager might see the account differently she might have methods to set the maximum amount that can be taken out of the account or to set the fee or interest rate that the customer has to be pay for the money borrowed

As an object is an instance of a class it has certain things from that class It can perhaps be compared to other objects of that class Two apples one red and bigger the other green and smaller On the other hand It is not that easy to compare different objects A green apple does not have much in common with a steel wrench

Object Oriented Design is a way for the designer of a computer program to specify what a computer program will do using the way that people think and not using the way that computers think People think in terms of classes and objects For example fruit is a class and there are different kinds of fruits such as bananas and pineapples If a computer program designer were specifying to a computer programmer how to create a computer program to manage the fruits in a supermarket then he or she would specify the program in terms of classes and objects which is how people think

A computer program called a compiler andor an interpreter would take the program that the programmer typed in and convert it into a form that a computer can run Computers really only understand things that are encoded as numbers Object Oriented Design uses the power and speed of a computer to allow humans to be more productive in making computer programs by letting human computer programmers think in terms of how humans think

Hitler remained in the Fhrerbunker until his death He knew that escape was nearly impossible Other soldiers knew that too and wanted to get out Since there was no hope of winning Hitler gave orders to his generals and allowed a breakout plan on April 28th However this plan went bad as only a small amount of the expected amount of soldiers managed to get through Soviet lines Hitler authorized another one on April 29th to break out May 1st

However on April 30th the Red Army captured the Reichstag They were just 500 yards from the Fhrerbunker Hitler killed himself by shooting himself in the face with a pistol Eva Braun his mistress killed herself by biting on a capsule of cyanide a very toxic chemical On May 1st Helmuth Weidling ordered a break out However only one division named the Nordland Division made it through

Finally on May 2 1945 Nazi Germany surrendered

The Young Ones is a popular British sitcom first seen in 1982 on BBC2 Its anarchic sense of humour in the 1980s made the actors famous in the UK Soon after that it was shown to Americans on MTV one of the first shows on the new channel that was not mostly about music

The programme was about four college students sharing a house violent punk rocker Vyvyan the stuck up anarchist Rick the suffering hippy Neil and the mysterious Mike It also starred Alexei Sayle who played their landlord Jerzei Balowski and other members of the Balowski family 

The show was like a regular sitcom with violent slapstick silly turns in the plot and surrealism 

Although the series was set in North London many outdoors scenes were filmed in Bristol All four characters went to the fictional Scumbag College but they were never shown in a classroom and were hardly ever seen studying

The show was voted 31 in the BBCs Best Sitcom poll in 2004

The series beginnings were in Londons comedy clubs in the late 1970s Most of the cast became popular at The Comedy Store Alexei Sayle was the main act drawing attention as the manic aggressive Master of ceremonies Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall worked as a double act 20th Century Coyote and later became The Dangerous Brothers Nigel Planer was in a double act with Peter Richardson called The Outer Limits 

As The Comedy Store became popular Sayle 20th Century Coyote and The Outer Limits with French and Saunders and Arnold Brown set up their own club called The Comic Strip in nearby Soho The Comic Strip became one of the most popular comedy clubs in London and one person who liked it a lot was Jeremy Isaacs of Channel 4 Peter Richardson then made a deal for six half hour shows on Channel 4 using the group as comedy actors instead of stand up performers

The first of this series The Comic Strip Presents was on Channel 4 on 2 November 1982 After this the BBC made a deal with Edmondson Mayall Richardson Planer and Sayle to star in another sitcom in the same style Paul Jackson was put in as a producer 

The series was written by Mayall with his girlfriend Lise Mayer and with Ben Elton Richardson was first going to play Mike but clashed with Jackson He was replaced by Christopher Ryan the only member of the group who was not a stand up comedian

The series was centered around the unclean house where the students lived during their time at Scumbag College

When it was first on television the show got attention for violent slapstick Though new to mainstream audiences Mayall and Edmondson had been using it in 20th Century Coyote for some time The show also had some very strange parts such as puppets playing talking animals or objects Confusion was added with pieces in the middle that were not part of the main plot

Episodes in the second series sometimes had flash frames but these were cut out of some repeats They were included to make fun of the British and American publics fear of subliminal messages in television and music The images included the words Carry On Cowboy a rusty dripping tap a leaping frog a dove in flight a skier and a hand making pottery

The episodes ran 35 minutes and many episodes were cut when repeated on the BBC or satellite channels

In the United States The Young Ones ran on PBS MTV and in 1994 on Comedy Central

The series theme song featured the cast singing Cliff Richard and The Shadows UK 1 song The Young Ones Throughout the series there were many references to Richard as Mayalls character was a fan 

The theme song over the end credits was written by Peter Brewis who also created incidental music on many episodes

In 1984 after the second season Planer reached No 2 in the UK charts with a version of Traffics Hole In My Shoe It went with Neils Heavy Concept Album a loose collection of songs and spoken comedy with appearances by Young Ones actors Dawn French and Stephen Fry

In 1986 the cast sang Living Doll with Cliff Richard and Hank Marvin for Comic Relief The song a reworking of his 1959 hit reached the top of the UK Charts

Most episodes had a musical guest performing in the house or street By including the groups the show could be called variety rather than light entertainment by the BBC and was given a bigger budget than a sitcom This also helped get several British bands to be more popular with American viewers such as Dexys Midnight Runners Motrhead and Madness This last group was in two episodes

Some of these performances were cut from the DVD for copyright reasons Some musical acts were also cut out for similar reasons on some satellite reruns 

Played by Nigel Planer Neil Pye the hippy is a clinically depressed suicidal pacifist vegetarian and environmentalist working towards a Peace Studies degree He is victimised by other housemates and forced to do the housework including shopping cleaning and cooking He is never acknowledged for it 

Neil is pessimistic and believes everyone and everything hates him which is mostly true though he does have some friends two hippys one also named Neil and one named Warlock He does not like technology except for videos and he speaks out for Vegetable Rights and Peace He is also an insomniac believing that sleep gives you cancer 

Neil wants the others to feel sorry for him or just acknowledge his presence To get attention he tries anything from repeatedly banging himself on the head with a frying pan to attempting suicide He claims the most interesting thing that ever happens to me is sneezing  

In the second series his parents  who appear in the episode Sick  are revealed to be upper middle class They are conservative Tories who look down on Neil

Neil also says heavy a lot

Played by Rik Mayall Rick is an anarchist who is studying sociology andor domestic sciences Rick writes poetry and calls himself The Peoples Poet

Rick is a hypocritical tantrum throwing attention seeker who loves Cliff Richard Rick tries to impress the others with what he thinks is his wit talent and humour but is really none of these He insults and often physically assaults Neil He fights and bickers with Vyvyan and attempts to impress Mike

Rick is a vegetarian and says he wishes everyone to love each other like brothers However he rarely does anything that can be called brotherly love 

Rick is unlikeable and so selfish that he believes he is the most popular member of the flat even though his housemates really hate him Vyvyan describes Ricks name as being spelled with a silent P Although the other members dislike and ignore Rick he is heard to say that they really are terrific friends

Believing himself the Peoples Poet or the spokesperson for a generation Rick exaggerates or lies about his political activism and working class background and in the last episode Summer Holiday it is suggested he really comes from an upper class Conservative background

While he sees himself as an anarchist he likes the ideas of Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky and states his interest in them in several episodes However he claims to dislike Margaret Thatcher as is noted by his efforts threatening to blow up England with a bomb in the episode Bomb if she does not do something to help the kids by this afternoon This is also noticed in The Young Ones Book first published by Sphere Books where negative references are made to Thatcher and the Conservative Party 

Rick speaks loudly and cannot pronounce his rs sometimes

Played by Adrian Edmondson Vyvyan is an orange haired mohican punk rocker and medical student He is extremely violent and regularly attacks Neil and Rick with pieces of wood cricket bats and other large objects He never hurts Mike whom he respects He hates Rick more than he does Neil taking every chance to insult and attack him For example when Rick Mike and Neil meet his mother at a bar in the episode Boring he calls both Neil and Mike his friends but not Rick whom he calls a complete bastard Although Rick and Vyvyan hate each other this makes them all but inseparable the two spend more time together than apart or with the other housemates 

Vyvyan owns a yellow Ford Anglia with red flames painted along the sides and a Glaswegian hamster named Special Patrol Group which he is very fond of even though SPG is also often subjected to Vyvyans extreme violence His mother is a barmaid and former shoplifter who before Boring had not seen Vyvyan in ten years and has no idea who his father is

Vyvyan has inhuman strength on occasion surviving a pick axe through the head and he eats just about anything televisions dead rats cornflakes or cornflakes with ketchup  

Although he is a homicidal maniac Vyvyan can be friendly and creative in one episode he made his own potion to change a person into an axe wielding homicidal maniac He has more friends than the others but he doesnt like any of them He often causes damage such as wiring the doorbell to a bomb and adding a 289 CID Ford V 8 engine to the vacuum cleaner which proceeds to suck up the carpet the floorboards and a friend of Neils Vyvyan also seems to be the only member of the group with a driving licence

Played by Christopher Ryan Mike was the oddest of the four He is the assumed leader of the group despite being rather shorter than the others and does not involve himself in the battles between the other three He makes puns which are either deliberately cheap or humorous

He often uses deep sounding phrases that confuse the others Mike is supposedly the ladies man of the bunch and brags about his prowess with women although he is eventually forced to admit his virginity to the others in Nasty Though he is a virgin as are the rest of the housemates he always tries to get a date with the opposite sex being quite forward and unsuccessful

A con artist he always has some kind of plan to make quick money such as renting out Ricks bedroom as a roller disco and trying to auction off the unexploded atom bomb that fell into the house Mike attends Scumbag College only in name as he has blackmailed his tutor and the Dean of the school for grants and apparently passing grades In Summer Holiday he says I think Ill ask for one of those PhDs next year

While Mike often does things at the expense of his housemates he usually does not show the sort of open hostility that the others do and seems to cause them trouble only when it benefits him He has however managed to nail his own legs to a table and accidentally knocked Neil out during a game of cricket We only see violence done to him once or twice

Throughout the two series Alexei Sayle regularly appeared as many different characters putting his own material into the programme in ways that copied his stand up comedy routines His main role was that of the flats landlord Jerzy Balowski appearing in Demolition Flood and Summer Holiday The rest of the time he played various male members of The Balowski Family including nephew Alexei Balowski son Reggie Balowski brother Billy Balowski cousin Tommy Balowski escaped convict Brian Damage Balowski and a medieval jester Jester Balowski

In the second series Sayles characters also included a train driver a Mussolini look alike and Harry the Bastard

Mike is the natural leader of the house Always trying to make himself appear more important and exciting than he really is he does appear to have done some of the things he claims to have done He gets little hostility from the other members of the house If there is any good or friendly relationship in the house it is between Mike and Vyvyan Vyvyan accepts Mikes role as the house leader whereas Mike sometimes uses Vyvyans muscles and willingness to act forcibly to enforce his own authority

Neil is the second least liked of the four although he is the only one who does any kind of household chores and is therefore needed by the other three

Rick is the least liked Rick thinks very highly of himself He tells poor jokes and stories is a wanna be anarchist and frequently acts like a child when he does not get his way He generally takes out his frustration on Neil since Neil never sticks up for himself and is ignored by the others However the one time when Neil looked as if he was going to retaliate Rick fled Most of his anger comes up in his endless battles with Vyvyan which he always loses

In the final episode the four students steal a red AEC Routemaster after robbing a bank only to drive it over a cliff and it explodes into flames at the bottom of a quarry

The end of the series was not the last appearance of The Young Ones For the British charity television appeal Comic Relief the four recorded a song and video for Cliff Richards Living Doll along with Richard and Shadows guitarist Hank B Marvin At the 1986 Comic Relief stage show they performed the song live 

Mayall Planer and Edmondson reunited in 1986 for the Elton written Filthy Rich Catflap The series had many of the same characteristics as The Young Ones as did Mayall and Edmondsons next sitcom Bottom Ryan for his part was regularly recruited to play roles on associated series

DVD releases have been somewhat basic only the US Every Stoopid Episode edition featured documentaries and no extra footage was included Musical references proved difficult to clear so The Sound of Silence and Subterranean Homesick Blues were cut from the US editions 

A new DVD release of all episodes came out in November of 2007 with new documentaries and two commentary tracks This edition restores The Sound of Silence and Subterranean Homesick Blues but is missing other scenes 

In 1986 MTV bought half the episodes to run on their cable systems during 1987

Napolon III also known as Louis Napolon Bonaparte was the first President of the French Republic and the last monarch of France Made president by popular vote in 1848 Napoleon III ascended to the throne on 2 December 1852 the forty eighth anniversary of his uncle Napoleon Is coronation He ruled as Emperor of the French until September 1870 when he was captured in the Franco Prussian War 

Napoleon III generally known as Louis Napolon before he became emperor was the son of Louis Bonaparte who married Hortense de Beauharnais the daughter by the first marriage of Napoleons wife Josephine de Beauharnais During Napoleon Is reign Louis Napolons parents had been made king and queen of a French puppet state the Kingdom of Holland After Napoleon Is military defeats and deposition in 1815 and the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy in France all members of the Bonaparte dynasty were forced into exile He was quietly exiled to the United States of America and spent four years in New York He also sailed to Central America Then he secretly returned to France and attempted yet another coup in August 1840 sailing with some hired soldiers into Boulogne In 1844 his uncle Joseph died making him the direct heir apparent to the Bonaparte claim Two years later his father Louis died making Louis Napolon the clear Bonapartist candidate to rule France 

Louis Napolon lived within the borders of the United Kingdom until the revolution of February 1848 in France deposed Louis Philippe and established a Republic He was now free to return to France which he immediately did 

In 1848 he was elected President of France in a land slide victory He won the election because of his popular name and French people hoped that he would return his uncles glory He used his rank as stepping stone to greater power Finally in 1852 he crowned himself as Emperor Napoleon III and the Second French Empire was bornIn 1856 Eugenie gave birth to a legitimate son and heir Louis Napolon the Prince Imprial 

On 28 April 1855 Napoleon survived an attempted assassination On 14 January 1858 Napoleon and his wife escaped another assassination attempt plotted by Felice Orsini Until about 1861 Napoleons regime exhibited decidedly authoritarian characteristics using press censorship to prevent the spread of opposition manipulating elections and depriving the Parliament of the right to free debate or any real power

A far more dangerous threat to Napoleon however was looming France saw its dominance on the continent of Europe eroded by Prussias crushing victory over Austria in the Austro Prussian War in JuneAugust 1866 The Prussian forces under Chancellor Otto von Bismarck then began the Franco Prussian War This war proved disastrous for France and was instrumental in giving birth to the German Empire which would take Frances place as the major land power on the continent of Europe In battle against Prussia in 1870 the Emperor was captured at the Battle of Sedan and was deposed by the forces of the Third Republic in Paris two days later

Napoleon spent the last few years of his life in exile in England with Eugenie and their only son The family lived at Camden Place Chislehurst where he died on 9 January 1873 He was haunted to the end by bitter regrets and by painful memories of the battle at which he lost everything

Napoleon was originally buried at St Marys the Catholic Church in Chislehurst However after his son died in 1879 fighting in the British Army against the Zulus in South Africa the bereaved Eugenie decided to build a monastery The building would house monks driven out of France by the anti religious laws of the Third Republic and would provide a suitable resting place for her husband and son 

An important legacy of Napoleon IIIs reign was the rebuilding of Paris Part of the design decisions were taken in order to reduce the ability of future revolutionaries to challenge the government by capitalizing on the small medieval streets of Paris to form barricades However this should not overshadow the fact that the main reason for the complete transformation of Paris was Napoleon IIIs desire to modernize Paris based on what he had seen of the modernizations of London during his exile there in the 1840s

Charles Perrault was a French author who started the literary genre of fairy tales His best known tales include the following

Saint Joseph it says in the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke was engaged to a young woman named Mary 

The Gospel of Luke says that at this time the angel Gabriel came to Mary to tell her that she would give birth to a Son and she should call him Jesus and that he would save people from their sins Mary said How can this happen I am a virgin The angel said With God anything can happen

When Joseph found out that Mary was pregnant he decided to privately break the engagement But then he had a dream An angel told him that the baby was the Son of God 

At this time the Roman Emperor Caesar Augustus made a law that everyone in the Roman Empire must pay tax Everyone had to go back to the town that their family came from to have their name put on the tax lists Joseph came from Bethlehem which was called The City of David Joseph took Mary to Bethlehem and she gave birth to the baby Jesus in a stable because there was no room for them

Oneness Pentecostalism is a Protestant Christian movement The movement split from the Pentecostal movement Followers believe that the bible should be read literally They believe in one god and reject ideas like the Trinity They believe Jesus is fully god and fully human This makes them different from most Unitarians who say that the son of god was only man Oneness Pentecostalists say the belief in the Trinity is really the belief in three different gods 

The Seventh day Adventist Church is a Protestant Christian group It is different from other groups mainly because its followers think that Saturday the original seventh day of the Judeo Christian week should be the Sabbath The movement grew out of the Millerite movement in the United States during the middle part of the 19th century and was formally established in 1863 Among its founders was Ellen G White She wrote many texts that are still considered very important to the church today

Much of the theology of the Seventh day Adventist church is the same as evangelical teachings such as the Trinity and the infallibility of Scripture Teachings that are different include the unconscious state of the dead and the doctrine of an investigative judgment The church is also known because it thinks a healthy diet is very important It also promotes religious liberty When it comes to culture it is more conservative

The world church is governed by a General Conference Smaller regions are administered by divisions union conferences and local conferences It currently has a worldwide membership of over 15 million people It is present in over 200 countries and territories and is ethnically and culturally diverse The church runs many schools hospitals and publishing houses worldwide as well as a prominent humanitarian aid organization known as the Adventist Development and Relief Agency

Pay per view is a way that people can pay to watch events on television in their homes The event is shown at the same time to everyone ordering it This is different than video on demand systems which lets people see the event at any time Common events include movies sporting events and pornographic movies

The first major pay per view event was on September 16 1981 This event was Sugar Ray Leonard and Thomas Hitman Hearns boxing for the Welterweight Championship Viacom Cablevision in Nashville Tennessee was the first system to offer the event Over fifty percent of its customers paid to see the fightFactdateJanuary 2008 Viacoms Marketing Director Pat Thompson put together the fight He later put together other PPV fights wrestling matches and even a Broadway play

After leaving Viacom Thompson became head of Sports View He produced the first pay per view football game on October 16 1983FactdateJanuary 2008 Sports View was important in creating pay per view networks It was a part of creating TigerVision for LSU TideVision for Alabama and UT Vol Seat for Tennessee Sports View also produced the Ohio State Michigan Football game on PPV in November of 1983

In 1985 the first US cable channels to show only pay per view Viewers Choice Cable Video Store and Request TV began operation within days of each other Viewers Choice was available to both home satellite dish and cable customers Request TV was available to only cable viewers at first Dish owners could not use it until the 1990s

The term pay per view became more well known in the 1990s when companies like iN DEMAND HBO and Showtime started using it to show movies and other things In Demand would show movies concerts and other events at prices between 399 to 4999 HBO and Showtime would offer championship boxing with prices between 1499 to 5499FactdateJanuary 2008

Pay per view is also a very important way for professional wrestling companies like World Wrestling Entertainment Total Nonstop Action Wrestling  Ring of Honor and Asistencia Asesora y Administracin to earn money

The first pay per view system tested in the United states was the Zenith Phonevision system In 1949 it used telephone lines to take and receive orders The telephone lines were also used to descramble the signal on the television Tests were run for 90 days in Chicago In 1950 Skiatron tested its system on WOR in New York City The system used IBM punch cards to descramble the signal Both systems showed that they could be used but were not allowed to be used by the FCC

One of the first pay per view systems on cable was the Optical Systems It was first used in 1972 in San Diego These early systems quickly went out of business as the cable industry started using satellite technology This caused systems for example Home Box Office which had people pay a constant amount of money each month to became popular

Proprietary software does not let people see or change source code of the computer software It is the opposite of Free software Proprietary software is usually created by businesses who want to sell their software but some programs that are free to use are still proprietary because the user is not allowed to change them With proprietary software only the people that make the software can see and change the code

Even if the people who make the program give the source code to other people the program will be proprietary if they do not allow to do important things like these

Most companies who sell their software for money make it proprietary source This makes it harder for people to copy or change the software or to take the source code and make similar software

Kala Dhaka lies next to Agror to the east by Tanawal to the south the range has a length of 25 to 30 miles from north to south and a height of 8000 feet above sea level The river Indus goes through the most northern but and then moves to the south Between the river and the top of the range the western areas are occupied by the Yusufzai Pathans tribe The rest of the range is held by another tribe  the Swatis The Black Mountain has long narrow ridges with higher peaks every now and again It also has valleys in which there are villages where the tribes live The upper parts of the ridge are covered with thick forests of pine oak sycamore horse chestnut and wild cherry but the slopes are stony and barren

The British sent armies more than four times to try and control the Black Mountain Tribes from 1852 to 1892 because some leaders of the tribes opposed the British Government

In 1851 two officers of the British Customs department in a place called Tanawal were killed The British believed they were killed by the Hasanzai part of the Yusufzai tribe so the British then sent an army led by Colonel Mackeson which destroyed a number of tribal strongholds In 1868 the Yusufzai helped by the Khan of Agror who was upset that the British had set up a police post at Oghi in the Agror valley attacked that post with many men But he was forced to move back 

The Khan of Tandwal who remained loyal to British faced attacks by tribes who didnt like the British Then a large number of the tribes began marching against the British the British managed to stop them and force them back  however during the fighting twenty one British villages had been burnt The British then organised an army under General Wilde  he and his men managed to take over all of the Black Mountain and forced the tribes to accept British rule

In 1888 the British blocked the area due to the raids by the Hasanzai and Akazai tribes who were being helped by the Madda Khel tribe into the Agror valley While the British were planning tougher attacks  Major Battye and Captain Urmston and some soldiers of the 5th Gurkhas were surprised and killed by the Gujar tribe

Hashim Ali who was the chief of the Hasanzai and Akazai was blamed for starting the attack The British then sent an armies against the tribes in the same year the tribes had to pay a lot money to the British and also had to agree that Hashim Ali was not allowed to live there any more The British then made Ibrahim Khan a relative and enemy of Hashim Ali ruler

In 1890 the tribe stopped the march of British troops along the crest of the Black Mountain and so an army was sent against them in the spring of 1891 As soon as the troops left the Hindustanis and Madda Khel broke their agreement with the British Government by letting Hashim Ali return In 1892 the British sent their armies again to fight the tribes  this ended with the tribes being defeated by British

The Danube is the most important river in Romania People use it for transportation and to make hydroelectric power from the rivers flow of water Boats and other watercraft are able to travel on nearly all of the places that the Danube flows in Romania A problem that has occurred with using it for transportation is the fact that it is not very close by any of Romanias big industries

Wicca music or Wicca rock is music influenced by the Wicca religion and its beliefs relating to nature and conservation written by Wiccan musicians living in some of the most naturally beautiful forest regions of the world in Canada It is said by some to be an emerging sub genre of alternative music

The early signs of this categorys formation got people talking A music band called ThemistouredCanada and the USA singing and talking about Wicca The Themis body of works promotes things that are Wiccan such as the divinity of nature the Lord and Lady and an ethical credo that resembles Wiccan philosophies

Another Canadian band a group of vocalists from Vancouver Canada the Chalice and Blade also perform original pieces based on the beliefs of Wicca and sing songs which show reverence for the earth and the balance of the God and Goddess Chalice and Blade

The Ethics of Wicca music also mirrors the global ethic standardadopted by the United Nations and by the 1993 Parliament of the Worlds Religions in Chicago

Comparing Wicca Music ethicswith the Global Ethic StandardWicca Musics ecological and ethical aspects suggests that Wicca Music satisfies the Council for a Parliament of World ReligionsDeclaration for a Global Ethics request for universal adoption

All historical experience demonstrates the following Our earth cannot be changed unless in the not too distant future an alteration in the consciousness of individuals is achieved This has already been seen in areas such as war and peace or economy and ecology And it is precisely for this alteration in inner orientation in the entire mentality in the heart that the religions bear responsibility in a special way Here we remain aware however that a universal consensus on many disputed individual ethical questions will be difficult to attain Nevertheless even for many questions still disputed differentiated solutions should be attainable in the spirit of the fundamental principles jointly developed here

In many areas of life a new consciousness of ethical responsibility has already arisen Therefore we would be especially pleased if as many as possible national or international professional organizations such as those for physicians scientists business people journalists and politicians would compose up to date codes of ethics

Evidenced in lyrics of Wicca songs like I am The Shadow by Themis Love of Life by Themis and Ancient Trees by Chalice and Blade Wiccan musicians support a culture promoting ecology of non violence and respect for life the divinity of mother nature solidarity with earth a just economic order tolerance healing and truthfulness and equal rights and partnership between men and women

According to The Religion Newswriters Foundation Wicca is moving into the mainstream smashing stereotypes as their movement matures Throughout America Wiccans are organizing congregations and youth groups training clergy pursuing charity work sharing parenting tips and fighting for civil rights 

Wicca is a diverse earth based religious tradition that honors nature and the cycles of the seasons Wiccans celebrate solar holidays such as the solstices equinoxes and the four midpoints in between as well as lunar cycles This religion is one of the fastest growing in the United States and it is notable for the leadership of women concern for the environment and in some cases for political activism particularly efforts to counter misunderstanding and stereotyping   The Harvard University Pluralism Project

Wicca has enchanted pop culture and many teenagers The number of Wiccans in the US and Canada is doubling about every 30 months But neverthelss the percentage of Wiccans in the entire US and Canada populations is still less than 1 

Wicca Rock may not be religious neutral to many of the Christian faith Some conservative Christians feel that even gospel music or Contemporary Christian Music is unholy 

Perhaps less about political correctness and more about ecology beliefs which are common to all religions Wicca music according to both Themisand The Chalice and Blade advances that the cycles of nature are the holy days the earth is the true temple and the plants and creatures their musical partners and inspirations We respect life cherish the free will of sentient beings and accept the sacredness of all creation Our bible is the wind and the rain Ruffian Angel song writer and lead singer of Themis

We thrive in the song and spirit of the birds and other creatures of the wild  our music is written from a love of all life A Wiccan Music Creed

Unlike much Gothic Rockand even alternative rock Wicca music is bright and cheerful promoting positive Wicca ideals The Craft is a joyous creed it is also a socially and ecologically responsible one Love of life in all its forms is the basic ethic of the Craft The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  Wicca 101 

Converse to Gothic rock which comes from the dark Wicca music comes from the light side

In 2007 Themis with a strong pro ecology message morphed from a Punk rock background into the Wicca music realm The bands followers advance the idea that modern Wicca should be more about nature ecology and feminism and less about witchcraft and spirtualism We thrive in the song and spirit of the birds and other creatures of the wild  our music is written from a love of all life The cycles of nature are our holy days the earth is our temple its plants and creatures our partners and teachers so we respect life cherish the free will of sentient beings and accept the sacredness of all creationOur bible is the wind and the rain

Art rock is a word that is about a sub genre of rock music that has experimental influences The term Art Rock or Kunst Rock was coined and defined by the great black philosopher Doctor William Fearon and is very much related to the Kunst Muzik of the 1970s led by UKUS bands such as the Ramones Talking Heads and Television and the DetroitGerman led Techno movement Dr Fearon coined the term and its German equivalent in recognition of the impact that Futurism had on late twentieth century music Far from being an album based music format Art Rock is recognisable at live venues in the modern age with the developments in light and video technology meaning that Art and Rock can be seamelessly fused It is an album based form that is able to have longer more complex music and lets the musicians spend more time trying different ways to play their instruments Art rock is not created for mass consumption meaning it is not made to be liked by most people It is often long and has a lot of themes like classical music but usually has more keyboards than guitars Also it is not really music to dance to but music to just listen to and it often tells a story or has a philosophical theme to the lyrics

The idea of art rock has sometimes been used when talking about the progressive rock bands which became popular in the 1970s Allmusic says that progressive rock and art rock are almost the same both used to describe rock music that is more artistic Progressive rock eventually stuck as a label for a specific genre of rock music while art rock was used to described bands that were harder to label 

Princeton Universitys Wordnet dictionary states that progressive rock art rock are a style of rock music that came out in the 1970s associated with attempts to mix rock with jazz and other forms It also says that it is meant for listening and not dancing 

Examples include Queen The Who Led Zeppelin Pink Floyd David Bowie The Velvet Underground The Beatles Genesis and Yes

Cos fan tutte is an opera by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart It is always known by its Italian title This is probably because it is impossible to find a good translation for the title which means something like They all do it like that or They are all like that Its full title is Cos fan tutte ossia La scuola degli amanti It is an opera buffa The libretto was written by Lorenzo da Ponte Cosi fan tutte is seen in the well loved manga Nodame Cantabile where Saiko Tagaya sings a part from the opera showing agony that Shinichi Chiaki doesnt like her anymore

The opera is often called Cos for short in the English speaking world It is one of the three Mozart operas for which da Ponte wrote the libretto The other two operas on which they worked together were The Marriage of Figaro and Don Giovanni 

Emperor Joseph II suggested to Mozart that he should write the opera The libretto was originally going to be set to music by another composer Antonio Salieri but Salieri only finished parts of the first act and then stopped working at the opera

The first performance was at the Burgtheater in Vienna on January 26 1790

Unlike The Marriage of Figaro the story of this opera did not offend people at the time However during the next two centuries many people thought the story was rather naughty so it was not often performed When it was it was often changed

Today it is one of the most often performed operas in the opera houses throughout the world Although the story is quite silly it has some of Mozarts most beautiful music

The story is about two young ladies who each have a lover Don Alfonso a cynical bachelor makes a bet with the two men that their girl friends would easily fall in love with someone else The two lovers disguise themselves and make love to the other ones girl friend At first the women are not willing but later they are

The story takes place in Naples in the 18th century

Ferrando and Guglielmo are two young officers Ferrando is in engaged to Dorabella and Guglielmo to her sister Fiordiligi When they are talking in a coffee shop they say that their fiances will always be faithful to them Don Alfonso joins the talking and makes a bet with the two officers He says that he can prove that all women are fickle The men take on the bet They pretend they have to go to fight in a war and say a sad goodbye Their boat sails off to sea while Alfonso and the sisters wish them a safe journey

Despina the sisters maid arrives and asks what is wrong Dorabella is desperately sad Despina does not take it seriously and says they should get new lovers Alfonso is worried that Despina will recognize the men through their disguises so he bribes her into helping him win the bet The two men then arrive dressed as Albanians They have moustaches The sisters enter and are worried when they see two strange men in their home The Albanians try to make friends with them but the girls do not want them

The Albanians enter in an uproar pretend to drink arsenic and fall to the ground It seems that a doctor arrives but it is Despina in disguise who draws out the poison with a magnet The two men recover and ask for a kiss They are encouraged to humor the men by Despina and Alfonso but the sisters refuse

In the sisters bedroom Despina is trying to persuade the sisters to love the Albanians After she leaves Dorabella says to Fiordiligi that she does actually fancy the Albanian and the two girls agree that a little flirtation will do no harm and will help them pass the time while they wait for their lovers to return

In the garden Dorabella and the disguised Guglielmo go off together as do the other two They have an awkward conversation and Ferrando departs with Fiordiligi Now alone Guglielmo tries to woo Dorabella She pretends at first that she does not want him but soon gives in She gives him a medallion in exchange for a heart shaped locket

Ferrando is less successful with Fiordiligi so he is angry when he later finds out from Guglielmo that the medallion with his portrait has been so quickly given away to a new lover Guglielmo at first sympathises with Ferrando but then says he is very happy because his girl is faithful

In the sisters room Dorabella tells Fiordiligi about the wrong thing she did Fiordiligi who is now upset decides to go to the army and find her lover Before she can leave though Ferrando arrives and again woos her Fiordiligi finally gives in and falls into his arms Guglielmo is very unhappy while Ferrando reminds Guglielmo about how he had been boasting a short while ago about his girls faithfulness Alfonso seems to have won the bet He tells the men to forgive their fiances After all Cos fan tutte 

The last scene begins as a wedding for both couples the sisters and their Albanian lovers Despina is now disguised as a notary She gets everyone to sign the marriage contract Military music is heard in the distance This means that the officers are returning Alfonso tells the sisters that Ferrando and Guglielmo are on their way to the house The Albanians hurry off to hide They return as themselves saying how much they love the girls Alfonso drops the marriage contract in front of the officers and when they read it they become very angry They then go off and return moments later half in Albanian disguise half as officers Everyone realizes that Despina had been the notary and the sisters now know they have been deceived All is forgiven and everyone sings about accepting life in good times and in bad

A movie that is released direct to video is one which has been released to the public on home video formats before or without being released in movie theaters or broadcast on television The term is also at times used as an insulting term for sequels of movies that are not expected to have financial success

Direct to video releases can occur for several reasons Often a production studio will develop a TV show or movie which is not generally released for several possible reasons poor quality lack of support from a TV network controversial nature or a simple lack of general public interest Studios limited in the annual number of movies they grant cinematic releases to may choose to pull the completed movie from the theaters or never exhibit it in theaters at all Studios then recoup some of their losses through video sales and rentals

In the case of a TV show low ratings may cause a studio to cancel the show possibly after having filmed an entire season and aired some episodes If the show has a considerable fanbase the studio may release unaired episodes on video to recoup losses Clerks The Animated Series and Firefly are examples of canceled shows which were successful cult hits on DVDFactdateFebruary 2007 Occasionally outstanding DVD sales may revive a canceled show as in the case of Family GuyOriginally canceled in 2004the series was revived in 2005 due partly to its excellent DVD sales

Direct to video releases have historically carried a stigma of lower technical or artistic quality than theatrical releases Some studio movies released direct to video are movies which have been completed but were never released This delay often occurs when a studio doubts a movies commercial prospects would justify a full cinema release or because its release window has closed A release window refers to a timely trend or personality and missing that window of opportunity means a movie possibly rushed into production failed to release before the trend faded In film industry slang such movies are referred to as having been vaulted

There is a positive side to direct to video releases They have become something of a lifeline for independent filmmakers and smaller companies

Direct to video releases can be done for movies which cannot be shown theatrically due to controversial content or because the cost involved in a theatrical release is beyond the releasing company Almost all pornographic movies are released direct to video

Animated sequels and movie length episodes of animated series are also often released in this fashion The Walt Disney Company began making sequels of most of its animated movies for video release beginning with The Return of Jafar in 1994 Universal Studios also began their long line of The Land Before Time sequels that same year In 2005 Fox released Stewie Griffin The Untold Story for DVD and Universal Media Disc 

Once in a while a studio that makes a movie that was prepared as a direct to video film and release it theatrically at the last minute due to the success of another movie with a similar subject matter or an ultimate studio decision Dougs 1st Movie is an example of this quickly changed from a DTV to a theatrical release due to the surprise success of The Rugrats Movie

Television spin offs are animated or live action television series or made for TV movies which contain either characters or theme elements from an older series or movie While the most common examples of a television spin off are animated series there are also live action examplesFactdateFebruary 2007

As the DVD format supplants the videocassette companies have increasingly released movies in DVD format rather than VHS causing the term direct to DVD to replace direct to video in some instances However the word video does not necessarily refer to VHS cassettes The new term used is DVDP Such movies can cost as much as 20 million and feature actors like Jean Claude Van Damme and Steven Seagal Salaries for such actors range from 2 to 4 million to 45 to 10 million According to Variety American Pie Band Camp sold a million copies in one week despite retaining only two actors from the original trilogy

In recent years DVD Premieres have become a substantial source of revenue for movie studios DVDPs have collectively grossed over 3 billion over the last few years and have matured enough that DVDP divisions of studios now option their own moviesFactdateFebruary 2007 Studios realized that DVDP movies can be shot on a smaller budget thus allowing studios larger profits with the combined revenues of home video sales and rentalsFactdateFebruary 2007 in addition to licensing movies for television and for distribution abroadFactdateFebruary 2007

Distributing DVDPs is not a practice reserved solely for larger Hollywood studios Several companies such as The Asylum MTI Home Video and York Entertainment distribute DVDPs almost exclusivelyFactdateFebruary 2007 The budgets for movies distributed by these companies are even smaller than those of ones distributed by a larger studio but these companies are still able to profit off their salesFactdateFebruary 2007

In Japan the direct to video movement carries different connotations being a niche product rather than a fallback medium Despite having lower budgets than features intended for theater release Japanese direct to video productions are rarely marred by the poor storyline and lower quality production often associated with the DTV market in the US So called V Cinema has more respect from the public and affection from film directors for the greater creative freedoms the medium allows DTV releases are subject to fewer content restrictions and less creative dictate than other formats

In the case of anime this is called Original Video Animation and their production values usually fall between those of television series and movies They are often used to tell stories too short to fill a full TV season and were particularly common in the early 1990s Sometimes OVAs garner enough interest to justify commissioning a full television series like Tenchi Muyo One Piece and El Hazard

With the advent of the 13 episode season format OVAs are less common now The majority of OVAs released in todays market are usually continuations or reworkings of recently completed TV series For instance the DVD release of a TV series might include a bonus episode that was never broadcast as a sales hook

Admiral Arthur Phillip RN was a British naval officer Phillip was made Governor of New South Wales the first European colony in Australia which is now the city of Sydney

Arthur Phillip was born in Fulham London in 1738 His father was a German born language teacher Jacob Phillip His mother Elizabeth Breach was English and the widow of a navy captain Phillip went to a school for poor boys at the Greenwich Hospital At the age of 13 he joined the merchant navy Phillip joined the Royal Navy at 15 He saw action during the Seven Years War in the Mediterranean at the Battle of Minorca in 1756 In 1762 he was promoted to Lieutenant When the war ended in 1763 he was put on half pay He married and became a farmer in Lyndhurst Hampshire He separated from his wife about six years later

In 1774 Phillip joined the Portuguese Navy as a captain He served in the Spanish Portuguese War 17761777 Phillip took a group of convict ships from Portugal to Brazil This trip was a success because not many people died This may have been one of the reasons Phillip was asked to lead the expedition to Australia In 1778 England was at war again and Phillip was recalled to active service In 1779 he was given his first command the ship Basilisk He was promoted to captain in 1781 and given command of the Ariadne In 1782 he was captain of the Europe with his friend Philip Gidley King as his lieutenant They sailed to India In 1784 he was back on half pay in England He spent time in southern France and in 1786 was doing survey work for the Royal Navy

In October 1786 Phillip was made Governor of New South Wales The British government wanted to start a penal colony on the east coast of Australia Phillip knew about farming and had taken prisoners to Brazil for the Portuguese This made him a good choice to be leader Phillip had a very hard time getting the ships ready for the eight month sea voyage to Australia He had to take everything that the new colony might need Phillip had no real idea of what he might find when he got there There wasnt much money to buy things He wanted people who knew about farming building and making things but this was rejected Most of the 772 convicts were thieves from the city area of London Phillip also took a group of marines and small group of officers who were to help him run the new colony

The First Fleet of 11 ships sailed on 13 May 1787 The first ship HMS Supply reached Botany Bay on 18 January 1788 Phillip soon decided that this site picked by Sir Joseph Banks was not suitable It had poor soil no safe place to leave the ships and no drinking water Phillip decided to go north to Port Jackson On 26 January 1788 this day is now called Australia Day the marines and convicts landed at Sydney Cove It was a successful trip as only 40 convicts had died Phillip named Sydney after Lord Sydney

The first years of the settlement were very hard They only had the supplies they brought with them They had to start growing their own food but the soil around Sydney was poor They didnt know about the climate how much rain or when it would fall for example Very few of the convicts knew anything about farming or growing food They did not have enough farming tools The convicts did not want to be farm workers The colony was in danger of starvation for long time The soldiers who didnt like being given orders in many cases did not think it was their job to make the convicts work Phillip had to put some convicts in charge to get the other convicts working This was the start of the process of making some convicts free which led to the reforms of Lachlan Macquarie after 1811 As Governor of the new settlement Phillip had complete power over the eastern half of Australia

Phillip had respect from the Aboriginal people because he was missing a front tooth This tooth was the same tooth that they knocked out as part of their initiation ceremonies

Phillip soon had problems with the soldiers in the penal colony Life in Sydney was difficult without proper houses and not enough food The officer in charge of the soldiers Major Robert Ross wanted to give up the settlement and go back to England Ross complained about Phillip and wrote letters to the government in England about him The soldiers thought they should be given land and other benefits They thought they should be given more food than the convicts but Phillip believed everyone should have an equal share Ross and the soldiers believed that they were in Australia to protect the settlement from being attacked by other countries They did not think that their work included guarding the convicts Ross who was a soldier did not think he should have to take orders from Phillip who was a navy man In March 1790 Phillip finally sent Ross to be in charge of the colony on Norfolk Island The British government continued to send out convicts there were over 4000 in Sydney by 1792 Food still needed to be brought in as the colony could not yet grow enough Phillip began giving small grants of land to ex convicts to start farms around Parramatta New South Wales

On 11 December 1792 Phillip left to go back to England He needed medical treatment for a pain in his side The pain was kidney pain from eating so much salted foodrp338 He planned to return to Australia but on medical advice he resigned as Governor and stayed in England He married Isabella Whitehead in 1794 He eventually got better and in 1796 returned to the navy as a captain He was in charge of the Alexander and later the 74 gun battleship Swiftshorerp456 In January 1799 he was made a Rear Admiral of the Blue and put in charge of the Sea Fenciblesrp457 Their job was to defend England against Napoleon He retired from active service in 1805 He had a number of strokes which left him partly paralysed He died at Bath on 31 August 1814 after falling from a third floor window He was buried at the church of StNicholas Bathampton

In 2007 Geoffrey Robertson QC found that Phillips remains are no longer in the church It is not known where they are It is believed they were lost while the church was being repaired in the 1970s Robertson believes that it is a insult to Phillip that he wasnt buried in one of Englands cathedrals He wants the remains of Phillip found and brought back to Australia

An edit war happens when people do not agree on an article Instead of discussing it on the talk page they keep changing the article back and forth If this happens an administrator may protect the page for a few days so that no one except administrators can change it This is so that everyone will have a chance to think about the article and come to a consensus or compromise 

It is not a good idea to start or join an edit war The Wikipedian way is to talk about it and have all sides give their opinion If that does not work ask a Wikipedian who has not been working on the article to give their opinion

Because edit wars go against the idea of consensus users who take part in an edit war can be blocked This usually happens if the user reverts three times in a day If someone is in an edit war an administrator can block them even if they have not reverted the page three times If a user is reverting obvious vandalism then the three revert rule may not apply to them

The Halting problem is a computer science problem that poses the question is there a program that can find out if any given program will run forever

For example a program like this

will loop forever but the program

stops very quickly

If we have a function stops that takes a program x and returns true if x stops Then we can make a program like this

This program takes program x and runs for ever if x does not run for ever

But the value of stops depends on what x it is given 

What happens if we run program p on itself p must work on every possible program so it must be able to work on program p so we can say p runs for ever if p does not run for ever 

This is clearly impossible and was used by Alan Turing in 1936 to prove that there is no program that solves the halting problem

The Scottish Fold is a breed of cat Its distinctive ear fold is caused by a particular gene 

First known as Flops for their floppy ears Scottish Fold became the breeds name in 1966 Scottish Folds with long hair are known by a number of names For example it is called the Highland Fold by the ACFA AACE and UFO the Scottish Fold Longhair by the TICA NCFA ACA CCA and CFA and the Longhair Fold by the CFF

The very first Scottish Fold was a long haired barn cat with white fur called Susie She was found in 1961 at a farm near Coupar Angus in Perthshire Scotland Susies ears had an unusual fold in the middle making her look like an owl When Susie had kittens two of them were born with the distinctive folded ears One was owned by William Ross a nearby farmer and cat lover Ross registered the breed with the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy in Great Britain and started to breed Scottish Fold kittens with the help of Pat Turner The breeding program ended up with 76 kittens in the first three years 42 with folded ears They suspected that that the ear mutation was from a dominant allele This means that if one parent has straight ears and one parent has folded ears half of the kittens will be Folds

Susies only fertile offspring was a female Fold named Snooks also white like her mother A second kitten was neutered shortly after birth Three months after Snooks birth Susie was killed by a car All Scottish Fold cats are related to Susie and Snooks This kind of ancestry is very rare even among pedigreed animals

The breed was not accepted for showing in Great Britain and Europe because people thought that they would be overly prone to ear problems such as infection mites and deafness but the Folds were sold in America The breed kept on growing using crosses with British Shorthairs and American Shorthairs Despite the initial concerns the Fold breed has not had the expected mite and infection problems However wax can build up faster than in the ears of other cats

Folds are very popular pets because of their unique look and their reputation as particularly loving companions Fold kittens are usually much more expensive to buy than kittens of more common breeds

All Folds are born with straight unfolded ears Cats that have the Fold gene will start to show the fold before 21 days The first cats only had one fold in their ears With careful breeding breeders have changed the fold to a double or triple fold This causes the ear to lie totally flat against the head

Folds are a medium sized breed of cat They have round bodies round heads and round faces They have big round eyes Their noses are short with a gentle curve They have medium to short sized legs Their heads are curved at the top They have very short necks The eyes have a big gap which gives the Scottish Fold a sweet expression

Scottish Folds can be either long or short haired They may have nearly any coat colour or mix of colours except pointed colours According to cat fancy website Terrific Catscom

Scottish Folds whether with folded ears or with normal ears are normally good natured and calm They can adjust to other animals within a household very well They tend to become very attached to their human caregivers They are by nature quite loving Folds receive high marks for playfulness affection and grooming They are often clever loyal quiet and do well in changing home situations

Folds are also known for sleeping on their backs Scottish Folds normally have soft voices They can give a mix of meows and purrs not found in better known breedsFactdateJuly 2008

Scottish Folds usually live for around 15 years

Scottish folds can easily get polycystic kidney disease osteochondritis and cardiomyopathy

Because the ears fold nearly a month after birth Fold kittens cannot be judged straight away as to their type or value as the animal website PetFindercom says

One special medical problem comes in the Scottish Fold if both parents have folded ears In such a case their kittens will be very likely to have a painful joint disease that can fuse the tail ankles andor knees Scientists think the disease is caused by the dominant gene It is more likely to affect Folds with the gene twice than mixed single with one recessive gene This disease can also affect Scottish Folds with one copy of the gene but usually not as often or as badly For this reason the breed is not accepted by either the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy or the Fdration Internationale Fline This is the reasoning behind the widely held belief that the only ethical manner of breeding Folds is Foldnonfold and not FoldFold

The Scottish Fold is one of the main focuses in the short novel The Cat Who Went to Paris by Peter Gethers The book and its two sequels A Cat Abroad and The Cat Wholl Live Forever The Final Adventures of Norton the Perfect Cat and His Imperfect Human talk about the life of Gethers and his Fold Norton It starts with their first meeting and ends with Nortons death and Gethers life after the loss

Cat guides about the Scottish Fold breed can be found For example Scottish Fold Cats A Complete Pet Owners Manual Guide to Owning a Scottish Fold Cat and Scottish Fold Cats

Ambush marketing is a form of marketing Many events especially in sports have sponsors These sponsors pay money which makes it possible to hold the event In return for this they get publicity and media coverage Ambush marketing is a name given to marketing campaigns that are also done around the event but where no money is paid for the event There are many very important events where one company will pay money to become the exclusive sponsor of the event This creates a problem for other brands or companies These other brands then find ways to promote themselves in connection with the same event They do not pay the sponsorship fee Even if they wanted to they could not because one brand is the exclusive sponsor They also do not break any laws

For the 2011 Rugby World Cup and the 2015 Cricket World Cup New Zealand is planning to make laws to combat ambush marketing according to former Sports Minister Trevor Mallard

Story

Christopher Nolan Comic Book

The Dark Knight is a 2008 superhero movie It was released on July 18 2008 in the United States It stars Christian Bale Heath Ledger Michael Caine and Aaron Eckhart It was directed by Christopher Nolan It is the sequel to the 2005 movie Batman Begins The Dark Knight broke many records on its release

The movie begins with the Joker and his gang of clowns robbing a mob bank The other clowns shoot each other so that there are fewer people so they can get more money per person The manager of the bank takes out his shotgun and shoots one of them The Joker takes off his mask and kills the last clown leaving all the money for himself He then drives away in a school bus

The crime mob in the city is very mad at the Joker for robbing the bank The Joker comes to them and says he wants to kill Batman a person who wears a mask and fights crime Meanwhile Gotham citys District Attorney Harvey Dent tries to shut the mob down by tracking down the money A businessman named Lau finds out about this and takes the money out beforehand and goes to Hong Kong so that he cannot be caught Batman whose real name is Bruce Wayne flies down there himself kidnaps him and takes him back to Gotham City

The Joker says he wants Batman to take his mask off and show the world who he is and that if he does not people will die Commissioner Loeb dies from drinking acid and the judge that was at the mob trials is killed The Joker then hires some men to kidnap police officers and take their uniforms At Loebs funeral Jokers men attempt to shoot the mayor Police officer James Gordon tackles the mayor and is shot and killed

Dent then calls a press conference to ask the people there if he should reveal Batman After they say yes Dent says that he is Batman and has the police arrest him They put him on a truck to send him to jail The Joker and his men drive a truck that badly damages the truck Dent is riding in The real Batman comes in and attempts to save Dent but wrecks his motorcycle like Batpod when the Joker stands there since Batman has a rule that he will not kill anyone Gordon who is revealed to have faked his death arrests the Joker

In jail Batman questions the Joker The Joker eventually reveals that his men captured Rachel Dawes Batmans old childhood friend and Dents girlfriend and Dent He has put them in warehouses far away so that Batman cannot save both of them himself They are near bombs that will go off and kill them The Joker tells Batman where each person is Batman goes to save Dawes while Gordon and his men go to rescue Dent However when Batman gets to Rachels location he only sees Dent because the Joker switched the addresses Batman gets Dent out but the bomb goes off and Dent scars half of his face Gordon is too late to save Dawes

The Joker gets out of jail He gets his phone call and dials a cell phone that is wired to a bomb which blows up the police station Afterwards he visits the hopsital where Dent is staying Dent is driven crazy because of Dawes death The Joker frees Dent and tells him to take revenge Dent goes around flipping coins and decides whether he will kill them or keep them alive He starts going after the various police people who leaked information to the Joker to make it possible for him to kidnap and kill Dawes

The Joker then announces that the city is his The people in charge load up two ferries with people to get them out of the city The Joker has wired both boats with explosives and has given each boat the detonator to the other one saying that he will blow up both boats at midnight if one boat does not blow up the other

Batman finds the Joker in an abandoned building He uses a sonar system to defeat the Jokers men and stops him from destroying both ferries He then leaves the Joker hanging The Joker is very impressed stating that Batman cannot be corrupted into breaking his own rule A SWAT team then captures the Joker

At the end of the movie Batman finds that Dent has kidnapped Gordons family When Batman arrives Dent flips his coin to decide their fates before he can see the result of his next coin flip Batman tackles Dent off the edge of the building letting the vigilante plummet to his death With Dent dead Gordon says that if word gets out that Dent killed all these people all the work he did will have been lost Batman offers to take the blame for all the murders Gordon who is originally against it agrees He destroys the Bat Signal and orders the police to hunt Batman down

Homer only talks about one Gorgon Hesiod names all three Stheno the powerful one Euryalewho could jump far and trouble ridden Medusa the queen According to Hesiod they lived at the edge of the known world in the Atlas Mountains At a later time Libya is also named as their home

With Hellenism came the myth that the Gorgo was a sister of Alexander the Great In this myth she is a neck a water spirit The sailors of each passing boat are asked whether he is still alive If they answer no she takes the boat and the sailors into the water The answer that saves the lives of the semen is Yes and he reigns as a king 

The heads of the Gorgons are often found on shields capes and amulets These were believed to be magic The magic that is used against bad spirits and bad look is known as apotropaic magic

The Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics for the French nomenclature dunits territoriales statistiques is a geocode standard that shows the administrative divisions of countries for statistical purposes It was made by the European Union so it only covers the member states of that union in detail 

A NUTS code begins with a two letter code referencing the country and is identical to the ISO 3166 1 alpha 2 code The subdivision of the country is then displayed by one number A second or third subdivision level is referred to with another number each Each numbering starts with 1 as 0 is used for the upper level In case the subdivision has more than 9 entities capital letters are used to continue the numbering

In addition to the full three levels for the European Union countries all countries have a NUTS code with a two letter code for a continent and two numbers for the country and for the USA Canada and Australia the states provinces and territories are numbered separately

Some are not easily classified for example Gibraltar is listed as being outside the EU with the code EO21 while French Guiana is listed twice once in France as FR930 and once in South America as AS13

NUTS in some ways are similar to the ISO 3166 2 standard as well as the FIPS standard of the United States

There are three levels of NUTS Some with two levels of local administrative units below These were called NUTS levels 4 and 5 until July 2003 but were changed due to official regulations although they are sometimes still described as such Note that not all countries have every level of division depending on their size One of the most extreme cases is Luxembourg which has only LAUs the three NUTS divisions each correspond to the entire country itself

Fire blight is a serious disease of rosaceous plants While Pectobacteria are soft rotting Erwinias are necrogenic bacteria In former classification both genera were included in Erwinia

Michael Ellis DeBakey was an American heart surgeon who was considered to be a very important name in his area He was also among the early names of heart surgery

DeBakey was born as Michel Dabaghi in Lake Charles Louisiana on September 7 1908 His parents were born in Lebanon but moved to America before he was born

DeBakey was involved with medicine from a young age and went to Tulane University He held many medicine related positions during his lifetime

During World War II DeBakey made wartime medicine much better than it used to be He was for the idea of having doctors closer to the areas of battle in war which worked very well and due to that more badly hurt soldiers survived Because of this Mobile Army Surgical Hospitals were made and they were used during the Korean War

In addition to MASH units DeBakey made many important aspects to surgery one of which was the roller pump which DeBakey made at age 23 while still at Tulane University This would later on make open heart surgery able to be done as roller pumps can make blood flow during surgery

DeBakey worked with another important heart surgeon Denton Cooley but they had a disagreement related to the first artifical heart put in a human They did not get along for a long time but they went on good terms in 2007

DeBakey did something rare by still practicing medicine in old age People that he operated on included world leaders such as Russian President Boris Yeltsin

In 2005 a serious heart problem happened to DeBakey Despite him having made the surgery for this problem he at first did not want any surgery As he got in worse condition the surgical team had made the decision to perform surgery anyway Once the surgery was done and he got in better health DeBakey said that he was glad the surgery happened after all

Rapture

A city where the artist would not fear the censor

As time passed the gap between rich and poor increased Frank Fontaine created charity organizations to support the underclass His goal was to use his charity organizations to manipulate the poor He also made a smuggling operation to supply citizens with forbidden items from the surface such as religious material These along with his control of the plasmid industry made him immensely powerful He tried to overthrow Ryan but the revolt was violently crushed and Fontaine was said to be dead Ryan seized control of Fontaines plasmid business Within a few months a new figure named Atlas rose as the leader of the disgruntled lower class On New Years Eve of 1959 Atlas and his ADAM infused followers began a new revolt against Ryan that spread throughout Rapture Ryan in turn began splicing his own forces and his paranoia had reached such a level he was hanging dozens of people mostly innocent in Raptures main square In order to solve ADAM shortages the Little Sisters were mentally conditioned to wander the city and extract ADAM from the dead recycling it into raw ADAM in their stomachs after swallowing it Big Daddies enhanced and mentally sterilized humans in armored diving suits were created by Dr Suchong the scientist behind many plasmids to protect the Little Sisters in their work A drawback of ADAM is that a user must take regular infusions or suffer mental and physical problems As the war hurt production and supply every ADAM user in the city went violently insane By the time the player arrives only a handful of non mutated humans survive in hideouts

At the start of the game player character Jack is a passenger on a plane that goes down in the Atlantic Ocean in 1960 after ordered society in Rapture has collapsed After surfacing Jack finds himself the only survivor of the crash and swims to a nearby lighthouse on an island where he finds a bathysphere which he uses to sink into the ocean and enter the city of Rapture An Irishman named Atlas uses the service radio found in the bathysphere to help Jack in making his way to safety Meanwhile Ryan believing Jack to be an agent of a surface nation uses Raptures automated systems and his pheromone controlled Splicers to try to kill Jack Atlas tells Jack that the only way he can survive is to use the abilities granted by plasmids and that he must kill the Little Sisters to extract their ADAM Overhearing Atlas words Dr Tenenbaum intercepts Jack and urges him to save the Little Sisters instead giving him a plasmid that will displace the embedded sea slugs in each Sister Atlas says his wife and child have been hiding on a submarine and directs Jack towards it Just as Jack and Atlas reach the bay where it is located Ryan has it destroyed an angry Atlas asks Jack to kill Ryan

Eventually after completing tasks like saving an artificial forest from dying and helping an insane artist build his sculpture Jack confronts Ryan in his office who is playing golf Ryan reveals a truth that he has pieced together He is Ryans illegitimate son by an affair with Jasmine Jolene a dancer When Jolene became pregnant with Jack she in desperate need of money had her embryo surgically removed and sold it to the highest bidder She had not realized it was Frank Fontaine who purchased the son leading to her death by an angry Ryan Ryan further reveals that after purchasing Jacks embryo Fontaine made him to obey orders when he is told Would you kindly Jack was then sent to the surface when the war started to put him beyond Ryans reach When the conflict between Fontaine and Ryan reached a stalemate Jack was sent instructions to board a flight with a package and to use its contents a revolver to hijack and crash the plane near the lighthouse enabling him to return to Rapture as a tool of Fontaine Because Jack was Ryans son he could freely use Raptures bathysphere network which had been locked out to everyone except those within Ryans genetic ballpark Finally Ryan has Jack kill him wanting to die on his own terms With Ryans death Jack realizes too late that Atlas has also been using the trigger phrase to control him Atlas reveals himself as Fontaine who faked his death to throw Ryan off his trail and take control of the city leaving Jack at the mercy of the reactivated security systems Dr Tenenbaum and her Little Sisters help Jack escape through the vent system where he falls and loses consciousness

When Jack awakens Dr Tenenbaum has already turned off the trigger phrase When it becomes clear to Fontaine that he is losing control of Jack Fontaine points out the fact that Tenenbaum has survived both World War II as a Holocaust victim and the battle in Rapture hinting that she has a secret agenda of her own With the help of the Little Sisters Jack is able to track down Fontaine Fontaine having been cornered injects himself with huge amounts of ADAM and becomes an monster Jack battles Fontaine eventually beating and allowing the Little Sisters to take the ADAM from Fontaine killing him

Three endings are possible depending on how the player interacted with the Little Sisters all narrated by Dr Tenenbaum If the player harvested no Little Sisters the ending shows five Little Sisters returning to the surface with Jack and living full lives under his care including their graduating from college getting married and having children it ends on a heart warming tone with an elderly Jack surrounded on his deathbed by all five of the adult Little Sisters

If the player harvested all or almost all of the Little Sisters the game ends with Jack turning on the Sisters after defeating Fontaine presumably killing them all and taking their ADAM Tenenbaum narrates what occurred angry Jack and his actions voice thick with anger Later in the second ending a George Washington class submarine carrying nuclear missiles comes across the wreckage of the plane and is suddenly surrounded by bathyspheres containing Splicers The Splicers kill all hands aboard the submarine and take control of it

If the player killed more than one Little Sister but not enough to obtain the previous ending the ending is the same to the second one but the tone of Tenenbaums voice is a sad one as opposed to angry and there are minor dialogue changes

A dilemma is a problem with at least two solutions or possibilities None of the solutions are practically acceptable one in this position has been traditionally described as being impaled on the horns of a dilemma neither horn being comfortable

The dilemma is sometimes used as a rhetorical device in the form you must accept either A or B here A and B would be propositions each leading to some further conclusion Applied in this way it may be a fallacy a false dichotomy

This can be translated informally as one of A or B is known to be true but they both imply C so regardless of the truth values of A and B we can conclude C

Horned dilemmas can present more than two choices The number of choices of Horned dilemmas can be used in their alternative names such as two pronged or dilemma proper or three pronged or trilemma and so on

Constructive dilemmas 

Destructive dilemmas 

In Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance Robert Pirsig outlines possible responses to a dilemma The classical responses are to either choose one of the two horns and refute the other or alternatively to refute both horns by showing that there are additional choices Pirsig then mentions three illogical or rhetorical responses One can throw sand in the bulls eyes by for example questioning the competence of the questioner One can sing the bull to sleep by for example stating that the answer to the question is beyond ones own humble powers and asking the questioner for help Finally one can refuse to enter the arena by for example stating that the question is unanswerable

Dilemma has several meanings

Hapkido is a Korean martial art 

To simple sight it is a combination of techniques of taekwondo with others of aikibudo Its teaching is very much focused to the self defence 

The history of hapkido is enough confused but many resources believe it to be the work of two Koreans Choi Yong Sul and Ji Han Jae When was child Choi had been in Japan where it seems that he worked as servant for the master of Daito ryu Aiki jutsu Sokaku Takeda 

Choi had demonstrated qualities in Daito ryu Aiki jutsu and often in Takeda they sent him in order to face with other persons who performed martial arts From his return to Korea Choi had begun to give classes of martial arts One of his students Ji Han Jae had made Korean traditional techniques of kicks and punches a part of the collection of techniques and in result he gave it the name of hapkido in the 1959 

Besides of Choi and Ji many schools of Korean martial arts have taken part in the development of several techniques that have helped in causing such hapkido as it is known it

Young Hercules is a spin off from Hercules The Legendary Journeys It was aired on FOX Kids Network from September 12 1998 to May 12 1999 It lasted only one season with 50 episodes and starred Ryan Gosling replacing Ian Bohen from the pilot movie as the title character Ian Bohen was offered the part but opted not to spend an entire year in New Zealand where the series would shoot principal photography

The show features the efforts of Ares the god of war played by Kevin Smith who attempts often to destroy his younger half brother to win over Zeus good graces Among his group is his nephew Strife who is the rather weaker member of the team Strifes partner is Discord goddess of retribution who acts more level headed and power hungry than her counterpart on more than one occasion

The storyline follows Hercules as he attends Cheirons Academy to train in the arts of the warrior under the wise headmaster Cheiron the Centaur He makes friends with the future king of Corinth the prince Jason and a thieving former member of a bandit group Iolaus who was sentenced to the training academy as an alternative to prison for his crimes Hercules also meets the academys first female cadet Lilith Other characters of interest include Kora the Inn Keeper who unknown to Hercules and his friends is a devotee of Artemis Goddess of the Hunt As the series develops Kora is revealed to have special powers which allow her to do Artemis bidding There are hints of romance between Hercules and Kora although their friendship keeps it all innocent 

The overall plot of the show is to fill in any of the gaps that may exist between the version of Hercules The Legendary Journeys and the episodes that transpire from his young adult life although very loosely due to its continuity errors by neglecting the Young Hercules movie and the flashback episodes of the fourth season of Hercules

Emmaus is a place in Palestine where two people met Jesus after his Resurrection according to the Gospel of Luke

 That very day two of them were going to a village sixty stadia away from Jerusalem called Emmaus and they were speaking about all the things that had occurred And it happened that while they were speaking and debating Jesus himself drew near and walked with them but their eyes were prevented from recognizing him As they approached the village to which they were going he gave the impression that he was going on farther But they urged him Stay with us for it is nearly evening and the day is declining So he went in to stay with them And it happened that while he was with them at table he took bread said the blessing broke it and gave it to them With that their eyes were opened and they recognized him 

According to a very ancient Christian tradition Emmaus is todays Arab village of Amwas which lies 160 stadia to the West of Jerusalem It can take 6 to 7 hours to come from Jerusalem to Emmaus on foot if one walks across the mountains of Judea The place was called Nicopolis during the 3d 7th centuries AD During Byzantine times two big Basilicas where built here with beautiful mosaics and a baptistry Many manuscripts of the Gospel of Luke have a shorter distance between Jerusalem and Emmaus 60 stadia It is this distance which is found in modern printed Bibles During the Crusader and Renaissance times many Christians traveling to the Holy Land were looking for Emmaus at the distance of 7 miles from Jerusalem Thats why several villages which lie 12 km away from Jerusalem were thought to be Emmaus Even today one can find three Emmaus in the Holy Land Emmaus Nicopolis Qubeibe and Abu Gosh

Greek numerals are a system of representing numbers using letters of the Greek alphabet They are also known by the names Milesian numerals Alexandrian numerals or alphabetic numerals In modern Greece they are still in use for ordinal numbers and in much of the same way that Roman numerals are in the West for ordinary numbers Arabic numerals are used

At first before it was used more the Greek alphabet Linear A and Linear B had used a different system with symbols for 1 10 100 1000 and 10000 operating with the following formula  1  10  100  1000  10000

The earliest alphabet related system of numerals used with the Greek letters was a set of the acrophonic Attic numerals operating much like Roman numerals with the following formula  1  5  10  50  100  500  1000  5000  10000 and  50000 

The acrophonic system was replaced by a new alphabetic system sometimes called the Ionic numeral system from the 4th century BC Each unit was assigned a separate letter each tens a separate letter and each hundreds a separate letter This requires 27 letters so the 24 letter Greek alphabet was extended by using three obsolete letters fau for 6 qoppa for 90 and sampi for 900 To distinguish numerals from letters they are followed by the keraia a symbol similar to an acute sign 

This alphabetic system operates on the additive principle in which the numeric values of the letters are added together to form the total For example 241 is represented as 

To represent numbers from 1000 to 999999 the same letters are reused to serve as thousands tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands A left keraia is put in front of thousands to distinguish them from the standard use For example 2008 is represented as 

In modern Greek uppercase letters are used more as in  Philip II

The Greeks also used the myriad to denote 10000 and the myriad myriad for one hundred million

The system of Hebrew numerals is a quasi decimal alphabetic numeral system using the letters of the Hebrew alphabet

Hercules and Iolaus finally reach his mothers house after a short chat with Alcmene Iolaus invites them both for dinner then leaves Later on that evening while the four are enjoying dinner Ania glimpses a man outside the window and Hercules goes to investigate It is Pithus the man who escaped the creatures at the beginning of the film He explains to Hercules about his village being attacked by the creatures and Hercules agrees to help Iolaus persuades Hercules to let him go along for one last adventure before he is married Hercules reluctantly relents and says that he can come along The three men set off for the village When they arrive Hercules asks where all the women are Pithus tells him that they were stolen by the creatures in the forest Hercules and Iolaus head off to find the beast and rescue the villages women In the forest they are ambushed by the beasts they manage to stave off the attack for a time but Iolaus discovers that the beasts are really women After he chases after one he is fatally injured in the fight and Hercules is captured and taken to the City of Amazons

Hercules is then seen being taken captive by the women He has been stripped of his shirt and chained to a wooden sled assembled by the women that is attached to a horses saddle and being pulled along The women have also cleave gagged his mouth with a black leather strap He is surrounded by women on each side of him and led into a village full of women He is starred at by many of the women A few laugh and taunt him You can hear one of the women saying keep him bound and another saying Men should be seen and not heard in reference to him being gagged In vein Hercules muffles angry speech through the gag Women continue to laugh at him In the village some women are being trained in combat and others are doing chores When he arrives at the end of the village the leader of the Amazon army helps to release him from the sled She tells Hercules If youre looking for men you wont find any Not in the city of amazons Youre the only one and I dont think youll last very long

Hercules stops Hippolyta and realises that she is possessed by Hera She rides off and Hercules goes after her As they fight Hercules tries to get through to Hippolyta telling her that she is stronger than Hera Hercules best her and is about to deal the fatal blow but cannot because it is Hippolytas body and not really Hera Hercules leaves and Hera follows him goading him He tells Hera that if he or Hippolyta have to die then he will give up his life for her saying he could not live his life without her Upon hearing this Hera runs Hippolytas body over the edge of a waterfall killing her

Hercules returns to the City of Amazons and retrieves the candle Hippolyta used to send him back to his childhood Zeus appears and tells him the candle does not work in the way Hercules wants it to Hercules replies that Zeus could make it work that way Zeus tells Hercules that if he did that he would be in big trouble with Hera but Hercules persuades him anyway Zeus blows out the candle and Hercules is taken back to the night of the dinner Ania see Pithus outside the window and Hercules goes to tell him that the village does not need the help of Hercules He explains that all the men need to do is treat the women with respect and things will sort themselves out Pithus returns to the village and when the women come the men sort out the problems that have been occurring Alcmene asks Hercules if there is a woman out there who will make him happy like Ania did for Iolaus Hercules replies that he is sure there is

Savate also known as boxe franaise or French kickboxing is a French martial art  a kind of boxe pieds poings  which use the hands and the feet as weapons and includes elements of Western boxing techniques of grappling and techniques of leg The persons who perform savate are called savateurs or tireurs in case of the men and savateuses in case of the women

Savate carry its name from the French word for old shoe and is now a combination of the French techniques of fighting from beginning of the century XIX In that age savate was a kind of fighting which was common in Paris and in the North of France In the South especially in the port of Marseilles the seamen had developed other style known as jeu marseillais that has obtained a new name chausson Differently in that age in England people treated kicking as non fair in sport or as something what only the cowards used more

The two persons who has been recorded in the history of changing of street combat into modern savate are Michel Casseux and Charles Lecour Casseux opened in 1825 the first building in order to perform and to help in the development of a version of chausson and savate with rules Anyhow such sport still have been limited by its opinion of street combat A student of Casseux Charles Lecour had been exposed to the English art of boxing in the year 1830 and he had felt himself misfit because he used his hands in order to hit the feet of the opponent and to drive them away in this way instead of punching as in boxing By that reason he trained himself in boxing during two years and in 1832 he combined boxing with chausson and savate in order to create such sport of savate boxe franaise as we know it today

Probably the more outstanding recognition as soon as to the esteem of savate came in 1924 when had been included as sport of exhibition in the Olympic Games of Paris In spite of its roots savate is a sport relatively safe in order to learn According to USA Savate savate is in the lower places of injuries when is compared with the soccer football hockey gymnastics basketball baseball and speed skating

At present savate is performed in all the world by interested people from Australia to United States and from Finlandia to the United Kingdom Many lands as is case of United States has national federations very interested for helping in the development of this sport

The modern savate gives three levels of competition assault precombat and combat In assault the competitors need to be concentrated on the technique during they are trying make contact refrees punish with penatlties the usage of excessive force Precombat permits fighting without thoughtlessness in the force always and when the fighters wear protection as helmets and shin protectors Combat the level more intensified is similar to the precombat but the usage objects of protection is prohibited

Many martial arts have systems of judgment of level of the persons who perform them as the colour of the belts in the karate In the same way savate uses different colours in the gloves in order to show the level of a fighter although on the contrary that disciplines as the judo or the capoeira where the fighters obtain new belts in each promotion every fighter can use the same pair of gloves in several promotions The beginners begin without colour and the different exams of promotion permit them to be promoted to blue green red white and yellow in that order The competition is restricted for the red gloves and higher each federation has the possibility to establish the conditions as little as possible for teaching this sport In France it is necessary to have the yellow glove in order to being able to gain the degree of instructor and the silver glove in his technical category in order to obtain the title of teacher In other lands as Mexico all technical degrees from the green require an evaluation on subjects of helping in teaching in order to being able to increase the development of that art

Cerium is a chemical element with an atomic number of 58 This means that the nucleus of Cerium has 58 protons in it The atomic mass of Cerium is 14012 The Chemical symbol of Cerium is Ce and it is a member of the Lanthanide group

Cerium is a grey shiny or lustrous metal At room temperature Cerium is a solid It melts and becomes a liquid at 798oC and boils and becomes a gas at 3424oC 00046 of the Earths crust is Cerium which means that it is quite common  more common than Tin and Lead and nearly as common as zinc

Cerium was first found in Sweden in 1803 by Berzelius and Hisinger and Klaproth in Germany Because it is very reactive it was not purified until 1875 in Washington DC Cerium was named after the asteroid or minor planet Ceres which was first seen two years earlier in 1801

Cerium is not often used as a metal since it quickly reacts with the air and tarnishes Its most common use is as the flint in a lighter because it easily produces a spark when it is struck with another metal Cerium is sometimes used in alloys because it often makes the alloy more heat resistant Cerium is also used in special glass ceramics and self cleaning ovens

Cerium reacts in two ways to produce Cerous compounds or salts and Ceric compounds Cerous salts have an oxidation number of 3 and ceric salts have an oxidation of 4

Cerium has a large number of isotopes Four of them are found in nature instead of having to be made 

Cerium 140 and Cerium 142 are the most common The average of the weights of each isotope is what give Cerium its Atomic Mass of 14012

The 1812 Overture was written by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky as Op 49 to remember Russias 1812 defence against Napoleons advancing Grande Arme at the Battle of Borodino during the French invasion of Russia The Overture was first presented to the public in the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow on August 20 1882 The overture is best known for its climactic volley of cannon fire and ringing chimes While this piece has no historical connection with United States history it is often used at Fourth of July celebrations

The 1812 Overture is written for an orchestra which uses following music instruments

Sixteen cannon shots are written into the score of the Overture The Overture begins with the plaintive Russian Orthodox Troparion of the Holy Cross played by eight cellos and four violas The piece moves through a mixture of pastoral and militant themes The Overture includes the Russian folk dance At the Gate at my Gate At the turning point of the invasion the Battle of Borodino the score calls for five Russian cannon shots A descending string passage represents the following retreat of the French forces followed by victory bells and a triumphant repetition of God Preserve Thy People as Moscow burns to deny winter quarters to the French A musical chase scene appears Out of it the anthem God Save the Tsar appears The overture uses counterpoint to reinforce the appearance of the leitmotif that represents the Russian forces throughout the song

There are several recordings of the overture in a transcription by American conductor Igor Buketoff with the following changes and additions

Lincoronazione di Poppea is an opera in three acts by Claudio Monteverdi It was the last opera that Monteverdi composed The libretto is by Giovanni Francesco Busenello The first performance was in the Teatro Santi Giovanni e Paolo Venice in 1642

Most operas in the early 17th century were about mythological stories or stories from the Christian religion This story however is about something that happened in the history of ancient Rome It is about the evil emperor Nero and how he married Poppea The gods still play a part in the opera especially Cupid

Although the opera is called The Coronation of Poppea we do not actually see any coronation ceremony

Monteverdi was an experienced composer when he wrote this and the opera has some of his best music The orchestra is only a small group of instruments strings recorders cornetts percussion harp lutes and gambas The music does not divide sharply between recitative and aria but flows gently from one type to the other

When listening to this opera it is important to remember that in the 17th century men often sang womens parts and women sang mens parts A part such as Nero would have been sung by a castrato Nowadays it can either be sung by a countertenor or a mezzo soprano There are scenes in this opera where the actors disguise themselves as the opposite sex In the 17th century opera audiences did not find anything unusual about a man pretending to be a woman pretending to be a man or the other way round

The duet between Nero and Poppea at the end of the opera may have been written by another composer 

The goddesses Fortune and Virtue are having an argument They are being nasty to one another each one is saying that she is better and more powerful than the other Cupid comes in and says that he is even greater than they are and that he rules both of them Fortune and Virtue do not dare to disagree with him

Otho who is Poppeas lover returns to his house and finds that the emperor Nero is in his house spending the night with Poppea Neros guards have surrounded the house Nero tells Poppea he has to go now but that he loves her and will come back very soon When he is gone Arnalta Poppeas nurse warns her that her affair with Nero will bring trouble Octavia Neros wife is very sad that her husband is having an affair with someone else and hopes that the gods will punish him Her nurse comforts her saying that she ought to find herself a new lover to make Nero cross but Octavia has too much honour to do such a thing The philosopher Seneca tells her that she should just accept her fate The page boy tells the philosopher he is stupid

Nero tells Seneca that he is going to get rid of his wife and marry Poppea Seneca warns Nero that the people will not like this but Nero does not care He is emperor and can do what he likes Nero tells Poppea that he loves her so much that he wants to make her empress Poppea says to Nero that Seneca believes that Nero is only powerful because he can guide him Nero immediately believes her and says Seneca should be killed Otho has been watching this scene He goes to Poppea and tries to get her love back but Poppea says she belongs to Nero now Otho realizes that Poppea just wants power and he knows that Nero will order him to be killed when he finds out that he used to be Poppeas lover so he decides he will have to kill Poppea

Otho goes to Drusilla who is in love with him He tells her that he loves her but he quietly says that Poppea is still in his heart

The god Mercury warns Seneca that he is going to die Seneca is quite happy with the news because it will mean that he will live with the gods in heaven Liberto a messenger comes to tell Seneca that Nero is going to have him killed He is surprised when Seneca already knows There is a short scene in which the Page broken wikt linkflirtflirts with the Lady in Waiting Nero with his friend Lucan sings in praise of Poppea

Octavia tells Otho to disguise himself in womans clothes and to go and kill Poppea She says that he will tell Nero bad things about him if he doesnt There is a comic scene between the Page and the Nurse Drusilla lets Otho borrow her clothes to disguise himself Poppea is in her garden being lulled to sleep by Arnalta Cupid sings a song promising to protect her When Otho disguised as Drusilla comes to kill her Cupid stops him 

Drusilla is happy because her rival is going to die The guards immediately arrest her thinking that she tried to kill Poppea Drusilla realizes she was stupid to lend Otho her clothes She tells Nero that she is guilty Otho then speaks and tells Nero what happened Nero punishes him by telling him to leave Rome and go and live in a faraway wilderness Nero also sends Octavia away from Rome He says she must be put in a boat and left to the mercy of the winds Octavia sings a farewell song to Rome Arnalta sings a comic song about how important he now is as the empresss nurse The opera finishes with a beautiful love duet for Nero and Poppea

This is a chronological list of pay per views promoted by World Wrestling Entertainment Each month WWE holds one or two annual pay per view events One event is usually three hours long and features six to twelve matches Pay per view events are a big part of how the WWE earns money

Many people believe wrongly that the first WWE then known as the World Wrestling Federation pay per view was November 1985s The Wrestling Classic This was a tournament held at the Rosemont Horizon near Chicago The first WrestleMania event in March of the same year was on pay per view in some areas The first two WrestleManias earned much money After WrestleMania III became one of the best event in wrestling history the WWF then decided to have more pay per views 

The first Survivor Series event took place on November 29 1987 It was shown at the same time as NWAs Starrcade which was thought to be the biggest yearly event for NWA The WWF informed cable companies that if they were showing Starrcade they would not be allowed to show future WWF events Most of companies showed Survivor Series Because of this Starrcade did not make much money that year This is thought to be the start for many problems for Jim Crockett Promotions

The first Royal Rumble in January 1988 was shown on the USA Network It had the highest rating in the networks history up until that time The event became a pay per view the next year

The first SummerSlam was held in Madison Square Garden in August 1988 These four events  the Royal Rumble in January WrestleMania in March or April SummerSlam in August and Survivor Series in November  were the only annual pay per view offerings from the WWF until 1995 After World Championship Wrestling started showing more pay per views the WWF increased the number of pay per views it showed At first the WWF used the name In Your House for its new shows Beginning in 1996 it began using other names along with the In Your House name This was done to avoid confusion By the end of February of 1999 the In Your House name was no longer used

Both companies increased the number of pay per views until they each had one pay per view event each month From the late 90s until 2003 World Wrestling Entertainment had a once a month pay per view schedule The pay per view events in the United States can be bought through iN DEMAND Dish Network or DirecTV

Up until 2003 the WWE ran two pay per views a year which were only shown in the United Kingdom After the brand extension they stopped doing these two events Instead of the UK events they did international tours which were taped for television Currently WWE has the WrestleMania Revenge tour after WrestleMania at the beginning of the year and the Survivor Series tour at the end of the year in the UK Each includes a RAW SmackDown and an ECW taping 

In Australia WWEs pay per views are shown on Main Event In the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland some pay per views are shown on Sky Sports 1 and others on Sky Box Office

Gabrielle is a fictional character in Xena Warrior Princess played by Rene OConnor She is referred to by fans as the Battling Bard of Potidaea Her trademark weapons are the Amazon fighting staff and the sai

Rene OConnor was chosen to play the role after she impressed producers with her role in the Hercules television movie The Lost Kingdom

Her name is the feminine of Gabriel from the Hebrew which means messenger of God That is the name of the chief of Archangels and during the show Gabrielle becomes an Archangel While Gabrielle is typically a French given name it has a grammatically correct Greek feminine ending and contains no anti Greek sounds Also the Greek version of Gabrielle is 

In the two musical episodes Gabrielles singing voice was provided by Susan Wood

Gabrielle joins Xena in the first episode as her traveling partner and sidekick and remains with her until the end of the show It is this partnership which forms the premise of the show

When they meet Gabrielle is a young innocent and idealistic scholar She studies maps and the stars reads mythology writes stories and dreams of traveling beyond her village to see the world She wants to be a traveling bard She also has strong ethical beliefs She believes in the essential goodness of every person and is willing to put her life on the line for that

In stark contrast Xena is cynical hard and world weary Xena has killed thousands of people and overcome with guilt is returning home perhaps to give up her own life But on seeing Gabrielles willingness to sacrifice herself for others she is inspired to spend the rest of her life redeeming herself and this becomes the driving theme throughout the show Together they embark on an arduous spirited adventure lasting over 30 years Gabrielle acts as Xenas guiding light keeping her dark memories at bay and reminding her of the goodness that she had once possessed In return Xena provides Gabrielle with travel and great adventures teaches her about survival and the fighting arts and acts as her protector both physically and spiritually

Gabrielles story is one of growing up Life with Xena is extreme in many ways and traveling together often proves more dangerous than she had initially bargained for Their friendship grows quickly and they both overcome doubts grief loss of hope and even death As a burgeoning warrior Gabrielle becomes more useful to Xena in combat and is increasingly treated as an equal Eventually they learn that their destiny is woven together in this and all future lives

By the end of the series when Xena dies and in the process finally redeems herself Gabrielle has been transformed into a tough and courageous leader a woman of the world and a great warrior in her own right

When Gabrielle first meets the Warrior Princess Xena she is a farm girl living in the village of Potidaea She and her sister Lila along with several other village girls have been kidnapped by the men of the warlord Draco to be sold as slaves Xena intervenes and rescues them Awed by her fighting skills Gabrielle decides that she wants to become a warrior too She also wants to avoid the marriage that her parents Herodotus and Hecuba have arranged for her with her childhood friend Perdicas Gabrielle insists on following an initially reluctant Xena on the road The two women soon develop a strong bond of love and friendship Over the six years of the series Gabrielle evolves from a naive idealistic teenager into a fully fledged but deeply conflicted warrior fighting alongside Xena 

Gabrielle becomes an Amazon when she defends a dying Amazon Princess during an ambush Before she dies the Princess Terreis passes her right of caste to Gabrielle and Gabrielle inherits her rank and possessions This leaves Gabrielle the heiress presumptive to the Amazon Queen Melosa Melosas adopted daughter Velasca becomes a rival for the position of Queen of the Amazons after Melosas death but Velascas schemes are foiled by Xena and Gabrielle As Gabrielle wishes to travel with Xena rather than rule the Amazons she appoints her friend Ephiny to act as Amazon Queen in her place

Gabrielle learns how to fight with a fighting staff from the Amazons With Xenas encouragement she develops a philosophy of fighting for the Greater Good without killing  

About a year after meeting Xena Gabrielle encounters Perdicas again and decides to marry him The morning after their wedding he is murdered by Xenas nemesis Callisto Gabrielles grief and anger tests her ideals of reverence for life but she nonetheless resists the impulse to kill Callisto During this period Gabrielles strong commitment to peacemaking and compassion often serves as a counterbalance to Xenas warrior nature  

When helping to defend Britannia against Caesar Gabrielle comes into contact with an evil cult that tricks her into killing one of its priestesses Meridian The loss of Gabrielles blood innocence enables the evil god Dahak to impregnate her After a pregnancy that lasts only a few days Gabrielle gives birth to a girl she names Hope After becoming convinced that the baby is simply a vessel for Dahak Xena wants to kill Hope Gabrielle manages to save her daughter by putting her in a basket and sending her downriver  

Several months later Gabrielle finds Hope again now looking like a nine year old and already in the process of helping her father Dahak implement his plan to take over the world Hope allies herself with Xenas enemy Callisto In revenge for Xenas attempt to kill her as a baby Hope murders Xenas son Solan This forces Gabrielle to accept that Hope is indeed evil She kills her daughter by giving her poison an act that continues to haunt Gabrielle throughout the series She holds herself responsible for Solans death as well as for betraying Xena a second time even after reconciliation with Xena is effected through their musical journey in the Land of Illusia When she once again encounters Hope who was saved from the funeral pyre by her father Gabrielle sacrifices herself to save Xena by jumping into a lava pit and taking Hope with her Gabrielle mysteriously survives the fall and is later reunited with Xena It is later revealed that Ares saved Gabrielle with plans to use her as a bargaining chip against Xena  

After her first kill and the traumatic events with Hope that followed it Gabrielle temporarily embraces complete pacifism as an alternative to fighting by Xenas side She and Xena travel barefoot on pilgrimage to India where they encounter a series of false prophets and gurus as well as a genuine healer and teacher Eli Eli claims to have found enlightenment and Gabrielle becomes interested in his philosophy of non violence and inner peace which he calls the Way of Love Gabrielle attempts to follow Elis way and throws away her staff under his influence However when Xena is in the midst of a battle with the Romans in an effort to rescue Gabrielle Eli and a group of prisoners Callisto uses Xenas own chakram against her breaking her back Gabrielle chooses to fight to save Xena and even kills some of the soldiers herself Before their crucifixion Gabrielle tells Xena that she had chosen The Way of Friendship

After being crucified Gabrielle and Xena ascend into Heaven but are soon ambushed by demons The demons are able to take Gabrielle to Hell where she comes face to face with the demonic form of Callisto Xena and a group of Archangels are able to rescue Gabrielle from Hell before Gabrielle can fall to the darkness She then learns that Xena has taken Callistos place in Hell She eventually forgives Callisto for the murder of Perdicas and that act of forgiveness grants her the right to join the Archangels in battle During her fight with the demon Xena they are restored to life by Eli

At this time Gabrielle accepts her new path as a warrior and acquires a pair of sai which become her signature weapon thereafter Xenas pregnancy revealed shortly after the duos return to life further forces Gabrielle to fight and sometimes protect Xena On two occasions the god of war Ares impressed by Gabrielles new warrior skills tries to recruit her to his side but Gabrielle always resists

Gabrielle and Xena sleep in an ice cave for 25 years after Ares places them there because he mistakenly believes they are dead After waking up Gabrielle discovers that her parents have been killed by the North African warlord Gurkhan who has also kidnapped her niece Sara for his harem Around this time Gabrielle develops a close friendship with Joxers eldest son Virgil who shares many of her traits as a bard and warrior Gabrielle struggles with the issue of seeking vengeance against Gurkhan She is often troubled by her role as a warrior particularly when she has to lead her Amazon tribe into a high casualty battle against a superior army led by the demigod Bellerophon to rescue a fellow Amazon queen Despite the success of the mission Gabrielle tells Xena With each battle I lose more of myself

The series final scene finds her on a ship headed to Egypt where she intends to continue the fight for the Greater Good with Xena accompanying her in spirit

Gabrielle starts the series as a young girl who more or less stands behind Xena and relies on Xena to protect her In the course of 10 episodes she acquires a fighting staff from the Greek Amazons and is a decent fighter with it shortly after Another 10 episodes later she displays immensely impressive skills with the staff taking on numerous soldiers single handedly in the attempts to rescue Xenas presumably dead body Probably what is most impressive is that two episodes later she blocks an arrow in flight with her staff

As time goes on we see Gabrielle not only improve with her abilities with the staff but as a total warrior as well As she adds kicks and minor acrobatics to her fighting rolling over a hunched over opponent before proceeding to beat them  

While in India Gabrielle is also thrown through time by a Darsham to save Xenas soul It is said that their souls are together throughout time In this next life Xena is the Mother of Peace Arminestra and Gabrielle is Shakti a Warrior Prince of India At the end of season 4 however is when Gabrielle shows a leap in her warrior abilities After months of following her path of the Way of Love Gabrielle picks up the sword of a paralyzed Xena and fights off a large group Roman soldiers with incredible skill This however sparked concern among fans who wondered how Gabrielle knew how to use a sword so well One theory that could make sense is that in her time as a complete non violent person Gabrielle as an experienced fighter no longer had to focus on her fighting and instead watched as Xena fought At that point as a seasoned fighter Gabrielle is able to grow in a dramatic way through observation 

By season 5 we see Gabrielle reach an undisputed status as a warrior fighting with her sai incorporating more acrobatic ability even performing a wall run and back flip Other than sai and sometimes a new casual staff she can use a large array of weapons with proficiency Gabrielle also fights against warriors with notable skill she defeats the warrior Mavican and stands against Ares and Hades in battle for a rather long period before they defeat her She also fights in a sword duel with Brutus Caesars former right hand and one of leaders of Rome eventually killing him As previously mentioned Gabrielles abilities become noticed by the God of War who seeks her out as his new protge It is mentioned later by Gabrielle and numerous others that Xena trained her throughout the years although there have only been a few episodes that actually show Xena giving her any sort of martial arts training  One of Gabrielles biggest fights of the season is her fight against fellow Amazon queen Varia They fight in an enclosed arena in a match in which Eves life is at stake and they appeared to be at a stand off before she is beaten by Varia Gabrielle takes the loss graciously and continues to grow in skill over the season regaining the title of supreme Amazon queen very soon

Gabrielles bardic skills appear to be natural and self taught In the opening episode she displays a remarkable ability to talk her way out of fearsome or difficult situations she talks a cyclops out of eating her and makes an ally of him talks an old man into giving her a lift talks a violent crowd out of killing Xena and talks her way into joining Xena as her traveling partner

Besides her persuasive ability she also reads and writes  rare skills for that time loves to tell stories and has some musical ability As she travels with Xena she records their adventures on a series of scrolls with an eye for flair and drama Occasionally her tendency to exaggerate and glamorize the facts gets her into trouble She is also shown telling stories for money in an inn In other episodes she wins a place in the Athens City Academy for the Performing Bards is a famous playwright is a theatrical director plays the pan pipes with considerable skill and is the only person able to recite a magical scroll with the correct accents

Despite Gabrielles ascendancy as a warrior her role as a bard remains important About a year into her travels with Xena her scrolls about Xenas exploits begin to gain popularity apparently helping according to Ares turn Xena into a legend After their 25 year sleep Gabrielle finds out that her stories had been read as far away as North Africa where they were popular among nomad tribes

According to an episode set in modern times Gabrielles scrolls were preserved for thousands of years and later discovered by modern archeologists They found their way to Hollywood where they formed the basis of the television series

Throughout the course of the series Gabrielle has a total of 7 regular costumes which become smaller more conducive to her fighting style as the show progresses and more showing what the fans call Fab Gab AbsFactdateApril 2008

Along with Xena occasionally Gabrielle is known to be credited with a variety of discoveries and inventions

In September 10 2005 a month after Eris discovery its moon was discovered by the adaptive optics team at the Keck telescopes in Hawaii who was carrying out observations of the four brightest Kuiper belt objects In addition to its provisional designation mpm S2005 1 its discoverers informally nicknamed it Gabrielle while Eris was nicknamed Xena In 2006 the International Astronomical Union has instead given its official name Dysnomia which retains a reference to Xena as the English translation of Dysnomia Lawless echoes the name of actress Lucy Lawless

The Fox and the Hound is a 1981 animated movie produced by Walt Disney Productions first released to movie theaters in the United States on July 10 1981 The 24th movie in the list of Disney animated movies the movie is about two unlikely friends a red fox and a hound dog who have trouble preserving their friendship because of their emerging instincts

In the movie the two main characters Tod and Copper become such good friends and play together However as they grow up they become enemies because real hounds hunt foxes for food

Coppers owner Amos Slade Coppers owner Amos Slade wants to kill Tod and hell do anything to get him He even has his other dog Chief to help him As Tod and Copper get older they start to become more of enemies They face problems with this friendship and Copper even turns on his best friend when Chief the older dog and guardian of Copper is nearly killed on a train and Copper thinks it was Tod

The story was loosely based on Daniel P Mannixs 1967 book with the same name The book had a more realistic story it dealt with the quest of a hunter and his dog Copper to shoot Tod after he killed the hunters new dog Chief The novel was mainly about Tods life in the woods While he was raised by humans he was not childhood friends with Copper and none of the animals spoke The story was changed to make it more suitable for a family movie instead of a story about the life and death of a fox it became a parable about how society determines our roles despite our better impulses

The Fox and the Hound was the last movie which was worked on with animation legends like Frank Thomas and Oillie Johnston two members of Walt Disneys original nine old men whom also worked on this movie with it being the last movie for both as well as the first movie for future Disney leaders like Tim Burton Brad Bird and Glen Keane who animated the bear in this movie and later worked on other animated movies like The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast in which he designed the beast It was also the final Disney movie to have all the credits in the title sequence instead of having end credits and have the words The End A Walt Disney Production at the end of the movie the last Disney animated movie to use the Buena Vista logo and the last Disney movie in which Don Bluth was involved in its production

The movie stars the voices of Kurt Russell Mickey Rooney Pearl Bailey Pat Buttram Sandy Duncan Richard Bakalyan Paul Winchell Jack Albertson Jeanette Nolan John Fiedler John McIntire Keith Mitchell and Corey Feldman A direct to video midquel The Fox and the Hound 2 was released to DVD on December 12 2006

The movie begins when a baby fox is orphaned after his mama is killed by hunters An owl named Big Mama and her two bird friends a sparrow named Dinky and a woodpecker named Boomer arrange for him to be adopted by a widow named Widow Tweed She names him Tod since he reminds her of a toddler

Meanwhile Widows neighbor a hunter named Amos Slade brings home a young hound puppy named Copper and introduces him to his hunting dog Chief Tod and Copper become playmates and vow to remain friends forever

Amos Slade sometimes gets angry at Copper for always running off to play and puts a leash on him While playing with Copper at his home Tod awakens Chief Amos and Chief chase him until they are stopped by Widow

After an argument Amos says that he wants to kill Tod and hell do anything to get him When hunting season comes he takes the dogs and goes on a hunting trip Meanwhile Big Mama tells Tod that his friendship with Copper cannot continue as they are natural enemies but Tod does not want to believe her

Months pass and Tod and Copper are now adults On the night when Copper returns Tod comes and asks if they are still friends Copper says that those days are over and that Im a hunting dog now

Copper warns Tod that Chief will wake up but Tod says that Chief does not worry him Chief wakes up anyway and alerts Amos Slade They chase Tod and Copper finds him Copper lets Tod go and leads Chief and Amos to go a different way then to Tod and Tod tries to escape on a railroad track But Chief finds him and chases Tod and when a moving train suddenley comes fast Tod is able to avoid the train by ducking under the vechile and the train comes and hits Chief and Chief being knocked off the bridge is now struck and wounded Copper and Amos blame Tod for Chiefs accident and they swear vengeance to get them if its the last thing they do

Widow knows that Tod is no longer safe with her and leaves him in a game preserve Big Mama introduces him to a lady fox named Vixey where things seem perfect but Amos and Copper tresspass into the preserve and hunt the two foxes But while Amos and Copper are trying to find Tod and Vixey they accidently provoke an attack from a bear which suddenley attacks them Amos trips and gets caught in one of his own traps and his gun falls just out of his reach and Copper tries to fight the bear but he is no match for him in a very vicious fight and Copper is nearly killed and soon overwhelmed by the bear Against his better judgement Tod quickly intervenes to save his friend He battles the much larger bear and ends luring him up onto a fallen trunk which breaks and sends the two both falling down a waterfall

Copper approaches Tod as he lies in the lake below when Amos appears ready to fire at the fox Copper interposes his body in front of Tod and refuses to move away Amos finally lowers his gun and leaves with Copper but not before the two former adversaries share one last smile before parting At home Widow nurses Amos back to health while the dogs rest Copper before resting smiles as he remembers the day when he became friends with Tod On a hill Vixey joins Tod as he looks down on the homes of Copper and Widow

Baphomet is a name of unestablished origin It first appeared in trial transcripts during the inquisition of the Knights Templar in the early 1300s Some modern scholars believe the name to have been an Old French corruption and misspelling of the name Mahomet Nowadays it is generally viewed as a symbol of the Devil

In the middle ages the Templar were accused of heresy such as denying Jesus Christ and spitting on the cross They also supposedly worshiped an icon called Bafomet Beyond this little is known about the origins of the Baphomet

In the 1800s magician Eliphas Levi interpreted Baphomet as an occult symbol representing perfection or the union of opposites to create divine harmony To illustrate his point he depicted the entity as a goat headed androgyne with wings female breasts a rod between its legs and a flaming torch between its horns

This imagery was soon used by people who thought it was Satanic notably in anti Freemasonry tracts where some writers accused Masons of worshiping Baphomet These rumors have never been proven and are generally regarded as false although the theory of a Satanic Masonry is still perpetuated by many evangelical Christians  

In modern times Baphomet has been adapted as a symbol by occultists and Satanists A related symbol is the Sigil of Baphomet which is a goats head drawn inside a five pointed star It has become a common icon among heavy metal bands like Slayer and Venom The Sigil of Baphomet is also the official logo of the Church of Satan

The Propdia is the first of three parts of the Encyclopaedia Britannica the other two being the 12 volume Micropdia and the 17 volume Macropdia The Propdia is supposed to be a book that organizes the things in the Britannica and a guideline to the index of the other two parts It was introduced in 1974 with the 15th edition of the encyclopedia to replace the index but when many people complained Britannica put the index back in two books in 1985 The core of the Propdia is its Outline of Knowledge which is supposed to give people a classification of what we know but the Propdia also has some parts listing the staff members advisors and contributors to all three parts of the Britannica 

The Propaedia can be used by a student who wants to know what there is to know before even finding out about it Once the student finds out what he needs to know he will then find out about the thing itself

The Outline has ten Parts each with an essay to introduce the part Below is the table of the ten parts 

The 17 book Macropdia is the third part of the Encyclopdia Britannica and the other two parts are the 12 book Micropdia and the 1 book Propdia The name comes from the word macro and encyclopaedia Macro means big and so the Macropaedia is a big encyclopedia The Macropaedia has articles that are very detailed but one article is usually about a very large topic It is the opposite of the Micropaedia which has articles that are short 

The Macropdia was introduced in the 15th edition of the Britannica in 1974 with 19 book having 4207 articles In 1985 these articles were combined and made smaller into 17 books with about 700 articles which can be as short as 2 pages and as long as 310 pages The longest article on the United States was from the combining of the 50 articles on each state 

Since it was created it has not stayed the same New articles are always being added older articles can be split shortened merged or even deleted 

The 12 book Micropdia is one of the three parts of the 15th edition of Encyclopdia Britannica and the other two being the one book Propdia and the 17 book Macropdia The name comes from the word micro and encyclopaedia Micro means small and so the Micropaedia is a small encyclopedia The Micropaedia has articles that are very short the articles are found in small strips It is the opposite of the Macropaedia which has articles that are very long

The Micropdia was introduced in 1974 with 10 books having 102214 short articles all of them are less than 750 words In the 15th edition many articles were put together with about only 65000 articles in 12 volumes In general the 750 word limit is still used and most articles are only 1 2 paragraphs however a few longer articles can be found in the 2007 Micropdia such as the Internet ones which takes up a full page

With some exceptions the 65000 articles of the Micropdia have no bibliographies and no named contributors It is supposed to be for fast checking to know only the main things about the topic and as a guide to the 700 longer articles of the Macropdia People use it to know just a little but the Macropaedia is used to know in detail

Fritz Wunderlich was a German tenor He was one of the great singers of his time famous both as an opera singer and as a recitalist singing Lieder

Wunderlich came from a musical family His mother was a violinist and his father was a choir master The family did not find it easy to make a living especially after Fritzs father committed suicide when Fritz was five years old As a young man Wunderlich worked in a bakery People heard him singing while he worked and he was persuaded to study music He got a scholarship to study at the Freiburg College of Music where he studied French horn and singing

Wunderlich soon became known as a brilliant young tenor He sang several roles in Mozarts operas and gradually learned roles in many other operas including Verdis Rigoletto and Don Carlo There is an excellent recording of Mozarts Magic Flute in which Wunderlich sings the part of the Prince Tamino and the famous baritone Dietrich Fischer Dieskau sings the part of Papageno the birdcatcher

Wunderlich had a lovely clear voice which was excellent for German Lieder He sang the great songs of Schubert and Schumann especially Schumanns Dichterliebe song cycle

Wunderlich was becoming world famous when he died from an accident he fell down the stairs of a friends hunting house and died just before his 36th birthday 

Half of a Yellow Sun is a book that was written by Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie in 2006 and was published by KnopfAnchor The book tells the story of two sisters Olanna and Kainene during the Biafran War

Half of a Yellow Sun won the 2007 Orange Prize for Fiction in the women only section The award is given annually for the best original full length book Adichie gained 30000 as a reward for winning the prize Purple Hibiscus her first novel made the Orange Prize shortlist in 2004 and because of the success of Half a Yellow Sun critics have said that Adichie may have even more success in the future

The book got good reviews from critics and it was included in The New York Times 100 Most Notable Books of the Year as well as winning the Orange Prize In a review for The Seattle Times Mary Brennan talks about the book as A sweeping story that provides both a harrowing history lesson and an engagingly human narrative The Guardians Kate Kellaway said An immense achievement Half of a Yellow Sun has a ramshackle freedom and exuberant ambition after reading the book The New York Times did a review of the book saying some good and some bad things about the book

The Nigerian Civil War began on July 6 1967 and lasted until January 15 1970 The war began because of political struggles caused by the numerous attempts to secede from the southeastern provinces of Nigeria and create the Republic of Biafra Political conflict between the Igbos Yorubas and the Hausa Fulani ended up with two military coups The Igbo tried to leave Nigeria to become the Republic of Biafra but did not have very much support From 1968 onward the war was mostly a tie with Nigerian forces unable to get an advantage over the Republic of Biafra Many people died in the war and even today there is still anger between the different ethnic and religious groups of Nigeria

The story in Half of a Yellow Sun is centered around the war The author has stated that many of the issues that caused the war remain today She also said that the war is very talked about in uninformed and unimaginative ways and that the war is as important to the people today as it was in her book Because none of the major political events were changed in the book Adichie said that the book had emotional truth and that the book showed the war had a large impact on the people of Nigeria

The Debian Free Software Guidelines is a set of guidelines that the Debian Project uses to decide whether a software license is a free software license which is used to decide whether a piece of software can be included in Debian The DFSG is part of the Debian Social Contract 

The DFSG was first published together with the first version of the Debian Social Contract in July 1997 The primary authors were Bruce Perens and several other Debian developers at the time

Most discussions about the DFSG happen on the debian legal mailing list When a Debian Developer first uploads a package to be included in Debian the ftpmaster team checks the software licenses and decides whether they follow the DFSGs rules The team sometimes discusses with the debian legal list in difficult cases

The DFSG is focused on software but in June 2004 the Debian project decided to use the same rules on software documentation multimedia data and other content The non software content of Debian began to follow the DFSG more strictly in Debian 40 and following releases

Much documentation written by the GNU Project the Linux Documentation Project and others licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License contain invariant sections which do not comply with the DFSG This assertion is the end result of a long discussion and the General Resolution 2006 001

Liberal arts is the term given to an education based on classical antiquity It is meant to be a practical education which develops mental capacity It was designed in the late medieval period using ideas from Ancient Greek and Roman culture The students were meant to be young gentlemen that is from respectable and important families In modern times liberal arts colleges educate both sexes and a wider range of people

The seven liberal arts were taught in two groups the trivium and the quadrivium 

During the Middle Ages the liberal arts were central to university education The quadrivium followed the preparatory work of the trivium 

The area and range of the liberal arts evolved in time Originally most of the teaching and all of the text books would have been in Latin the language the students would have learnt at school before they came to college In the beginning the courses were aimed at educating the elite in the classical works Eventually the meaning of liberal arts got extended to include both humanities and science But even today practical activities as agriculture business engineering pedagogy or pharmacy are excluded from the liberal arts The liberal professions include only professions which require education at university mainly law and medicine

The trivium included the literary disciplines

The quadrivium included the disciplines connected with mathematics They were

Liberal arts colleges are a modern re interpretation of the old idea Mostly in the United States these colleges concentrate on good teaching and are closer to the Oxford Cambridge type of tuition than most universities They are mostly or entirely fee paying institutions and so continue to offer an elite education to students from prosperous families The courses are mostly or entirely undergraduate courses

An assembly language is a programming language that can be used to directly tell the computer what to do An assembly language is almost exactly like the machine language that a computer can understand except that it uses words in place of numbers A computer cannot really understand an assembly program directly However it can easily change the program into machine code by replacing the words of the program with the numbers that they stand for A program that does that is called an assembler 

Programs written in assembly language are usually made of instructions which are small tasks that the computer performs when it is running the program They are called instructions because the programmer uses them to instruct the computer what to do The part of the computer that follows the instructions is the processor

The assembly language of a computer is a low level language which means that it can only be used to do the simple tasks that a computer can understand directly In order to perform more complex tasks one must tell the computer each of the simple tasks that are part of the complex task For example a computer does not understand how to print a sentence on its screen Instead a program written in assembly must tell it how to do all of the small steps that are involved in printing the sentence 

Such an assembly program would be composed of many many instructions that together do something that seems very simple and basic to a human This makes it hard for humans to read an assembly program In contrast a high level programming language may have a single instruction such as PRINT This is a sentence that will tell the computer to perform all of the small tasks for you

When computer scientists first built programmable machines they programmed them directly in machine code which is a series of numbers that instructed the computer what to do Writing machine language was very hard to do and took a long time so eventually assembly language was made Assembly language is easier for a human to read and can be written faster but it is still much harder for a human to use than a high level programming language which tries to mimic human language

To program in machine code the programmer needs to know what each instruction looks like in binary Although it is easy for a computer to quickly figure out what machine code means it is hard for a programmer Each instruction can have several forms all of which just look like a bunch of numbers to people Any mistake that someone makes while writing machine code will only be noticed when the computer does the wrong thing Figuring out the mistake is hard because most people cannot tell what machine code means by looking at it

An example of what machine code looks like 05 2A 00 This hexadecimal machine code tells an x86 computer processor to add 42 to the accumulator It is impossible for a person to read and understand unless that person knows machine code 

With assembly language each instruction can be written as a short word called a mnemonic followed by other things like numbers or other short words The mnemonic is used so that the programmer does not have to remember the exact numbers in machine code needed to tell the computer to do something Examples of mnemonics in assembly language include add which adds data and mov which moves data from one place to another Because mnemonic is an uncommon word the phrase instruction type or just instruction is sometimes used instead often incorrectly The words and numbers after the first word give more information about what to do For instance things following an add might be what two things to add together and the things following mov say what to move and where to put it

Assembly language also allows programmers to write the actual data the program uses in easier ways Most assembly languages have support for easily making numbers and text In machine code each different type of number like positive negative or decimal would have to be manually converted into binary and text would have to be defined one letter at a time as numbers

Assembly language provides what is called an abstraction of machine code When using assembly programmers do not need to know the details of what numbers mean to the computer the assembler figures that out instead Assembly language actually still lets the programmer use all the features of the processor that they could with machine code In this sense assembly language has a very good rare trait it has the same ability to express things as the thing it is abstracting while being much easier to use Because of this machine code is almost never used as a programming language

When programs are finished they have already been transformed into machine code so that the processor can actually run them Sometimes however if the program has a bug in it programmers will want to be able to tell what each part of the machine code is doing Disassemblers are programs that help programmers do that by transforming the machine code of the program back into assembly language which is much easier to understand Disassemblers which turn machine code into assembly language do the opposite of assemblers which turn assembly language into machine code

An understanding of how computers are organized how they seem to work at a very low level is needed to understand how an assembly language program works At the most simplistic level computers have three main parts 

In most computers memory is divided up into bytes Each byte contains 8 bits Each byte in memory also has an address which is a number that says where the byte is in memory The first byte in memory has an address of 0 the next one has an address of 1 and so on Dividing memory into bytes makes it byte addressable because each byte gets a unique address Addresses of byte addressable memories cannot be used to refer to a single bit of a byte A byte is the smallest piece of memory that can be addressed

Even though an address refers to a particular byte in memory processors allow for using several bytes of memory in a row The most common use of this feature is to use either 2 or 4 bytes in a row to represent a number usually an integer Single bytes are sometimes also used to represent integers but because they are only 8 bits long they can only hold 28 or 256 different possible values Using 2 or 4 bytes in a row raises the number of different possible values to be 216 65536 or 232 4294967296 respectively 

When a program uses a byte or a number of bytes in a row to represent something like a letter number or anything else those bytes are called an object because they are all part of the same thing Even though objects are all stored in identical bytes of memory they are treated as though they have a type which says how the bytes should be understood either as an integer or a character or some other type Machine code can also be thought of as a type that is interpreted as instructions The notion of a type is very very important because it defines what things can and cant be done to the object and how to interpret the bytes of the object For instance it is not valid to store a negative number in a positive number object and it is not valid to store a fraction in an integer

An address that points to a multi byte object is the address to the first byte of that object the byte that has the lowest address As an aside one important thing to note is that you cant tell what the type of an object is  or even its size  by its address In fact you cant even tell what type an object is by looking at it An assembly language program needs to keep track of which memory addresses hold which objects and how big those objects are A program that does so is type safe because it only does things to objects that are safe to do on their type A program that doesnt will probably not work properly Note that most programs do not actually explicitly store what the type of an object is they just access objects consistently  the same object is always treated as the same type

The processor runs instructions which are stored as machine code in main memory As well as being able to access memory for storage most processors have a few small fast fixed size spaces for holding objects that are currently being worked with These spaces are called registers  Processors usually execute three types of instructions although some instructions can be a combination of these types Below are some examples of each type in x86 assembly language

Because no indirection was used the actual value itself was put into the register 

Here the memory at address 1000h gets the value of ax If this example is executed right after the previous one the 2 bytes at 1000h and 1001h will be a 2 byte integer with the value of 20

Some instructions do things like subtraction or logical operations like not

This instruction computes the or of the contents of the registers ax and bx and stores the result back into ax

Usually instructions are executed in the order they appear in memory which is the order they are typed in the assembly code The processor just executes them one after another However in order for processors to do complicated things they need to execute different instructions based on what the data they were given is The ability of processors to execute different instructions depending on somethings outcome is called branching Instructions that decide what the next instruction should be are called branch instructions

In this example suppose someone wants to calculate the amount of paint they will need to paint a square with a certain side length However due to economy of scale the paint store will not sell them any less than amount of paint needed to paint a 100 x 100 square

To figure out the amount of paint they will need to get based on the length of the square they want to paint they come up with this set of steps

This example introduces several new things but the first two instructions are familiar They copy the value of ax into bx and then subtract 100 from bx 

One of the new things in this example is called a label a concept found in assembly languages in general Labels can be anything the programmer wants In this example the label is continue It is interpreted by the assembler as the address of an instruction In this case it is the address of mult ax 

Another new concept is that of flags On x86 processors many instructions set flags in the processor that can be used by the next instruction to decide what to do In this case if bx was less than 100 sub will set a flag that says the result was less than zero

The next instruction is jge which is short for Jump if Greater than or Equal to It is a branch instruction If the flags in the processor specify that the result was greater than or equal to zero instead of just going to the next instruction the processor will jump to the instruction at the continue label which is mul ax

Now instead of subtracting 100 from ax seeing if that number is less than zero and assigning it back to ax ax is left unchanged The flags are still set the same way and the jump is still taken in the same situations

While input and output are a fundamental part of computing there is no one way they are done in assembly language This is because the way IO works depends on the set up of the computer and the operating system its running not just what kind of processor it has In the example section the Hello World example uses MS DOS operating system calls and the example after it uses BIOS calls

It is possible to do IO in assembly language Indeed assembly language can generally express anything that a computer is capable of doing However even though there are instructions to add and branch in assembly language that will always do the same thing there are no instructions in assembly language that always do IO

The important thing to note is that the way that IO works is not part of any assembly language because it is not part of how the processor works

Even though assembly language is not directly run by the processor  machine code is it still has a lot to do with it Each processor family supports different features instructions rules for what the instructions can do and rules for what combination of instructions are allowed where Because of this different types of processors still need different assembly languages

Because each version of assembly language is tied to a processor family it lacks something called portability Something that has portability or is portable can be easily transferred from one type of computer to another While other types of programming languages are portable assembly language in general is not

Although assembly language allows for an easy way to use all the processors features it is not used for modern software projects for several reasons

As a result of these drawbacks high level languages like Pascal C and C are used for most projects instead They allow programmers to express their ideas more directly instead of having to worry about telling the processor what to do every step of the way Theyre called high level because the ideas the programmer can express in the same amount code are more complicated

Programmers writing code in compiled high level languages use a program called a compiler to transform their code into assembly language Compilers are much harder to write than assemblers are Also high level languages do not always allow programmers to use all the features of the processor This is because high level languages are designed to support all processor families  Unlike assembly languages that only support one type of processor high level languages are portable

Even though compilers are more complicated than assemblers decades of making and researching compilers has made them very good Now there is not much reason to use assembly language anymore for most projects because compilers can usually figure out how to express programs in assembly language as well or better than programmers

Metropolitan Statistical Areas are large metropolitan areas of the United States as defined by the Office of Management and Budget These areas are urban area a high population density An earlier version of the MSA was the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area MSAs are used for official purposes

MSAs are made up of counties and for some county equivalents In New England because of the greater importance of towns over counties similar areas are based on town units These are called New England City and Town Areas

MSAs are creatded around a central urban area a single area of high population density The counties which the urbanized area are located in are known as the central counties of the MSA Other nearby counties can be a part of the MSA if these counties have strong social and economic connections to the central counties Aome areas within these outlying counties may actually be rural areas

The population estimates for some metro areas are not always agreed upon In some cases different sources give numbers of people which differ by millions The definitions used for the last US Census differed from those for previous censuses This makes it hard to compare official information from different dates MSA boundaries do not stretch into Canada or Mexico This can affect the actual population in several cities For example Detroit Buffalo El Paso and San Diego are often much larger than their MSA figures

As of June 2003 there is now an additional classification Metropolitan Division The term metropolitan division is used for a county or group of counties that are a distinct employment area within a metropolitan statistical area that has a population of at least 25 million people A metropolitan division is a part of a larger metropolitan statistical area but it is often a distinct social economic and cultural area within the larger region

The following is a list of the 25 most populated metropolitan statistical areas and metropolitan divisions in the United States according to the July 1 2007 US Census Bureau estimates

The word phallus refers to an erect penis to a penis shaped object such as a dildo or to a mimetic image of an erect penis 

Any object that symbolically resembles a penis may also be referred to as a phallus or as being phallic Such symbols represent the fertility associated with the male sexual organ and the male orgasm

When an erect penis is shown in art it is often called a phallus Erotic art has shown phalluses for a very long time Pictures of men with erections appear on ancient objects and in paintings

The erect penis was also a symbol or sign of health and fertility The Hohle Fels phallus was found in a cave in Germany It is a piece of stone carved to look like a penis that is about 28000 years old 

From the fourth millennium BC Ancient Egyptians worshipped Min as the god of reproduction and the maker of all things Min was shown in statues and on wall carvings as having an erect penis

The Ancient Greeks believed in a god called Priapus who had a very large penis that was always erect He was thought to protect livestock fruit plants and gardens and mens sex organs He was also seen as able to chase away evil and as a protector of sailors fishermen and others needing good luck The oldest piece of writing about Priapus that is known is a comedy written some time in the fourth century BC In Greek mythology Priapus tried to attack a nymph named Lotis who was sleeping so he could force her to have sex However a donkey brayed it gave a loud cry This made him lose his erection and also woke Lotis up To save Lotis the gods turned her into a lotus plant In the end Priapuss lust his strong desire to have sex made him have an erection all the time and his penis grew so large that he could not move Although some temples were built for people to pray to Priapus he was mostly worshipped in peoples homes or gardens Donkeys would sometimes be killed and offered to him but gifts of fish flowers fruit and vegetables were also very common Statues of Priapus were often placed at doorways and crossroads To make Priapus happy people passing by would stroke the statues penis

A Herma or herm is a sculpture with a head and perhaps a torso above a plain usually squared lower section on which male genitals may also be carved at the appropriate height The form originated in Ancient Greece and was adopted by the Romans and revived at the Renaissance

In ancient Greece the statues functioned as a sort of good luck charm and were placed at crossings and borders as protection Hermes was a phallic god associated with fertility luck roads and borders His name comes from the word herma In Athens they were placed outside houses for good luck The male genitals would be rubbed or anointed with olive oil to obtain luck 

Shiva perhaps the most ancient of the Indian deities and the third of the Hindu Trinity  one of the most widely worshipped and edified deity in the Hindu pantheon is worshipped often in the form of the lingam or phallus Evidence of phallic worship in the India date back to prehistoric times Stone Lingams with several varieties of stylized heads or the glans are found to this date in many of the old temples and in museums in India and abroad 

The famous man size lingam in the Parashurameshwar Temple in the Chitoor Distirct of the Indian State of Andhra Pradesh better known as the Gudimallam Lingam is about 15 metres in height carved in polished black granite Dated back to ca 2300 2800 BC it is one of the existing lingams from the pre Buddhist period The almost naturalistic giant lingam is distinguished by its prominent bulbous head and an anthropomorphic form of Shiva carved in high relief on the shaft Shiva Lingams in India have tended to become more and more stylized over the centuries and existing lingams from before the 6th century show a more leaning towards the naturalistic style with the glans clearly indicated

Today phalluses do not often appear in artworks or movies This is because many people think that showing a mans penis when it is erect is obscene

Kilik Pass 30 km to the west of Mintaka Pass is a high mountain pass in Pakistan The two passes were in ancient times the two main access points into the Upper Hunza Valley from the north

This was the shortest and quickest way into northern Kashmir from the Tarim Basin and one that was usually open all year but was extremely dangerous and only suited for travellers on foot From Tashkurgan one travelled just over 70 km south to the junction of the Minteke River Heading some 80 km west up this valley one reached the Mintaka Pass which both led into upper Hunza from where one could travel over the infamous rafiqs or hanging passages to Gilgit and on either to Kashmir or to the Gandharan plains

Laden animals could be taken over the Mintaka and Kilik passes into upper Hunza but then loads would have to be carried by coolie to Gilgit From there cargoes could be reloaded onto pack animals again and taken either east to Kashmir and then on to Taxila or west to Chitral which provided relatively easy access to either Jalalabad or Peshawar via Swat

The Mintaka Pass was the main one used in ancient times until the fairly recent advance of glacier ice After the glaciation of the Mintaka Pass the Kilik Pass was favoured by caravans coming from China and Afghanistan as it is wider free of glaciers and provided enough pasture for caravan animals

Drosophila melanogaster is a small common fly found near unripe and rotted fruit It has been in use for over a century to study genetics and lends itself well to behavioral studies

Thomas Hunt Morgan studied Drosophila early in the 1900s He and his team were the first to discover sex linkage and genetic recombination which placed the small fly in the forefront of genetic research 

Due to its small size ease of culture and short generation time geneticists have been using Drosophila ever since It is one of the organisms whose entire genome is known and many hundreds of genes have been identified and studied

Fruit flies are easily obtained from the wild and most biological science companies carry a variety of different mutations In addition these companies sell equipment to culture the flies Costs are relatively low and most equipment can be used year after year 

The flys vision is its most important sense organ Approximately two thirds of the Drosophila brain is dedicated to visual processing Although their ability to distinguish fine detail is worse than that of humans their ability to time things is about ten times better

The compound eye of the fruit fly contains 760 units or ommatidia and are one of the most advanced among insects Each ommatidium contains eight photoreceptor cells support cells pigment cells and a cornea Wild type flies have reddish pigment cells which serve to absorb excess blue light so the fly isnt blinded by ambient light

The wings of a fly are capable of beating at up to 220 times per second Flies fly via straight sequences of movement interspersed by rapid turns called saccades During these turns a fly is able to rotate 90 degrees in fewer than 50 milliseconds

It was long thought that the characteristics of Drosophila flight were dominated by the viscosity of the air rather than the inertia of the fly body However research has shown that flies perform banked turns where the fly accelerates slows down while turning and accelerates again at the end of the turn This indicates that inertia is the dominant force as is the case with larger flying animals

Sarah Siddons was a Welsh actress She was the best known actress who played tragedies of the 18th century She was the older sister of John Philip Kemble Charles Kemble Stephen Kemble Ann Hatton and Elizabeth Whitlock She is very famous for the way she played the Shakespearean character Lady Macbeth She grew to liking the character Lady Macbeth very much

She was born Sarah Kemble in Brecon Brecknockshire Wales She was the oldest daughter of Roger Kemble an actor and manager He travelled around with his company which included most members of his family and Sarah Sally Ward 

Acting was only just becoming a respectable profession for a woman At first her parents did not like the fact that she had chosen to become an actress

In 1774 Siddons had her first success as Belvidera in Thomas Otways Venice Preserved Because of this role David Garrick noticed her Garrick later sent someone to see her act as Calista in Thomas Rowes Fair Penitent After this she was engaged to appear at Drury Lane She was inexperienced Because of this and other factors her first appearances as Portia in the play The Merchant of Venice and in other parts were not well received She received a note from the manager of Drury Lane saying that her services would not be required She was in her own words 

In 1777 she went to play in the provinces For the next six years she worked in provincial companies in particular those in York and Bath Her fame grew Her next Drury Lane appearance on 10 October 1782 was very different She was an immediate sensation playing the title role in Garricks adaptation of a play by Thomas Southerne Isabella or The Fatal Marriage 

Her most famous role was that of Lady Macbeth Because she was very good at expressing emotion when she acted Lady Macbeths murderous passions she could captivate her audience Lady Macbeth was the play best adapted to her acting She was tall and had a striking figure brilliant beauty powerfully expressive eyes and solemn dignity of demeanour This allowed her to claim the character as her own

After Lady Macbeth she played Desdemona in Othello Rosalind in As You Like It Ophelia and Volumnia all with great success In Queen Catherine she discovered a role that was almost as well adapted to her acting powers as that of Lady Macbeth

It was the beginning of twenty years in which she was the queen of Drury Lane Her celebrity status has been called mythical and monumental By the mid 1780s Siddons was established as a cultural icon She mixed with the literary and social elites of London society She knew people like Samuel Johnson Edmund Burke Hester Thrale Piozzi and William Windham

In 1802 she left Drury Lane She then appeared on the stage of a rival theatre Covent Garden from time to time It was there on 29 June 1812 that she gave perhaps the most extraordinary farewell performance in theatre history She was playing her most famous role Lady Macbeth and the audience refused to allow the play to continue after the end of the sleepwalking scene Eventually after tumultuous applause from the pit the curtain reopened and Siddons was discovered sitting in her own clothes and character  whereupon she made an emotional farewell speech to the audience lasting eight minutes

Mrs Siddons formally retired from the stage in 1812 but continued to appear on special occasions Her last appearance was on 9 June 1819 as Lady Randolph in John Homes Douglas

She began as a ladies maid to Lady Greathead at Guys Cliffe House near the Saxon Mill Coventry Road Warks 

In 1773 at the age of 18 she married William Siddons an actor She was less lucky with her family She had seven children but five of them died Her marriage to William Siddons was the cause of many problems They could not divorce but they separated and lived in different places

Sarah Siddons died in 1831 in London She is buried in Saint Marys Cemetery at Paddington Green

Sir Joshua Reynolds painted his famous portrait Mrs Siddons as the Tragic Muse in 1784 and signed it on the hem of her dress for he told her I have resolved to go down to posterity on the hem of your garment 

In 1950 Joseph Mankiewicz saw the portrait and decided that it would provide the setting for the opening scene of All About Eve The scene opened in the ballroom of the then fictitious Sarah Siddons Society The occasion is the presentation of the Sarah Siddons award statuette modeled on Sarah Siddons as the Tragic Muse In the climactic party scene the painting is prominently displayed between Bette Davis and Marilyn Monroe The portrait also presides over the final scene when Anne Baxter moves past it 

In 1957 Bette Davis posed as Sarah Siddons in a re creation of the painting staged as part of the Pageant of the Masters 

At the time of the release of All About Eve The Sarah Siddons Award was a purely fictitious award However there now exists the American Sarah Siddons Award for dramatic achievement in theatre a genuine and prestigious award named in honor of Siddons The award is given annually in Chicago by the Sarah Siddons Society

The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were nuclear attacks at the end of World War II against the Empire of Japan by the United States ordered by the US President Harry S Truman on August 6 and 9 1945 These bombs had been developed in the Manhattan Project

The bombs killed as many as 140000 people in Hiroshima and 80000 in Nagasaki by the end of 1945 In both cities most of the dead people were civilians or non soldiers

One reason why the bombs killed so many people is because a lot of Japanese houses were made of wood When the bombs exploded the wooden buildings caught fire which spread quickly

Six days after the explosion over Nagasaki on August 15 Japan announced its surrender to the Allied Powers signing the surrender paper on September 2 officially ending the Pacific War and World War II 

Some people say that the atomic bombs actually saved many lives because an Allied invasion of Japan would kill more people on both sides Allied generals believed that an invasion of Japan would have killed more than a million people on each side Others say that the bombings were evil not necessary and a war crime People still argue about this

The bombings led in part to post war Japan adopting Three Non Nuclear Principles forbidding that nation from nuclear armament

Sir William Schwenck Gilbert was an English dramatist librettist poet and illustrator He is best known for the comic operas that he wrote with Sir Arthur Sullivan

Gilbert worked in the civil service for a few years but he did not like it He studied law and became a lawyer but not many people hired him To make more money he wrote short stories and comic poems for magazines He also worked as a theatre critic Gilbert made drawings for some of his poems and signed them Bab a nickname he had when he was a baby Those poems became known as The Bab Ballads and were very popular

In the 1860s Gilbert started writing plays At first he wrote parodies of other writers plays and operas but soon he developed his own way of writing Gilbert wrote many plays most of them are not performed anymore but Engaged about a man who proposes marriage to every woman he meets is still performed

In 1871 Gilbert started working with Sullivan They wrote fourteen comic operas together Gilbert wrote the words and Sullivan wrote the music Their fourth opera HMS Pinafore made the team of Gilbert and Sullivan famous all over the English speaking world Besides Pinafore their best known operas are The Pirates of Penzance and The Mikado The Gilbert and Sullivan operas are still performed very often by opera companies theatre companies and groups in schools and colleges

Gilbert and Sullivan sometimes argued about what to write and how to write it but they worked together for 25 years from 1871 to 1896 When they were angry with each other they wrote operas with other people but those operas did not make as much money as the operas they wrote together When Sullivan died in 1900 Gilbert stopped writing operas

Gilbert directed his own plays and operas He wanted the actors to talk in a natural way and not shout as if they were giving a speech to a big crowd Gilberts ideas helped other playwrights like Oscar Wilde and George Bernard Shaw to make their plays more real

While Mumbles mother Norma Jean thinks this little habit is cute his father Memphis says it just aint penguin Besides they both know that without a Heartsong Mumble may never find true love As fate would have it his one friend Gloria happens to be the best singer around Mumble and Gloria have a connection from the moment they hatch but she struggles with his strange hippity hoppity ways Mumble is just too different especially for Noah the Elder the stern leader of the colony who ultimately casts him out of the community

Away from home for the first time Mumble meets a group of different penguinsthe Adelie Amigos Led by Ramon the Adelies instantly accept Mumbles tap dancing skills and invite him to party with them In the home of the Adelies Mumble seeks the counsel of Lovelace the Guru a Rockhopper penguin who claims he will answer any of lifes questions for the price of a pebble In their conversation Lovelace mentions aliens which interest Mumble as he finds a frozen vehicle in a glacier He decides to find the aliens

The Horst Wessel Lied also known as Die Fahne hoch was the anthem of the Nazi Party from 1930 to 1945 From 1933 to 1945 it was also part of Germanys national anthem 

The lyrics of the song were composed in 1929 by Horst Wessel a Nazi activist and local commander of the Nazi militia the SA in the Berlin district of Friedrichshain Wessel was assassinated by a Communist activist in January 1930 and the propaganda apparatus of Berlin Gauleiter Dr Joseph Goebbels made him the leading martyr of the Nazi Movement The song became the official Song of Consecration for the Nazi Party and was extensively used at party functions as well as being sung by the SA during street parades 

When the Nazis came to power in 1933 the Horst Wessel Lied was recognised as a national symbol by a law issued on May 19 1933 Nazi Germany thus had a double anthem consisting of the first verse of the Deutschlandlied followed by the Horst Wessel Lied A regulation attached to a printed version of the Horst Wessel Lied in 1934 required the right arm to be raised in a Hitler salute when the first and fourth verses were sung

With the fall of the Nazi regime in 1945 the Horst Wessel Lied was banned and both the lyrics and the tune remain illegal in Germany and Austria to this day except for educational and scholarly uses

The lyrics of the Horst Wessel Lied were published in the Berlin Nazi newspaper Der Angriff in September 1929 attributed to Der Unbekannte SA Mann as follows

The Rotfront was a reference to the Rotfrontkmpferbund a communist militia tied to the Communist Party of Germany It was common for Nazis Sturmabteilung and Communists Redfront to attack each other in violent street fights which eventually grew into full scale battles after 1930 Reaction was a reference to the conservative parties and the liberal democratic German state of the Weimar Republic period which made several unsuccessful attempts to ban the SA Servitude means what the Nazis saw as Germanys servitude to the Treaty of Versailles of 1919 which imposed huge reparations on Germany and deprived her of her colonies and territory along her eastern border

Some changes were made to the lyrics after Wessels death 

The dropping of the reference to barricades reflected the Nazi Partys desire in the period 1930 33 to be seen as a constitutional political party aiming at taking power by legal means rather than as a revolutionary party

The line Kameraden die Rotfront und Reaktion erschossen is ghastly German but it was never amended

After Wessels death new stanzas were composed in his honour These were frequently sung by the SA but did not become part of the official lyrics used on party or state occasions

After Wessels death he was officially credited with having composed the melody as well as having written the lyrics for the Horst Wessel Lied Between 1930 and 1933 however German critics disputed this claim pointing out that the melody had a long prior history Such criticism became impossible after 1933

The most likely immediate source for the melody was a song popular in the German Imperial Navy during World War I which Wessel would no doubt have heard being sung by Navy veterans in the Berlin of the 1920s The song was known either by its opening line as Vorbei vorbei sind all die schnen Stunden or as the Knigsberg Lied after the German light cruiser Knigsberg which is mentioned in one version of the songs lyrics The opening stanza of the song is

Another German song Der Abenteurer begins

In 1936 a German music critic Alfred Weidemann published an article in which he identified the melody of a song composed in 1865 by the Weimar composer Peter Cornelius as the Urmelodie According to Weidemann Cornelius described the tune as a Viennese folk tune This appeared to him to be the ultimate origin of the melody of the Horst Wessel Lied  

The musical score is much more complex than the text of the song given its characteristics it could easily be sung even by people without much singing practice and be played by amateur bands Often fanfares were used to give a more military touch to the tune

During the 1930s and 40s the Horst Wessel Lied was adapted for use by fascist groups in other European countries The anthem of the British Union of Fascists was set to the same tune and its lyrics were to some extent modelled on the Horst Wessel Lied but appealing to British nationalism rather than German nationalism Its opening stanza was

In Spain the Falange fascist movement sang to the same tune

While in Vichy France the fascists of the radical Milice sang

Between 1930 and 1933 the German Communists and Social Democrats sang various parodies of the Horst Wessel Lied during their street battles with the SA Some simply changed the political character of the song such as

The Stahlhelm was a veterans organisation closely aligned with the Nazis

Others substituted completely new lyrics

Ernst Thlmann was the KPD leader

These versions were of course banned once the Nazis came to power and the Communist and Social Democratic parties repressed But during the years of the Third Reich the song was parodied in various underground versions most of them poking fun at the corruption of the Nazi elite One version ran

Wilhelm Frick was the Interior Minister Baldur von Schirach was the Hitler Youth leader Heinrich Himmler was head of the SS and police

In the first year of the Nazi regime radical elements of the SA sang their own parody of the song reflecting their disappointment that the socialist element of National Socialism had not been realised

Kurt Schmitt was Economics Minister 1933 35

Identity is an umbrella term used throughout the social sciences to describe an individuals comprehension of him or herself as a discrete separate entity This term though generic can be further specified by the disciplines of psychology and sociology including the two forms of social psychology 

Identity may be contrasted with the notion of self In psychology a psychological identity relates to self image self esteem and individuation An important part of identity in psychology is gender identity as this dictates to a significant degree how an individual views him or herself both as a person and in relation to other people In cognitive psychology the term identity refers to the capacity for self reflection and the awareness of self

Sociology places some explanatory weight on the concept of role behavior The notion of identity negotiation may arise from the learning of social roles through personal experience Identity negotiation is a process in which a person negotiates with society at large regarding the meaning of his or her identity

Psychologists most commonly use the term identity to describe personal identity or the idiosyncratic things that make a person unique Meanwhile sociologists often use the term to describe social identity or the collection of group memberships that define the individual However these uses are not proprietary and each discipline may use either concept

Erik Erikson was one of the earliest psychologists to be explicitly interested in identity The Eriksonian framework rests upon a distinction among the psychological sense of continuity known as the ego identity the personal idiosyncrasies that separate one person from the next known as the personal identity and the collection of social roles that a person might play known as either the social identity or the cultural identity Eriksons work in the psychodynamic tradition aimed to investigate the process of identity formation across a lifespan Progressive strength in the ego identity for example can be charted in terms of a series of stages in which identity is formed in response to increasingly sophisticated challenges On some readings of Erikson the development of a strong ego identity along with the proper integration into a stable society and culture lead to a stronger sense of identity in general Accordingly a deficiency in either of these factors may increase the chance of an identity crisis or confusion

Although the self is distinct from identity the literature of self psychology can offer some insight into how identity is maintained From the vantage point of self psychology there are two areas of interest the processes by which a self is formed and the actual content of the schemata which compose the self concept In the latter field theorists have shown interest in relating the self concept to self esteem the differences between complex and simple ways of organizing self knowledge and the links between those organizing principles and the processing of information 

The Neo Eriksonian identity status paradigm emerged in later years driven largely by the work of James Marcia This paradigm focuses upon the twin concepts of exploration and commitment The central idea is that any individuals sense of identity is determined in large part by the explorations and commitments that he or she makes regarding certain personal and social traits It follows that the core of the research in this paradigm investigates the degrees to which a person has made certain explorations and the degree to which he or she displays a commitment to those explorations 

A person may display either relative weakness or relative strength in terms of both exploration and commitments When assigned categories four possible permutations result identity diffusion identity foreclosure identity moratorium and identity achievement Diffusion is when a person lacks both exploration in life and interest in committing even to those unchosen roles that he or she occupies Foreclosure is when a person has not chosen extensively in the past but seems willing to commit to some relevant values goals or roles in the future Moratorium is when a person displays a kind of flightiness ready to make choices but unable to commit to them Finally achievement is when a person makes identity choices and commits to them

At a general level self psychology is compelled to investigate the question of how the personal self relates to the social environment To the extent that these theories place themselves in the tradition of psychological social psychology they focus on explaining an individuals actions within a group in terms of mental events and states However some sociological social psychology theories go further by attempting to deal with the issue of identity at both the levels of individual cognition and of collective behavior

The question of what psychological reasons drive the individuals adoption of group identities remains open Many people gain a sense of positive self esteem from their identity groups which furthers a sense of community and belonging Another issue that researchers have attempted to address is the question of why people engage in discrimination ie why they tend to favor those they consider a part of their in group over those considered to be outsiders Both questions have been given extensive treatment by Henri Tajfel and John C Turners social identity theory Their theory focuses mainly on the role of self categorization and attempts to show how a simple sense of distinctiveness can lead people to act in a discriminating way Moreover social identity theory shows that merely crafting cognitive distinction between in and out groups can lead to subtle effects on peoples evaluations of others 

Another issue of interest in social psychology is related to the notion that there are certain identity formation strategies which a person may use to adapt to the social world Cote and Levine developed a typology which investigated the different manners of behavior that individuals may have Their typology includes

Kenneth Gergen formulated additional classifications which include the strategic manipulator the pastiche personality and the relational self The strategic manipulator is a person who begins to regard all senses of identity merely as role playing exercises and who gradually becomes alienated from his or her social self The pastiche personality abandons all aspirations toward a true or essential identity instead viewing social interactions as opportunities to play out and hence become the roles they play Finally the relational self is a perspective by which persons abandon all sense of exclusive self and view all sense of identity in terms of social engagement with others For Gergen these strategies follow one another in phases and they are linked to the increase in popularity of postmodern culture and the rise of telecommunications technology

Anthropologists have most frequently employed the term identity to refer to this idea of selfhood in a loosely Eriksonian way properties based on the uniqueness and individuality which makes a person distinct from others Identity became of more interest to anthropologists with the emergence of modern concerns with ethnicity and social movements in the 1970s This was reinforced by an appreciation following the trend in sociological thought of the manner in which the individual is affected by and contributes to the overall social context At the same time the Eriksonian approach to identity remained in force with the result that identity has continued until recently to be used in a largely socio historical way to refer to qualities of sameness in relation to a persons connection to others and to a particular group of people 

This ambiguous and confusing approach to identity has led on occasion to rather restrictive interpretations of the concept following two more or less opposite tendencies The first favours a primordialist approach which takes the sense of self and belonging to a collective group as a fixed thing defined by objective criteria such as common ancestry and common biological characteristics The second rooted in social constructionist theory takes the view that identity is formed by a predominantly political choice of certain characteristics In so doing it questions the idea that identity is a natural given characterised by fixed supposedly objective criteria Both approaches need to be understood in their respective political and historical contexts characterised by debate on issues of class race and ethnicity While they have been criticized they continue to exert an influence on approaches to the conceptualisation of identity today

These different explorations of identity demonstrate how difficult a concept it is to pin down Since identity is a virtual thing it is impossible to define it empirically Discussions of identity use the term with different meanings from fundamental and abiding sameness to fluidity contingency negotiated and so on Brubaker and Cooper note a tendency in many scholars to confuse identity as a category of practice and as a category of analysis Indeed many scholars demonstrate a tendency to follow their own preconceptions of identity following more or less the frameworks listed above rather than taking into account the mechanisms by which the concept is crystallised as reality In this environment some analysts such as Brubaker and Cooper have suggested doing away with the concept completely Others by contrast have sought to introduce alternative concepts in an attempt to capture the dynamic and fluid qualities of human social self expression Hall for example suggests treating identity as a process to take into account the reality of diverse and ever changing social experience Some scholars have introduced the idea of identification whereby identity is perceived as made up of different components that are identified and interpreted by individuals The construction of an individual sense of self is achieved by personal choices regarding who and what to associate with Such approaches are liberating in their recognition of the role of the individual in social interaction and the construction of identity

In sociology and political science the notion of social identity is defined as the way that individuals label themselves as members of particular groups It is in this sense that sociologists and historians speak of the national identity of a particular country and feminist and queer theorists speak of gender identity Symbolic interactionism attempts to show how identity can influence and be influenced by social reality at large SI is based largely on the work of the American pragmatists such as Charles Peirce and William James

SI has two schools of thought the Iowa School and the Chicago School SI researchers in the Chicago School argue that social reality is emergent and is constructed from personal situated interaction ie from the process of impression management To observe identity scientifically the Chicago school opts for ethnomethodology and qualitative observation techniques Iowa School researchers attempt to show that personal and social identities are representations of or are otherwise connected to social structures and tend to use quantitative surveys For example McCall and Simmons make use of the notion of role identity and Sheldon Strykers theory of structural interactionism explains identity in terms of interaction density and interaction opportunities Of particular concern to sociologists who subscribe to the theories of mile Durkheim is the question of how social phenomena such as mass anomie relate to the identity formation strategies

Identity has played a functional role in social movements By emphasizing a group identity social movements have sought to strengthen politically oppressed groups both by improving members sense of confidence and by familiarizing the external society with the existing social group However national or ethnic identity is sometimes also tied to demagogy leading to ethnic or religious conflicts FactdateFebruary 2007

Based on identity theory as rooted in the work of George Herbert Mead and expanded by Sheldon Stryker the process of the individual interacting with others in order to create an identity is called identity negotiation The purpose of identity negotiation is to develop a consistent set of behaviors that reinforce the identity of the person In general a person will have to negotiate separately on each identity he or she possesses by interacting with those who are affected by the role in question For example a persons identity as office worker would be negotiated separately from her identity as mother because the collectively established role of the worker involves negotiation with coworkers and not with ones children See Stryker and Burke A related notion is that of identity capital developed by Cote Levine

In sociology social identity can also be examined from the perspective of social and historical change Postmodern views of identity understand it as a function of historical and cultural circumstances Some works like that of Berger and Luckmann argue that all aspects of social reality are actually social constructions created by historical facts Nevertheless they emphasize that these constructs have real consequences upon the lives and behaviors of human beings

Kenneth Gergen and Anthony Giddens have both attempted to place theories of identity formation in a historical context Gergen argues that changes in popular types of identity have run parallel to a change in broader culture a sense of robust ego identity was present in the romantic period followed by a sense of self as rational actor during the modernist period and the sense of a relational self was typical of the postmodern period In contrast Giddens accepts that there is historical change in identity styles but attributes it to aberrations in socio economic conditions which are unique to the high modern period

Implications of identity and identity construction can be seen in occupational settings This becomes increasing challenging in stigmatized jobs or dirty work In their article Tracy and Trethewey state that individuals gravitate toward and turn away from particular jobs depending in part on the extent to which they validate a preferred organizational self Some jobs carry different stigmas or acclaims In her analysis Tracy uses the example of correctional officers trying to shake the stigma of the glorified maids The process by which people arrive at justifications of and values for various occupational choices Among these are workplace satisfaction and overall quality of life People in these types of jobs are forced to find ways in order to create an identity they can live with Crafting a positive sense of self at work is more challenging when ones work is considered dirty by societal standards In other words doing taint management is not just about allowing the employee to feel good in that job If employees must navigate discourses that question the viability of their work and or experience obstacles in managing taint through transforming dirty work into a badge of honor it is likely they will find blaming the client to be an efficacious route in affirming their identity

In any case the concept that an individual has a unique identity developed relatively late in history Factors influencing the emphasis on personal identity may include

Philip Gidley King was a sailor in the British Royal Navy who became the third Governor of New South Wales

King was born in Launceston Cornwall His father was a draper selling cloth and fabrics He joined the navy in 1770 at the age of 12 He was made the captains servant on the HMS Swallow He served in the West Indies and then fought in the American War of Independence He became a midshipman and later a lieutenant He served with Captain Arthur Phillip in HMS Ariadne He went to India with Phillip in 1783 in the ship HMS Europe Phillip was very pleased with King He made King a lieutenant on HMS Sirius when he took the First Fleet to Australia in 1787 to start the penal colony

Three weeks after the First Fleet got to Sydney Governor Phillip sent King to Norfolk Island His task was to set up a small penal colony that would make use of the timber and flax growing on the island These would be of use to the British Navy He arrived at the island on March 3 1788 There was no safe place to land on the island and this made it a difficult place to have a settlement King had a group of 23 people including 15 convicts Over the next two years they began clearing land to grow crops and to raise cattle and other animals King was made Lieutenant Governor of Norfolk Island In March 1790 Phillip sent King back to England He was to go back and tell the British government about the problems of the new settlements in Australia

King stayed in London for about four months He married Anna Josepha Coombe on March 11 1791 and they left for Australia four days later After reporting to Phillip in Sydney they were back on Norfolk Island in November where his son Phillip Parker King was born

While he had been away Norfolk had been governed by Lieutenant Governor Robert Ross Phillip had moved Ross to the island because of his difficulties in working with him When King arrived the convicts settlers and soldiers were very unhappy because of Rosss leadership King made new rules which made things better for people who wanted to settle on the island many of whom had been marines or convicts In 1794 the island was growing all of the wheat it needed and had so many pigs it was able to send food to Sydney

The flax on the island was too hard to turn into cloth Two Maoris from New Zealand were kidnapped and brought to Norfolk to teach people how to work the flax The two men did not know about flax in New Zealand it was work done by the women In November 1793 King left the island for ten days to take the men back home He did not have permission to leave and got into trouble from Lieutenant Governor Francis Grose King also had problems with many of the soldiers They said he punished them more than the convicts King arrested 20 soldiers and charged them with mutiny and sent them to Sydney Grose released the soldiers and told the soldiers on Norfolk that they were in charge not King These orders were later changed by the Duke of Portland

King became ill and Governor John Hunter let him go back to England to get medical treatment

The First Fleet is the name given to the 11 ships which sailed from Great Britain on 13 May 1787 to start the first European colony in New South Wales It was a convict settlement the start of a plan to transport thousands of prisoners to Australia The fleet was led by Captain Arthur Phillip This journey lasted eight months and used a route across the oceans that had only been used three times once by Abel Tasman and twice by James Cookrp161

There were two navy ships six convict transports and three storeships The private ships were on contract to the British Government The contracts were organized by William Richards a shipbroker from Walworth He also supplied the food and drink for the ships Zachariah Clarke went with the Fleet to look after things for Richards 

The convict ships were set up in the same way as soldiers were transported People slept in hammocks and there were tables for eating and stools to sit on To keep the convicts secure thick wooden walls were built across the deck from side to side These had small holes in them so the guards could shoot in case of trouble The hatches were kept shut with cross bars bolts and locks Guards were always on duty at each hatch and a guard with a gun was always on the quarter deck

Some of the convicts were taken to the transport ships at London and the rest went on board at Plymouth Many especially those from smaller country gaols were not in good health Phillip thought that he might have to make one of the ships a hospital ship to care for the sickrp154 Newspapers wrote that they expected about 80 of the convicts would not survive the long journeyrp54 Several of the convicts died and some of marines were so sick that they were removed from the ships before they left Englandrp125 The number of people that died on the trip was quite small and shows that the planning and treatment of the convicts was successfulrp156 Most had put on weight and were healthier when they arrived in Australia than when they left Englandrp155

Convicts were given two thirds of the amount normally provided for sailors Each week a sailor was given

As well as this food there was sometimes rice dried fish and soup When the ships were in a harbour there was also fresh meat and vegetables Women and children were given a slightly different list of food Sick people were also given wine and spirits 

When the Fleet arrived in Sydney Arthur Phillip worked out they only had enough food for 49 weeks He should have been given enough for two years

The Fleet also took a number of animals plants and seeds The animals included sheep pigs dogs cats goats turkeys geese ducks chickens pigeons horses and cattle Plants and seeds included coffee cocoa cotton bananas oranges lemons tamarinds guava prickly pear eugenia or pomme rose jalap ipecacuanha figs bamboo sugar cane esparto grass vines quinces apples pears strawberries oaks myrtles rice wheat barley and maize Some of this was brought from England and the rest from when the Fleet stopped at Rio de Janeiro and Capetown

The first ship Supply reached Botany Bay on 18 January 1788 Phillip soon decided that this site picked by Sir Joseph Banks was not suitable It had poor soil no safe place to leave the ships and no drinking water Phillip decided to go north to Port Jackson On 26 January the marines and convicts arrived at Sydney Cove It was a successful trip as only 40 convicts had died Phillip named the settlement Sydney after Lord Sydney the British governments Home Secretary

1403 people left Portsmouth On the voyage 7 babies were born 69 people died or left the ships 1332 people landed in Port Jackson which is now known as Sydney

Homeopathy is a form of alternative medicine It was created in the 18th century by Samuel Hahnemann The basic theory behind Homeopathy is that a sick person can be healed using the rebound effect of a substance that produces the symptoms of the illness in a healthy person Some researchers claim that there is scientific evidence that homeopathy helps in many problems and diseases The solutions in homeopathy are prepared in such a way that for most of them it is unlikely that anything from the original substance is still there Homeopaths claim that the solution carries a memory of the original substance but according to science it is really unlikely that this memory exists or that homeopathy will help peoples health Skeptics claim that people who feel better after homeopathic treatment are likely feeling better because they think they will feel better a condition known as the placebo effect

It is prepared by adding lots of water to a substance shaking it then taking a small amount of that water adding it to more water shaking that and repeating that over and over up to 200 times in some homeopathic remedies Hahnemann said this would bring out the spirit like medicinal powers held within a drug However modern science shows how many atoms or molecules  tiny things that cannot be divided up any more  existed in the original substance being diluted In most homeopathic drugs scientists can use mathematics to show they are unlikely to have any of the original substance Even some homeopaths agree with this but say that quantum mechanics or other things allow homeopathy to work anyway  Most scientists believe that homeopathy does not work because its ideas go against those of physics and chemistry

Homeopathy became popular because it was created at a time when medicine did not work very well and could make people sicker Back then taking homeopathy might have kept people from getting hurt by bad doctors However medicine has improved since then and now helps people a lot more than it hurts people So while most people think using homeopathy wont hurt you if you go to a homeopath instead of a qualified medical doctor it may keep you from getting help that could save your life Homeopaths have also been known to tell their patients not to take medicines like antibiotics and vaccines that could cure dangerous diseases

Homeopaths view illness as a systemic condition a disturbance in the overall homeostasis of the total being and accordingly consider that almost any sick person may benefit from proper homeopathic treatment homeopathy is designed to treat the whole person and can therefore be considered in almost any situation where a persons health is depleted

Syllogism is deduction A form of logical argument with three propositions The first two propositions are called premises and the last is called the conclusion Each proposition must have some form of the to be verb in it this is how we distinguish the different parts of the propositions Next there must be three terms and each must be used twice The subject of the conclusion is left of the to be verb and the predicate is right of the to be verb The Minor Term is the subject of the conclusion Conversely the predicate of the conclusion is the Major Term The proposition that contains the Minor Term is referred to as the Minor Premise and the proposition that contains the Major Term is referred to as the Major Premise The term not used in the conclusion is referred to as the middle term 

Aristotles Six Rules for a Syllogism 1 A syllogism must have three terms 2 A syllogism must have three propositions 3 The middle term must be distributed at least once 4 No term undistributed in the premises can be distributed in the conclusion 5 No syllogism can have two negative premises 6 If one of the premises is negative the conclusion must also be negative

Aristotle studied different syllogisms and identified valid syllogisms as syllogisms with conclusion true if both premises are true The example above is valid syllogism

Reprise Records is an American record label founded in 1960 by Frank Sinatra which is owned by Warner Music Group and operated through Warner Bros Records Reprise is best known for recording Green Day since 1994

Reprise was formed in 1960 by Frank Sinatra in order to allow more artistic freedom for his own recordings He had earlier been with Capitol Records but was upset when Capitol issued an album Come Fly with Me whose cover had a picture of him in front of an airplane with a Trans World Airlines logo He believed Capitol and TWA were profiting together from his image and left him out

Reprises artists included Sinatras longtime friend Dean Martin who was a singer and comedian with a popular television show Sinatras daughter Nancy Sinatra became a recording artist and singer and signed with her fathers label Reprise also released records by Jimi Hendrix and later Neil Young

Rob Cavallo is a record producer who has made several albums He is now a senior VP at Reprise Records

Longview is the first major label single released by punk band Green Day from their 1994 album Dookie

mike dirnt wrote the opening bass line while on acid according to billie joe

Basket Case is a song by the band Green Day from its third album Dookie The song ended up being a huge hit spending five weeks at the top of the Modern Rock Tracks chart after it was released The song was written by frontman Billie Joe Armstrong about his struggle with anxiety before he was diagnosed with a panic disorder and he thought he was going crazy 

It should be noted that while the song was extremely popular in the United States even reaching hit number 26 on the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay the lack of a commercial single single handedly stopped the song from charting on the Billboard Hot 100

When I Come Around is a 1994 single from Green Days album Dookie It was the final single from the album and it was 1 on the Modern Rock Tracks for seven weeks

Hercules is a constellation in the northern part of the sky It represents the mythological Hercules of Greek mythology

Aquila lies just a few degrees North of the celestial equator The constellation is best seen in the summer as it is located along the Milky Way Because of this location along the line of our galaxy many clusters and nebulae are found within its borders However they are dim and there are not many galaxies

Aquila was one of the 48 constellations described by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy It had been earlier mentioned by Eudoxus in the 4th century BC and Aratus in the 3rd century BC It is now one of the 88 constellations defined by the International Astronomical Union 

The Greek Aquila is probably based on the Babylonian constellation of the Eagle which is located in the same area as the Greek constellation

Two major novae have been observed in Aquila The first one was in 389 BC and was recorded as being as bright as Venus The other was in 1918 and is known as It briefly shone brighter than Altair the brightest star in Aquila

Three interesting planetary nebulae lie in Aquila

In illustrations of Aquila that represent it as an eagle a nearly straight line of three stars symbolizes part of the wings The center and brightest of these three stars is Altair The tips of the wings spread out to the southeast and northwest The head of the eagle stretches off to the southwestCitation neededdateMarch 2011

In mythology Aquila was owned by the Roman god Jupiter and did many tasks for him

In a book by Gavin White the Babylonian Eagle carried the constellation called the Dead Man in its talons The author also draws a comparison to the Classical stories of Antinous and Ganymede

In classical Greek mythology Aquila was identified as  He was the eagle that carried the thunderbolts of Zeus He was sent by Zeus to carry the shepherd boy Ganymede to Mount Olympus The constellation of Aquarius is sometimes identified with GanymedeCitation neededdateMarch 2011

In the Chinese love story of Qi Xi Niu Lang and his two children are separated forever from their wife and mother Zhi Nu who is on the far side of the river the Milky WayCitation neededdateMarch 2011

In Hinduism the constellation Aquila is identified with the half eagle half human deity GarudaCitation neededdateMarch 2011

In Chinese astronomy Aql is located within the Heavenly Market Enclosure and the other stars of the constellation are placed within the Black Tortoise of the North

Libra is a constellation of the zodiac It lies between Virgo to the west and Scorpius to the east It once represented the claws of Scorpius

The brightest stars in Libra form a rectangle

 and Librae are the scales balance beam and and are the weighing pans

 Librae was formerly known as Scorpii even though it is well inside the boundaries of Libra It was not renamed as Librae until 1851

The constellation Sagittarius is a group of stars in one area of the night sky The stars are in the shape of a centaur archer This constellation is part of the Western zodiac

Ursa Major is a constellation that can be seen in the northern hemisphere and part of the southern hemisphere Its name means Great Bear in Latin It was named that because many different groups of people around the world have thought that its stars look a lot like a bear with a long tail All of the stars in the constellation except Dubhe and Alkaid are moving toward the same point in the sky through proper motion This group of stars is known as the Ursa Major Moving Group

Several bright galaxies are found in Ursa Major including the pair Messier 81 and Messier 82 above the bears head and the Pinwheel Galaxy a beautiful spiral galaxy northwest of the star Ursae Majoris The other well known spiral galaxies Messier 108 and Messier 109 can also be found in this constellation The constellation has about 50 galaxies that can be seen with a small telescope The bright planetary nebula Owl Nebula can be found along the bottom of the bowl of the Big Dipper 

The seven stars in the upper left corner of Ursa Major form an broken wikt linkasterismasterism called the Big Dipper This group has been recognized by almost all groups of people who live or lived in places where it can be seen in the sky and it is one of the best known star patterns The Big Dipper is helpful in finding the north star because an imaginary line drawn through the two stars on the right side will point directly at the north star These two stars are called The Pointers and they are very important on navigation by stars

Ursa Minor is a constellation in the northern sky It is often called the Little Bear or the Little Dipper Just like the related constellation Ursa Major or the Big Bear or Big Dipper it seems to have a long handle leading to a cup or ladle The end of the handle is the the North Star called Polaris

The ancient astronomer Ptolemy included Ursa Minor in his list of 48 constellations It is now one of the 88 modern constellations Ursa Minor is special because it includes the north celestial pole However this will change after after several hundred years because the Earth will change the direction of its axis That movement is called precession

Ursa Minor is often called the Little Dipper because its seven brightest stars seem to be in the shape of a dipper The star at the end of the dipper handle is Polaris the North Star

Polaris is the brightest star in the constellation It is a yellow white supergiant shining at 202 apparent magnitude It belongs to an unusual class of stars called Cepheid variables The brightness of Polaris can change The second brightest star is UMi It is a 208 orange giant star

The four stars in the bowl of the little dipper are very useful for star watchers They are of second third fourth and fifth magnitude These stars are an easy guide to knowing what magnitude stars are visible This is helpful for people who live in cities where light can make dim stars hard to see It is also a way of testing your eyesight

There is one dwarf galaxy in the area of the constellation It is called Ursa Minor Dwarf

Drawings of Ursa Minor often show it as a baby bear with an unusually long tail In some stories the tail is so long because the baby bear was held by the tail and spun around the pole

Greek mythology connected Ursa Minor and Ursa Major to the story of Callisto and Arcas However one older version of the story has Botes in place of Arcas In that story Ursa Minor was a dog This earlier tradition explains both the length of the tail and a older name for Polaris The North Star used to be called Cynosura which means the dogs tail

In another story from early Greek mythology the seven stars of the Little Dipper were seven sisters They were Atlas daughters the Hesperides They were part of a story with the nearby constellations Botes Ursa Major and Draco

Polaris also known as Alpha Ursae Minoris or the North Star is a somewhat bright star that is almost straight above Earths north pole Because of this when it is seen from Earth it looks like it always stays in the same place in the sky This is different than other stars which look like they move in a circle in the sky because of the Earths rotation Because Polaris is always straight above the north pole looking for it in the sky is an easy way to tell which way is north Many years ago sailors used Polaris to help them figure out where they were on the ocean and what way they were moving

Polaris is about 430 light years from the Earth and has an apparent magnitude of 197 and an absolute magnitude of 364 Polaris is actually a triple star but you need some binoculars or a small telescope to see the second star and a very powerful telescope to see the third star 

Even though Polaris is the North Star today this has not always been the case The place in the sky that the Earths north pole points at changes slowly over time This movement is called stellar precession In 3000 BC a faint star called Thuban in the constellation of Draco was the North Star Polaris did not become the North Star until about AD 500 It will get closer to straight above the Earths north pole until sometime in 2102 Then it will move away again It will be the closest star to the pole until about AD 3000

In geometry a hypercube is an n dimensional analogue of a square and a cube It is a closed compact convex figure whose 1 skeleton consists of groups of opposite parallel line segments aligned in each of the spaces dimensions at right angles to each other and of the same length 

An n dimensional hypercube is also called an n cube The term measure polytope is also used notably in the work of HSM Coxeter but it has now been superseded

The hypercube is the special case of a hyperrectangle

A unit hypercube is a hypercube whose side has length one unit Often the hypercube whose corners are the 2n points in Rn with coordinates equal to 0 or 1 is called the unit hypercube

A point is a hypercube of dimension zero If one moves this point one unit length it will sweep out a line segment which is a unit hypercube of dimension one If one moves this line segment its length in a perpendicular direction from itself it sweeps out a two dimensional square If one moves the square one unit length in the direction perpendicular to the plane it lies on it will generate a three dimensional cube This can be generalized to any number of dimensions For example if one moves the cube one unit length into the fourth dimension it generates a 4 dimensional unit hypercube This process of sweeping out volumes can be formalized mathematically as a Minkowski sum the d dimensional hypercube is the Minkowski sum of d mutually perpendicular unit length line segments and is therefore an example of a zonotope

The hypercubes are one of the few families of regular polytopes that are represented in any number of dimensions 

The hypercube family is the first of three regular polytope families labeled by Coxeter as n The other two are the hypercube dual family the cross polytopes labeled as n and the simplices labeled as n A fourth family the infinite tessellation of hypercubes he labeled as n

Another related family of semiregular and uniform polytopes is the demihypercubes which are constructed from hypercubes with alternate vertices deleted and simplex facets added in the gaps labeled as hn

In general rotation is a planar phenomenon requiring two dimensions to operate Any additional dimensions in the space that the rotating object is embedded in manifests itself as a stationary set

No rotation is possible in 1 dimension An object in 1 dimension cannot rotate without leaving that 1 dimensional space

In 2 dimensions both dimensions are used for rotation leaving a 0 dimensional stationary point Hence an object in 2 dimensions rotate about a point The rotational axis commonly associated with 2 dimensional rotation actually lies outside of the 2 dimensional space itself and thus is merely an artifact of anthropocentric bias toward 3 dimensional space Hence rotation in 2 dimensions is more properly understood as rotation about a center of rotation Rotations in 2 dimensions are uniquely identified by the center of rotation and the rate of rotation

In 3 dimensions objects rotate about an axis a stationary line since there is one dimension left over as the other two participate in the rotation The rotational axis is peculiar to odd numbered dimensions Rotations in 3 dimensions are uniquely identified by the axis of rotation and the rate of rotation

Rotation in 4 dimensions are of two kinds plane rotations and composite rotations A plane rotation has a stationary plane which an object may rotate around This is because two dimensions participate in the rotation while the other two are stationary Objects in 4 dimensions can also rotate independently in these two leftover dimensions resulting in a composite rotation composed of two plane rotations at two independent rates of rotation These composite rotations have a stationary point just as in 2 dimensions Hence rotation in 4 dimensions are identified by a center of rotation and two rates of rotation

In 5 dimensions rotations have either a rotational axis or a rotational 3 space With the former there are two independent rates of rotation just as in 4 dimensions With the latter there is 1 rate of rotation

In general in n dimensions if n is odd then rotations have an axis and there are2 possible simultaneous plane rotations around that axis If n is even then rotations have stationary points with n2 possible simultaneous plane rotations Each possible plane rotation has its own rate of rotation

The graph of the n hypercubes edges is isomorphic to the Hasse diagram of the simplexs face lattice This can be seen by orienting the n hypercube so that two opposite vertices lie vertically corresponding to the simplex itself and the null polytope respectively Each vertex connected to the top vertex then uniquely maps to one of the simplexs facets and each vertex connected to those vertices maps to one of the simplexs n 3 faces and so forth and the vertices connected to the bottom vertex map to the simplexs vertices

This relation may be used to generate the face lattice of an simplex efficiently since face lattice enumeration algorithms applicable to general polytopes are more computationally expensive

Non fiction is writing about facts Although non fiction is supposed to be truthful sometimes it may not be People normally assume that authors mean to be truthful but they might make mistakes Writing is normally split into two parts non fiction and fiction As well as non fiction books there are also pictures and films

The movie has also found popularity over the years because of television and VHS in 1994 the movie became one of the best selling movies of the year 21 years after its first premiere No other non Disney musical animated movie has make such a great comeback in popularity which inspried a direct to video sequel Charlottes Web 2 Wilburs Great Adventure which Paramount released in the US on March 18 2003 followed by a live action film version of E B Whites original story which was released on December 15 2006 The movie was presented by Pulitzer Prize in 1985 the year in which author E B White died E B White himself wrote about the nature of this work based on the original owner of the public

A litter of 11 piglets are born to a sow on a farm owned by the Arable family The 11th of the 11 baby pigs is a runt and the sow cannot feed it so John Arable decides to do away with it However when his daughter Fern Arable hears of the pigs fate she rescues him and tells it is unfair to kill a helpless piglet since it is smaller than the others John agrees and Fern is allowed to keep the runt piglet as a pet naming him Wilbur Fern and Wilbur loved each other Fern takes Wilbur around in a baby carriage and gives him a bath However after only six weeks of raising him John Arable tells Fern that its time for him to be sold And Wilbur was no longer a baby pig but a full grown pig Fern sadly says good bye as the young pig is sold down the street to her uncle Homer Zuckerman When Wilbur wants to play with a lamb the lambs father says that sheep do not play with pigs because its only a matter of time before they are turned into smoked bacon and ham Wilbur starts crying saying that he does not want to die but a voice from above tells him to chin up Wilbur goes to sleep comforted

The next day she sings a song about chinning up and reveals herself to be a spider named Charlotte Charlotte saves Wilbur by writing messages in her web hence the title of the movie She starts to write messages in her web calling him terrific and some pig The messages get a lot of attention from the media and other neighbors to the fair Wilbur is such a media hit that this convinces the Arables Zuckermans and Fussys to keep him and not kill him Charlotte eventually lays her eggs and dies When the baby spiders are born most of them leave Three of them stay and for a number of years a few of Charlottes kids stay around the farm and keep Wilbur company But as much as Wilbur loves them they will never replace the memory of his friend Charlotte

The movie was released to theaters on March 1 1973 by Paramount Pictures in the United States It was released limitedly on February 22 1973 in New York City and also released in West Germany on March 30 1973 as well as August 11 in Sweden and August 25 in Japan

Rotten Tomatoes says that that the movie has a 74 fresh rating based on 19 reviewes with a score of 66 The RT community gave the movie an 86 apporval rating with a score of 710 Craig Butler of All Movie Guide criticized the animation and the musical score but said it was a faithful adaptation saying that no attempt has been made to soften the existential sadness at the storys core Dan Jardine criticized the songs and the Saturday morning cartoon quality of the animation but also says that Hamner kept just enough of Whites prose to keep the movie from being simply a painfully well intended experiment Christopher Null of Filmcriticcom said that the animation is sometimes downright bad but E B Whites classic fable needs little to make it come to life He later went on to say that the movie is a must own for anyone with children and a must see for everyone else He rated it four out of five stars When it was reissued on DVD the film was awarded an Oppenheim Toy Portfolio Gold Award

According to Gene Deitch a director of animation and friend of E B White the authors wife wrote the following words in a 1977 letter We have never ceased to regret that your version of Charlottes Web never got made The Hanna Barberra version has never pleased either of us a travesty EB White himself wrote of the film The story is interrupted every few minutes so that somebody can sing a jolly song I do not care much for jolly songs The Blue Hill Fair which I tried to report faithfully in the book has become a Disney World with 76 trombones But thats what you get for getting embroiled in Hollywood

Chin Up is sung by Charlotte the spider when she first meets Wilbur the pig in the barnyard She convinces him to look on the bright side

I Can Talk is sung by Wilbur the pig who had previously been unable to utter words The Goose realizes as she is sitting on her eggs that her new neighbor in the pen beside her Wilbur the pig has not been eating his food and that he seems to be downhearted She offers him an ear if he will come over to her and talk since she cannot get off of her eggs But soon she realizes that Wilbur cannot talk She encourages him to try And with a couple grunts and a Wa Wa Wa Wi Wi Willbur WILBUR Suddenly with the Gooses help Wilbur realizes he can talk and say all the things he wants Wilbur sings a song about his newfound linguistical skills while waking up some of the other farm animals with his middle of the night excitement

A Veritable Smorgasbord is introduced and sung in the story by the Goose reprised by the Goose and Templeton It is reprised once more this time at a double time tempo sung solo by Templeton

Zuckermans Famous Pig is the title given to Wilbur the pig hero which saves him from being slaughtered in the story and the theme of the finale song in the film The song was composed and arranged in a barbershop quartet style by the Sherman Brothers in keeping with the time and place of the story It was covered by the Brady Kids and was chosen for release on their first single taken from The Brady Bunch Phonographic Album by producer Jackie Mills

Weve Got Lots in Common is sung by Wilbur to the new gosling Jeffery who like Wilbur is a runt Wilbur passes on one of the lessons which Charlotte has taught him The other barnyard animals sing along as well In the promotional trailer for distributors a rare piece of footage of the Sherman Brothers singing Weve Got Lots In Common can be seen In the footage Richard Sherman plays piano while Robert Sherman stands over his brothers shoulder and sings along The song was shot in an unnamed recording studio in Los Angeles in 1972

Mother Earth and Father Time is introduced in the story by Charlotte and reprised once more in the film as Charlotte is dying According to The Annotated Charlottes Web by Peter F Neumeyer some fans of the book are not in favor of the songs placement in the film because it supplants E B Whites narrative words And she didnt move again which purists find extremely moving The Sherman Brothers father songwriter Al Sherman believed the Charlottes Web song score and Mother Earth and Father Time in particular to be the brothers finest work The lyric addresses the idea of putting perspective on ones life In the storyline the song is sung by Charlotte at the end of her life Ironically Al Sherman died shortly after the film was released

There Must Be Something More is introduced in the story when Fern is learning about love from a little runt she saved from an untimely death when her father was about to do away with it Fern found it to be an injustice and relates herself saying to her father if she had been small would he have killed her too Her father gives in and lets her raise the pig she names Wilbur Fern learns about Love and Life through Wilbur and sings a song to tell Wilbur just how much she loves him The song goes through the first two weeks of Wilburs life with Fern The song is sung by Fern to a baby Wilbur in a motherly way The song is then reprised briefly by Wilbur when Fern gets a bit older begins to show an interest in young Henry Fussy Suddenly Wilbur is no longer as much of a priority in Ferns life Charlotte explains to Wilbur that this is the nature of the world

Charlottes Web is the title song of the movie In the movie the song is sung back to back with Deep in the Dark The title song was covered by the The Brady Bunch among others In the movie Charlotte tells Wilbur to go to sleep and she would see him in the morning and she sings a song called Deep In the Dark to put the barnyard to sleep 

The title song was covered by the The Brady Bunch among others The Brady Bunch Phonographic Album features three Sherman Brothers songs including River Song from Tom Sawyer Zuckermans Famous Pig and Charlottes Web Their cover of the song is also featured on their Greatest hits album Its a Sunshine Day The Best of The Brady Bunch
