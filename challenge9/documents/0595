Ernest Ernie Coombs CM who was most famous for being the host of the popular Canadian television TV show called Mr Dressup Mr Dressup was on TV for a very long time

He was born in Lewiston Maine in 1927 After he finished school at the North Yarmouth Academy he decided to find work entertaining children He first started learning how to do this when he moved to Canada in 1963 and started working for Fred Rogers on an early version of Mister Rogers Neighborhood This show was on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation TV channel After Rogers moved back to the United States in 1964 Coombs stayed in Canada His next work was on a TV show called Butternut Square which was on TV from 1964 to 1967

After Butternut Square ended Coombs started the Mr Dressup TV show It would become one of Canadas longest running childrens TV shows As Mr Dressup he would do art sing songs tell stories and play childrens games In each show Mr Dressup would dress up in costumes that he would find in a box he called his Tickle Trunk

Coombs became a Canadian citizen in 1994

Coombs had a stroke on September 10 2001 He died on September 18 2001 in Toronto Ontario He was 73 years old when he died

Pleiotropism is a central term in developmental genetics In pleiotropism a single gene affects a number of phenotypic traits in the same organism 

These pleiotropic effects often seem to be unrelated to each other The usual underlying mechanism is that the same gene is activated in several different tissues producing apparently different effects It follows that the phenomenon must be extremely common since most genes will have effects in more than one tissue 

The term may be contrasted with pleiomorphism in which a genetically uniform group of organisms shows variable phenotypes

Pleiotropy has significance for the theory of evolution It has often been claimed that some heritable features of animals are not the product of adaptation by natural selection Much of this may be explained by pleiotropism Strong selection for one or two aspects of gene function will automatically bring along some other pleiotropic traits These other traits though inherited may be neutral or even slightly deleterious in terms of selection

Antagonistic pleiotropy refers to the expression of a gene resulting in multiple competing effects some beneficial but others detrimental to the organism Three circumstances are possible

1 Simultaneously a gene may cause deleterious traits which are outbalanced by the survival value of positive traits

2 A gene may increase fitness in the younger fertile organism yet contribute to decreased fitness later in life The reproductive contribution at the younger stages of life will ensure the spread of such a gene

3 A gene may increase fitness in some habitats but not others Its survival in the population is then balanced An example is a bacterial gene which enhances glucose use at the expense of the ability to use other energy sources This has positive effects when there is plenty of glucose but can be lethal if lactose is the only available food source

Empire of the Sun is an Australian electronic music group which started in 2007 The band is made up of two musicians Luke Steele of The Sleepy Jackson and Nick Littlemore of Pnau The pair achieved chart success with their first single Walking on a Dream which got to number ten on the Australian charts and reached 64 on the UK Singles Chart

Their first album also called Walking on a Dream released in October 2008 won a platinum award in Australia Another single from the album We Are the People reached the top 25 Recently Empire of the Sun was in the news for getting to fourth position on the BBCs annual Sound of Music poll 2009 They are currently signed to EMI Australia and Virgin UK In November 2009 the band won four awards from the Australian Recording Industry Association They were given the award for the best group the best pop release the Album of the Year and Single of the Year

Empire of the Sun is very different Luke Steele said that we are not a band Were anything we want it to be The two musicians play a lot of instruments and dress in elaborate stage costumes

The Visegrd Group is a group of four central European countries the Czech Republic Hungary Poland and Slovakia It was created in 1991 in Visegrd Hungary for the purposes of better cooperation among these countries

The standard error is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of a statistic The term may also be used to refer to an estimate of that standard deviation which comes from a sample from the whole group

The average of some part of a group is the usual way to estimate the average for the whole group It is often too hard or costs too much money to measure the whole group But if a different sample is measured it will have an average that is a little bit different from the first sample The standard error of the mean is a way to know how close the average of the sample is to the average of the whole group It is a way to know how sure you can be about the average from the sample 

In real measurements the true value of the standard deviation of the mean for the whole group is usually not known So the term standard error is often used to mean a close guess to the true number for the whole group The more measurements there are in a sample the closer the guess will be to the true number for the whole group 

One way to find the standard error of the mean is to have lots of samples First the average for each sample is found Then the average and standard deviation of those sample averages is found The standard deviation for all the sample averages is the standard error of the mean This can be a lot of work Sometimes it is too difficult or costs too much money to have lots of samples 

where

How big does the sample need to be so that the estimate of the standard error of the mean is close to the actual standard error of the mean for the whole group There should be at least six measurements in a sample Then the standard error of the mean for the sample will be within 5 of the standard error of the mean if the whole group were measured 

There is another equation to use if the number of measurements is for 5 or more of the whole group

There are special equations to use if a sample has less than 20 measurements 

Sometimes a sample comes from one place even though the whole group may be spread out Also sometimes a sample may be made in a short time period when the whole group covers a longer time In this case the numbers in the sample are not independent Then special equations are used to try to correct for this 

A practical result One can become more sure of an average value by having more measurements in a sample Then the standard error of the mean will be smaller because the standard deviation is divided by a bigger number However to make the uncertainty in an average value half as big the sample size needs to be four times bigger This is because the standard deviation is divided by the square root of the sample size To make the uncertainty one tenth as big the sample size needs to be one hundred times bigger 

Standard errors are easy to calculate and are used a lot because

The relative standard error is the standard error divided by the average This number is smaller than one Multiplying it by 100 gives it as a percentage of the average This helps to show whether the uncertainty is important or not For example consider two surveys of household income that both result in a sample average of 50000 If one survey has a standard error of 10000 and the other has a standard error of 5000 then the relative standard errors are 20 and 10 respectively The survey with the lower relative standard error is better because it has a more precise measurement 

In fact people who need to know average values often decide how small the uncertainty should be before they decide to use the information For example the US National Center for Health Statistics does not report an average if the relative standard error exceeds 30 NCHS also requires at least 30 observations for an estimate to be reportedcitation neededdateOctober 2011

For example there are many redfish in the water of the Gulf of Mexico To find out how much a 42 cm long redfish weighs on average it is not possible to measure all of the redfish that are 42 cm long Instead it is possible to measure some of them The fish that are actually measured are called a sample The table shows weights for two samples of redfish all 42 cm long The average weight of the first sample is 0741 kg The average weight of the second sample is 0735 kg a little bit different from the first sample Each of these averages is a little bit different from the average that would come from measuring every 42 cm long redfish 

The uncertainty in the mean can be used to know how close the average of the samples are to the average that would come from measuring the whole group The uncertainty in the mean is estimated as the standard deviation for the sample divided by the square root of the number of samples minus one The table shows that the uncertainties in the means for the two samples are very close to each other Also the relative uncertainty is the uncertainty in the mean divided by the mean times 100 The relative uncertainty in this example is 238 and 250 for the two samples 

Knowing the uncertainty in the mean one can know how close the sample average is to the average that would come from measuring the whole group The average for the whole group is between a the average for the sample plus the uncertainty in the mean and b the average for the sample minus the uncertainty in the mean In this example the average weight for all of the 42 cm long redfish in the Gulf of Mexico is expected to be 07230759 kg based on the first sample and 07170753 based on the second sample

Adaptive radiation is rapid evolutionary radiation It is an increase in the number and diversity of species within each lineage 

Some definitions phrase it in terms of a single clade Adaptive radiation is the rapid proliferation of new taxa from a single ancestral group However in the most striking cases such as occurred in the Triassic after the greatest extinction event in Earth history many lines underwent rapid radiation simultaneously This must have something to do with the availability of ecological niches and relative absence of competition 

The Ediacaran biota were the result of an early metazoan radiation The greatest radiation of all took place early in the Cambrian period when most of our animal phyla evolved see List of animal phyla 

In the relative absence of competition groups diversify to fill available habitats and niches This is an evolutionary process driven by natural selection 

The term was introduced and discussed by George Gaylord Simpson the palaeontologist who contributed to the modern evolutionary synthesis Others prefer not to use the term Robert L Carroll prefers to use the term major evolutionary transitions though it turns out that all or most of these could also be described as adaptive radiations Others use terms like macroevolution or even megaevolution as if the processes are different from those which occur below species level It is part of evolutionary theory that all processes take place at the level of populations All agree though that the speed of evolution does change however it is measured

Records of timing are bedevilled by gaps in the fossil record often at those crucial early stages when numbers are low and geographical distribution is severely restricted In reality there are long periods within nearly every lineage for which the fossil record remains unknownp297 These gaps affect our knowledge of timing and of morphological change

Nevertheless when a string of distinctly new lineages appear within a short interval it seems reasonable to conclude that the rate of change has been surprisingly fast An example would be the appearance of new reptilian groups in the Upper Triassic Using the term reptile broadly the groups include dinosaurs pterosaurs ichthyosaurs Chelonia crocodylomorphs Phytosaurs 

These radiations occurred after the great mass extinction at the end of the Palaeozoic era and the Triassic itself had several lesser extinctions Unfortunately the Triassic has the poorest fossil record of the whole of the Mesozoic era

The evolution of a novel feature may permit a group to diversify by making new ways of living possible A most striking example is the cleidoic egg developed in early amniotes which permitted vertebrates to invade the land The cleidoic egg must have been developed in the latest Devonian or early Carboniferous Amphibians who branched off before this event still lay their eggs in water and so are limited in the extent to which they can exploit land environments 

An example of a more modest innovation is the evolution of a fourth cusp in the mammalian tooth This trait permits a vast increase in the range of foodstuffs which can be fed on Evolution of this character has thus increased the number of ecological niches available to mammals The trait arose a number of times in different groups during the Cenozoic and in each instance was immediately followed by an adaptive radiation With birds the evolution of flight opened new possibilities and at least two huge adaptive radiations occurred

Adaptive radiations often occur as a result of an organism entering an environment with unoccupied niches such as a newly formed lake or isolated island chain The colonizing population may diversify rapidly to take advantage of all possible niches

In Lake Victoria an isolated lake which formed recently in the African rift valley over 300 species of cichlid fish adaptively radiated from one parent species in just 15000 years

In about convert6500sqmikm2abbron the Hawaiian Islands have the most diverse collection of drosophilid flies in the world living from rainforests to mountain meadows About 800 Hawaiian drosophilid species are known

Studies show a clear flow of species from older to newer islands There are also cases of colonization back to older islands and skipping of islands but these are much less frequent By potassiumargon radioactive dating the present islands date from 04 million years ago to 10mya The oldest member of the Hawaiian archipelago still above the sea is Kure Atoll which can be dated to 30 mya The archipelago itself produced by the Pacific plate moving over a hot spot has existed for far longer at least into the Cretaceous Previous islands now beneath the sea form the Hawaiian Emperor seamount chain

All of the native drosophilid species in Hawaiokinai have apparently descended from a single ancestral species that colonized the islands about 20 million years ago The subsequent adaptive radiation was spurred by a lack of competition and a wide variety of vacant niches Although it would be possible for a single pregnant female to colonise an island it is more likely to have been a group from the same species

There are other animals and plants on the Hawaiian archipelago which have undergone similar if less spectacular adaptive radiations

Adaptive radiations commonly follow mass extinctions following an extinction many niches are left vacant A classic example of this is the replacement of the non avian dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous with mammals in the Palaeocene

The percentile is a measurement in statistics To find a certain percentile a frequency distribution of the results is done they are ranked These frequency distributions are then split into 1 steps Given this ranking a certain percentile then groups all the ranks that are lower than it For example a test score that is greater than 75 of the people taking the test is said to be in the 75th percentile The top 5 of a test would be the 95th percentile 

The 50th percentile is called the median

The Grand Coulee used to be a river in the US state of Washington This dry river stretches for sixty miles from the Grand Coulee Dam to Soap Lake A feature known as Dry Falls divides the Coulee into two parts Dry Falls is thought to be the remains of the largest waterfall ever two or three times higher than Niagara Falls

The Grand Coulee is granite bedrock which is 40 to 60 million years old The volcanic basalt is convert2000mft thick The coulee is said to have been made when the Columbia River was blocked by a large glacier At the end of the last ice age the Columbia River went back to its old route and left the coulee The coulee is a mile wide and was formed by a river that now flows a different way

The area surrounding the Grand Coulee is shrub land It has a rainfall of twelve inches per year The Lower Grand Coulee contains the Park Blue Alkali Lenore and Soap lakes Until recently the Upper Coulee was dry

The Columbia Basin Project dammed the river in 1952 It used the Grand Coulee as an irrigation network The Upper Grand Coulee was dammed and made Banks Lake The lake is filled by pumps from the Grand Coulee Dam Banks Lake feeds a hundred mile irrigation system

Latent autoimmune diabetes of adults is extremely similar to both Type 1 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes although the disease is autoimmune insulin resistance accompanies the disease as it does Type 2 diabetes

Most latent autoimmune diabetic people are thin although there are many people that are overweight to slightly obese who have the LADA The differences between LADA and true type 2 diabetes is unlike many with the latter those with LADA become insulin dependent within 3 12 years based on different sources

Latent autoimmune diabetes of adults is very different from true type 1 diabetes in that the condition happens gradually instead of rapid its different from type 2 diabetes in that although the latter like LADA occurs gradually with latent autoimmune diabetes of adults there is also autoimmunity associated

People with LADA are misdiagnosed as having Type 2 diabetes except that LADA has GAD antibodies 

Contrary to common belief some people with latent autoimmune diabetes do have family histories of Type 2 diabetes involving their parents sister brother uncles aunts cousins etc Also LADA does not affect children and teenagersfactdateJanuary 2010 and usually affects people age 35 and older but can affect anyone between 23 30 years of age

People with LADA usually control their diabetes using very similar methods and changes of lifestyle to Type 2 diabetes eating right exercising and oral medications weight loss is optional Unlike Type 2 diabetics who might never need to inject insulin however the LADA patients become insulin dependent within several years By contrast only 20 to 30 of those with Type 2 diabetes eventually become insulin dependent

There are glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies connected with the latent autoimmune diabetes Moreover there are also TCF7L2 genes associated with Type 2 diabetes which are also connected with LADA

The complications of latent autoimmune diabetes of adults are highly similar to those for types 1 and 2 diabetes stroke heart disease gangrene kidney trouble heart attacks etc

George Gaylord Simpson was an American paleontologist Simpson was perhaps the most influential paleontologist of the twentieth century and a major participant in the modern evolutionary synthesis 

He was an expert on extinct mammals and their intercontinental migrations He dispelled the myth that the evolution of the horse was a linear process culminating in the modern Equus caballus He coined the word broken wikt linkhypodigmhypodigm in 1940 and published extensively on the taxonomy of fossil and extant mammals

He was Professor of Zoology at Columbia University and Curator of the Department of Geology and Paleontology at the American Museum of Natural History from 1945 to 1959 He was Curator of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University from 1959 to 1970 and a Professor of Geosciences at the University of Arizona until his retirement in 1982

He was awarded the Linnean Societys Darwin Wallace Medal in 1958 He also received the Royal Societys Darwin Medal In recognition of his distinguished contributions to general evolutionary theory based on a profound study of palaeontology particularly of vertebrates in 1962

The James Norris Memorial Trophy is given out to the National Hockey Leagues best defense player who demonstrates throughout the season the greatest all round ability in the position The James Norris Memorial Trophy has been awarded 53 times to 22 different players since it was first created in 1954 At the end of each season members of the Professional Hockey Writers Association vote to decide the player who was the best defenseman during the regular season

The trophy is named in honour of James E Norris owner of the National Hockey Leagues Detroit Red Wings from 1932 to 1952 The trophy was first awarded at the end of the 195354 NHL season 

Bobby Orr of the Boston Bruins won the award for a record eight seasons in a row Doug Harvey won the award seven times while Nicklas Lidstrom has won it six times in his career and Ray Bourque won it five times during his career The Boston Bruins have won the most Norris Trophies with 14 The Montreal Canadiens are second with 11

There are only two players that have won both the Norris and Hart Memorial Trophy for the same season Bobby Orr who won both trophies for the 196970 197071 and 197172 seasons and Chris Pronger who won the Hart and Norris for the 19992000 NHL season

Seven different defensemen won the Hart Trophy before the Norris Trophys establishment Billy Burch Eddie Shore Herb Gardiner Albert Babe Siebert Ebbie Goodfellow Tommy Anderson and Babe Pratt

The voting is done at the end of the regular season by members of the Professional Hockey Writers Association and each voter picks their top five candidates on a 107531 points system Three finalists are named and the trophy is awarded at the NHL awards ceremony after the end of the playoffs

A carousel also known as a merry go round is a ride found in an amusement park or on a playground It includes a circle shaped rotating platform A carousel found in an amusement park has seats made to look like objects such as automobiles trains and animals Animals that can be seen on a carousel might be horses elephants and swans Carousels are often brightly decorated with lights paintings and animals around the outside A carousel found in an amusement park often moves by machine power A carousel is also a common toy on a childs playgrounds Playground carousels are not powered by a machine The children make the carousel spin by holding on to the handle bars that are attached to the rotating platform The child will then run in a circle while holding on to the handle bars making the merry go round spin The merry go round found on a playground will move faster or slower depending on how fast the child runs In this Wikipedia article you will be able to find other words for carousel that are commonly used a brief history about carousels animals that may found on carousels and the scientific principles of how machine powered carousels work

There are many words that have been invented to talk about carousels They originate from all over the world Both of the terms Merry go round and round about came from the United Kingdom The word carousel can also be spelled carrousel It is a word that came from the 17th century The word carousel is a French word which means a tilting match This refers to the jousting game played by knights Both merry go round and carousel are now used interchangeably in North America and The United Kingdom There are many words which have the same meaning as carousel Since it was a popular ride in the United Kingdom America and France each region had its own term Some people call carousels by different names In England a carousel can be called a roundabout galloper or tilt In France a carousel can be called a riding ring of wooden horses In America some people may call carousels flying horses whirlgig flying Dutchmen flying jinny Kellys goats spinning jinny hobby horses steam circus steam riding galleries galloping horse steam carousels carry us alls and the most popular merry go rounds Most of the words used in the 1700s were to attract customers Merry go round which means a ride rotating happily and Menagerie which means beasts The reason a carousel is generally used today is due to its tie to the origin of the ride

The earliest types of carousels were most likely created by Arabians The first carousels were made for adults to ride Today carousels are made for children to ride However the carousel was first recognized as being a carousel in Europe People most likely made the first carousels in the seventeenth century However carousels were used in France to practice a game they enjoyed playing For this game horsemen practiced playing a game on which they would ride wooden horses horses that were carved out of wood The wooden horses would be rotated by servants pulling at the rotating platform This would be similar to the playground carousels Or the horsemen would use real horses to rotate the platform The carousel emerged as a ride when a toy dealer in France showed wooden horses on a rotating platform moved by human power or horsepower in the beginning of 18th century Carousels became popular in America between 1880 and 1930 During this time there were around 5000 carousels built  Michael Dentzel an American who immigrated from German and lived in Philadelphia moved the rotary platform of his carousel using steam power or horsepower in 1814 Later the carousels found in amusement parks had platforms moved by a machine This concept is still being used today It was invented in 1898 in America Railroads were the first companies in America to purchase carousels for their customers enjoyment

The most popular of the carousel animals always has been and still is the horse Eighty percent of animals carved for carousels in America are horses Other animals that have been used on carousels include Mother Goose and Disney characters The romance side of the carousel animals is the side that faces the audience On the romance side the animal had extra carvings and decorations Most of the carousels in Europe and America turn the opposite direction of a clock or counterclockwise In Great Britain carousels turn the same direction as a clock or clockwise

A carousel is set up a little above the ground The platform rotates under motor power in the middle and can move up and down The number of seats resembling horses or other animals varies depending on the carousel but there are usually between 16 and 60 The horses on the platform are connected to a pole attached to both the floor and the ceiling of the ride The velocity of a carousels rotation is about 5 rounds a minute An average ride length is 2 to 3 minutes The speed of the ride is low in order to keep centrifugal force low because the faster it turns the more centrifugal force the ride will have The axis in the middle has centripetal force which is the opposite force of centrifugal force

Conrad Gessner was a Swiss naturalist and bibliographer His five volume Historiae animalium is a forerunner of modern zoology The flowering plant genus Gesneria is named after him 

He studied at Strasbourg Bourges and Paris In 1535 religious unrest drove him back to Zrich where he made an unwise marriage His friends came to his aid enabled him to study at Basel and in 1537 obtained for him the professorship of Greek at the newly founded academy of Lausanne Here he had leisure to devote himself to scientific studies especially botany 

In 15401541 he visited the famous medical university of Montpellier took his degree of doctor of medicine at Basel and then settled down to practise at Zrich where he obtained the post of lecturer in physics at the Carolinum the precursor of the University of Zrich There apart from a few journeys to foreign countries and annual summer botanical journeys in his native land he passed the remainder of his life He devoted himself to preparing works on many subjects of different sorts He died of the plague the year after his ennoblement

To his contemporaries he was best known as a botanist though his botanical manuscripts were not published till long after his death he himself issuing only the Enchiridion historiae plantarum and the Catalogus plantarum in four languages 

In 1545 he published his remarkable Bibliotheca universalis supposedly a catalogue of all writers who had ever lived with the titles of their works etc A second part Pandectarium sive partitionum universalium Conradi Gesneri Ligurini libri xxi appeared in 1548 only nineteen books being then concluded The last a theological encyclopaedia was published in 1549 but the last but one intended to include his medical work was never finished

His great zoological work Historiae animalium appeared in 4 vols folio 15511558 at Zrich a fifth being issued in 1587 This work is the starting point of modern zoology Not content with such vast works Gessner put forth in 1555 his book entitled Mithridates de differentis linguis an account of about 130 known languages with the Lords Prayer in twenty two languages while in 1556 appeared his edition of the works of Claudius Aelianus

Gessners work On fossil objects contains among much else a recognition of the true organic nature of some fossils

To non scientific readers Gessner is best known for his love of mountains and for his many excursions among them undertaken partly as a botanist but also for the sake of exercise and enjoyment of the beauties of nature In 1541 he prefixed to his Libellus de lacte et operibus lactariis a letter addressed to his friend J Vogel of Glarus as to the wonders to be found among the mountains declaring his love for them and his firm resolve to climb at least one mountain every year not only to collect flowers but in order to exercise his body In 1555 Gessner issued his narrative of his excursion to the Gnepfstein the lowest point in the Pilatus chain

Bernhard Rensch was a German evolutionary biologist and ornithologist who did field work in Indonesia and India He is probably best known as one of the architects of the modern evolutionary synthesis which he popularised in Germany His work on the evolution of geographically isolated populations and on evolution above the species level contributed to the modern synthesis He also worked extensively on animal behavior 

Renschs education and scientific work was interrupted by service in the German military during both World War I and World War II His autobiography published later in life translates as Life of a biologist in a turbulent century

In 1929 he published a classic book on species and speciation in which he proposed ideas which later were to become basic principles of taxonomy He recognised the significance of Moritz Wagners idea of geographical species splitting

In 1947 Rensch published Neuere Probleme der Abstammungslehre die Transspezifische Evolution This looked at how the evolutionary mechanisms involved in speciation might be extended to explain the origins of the differences between the higher level taxa His work contributed to the rapid acceptance of the synthesis in Germany

Kinect is a device being made by Microsoft for the Xbox 360 Kinect uses cameras and a special microphone to see and hear Xbox 360 users The device also uses equations to know what is a person and what is not It was first shown at E3 in Los Angeles in May of 2009 It has won many awards Kinect allows a user to move his or her body to control games movies and more People can move their hand to go through menus or they can use their whole body to control a body in a game Kinect is special because it is the first way to play games that does not use a controller

Kinect is expected to be in stores in late 2010 The MSRP is 14999 and the Kinect is also optionally bundled with a new Xbox 360 Microsoft has said they will advertise it almost like a new video game console They want Kinect to increase the time that people make games for Xbox 360 before a new video game console is made In the future Microsoft hopes Kinect starts a new idea of people using televisions computers and games with their hands and voices Eye Toy which is for the Playstation Series is Kinects main competitor

The Kinect was named the Fastest selling consumer electronics device by the Guinness World Records selling an average of 133333 kinects per day with a total of 8 million units in its first 60 days

George Ledyard Stebbins Jr was an American botanist and geneticist who was one of the leading evolutionary biologists of the 20th century Stebbins received his PhD in botany from Harvard University in 1931 He went on to the University of California Berkeley where his work led to a synthesis of plant evolution and genetics 

His most important publication was Variation and evolution in plants which combined genetics and Darwins theory of natural selection to describe plant speciation It helped form the modern evolutionary synthesis and still provides the framework for research in plant evolutionary biology According to Ernst Mayr Few later works dealing with the evolutionary systematics of plants have not been very deeply affected by Stebbins work 

He also researched and wrote widely on the role of hybridization and polyploidy in speciation and plant evolution his work in this area has had a lasting influence on research in the field

Stebbins was elected to the National Academy of Science was awarded the National Medal of Science He was involved in the development of evolution based science programs for California high schools as well as the conservation of rare plants in that state

In 1935 Stebbins was offered a genetics research position at the University of California Berkeley working with geneticist EB Babcock Babcock needed assistance with a large Rockefeller funded project on the genetics and evolution of plants from the genus Crepis Crepis commonly hybridized displayed polyploidy and could make seed without fertilization The collaboration between Babcock and Stebbins produced numerous papers and two monographs 

Stebbinss review The significance of polyploidy in plant evolution showed how polyploidy was important in developing large complex and widespread genera By looking at the history of polyploidy in plant families he argued that polyploidy was only common in herbaceous perennials but infrequent in woody plants and annuals As such polyploids played a conservative role in evolution since problems with fertility prevented the replication of new genetic material that might lead to a new line of evolution This work continued with the 1947 paper Types of polyploids their classification and significance which described Stebbins ideas about the role of paleopolyploidy in angiosperm evolution He argued that chromosome number may be a useful tool for the construction of phylogenies These reviews were highly influential and helped others study the role of polyploidy in evolution

In 1939 with Babcocks support Stebbins was made a full professor in the Department of Genetics at UC Berkeley after the Department of Botany failed to promote him Stebbins taught a course on evolution During his preparation he became excited by research combining genetics and evolution Stebbins directed his research towards evolution He became involved with the Society for the Study of Evolution in 1946 and was one of the few botanists in the new organization

He worked on the genetics of grass grown for grazing looking at polyploidy and the evolution of the Poaceae He produced an artificial autotetraploid grass from the diploid species Ehrharta erecta by treatment with the chromosome doubling agent colchicine He was able to establish the plant in the field and after 39 years of field trials found that the tetraploid was not as successful as its diploid parent in an unchanging environment

George Herbert Leigh Mallory was a British mountaineer who took part in three expeditions to Mount Everest in the early 1920s Mallory and his climbing partner Andrew Irvine both disappeared somewhere high on the North  East Ridge in an attempt to get to the top The pairs last known sighting was a few hundred feet from the summit Mallorys fate was unknown for 75 years until his body was discovered in 1999 Whether they made it to the summit or not still remains a mystery

George Mallory was famous for replying to the question Why do you want to climb Mount Everest with the reply Because its there which has been described as the most famous three words in the history of mountaineering Some questions have been raised inquiring whether Mallory had actually said it or if it was a newspaper reporter making it up

Mallory was born in Mobberly Cheshire the son of Herbert Leigh Mallory a clergyman who changed his name to Leigh Mallory in 1914 George had two sisters  one older one younger  and a younger brother called Trafford Leigh Mallory the World War II Royal Air Force commander

In 1896 Mallory went to Glengorse a boarding school in Eastbourne on the south coast of England having already transferred from a school in West Kirby At the age of 13 he won a scholarship to Winchester College In his second  to  last year at Winchester he was introduced to rock climbing and mountaineering by a master RLG Irving who took a small number of pupils climbing in the Alps every year In October 1905 Mallory entered Magdalane College Cambridge to study history There he became good friends with several members of the Bloomsbury Group including James Strachey Lytton Strachey Rupert Brooke John Maynard Keynes and Duncan Grant who painted many portraits of Mallory Mallory was a keen oarsman and rowed in his college eight but he did not row for Cambridge in the annual Oxford Cambridge Boat Race 

After getting his degree Mallory stayed in Cambridge for a year writing an essay he later published as Boswell the Biographer He lived briefly in France where Simon Bussy painted his portrait now in Londons National Portrait Gallery On his return he decided to become a teacher In 1910 he began teaching at Charterhouse School Godalming Surrey where he met the poet Robert Graves then a pupil in his autobiography Goodbye to All That Graves remembered Mallory who acted as best man at Robert Graves wedding in 1918 fondly both for his encouragement of Graves interest in literature in poetry and his instruction in climbing Graves recalled He was wasted at Charterhouse He tried to treat his class in a friendly way which puzzled and offended them

While at Charterhouse he met his wife Ruth Turner a taxi driver who lived in Goldalming and they were married in 1914 just six days before Britain and Germany went to war George and Ruth had two daughters and a son Clare born 1915 Beridge known as Berry and John In December 1915 Mallory joined the Royal Garrison Artillery as 2nd lieutenant and in 1916 participated in the shelling of the Somme under the command of Major Gwilym Lloyd George who was son of then Prime Minister David Lloyd George 

After the war he returned to Charterhouse resigning in 1921 to take part in the first Everest expedition

An atomic clock is an exact clock that works with atoms as opposed to most other clocks which are mechanical The frequency comes from the crossing radiation of electrons Atomic clocks are currently the most exact clocks of the world They are also called primary clocks

World wide there are over 260 atomic clocks at over 60 different places All data are collcted at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in Paris France The International Atomic Time is calculated there

Typography is a practical art the art of arranging how the printed word shall appear on the page Typography was born when print was born Indeed the early types were copies of the letterforms of scribes and the design of roman type was modelled on type used on Trajans column 

Typography includes not only letters but all the set of symbols in a font and it includes the overall design of a page or document It applies to any medium which may be read therefore it includes text on computer screens A typographer may design type select fonts and design the layout of pages and books The term does not cover the act of printing itself though many of the early printers were themselves typographers 

Typography in the 20th century was greatly influenced by three things

A traditional aim of the typographer would be to produce a page which is above all legible and attractive to read without its being obtrusive For display typography such as advertising the display must be noticed before it is read This had led to the development of many display typefaces which are highly visible and which are available in large sizes

Korean names today have different rules than they had in the past And this article mainly covers South Koreas The North Korean one could be different

Korean names have two parts One is the family name and the other is the given name

Park Chan Ho is a name of a Korean person Park is the family name and Chan Ho is the given name In the Korean language the family name comes first and the given name comes second Most Koreans feel uneasy when they are called in the reverse way or by only family name

Married men and women usually keep their full personal names and children take the fathers family name So a son of Ha Hi Ra and Choi Su Jong will be Choi something

Although Koreans have nicknames these usually come from their personal characteristics like appearance a physical defect or the word has similar pronunciation with his name They are different from the nicknames in the Western sense such as Bob Bill Liz and Kate Unfavorable nicknames are more common than favorable ones After growing up being called by nicknames is very rare

Koreans call someone with Si Yang Goon after the family name the given name or the full name 

Koreans call someone by only the given name itself or with the vocative postpositional word

Koreans call someone with   after the given name

Koreans call someone by only the given name itself or with the vocative postpositional word

Koreans call someone using the word indicates blood relation than their name itself

ex     

Koreans call someone using the job title than his name 

Let me give you examples using the words and 

Koreans call someone with the job title after his family name

ex  

Koreans call someone plus after the job title or by the combination like the family name the job title Nim

ex  or 

The family name is typically a single syllable and the given name two syllables There is no middle name in the Western sense Each syllable in Korean name usually has its Chinese character But its pronunciation is considerably different from the one in China In case of the given name Koreans place great importance on the meaning of each Chinese character And mainly naming centers take charge of naming a new baby

Yaque del Norte is the longest river in the Dominican Republic and the second longest river of the Hispaniola island after the river Artibonite

It is 296 km long and flows to the northwest into the Montecristi Bay Atlantic Ocean

Yaque or Yaqui is a Tano word given to two rivers One of those rivers the longest goes to the north of the island to the Atlantic Ocean and is called the Yaque del Norte and the second goes to the south to the Caribbean Sea and is called Yaque del Sur

During his first visit to America in 1492 Christopher Columbus saw for the first time this river at its mouth and he called it Ro de Oro because he found many small pieces of gold But later during his second visit he saw the river in other place and called it Ro de las Caas because many tall grasses were growing on the borders of the river But none of those names were ever used it has always been called Yaque or Yaque del Norte

Columbus built three forts near the river Esperanza Magdalena and Santiago the first two were abandoned and Santiago was moved to another place with the name of Santiago de los Caballeros Later Santiago de los Caballeros was moved again near the river but not in the original place

The source of the Yaque del Norte is at an elevation of 2580 m on the Pico del Yaque mountain in the central part of the Cordillera Central mountain range

But in this place the river is called Los Guanos or Ro de la Derecha The name Yaque del Norte is used only when this small river joins another small river Los Tablones or Ro de la Izquierda in Manabao to the west of Jarabacoa at an elevation of 900 m

From Manabao the river flows to the east through the northwestern part of La Vega province When it gets to Jarabacoa it turns to the north to the Santiago The River Jimenoa the only important right tributary of Yaque del Norte joins it at Jarabacoa

In Santiago de los Caballeros the river turns to the northwest and flows by the Yaque del Norte Valley the western part of the Cibao Valley

Its mouth is on the Montecristi Bay just to the south of the city of San Fernando de Monte Cristi on the Atlantic Ocean

Its most important left tributaries are the rivers Bao mina Mao and Guayubn

The city of Santiago de los Caballeros is the most important Dominican city close to the riverIt goes also near the cities of Jarabacoa Mao Guayubn Castauela and Monte Cristi

With an area of 7044 km its watershed is the largest of the Dominican Republic and the second largest of the island Its discharge is 970 cubic metres per second at Palo Verde to the southeast of San Fernando de Monte Cristi

The water of the river is used for irrigation mainly in the valley that goes from Santiago to Monte Cristi the Yaque del Norte Valley It is a very dry valley and without water it would be very difficult to grow any crop The most important crops here with irrigation are rice bananas and vegetables as tomato

Around Jarabacoa the river is used for some water sports with canoes and small boats

There are several dams along the river to generate electricity store the water for irrigation and prevent flooding

In music a whip or slapstick is a percussion instrument It consists of two pieces of wood joined by a hinge The pieces of wood are slapped together This makes a noise like a whip  There is a handle on each of the pieces of wood so that the player can hold it and slap them together without trapping his fingers 

The whip is often heard in modern orchestras bands and percussion groups Examples of a whip in classical music can be heard near the beginning of Ravels Piano Concerto and in Brittens Young Persons Guide to the Orchestra

There is another type of whip in which one plank is longer than the other It can be played with one hand The player shakes the instrument quickly and the small plank moves away from the large one then slaps back onto it It makes a different kind of sound from the whip and is properly called a slapstick  It has been used by several composers including Mahler Richard Strauss Ravel Mussorgsky and Hindemith

The Bering land bridge joined present day Alaska and eastern Siberia at times during the Pleistocene ice ages 

Its greatest extension was about 1000 miles north to south It was not glaciated because snowfall was extremely light the southwesterly winds from the Pacific Ocean lost their moisture over the fully glaciated Alaska Range 

The grassland steppe including the land bridge that stretched for several hundred miles into the continents on either side has been called Beringia It is believed that a small human population of at most a few thousand survived the ice age in Beringia It was isolated from populations in Asia for at least 5000 years Sometime after 16500 years ago it started to populate the Americas when the American glaciers that blocked the way southward melted

The Bering Strait the Chukchi Sea to the north and the Bering Sea to the south are all shallow seas During cycles of global cooling such as the most recent ice age enough sea water became concentrated in the ice caps of the Arctic and Antarctica that the subsequent drop in eustatic sea levels exposed shallow sea floors that have subsequently re flooded Other land bridges around the world have been created and re flooded in the same way approximately 14000 years ago mainland Australia was linked to both New Guinea and Tasmania the British Isles were an extension of continental Europe via the dry bed of the English Channel and the dry basin of the South China Sea linked Sumatra Java and Borneo to the Asian mainland

The rise and fall of global sea levels has exposed and submerged the bridging land mass called Beringia in several periods of the Pleistocene The Beringian land bridge is believed to have existed both in the glaciation that occurred before 35000 BP and during the more recent period 22000 7000 years Before Present The strait reopened about 15500 BP and by c 6000 BP the coastlines had assumed approximately their present configurations

The Bering land bridge is significant for several reasons not least because it is believed to have enabled human migration to the Americas from Asia about 25000 years ago A study by Hey has indicated that of the people migrating across this land bridge during that time period only 70 left their genetic print in modern descendants 

The 191718 NHL season was the first season of the National Hockey League The season was split into two halves December 19 to February 4 and February 6 to March 6 The Montreal Canadiens won the first half and Toronto the second half The Montreal Wanderers withdrew early in January 1918 after their rink the Westmount Arena burned down Toronto won the NHL playoff and then won the Stanley Cup by defeating the PCHAs Vancouver Millionaires three games to two in a best of five series

The November 10 1917 annual meeting of the NHA was presided over by Frank Calder who was the NHA secretary The NHA voted to stop operating

On November 17 1917 it was announced that the Quebec Bulldogs team would not play the next season but that the NHA season would continue

On November 26 1917 representatives of the NHA clubs met at the Windsor Hotel in Montreal The decision to start a new league was made which was named the National Hockey League

They also decied on several things for the NHL

A Toronto team was to be controlld for a wihle by the Arena Gardens while the problem of who owned the Toronto team was fixed The franchise had players from the Toronto Blueshirts including those who had been sent to other NHA teams for the second half of the 191617 NHA season While Eddie Livingstone who owned Toronto teams agreed to do this the NHL owners did not want to share any money with him Livingstone would sue for the Toronto teams revenues in 1918 George Kennedy owner of the Canadiens would later say

The Toronto players belong as a body to the National Hockey League for they were only loaned to the Toronto Arena Company though Livingstone tried to make the Arena Company believe that he controlled those players

The Toronto team played without a nickname for the season They would later be called the Toronto Arenas 

The NHL was not supposed to be a permanent league It was only supposed to exist until the NHA could fix the problem of teams in the NHA The NHA was involved in a lawsuit against the 228th Battalion who had a team in the NHA the year before and could or would not fold until that was finished

The OBrien Cup was given to the new NHL from the NHA and became the leagues championship trophy It was awarded to the winner of the NHL playoffs and that winner then went on to play for the Stanley Cup in a series against other leagues

On January 9 1918 the league decided to allow goaltenders to drop to the ice surface in order to make saves This was the first implemented and amended rule change in the National Hockey League It was done in response to Ottawas Clint Benedict who would fall to the ice to stop the puck even though it was against the rules

The new league had trouble getting players because there were other leagues at the time including the Pacific Coast Hockey Association Also making it difficult was many people were involved in World War I so they couldnt play hockey 

The Wanderers were in trouble from the start of the season They won their first home game but only had 700 people watch The Wanderers then lost the next three games and owner Lichtenhein threatened to withdraw from the league unless he could get some other players Although they could have acquired Joe Malone who led the NHL in scoring in the draft they turned to the PCHA and signed goaltender Hap Holmes They were also allowed to sign players like Frank Foyston Jack Walker and others if they could get the players to agree The Wanderers loaned Holmes to the Seattle Metropolitans of the PCHA but he eventually came back to the NHL when Seattle loaned him to Toronto 

A league meeting was planned to deal with the Wanderers but on January 2 1918 the it was fixed when the Montreal Arena burned down leaving the Canadiens and Wanderers without a place to play The Canadiens moved into the 3250 seat Jubilee Rink The Hamilton arena said the Wanderers could play there but instead Lichtenhein shut down the team on January 4 after the other clubs refused to give him any more players The remaining three teams would complete the season

The last player from the this season who played was Reg Noble who retired following the 1933 Stanley Cup playoffs

The first game of the season featured Toronto versus the Wanderers Montreals Dave Ritchie scored the first goal in NHL history and Harry Hyland had four goals in the Wanderers 109 victory which would be their only one in the NHL The opening game was played in front of 700 people 

On January 28 when Canadiens visited Toronto players Alf Skinner and Joe Hall started swinging their sticks at each other Both players received match penalties 15 fines and were arrested by the Toronto Police for disorderly conduct for which they received suspended sentences

Wanderers defaulted scheduled games against the Canadiens and Toronto when their arena burned down These were counted as losses in the standings though the games were not played 

The league did not accept the Wanderers resignation immediately electing to wait and see whether the team showed up for its scheduled match in Toronto on Saturday January 5 The deadline did expire and the once powerful team that had been known as the Little Men of Iron was thrown onto the scrap heap of hockey history The Wanderers scheduled games of January 2 and 5 were officially recorded in the standings as victories for their respective opponents the Canadiens and Torontos Holzman

The 2010 Atlantic hurricane season started on June 1 2010 and ended on November 30 2010 This is the time when hurricanes are likely to form Unlike the last three years a storm did not form in the month of May or earlier

On December 9 2009 the Colorado State University made their first forecast for the 2010 hurricane season They said there would be 11 to 16 named storms 6 to 8 hurricanes and 3 to 5 major hurricanes A major hurricane is a Category 3 storm or higher on the SaffirSimpson Hurricane Scale On April 7 2010 they made another forecast 15 named storms 8 hurricanes and 4 very strong hurricanes They said the season would be active because of several things including warm ocean waters which make hurricanes stronger North Carolina State University said that 2010 would have 15 to 18 named storms and 811 would become hurricanes On May 27 2010 the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration put out their forecast for the season They said it would be extremely active with 14 to 23 named storms 8 to 14 hurricanes and 3 to 7 very strong hurricanes

On June 2 2010 the Colorado State University team made another forecast saying that there would be 18 named storms 10 hurricanes and 5very strong hurricanes They said the chance of a very strong hurricane hitting the United States is 76 percent which is higher than the average of 52 percent On June 17 the Met Office said there would be 20 tropical storms However they do not issue forecasts on the number of hurricanes and very strong hurricanes A normal season has about 10 named storms so if these predictions are correct the 2010 season will have a high number of storms 

Tropical Depression One started just offshore of Honduras on June 25 Strengthening fast it became a tropical storm the next morning given the name Alex Tropical Storm Alex continued to strengthen fast striking central Belize on that same day with winds of 65 mph For about twelve hours Alex had weakened back to a tropical depression after moving further inland over the Yucatan Peninsula Alex would re strengthen into a tropical storm on June 27 while entering the Gulf of Mexico Tropical Storm Alex moved generally westward across the Gulf of Mexico strengthening further as it did so By June 29 winds from Alex were strong enough for it to become a hurricane While reaching its highest winds 105 mph Hurricane Alex struck land again in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas late on June 30 Alex died out over Mexico a few days after striking land 

Hurricane Alex caused 51 deaths and about 1885 billion in damage  

Tropical Depression Two had started in the western Gulf of Mexico on July 8 It stayed weak and did not become a tropical storm Two made landfall in southern Texas with winds of 35 mph Tropical Depression Two rapidly died over Mexico 

Tropical Depression Three started to the southeast of the Bahamas on July 22 It quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Bonnie but did not strengthen any further Tropical Storm Bonnie moved quickly westward making landfall in Cutler Bay Florida only the next day Bonnie quickly went back to tropical depression status while crossing Florida Instead of re strengthening Tropical Depression Bonnie died in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico 

One person drowned in Puerto Rico from what would become Tropical Storm Bonnie 

On August 2 a low pressure system had started Tropical Depression Four On the next morning Tropical Depression Four had strengthened and became Tropical Storm Colin Bad conditions for tropical cyclones were in the atmosphere and Colin quickly died out By August 5 the storm restarted itself and was again Tropical Storm Colin heading northward Cooling water temperatures later began to destroy the storm and Tropical Storm Colin died again just west of Bermuda 

Tropical Depression Five started in the southeast Gulf of Mexico near Florida It headed northwestward toward Louisiana There was no further strengthening so Tropical Depression Five did not become a tropical storm Nearing the coast of Louisiana Tropical Depression Five died just before making a landfall in the state on August 11 but the remains did reach land 

On August 19 Tropical Depression Six formed close to Africa On August 22 Tropical Depression Six strengthened to become Tropical Storm Danielle The next day the storm strengthened further and became Hurricane Danielle a Category 2 hurricane Suddenly bad conditions in the atmosphere meant that Danielle weakened back to a tropical storm A few hours later Danielle strengthened to a hurricane for a second time reaching Category 4 strength As Danielle went over the colder waters of the north Atlantic it weakened and was no longer a hurricane east of Newfoundland Danielle was never a threat to land

On August 23 a bad weather moved off of the East coast of Africa Two days later Tropical Depression Seven formed East of Hurricane Danielle and later strengthened and became Tropical Storm Earl on the same day On August 29th Earl strengthened into a hurricane On August 30 Earl impacted the northern Leeward Islands including Antigua and Barbuda and the British Virgin Islands while at the same time strengthening into a Category 4 hurricane After moving away from the Leeward Islands Earl was downgraded to a Category 3 hurricane due to changes in the eyewall of the storm However the hurricane quickly intensified back to a Category 4 Earl passed Cape Hatteras in the US state of North Carolina on September 2nd bringing heavy rainfall and strong winds to the area Buildings in the area were not damaged much as houses along the coast were built to stand against hurricanes Earl travelled north along the US coast weakening down to a tropical storm when it reached Nova Scotia in Canada 

Damage from Earl was minimal in the US but Earl caused 150 million of damage in the Caribbean

On August 30 an area of bad weather that had come from Africa gained enough strength to be named as Tropical Storm Fiona skipping the status of being a tropical depression Fiona struggled to strengthen further as it was close to the much more powerful Hurricane Earl Fiona died just south of Bermuda but dropped an inch of rain on the island

Another tropical wave emerged off Africa near the end of August Good conditions meant that the tropical wave developed into a tropical depression on September 1st Later that day it strengthened to become Tropical Storm Gaston However bad conditions meant that Gaston weakened and died soon after There was a possibility that the leftovers of Gaston could re strengthen and affect the Caribbean however this did not happen

The leftovers of Tropical Depression Eleven E from the Pacific Ocean re strengthened over the Bay of Campeche By August 5 the storm had enough power to be called a tropical depression Later in the day it strengthened further to become Tropical Storm Hermine The storm reached land in north eastern Mexico on September 7 as a tropical storm Hermine blew over trees and power lines in the Rio Grande valley and one person drowned due to a strong sea current in Texas Hermine also created at least two tornadoes

A tropical wave from Africa strengthened quickly on September 8 to become a tropical depression Later it strengthened further to become Tropical Storm Igor to the south of the Cape Verde islands Igor weakened to a tropical depression due to mixing with another area of bad weather but then strengthened to a tropical storm and then a hurricane on September 11 Shortly after becoming a hurricane Igor strengthened faster reaching strong category 4 hurricane status the following day By September 17 it looked like Igor would hit Bermuda in some way which it did the following day Bermuda only got minor effects from Igor unlike Hurricane Fabian in 2003 which almost destroyed parts of the island From there Igor started moving north and then northeast toward Canada weakening to a tropical storm early on September 21 and dying later that day

On March 16 2011 World Meteorological Organization retired the names Igor and Tomas from its rotating name lists The names were replaced with Ian and Tobias

Pool also known as pocket billiards is the general term for a family of cue sports These games are played on a pool table with six holes cut into them called pockets into which balls are deposited as one of the main goals of play

Outside the billiards industry the various games played on these tables are very often called pool This is due to an association with the poolrooms where gamblers pooled together their money to bet on horse races Because these places often provided billiard tables the term pool became linked to billiards Though the original pool games were played on pocketless carom billiards tables the name stuck to pocket billiards as it gained in popularity The traditional view of billiards as a refined and noble pastime did not blend well with the low class connotations of gambling Because of this the billiards industrys attempts to distance itself from the term pool beginning in the late 19th century They were largely unsuccessful

There are hundreds of pool games Some of the more well known include eight ball nine ball straight pool and one pocket The game of snooker is played on a table with pockets but is considered separate from pool It is governed internationally by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association and the International Billiards and Snooker Federation There are also hybrid games combining traits of both pool and carom billiards such as English billiards American four ball billiards cowboy pool and bottle pool

As a competitive sport pool is governed internationally by the World Pool Billiard Association which has national affiliates such as the US Billiard Congress of America and which represents pool in the World Confederation of Billiard Sports which in turn represents all forms of cue sports in the International Olympic Committee

Pool uses different equipment from carom billiards In addition pool tables having pockets the balls for pool are generally smaller and range from convert225inmm2 in diameter to convert2375inmm2 in diameter By comparison carom billiard balls are generally convert2375inmm2 or convert615mmin2 While UMB the International Olympic Committee recognized world carom billiards authority permits balls as small as convert610mmin2 no major manufacturer produces such balls any longer For that reason the normal standard is convert615mmin2 Modern pool tables range in size from convert35ftm2 by convert7ftm2 to convert45ftm2 by convert9ftm2 Modern cue sticks are generally convert585incm1 long for pool while cues prior to 1980 were designed for straight pool and had an average length of convert575incm1 while carom billiards cues are generally convert56incm1 long

Hanbokrefers to traditional Korean clothing In North Korea Hanbok is referred to as Choson ot One of the most famous characteristics of Hanbok is its vivid colors and straight and curved lines Although its literal meaning is Korean clothing it today indicates specifically traditional garment especially that of Joseon dynasty

Hanbok has been a great part of Korean culture though history The trace of Hanbok is found even before Three Kingdom period of Korea The oldest form of hanbok can be seen in tomb mural paintings from the Goguryeo Kingdom Korea had two kinds of clothing tradition The rulers and noblemen usually wore clothing of different kinds of foreign styles But subjects continued to use a distinct style of indigenous clothing that today is known as Hanbok

There are several kinds of Hanbok People wore different sorts of Hanbok according to their social statuses sexes jobs and from time to time they chose special Hanbok for ceremonies People could figure out the wearers job educational background and even whether he or she got married or not There are Hanbok for men women royal court government officials and children Because Hanbok could reveal the wearers social status there were some government regulations on designs materials and shapes of Hanbok For example only royal families could use golden stripes on their Hanbok

Hanbok had a long history But the ancient one that is similar with todays Hanbok would be that in Three Kingdom period During this time noblewomen started wearing full length skirts and jackets and noblemen began to wear roomy trousers bound in at the ankles and belted at the waist and thus aristocrates began to wear what is similar with Hanbok in thses days

After Silla unified the Korean peninsula in the 7th century a new clothing style was introduced which combined original Korean dress with foreign elements imported from China This Chinese style of the Tang Dynasty was regarded as an international clothing style and was used for the uniforms of government servants and for ceremonial dress The most conspicuous difference is that while the original Korean cloth had a straight neckline the imported Chinese style had a rounded one In the ensuing Goryeo and Joseon periods the hanbok underwent various changes in terms of fashion and the form that has been known today dates from Joseon Koreans carefully consider their national identity in the Sirhak or Practical Learning movement of the 17th and 18th centuries and in fashion as in other fields whatever was imported or influenced by foreign factors was subsequently Koreanized

In the Joseon period most of attire was unified and most Koreans dressed in a similar way Even so differences in social status appeared in little differences of design material and decoration so that Koreans in those days could indirectly recognize the class rank educational level and character of the owner of it by fashion style Although the basic shape was little similar we can also tell the season appeared in paintings from this period by the matrial that is used in clothing and the use of seasonal attire

Hanbok consists of various components The most famous ones are Jeogori Chima and Baji Jeogori is a shirts or a jacket for both of female and male Chima is a skirt which is usually worn full Men usually wore Jeogori and baggy pants called Baji Women wore the ensemble of Jeogori and Chima

Jeogori and Chima are the basic form of Hanbok for female and Baji and Jeogori were for men But therer are other garments of Hanbok There are Jokki Magoja and Po Jokki is a vest Magoja is an outer jaekct and Po is an overall outher robe or overcoat

There are accessories and headdresses that go together with Hanbok Women wore a wig called Gache Like the case of Western the bigger and heavier the wigs were the more elegant they were But this heavy wig was popular until 19th century and after that simple Gache was preferred to heavy ones due to Confucian values Women also had a long pin called Binyeo It was thrust though the knotted hair of a woman Various patterns were carved on Binyeo and it is often made of Jade

Traditionally Korean people have various kinds of Hanbok for different purposes There were Hanboks for men women royal court government officials children and special ceremonies like wedding and funeral Mens and womens everyday Hanboks were the basic forms

The mens jacket is designed to be long because sleeves were added and not to make the front part open the two sides of front jacket overlap The neck is gathered up into a collar with a white collar strip folded around the neckline Breast ties hold the two sides of the jacket together so that one side is overlapping the other Until the mid Joseon period the breast ties were short and thin and merely perform its practical purposes to fasten the two sides of the jacket but in the late Joseon era they became longer and thicker showing decorative aspect quite far from their practical usage The male costume could include a gown similar to a topcoat which the wearer dress over the jacket and pants with different sorts of hat and coronet for a noble effect People chose different gown from time to time depending on the occasion Although the generous cut of the mens clothes emphasized the individuality of the wearer the belt framed the upper body for a tidy shape or fit The typical male costume in those days is the gentlemans outfit of white or light green gown and black hat The harmony of black and white indicates a well rounded and rational intelligence and a dignified character A different girdle in terms of color on the chest adds variety to the contrast of black and white which could otherwise look serious and solemn

The womens Hanbok includes a jacket and skirt the mens has a jacket and pants and both of cloth for female and male have an optional gown for added formality The jackets of men and women are similar in shape their length and color was different The womens costume consists of a jacket and skirt with a sleeveless waistcoat and a gown worn when she need looking formal Ceremonial attire can be decorated with various ornaments including coronets bridal headpieces hairpins and pendants The upper garment fits neatly while the lower garment is more voluminous and wide and women usually wear various kinds of underwear under Chima The women of that time valued chastity and when they went out they covered their faces with a shawl or cloak which would prevent them from exposing to outside of the world They used a variety of colors and designs when they chose ornaments often standing for the cherished hopes of the age long life and happiness prosperity and posterity

More than three decades ago hanbok a traditional form of Korean clothing was popular Like all clothing hanbok also changed as time goes by with fluctuating fashion trends Hanbok designs changed a lot as it pass throughout Koreas turbulent history Hanbok we freely wear and see these days is reminiscent of the late Joseon Dynasty

Curved features are important in traditional hanbok design As they are not designed to be tight fitting the inherent beauty of hanbok is apparent in its elegance and style generated by the abundance of material The curves lines and vivid colours of hanbok have affected the Korean fashion industry By mixing traditional dress with modern fashion a series of fusion hanbok designs appeared Designs patterns and styles of hanbok have even been used to architecture

Although now hanbok become the ritual dress of choice worn only on traditional holidays Koreans love for hanbok is great The famous Korean classic dramas are making many foreigners take a more interest in traditional Korean clothing as well

Recently some high schools adopted Hanbok as their school uniforms Especially one of the most famous high school in Korea Korean Minjok Leadership Academy is famous for its school uniform which is modified Hanbok Moreover Korean people nowadays modify their traditional clothing Hanbok to make it more wearable The vivid colors shapes curved lines materials of Hanbok are used for designing fashionable clothing in Korea these days

At about this time the Persian Great King Ardashir had already begun his conquests in Persia When Artabanus tried to subdue him his troops were defeated The war lasted several years at last Artabanus himself was killed in 226 Thus the 400 year rule of the Arsacid Dynasty came to an end

Makgeolli Makuly also called as nongju or takju is a Koreas traditional rice wine Made from rice it is a milky brew with an alcohol content of 6 to 7 percent Rice the main ingredient of it is not sweet in itself so Nuruk is also used to make it Once boiled rice and Nuruk are mixed the enzymes in Nuruk break down carbohydrates in rice into sugar Then the sugar meets yeasts in Nuruk and there begins fermentation Because the fermentation keeps on going Makgeolli should be drunk as soon as possible once it is opened

It has a long history Ancient people made liquor with grains such as wheat and rice after they found the way to grow them That is the beginning of it There are some records about it For example a book written in Three Kingdoms of Korea it says many people drank grain liquor Moreover in a document about the brewing of Joesun Dynasty there says Makgeolli had had long history and been considered as liquor of the folk Made from newly harvested rice it was regarded as sacred gift from God In addition it played an important role in religious event like praying ceremony for a year of abundance

Compared to other liquor it is good for health Abundant in protein and fiber it affects to liver much less than any other alcohol Rather it helps prevent cancer and heart disease Similar to milk and yogurt it has good effect on the health with its organic acids

These days demand on it is growing from USA and Japan so exports are rising in Korea Actually in Korea most of the men who drank it were farmers or manual workers in 1970s Thats because it was replaced not only by soju but also by Western drinks such as beer or whisky Recently however even young generations are more likely to drink it than before

The equipment of the game consists of a board four yut sticks and four marks called mal per each team The board which is normally rectangular shaped is made of various materials like stitched cloth paper or leather It is composed of a circle with a cross in the center and 28 circles around this cross The sticks determine how far a mal can advance The stick consists of two sides which one of it is round shaped and the other side flat shaped It is commonly made of wood from chestnut trees Players can move their mal from one circle to another based on the results that their sticks indicate Anything can be a mal if it can be distinguished from the mal of opposite teams 

Shapes of sticks that fell down after throwing indicate movements of each teams mal There are five possibilities do gae geol yut and mo which each of them means five livestock pigs dogs cow sheep and horses Do when flat side of only one stick faces upward means one step advance When two flat sides are up it means gae which is two step advance Geol is three flat sides up which is three step advance and yut which all of four sticks are flat side up means four step advance When all of sticks face round side up it is mo which means five step advance Each teams throw sticks normally in turn but players get one more chance to throw sticks when they throw yut or mo

Shirley Jackson was an important American author A popular writer in her time her work has received even more attention from literary critics in recent years She has influenced such writers as Neil Gaiman Stephen King Nigel Kneale and Richard Matheson

Born Shirley Hardie Jackson in San Francisco in 1916 to Leslie and Geraldine Jackson Shirley and her family lived in Burlingame California an wealthy middle class suburb Shirley spent most of her early life in California The Jackson family then moved to Rochester New York where Shirley attended Brighton High School and graduated in 1934 For college she first attended the University of Rochester before graduating from Syracuse University in 1940 

She got married in 1940 to Stanley Edgar Hyman who met in campus literary magazine literary critic and have four children who are Laurence Joanne Sarah and Barry The Hyman family lived in Vermont in a quiet rural community and far away from city life In 1965 Shirley Jackson died of heart failure in her sleep at the age of 48 Shirley suffered all through her life from various neuroses and psychosomatic illness These illnesses along with the various prescription drugs used to treat them overweight and heavy smoking may have led to her declining health and early death

She is best known for The Lottery which suggests a deeply unsettling dark underside in human nature who lives in suburban small town in America This is easily the best adaptation of the famed Shirley Jackson short story first published in The New Yorker Jackson may even have taken pleasure in the destructive impact of her work as evidenced by Hymans statement that she was always proud that the Union of South Africa banned The Lottery and she felt that they at least understood the story Larry Yust made this story into a short film which was banned in Boston

With information for Jacksons debut novel The Road Through the Wall her husband who also is a literary critic described Shirley Jackson as someone who practiced witchcraft Shirley later wrote about witchcraft accusations in her book for young readers The Witchcraft of Salem Village

Her other novels include Hangsaman The Birds Nest The Sundial and The Haunting of Hill House regarded by many as one of the important horror novels of the 20th Century 

When the Hymans eventually settled in Vermont Shirley continued to publish novels and short stories while caring for their children Laurence Joanne Sarah and Barry Eventually her four children would come to their own brand of literary characters as fictionalized versions of themselves in their mothers short stories In a series of the short stories later collected in the books Life Among the Savages and Raising Demons she presented a fictionalized version of her marriage and the experience of raising four children 

In addition to her adult literary novels Shirley also wrote a childrens novel Nine Magic Wishes as well as a childrens play based on Hansel and Gretel and entitled The Bad Children

A transwoman is a male to female transsexual or transgendered person Many people in this group like the name transwoman over the many medical terms that are out there Other non medical names are t girl tg girl and ts girl Transgender though is the more common name

Some people who are born as males feel that this is not who they really are They feel that the gender they are on the outside and the gender that they are on the inside do not match They may want to move towards a new gender role as a woman In keeping with their new gender role many transwomen want to simply be called women as they feel that being called a transwoman may mean that their new identity is false or not true 

Transitioning refers to the act of changing a persons social and personal gender identity to the gender identity that they feel is their real self and may or may not include having medical treatments done or surgery and the changing of their legal papers to show their new identity and changing the way that they dress

Like transmen transwomen have many choices that they can make depending on what culture they are in and what gender roles they and the people who support them feel like they should have No case is the same and the options that are there for transwomen depend very much on if they have easy access to medical care and money Some transwomen choose to have hair removed on their face armpits and other parts of their body as well as having their voice changed so that it sounds more like a woman There are surgeries that can make transwomens faces look more like female but may not always necessary as some transwomen had faces that looked like womens faces when they were men They are mainly to provide emotional benefits to patients so that they can see themselves changing or as a step in sexual reassignment surgery

Some transwomen who feel that their gender change is done meaning that they have all the same physical characteristics of those who are born women want to just be called women They think that the names transwoman or male to female should only be used for people who have not finished their change Because of this many see it as important to include a space in the name as in trans woman using trans as a word to talk about a particular type of woman not a third gender as transwoman might imply

The story of the young boy who is very much like a young girl and grows up to live his life as a woman has a very long history It is a commonly but wrongly thought that all transgendered and transsexual women are straight Many studies on this issue have been thought to be hurt by bias since many transsexuals feel they must give the right answers to such questions to help their chances of being able to get hormone therapy

Some do not pay attention to transwomen identifying as women and continue to view them as men calling transwomen who feel attracted to men homosexual and transwomen that are attracted to women as nonhomosexual This is seen as rude to the women that they are supposed to be studying

Studies have shown that transwomen are more likely to have a decreased sex drive than those who are born female but the difference was not very significant

Magnum crimen pola vijeka klerikalizma u Hrvatskoj is a book first published in Zagreb in 1948 The book was written by a Croatian Roman Catholic priest Dr Viktor Novak who was also a professor at Belgrade and Zagreb Universities and the member of the Yugoslav Academy Science and Arts In this book Novak wrote about clericalism in Croatia from the beginning of the 20th century to the end of World War II

The Vatican Curia placed the book on their list of banned books the Index librorum prohibitorum and said that Novak was an enemy of the Catholic Church

Novak wrote that he spent more than 40 years collecting documents and books to write his book He started collecting this material during his secondary school days continued it as a university student and as a member of the Austrian Institute of History in Vienna Austria then as a university professor in Zagreb and Belgrade He worked on three books of which Magnum crimen is the last the first two parts of are the Magnum tempus and the Magnum sacerdos In 1941 after the destruction and occupation of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia Novak was forced to destroy all material he had collected He was in danger of being arrested and killed by the German occupying forces and their collaborators in Belgrade He was among the first ten people arrested in Belgrade by Germans but managed to survive and continue work on this book after liberation of Belgrade in October 1944

Novak dedicates this book to the victims of the clero fascism 

Observing the Roman Catholic Church activities in Yugoslavia for more than fifty years the author concludes that this Church replaced the idea of service to God by service to the Roman Curia ie service to the government of the Roman Pontificate in the role of the world leader As a result of this idea in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia the Roman Catholic Church identified the Roman Catholicism to the Croatian nationhood which turned most of its priesthood into ardent Ustashe supporters

The book describes activities of the Roman Catholic clergy in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia including their intention and attempts to become above the state to control the state and eventually everyday lives of the common people It has two distinct parts The first part consists of fifteen chapters covering the Roman Catholic clericalism from the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth century in Austria Hungary then in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia The second part the last four chapters covers the rise and fall of the Independent State of Croatia and the active support of the Roman Catholic Church clergy

The main doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was that the clergy shall be paid by the state as the state officials the state cannot have any control over the Church the Church has right to be fully involved in the political life of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia the Church doctrinereligious education shall be a part of primary and secondary school curricula and that the Roman Catholic Church curricula in the schools shall be obligatory to all pupils whose at least one parent is a Roman Catholic

To achieve these goals the Church supported clerical political parties confronting them to other confessions primarily to the Serbian Orthodox Church by publicly preaching hatred against the Orthodox population and advocating Croatian and Slovene separatism and intolerance against others

Josip Juraj Strossmayers ideas of which the most important one was  serving God equals to serving people created close relations between Croats and Serbs by introducing the Old Slavonic language as the liturgy language of the Roman Catholic Church in the Balkans  were aggressively suppressed by the Roman Catholic clergy in Croatia and Slovenia The clergy put the Roman Curia in between the God and the people demanding from the Roman Catholics ultimate obedience to the Roman Curia and unconditional love of the Roman Pope The clergy remaining faithful to the Strossmayer was marginalized with the most ardent supporters excommunicated by the Zagreb archbishop

Nevertheless Strossmayer was embraced as a great Roman Catholic bishop by the same clergy  but his teaching was distorted or not mentioned ever The same destiny faced Franjo Raki Ante Trumbi and Stjepan Radi  three Croatian politicians advocating actively and fighting for the Yugoslavism  as a common denominator of togetherness and life among the Slavic people of the kingdom of Yugoslavia The Trumbi and Radis struggle against centralism was interpreted as the Croatian and Slovene separatism support 

Novak demonstrated that even the anti Croatian activities in the Italian Croatian and Slovene lands were not counteracted by the Croatian and Slovene Roman Catholic clergy in Yugoslavia Expulsion of the Croatian and Slovene clergy from these lands and their replacement by the Italians was received with silence and accepted without resistance or protest among their Catholic brethren in Yugoslavia

Ante Pavelis political activities in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia the Ustashe terrorism and the embracement of fascism were all supported by the Roman Catholic clergy Pavelis nationalism identified Roman Catholicism to the Croatdom which was actively supported and interpreted by the clergy 

The second part of this book is about the beginning of the Independent State of Croatia the active support of the Roman Catholic clergy to this state and their involvement and support in the extermination andor forceful conversion of the Serbs and extermination of the Jews and the Roma people The book is full of testimonies and documents showing the active involvements of the Catholic clergy in supporting organizing and executing extermination of Serbs Jews and Roma people of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia One of the most bizarre events described was that Roman Catholic priests in the Jasenovac concentration camp working every day on the most gruesome ways to kill the camp inmates while they went to chapel regularly each day to pray to God 

At the end of World War II the Catholic clergy defended themselves claiming their opposition to forceful conversion and extermination in some letters and instructions directed to the priesthood The book notes that these letters and directions were not public and not respected or followed In fact an article from Novi list argued that a Jew could not be save by converting to the Roman Catholicism

Archbishop Aloysius Stepinac is portrayed in this book as an ardent Roman Catholic crusader who publicly endorsed the establishment of the Independent State of Croatia acknowledged the Ustashe as Croatian patriots defended her before the Roman Pope and was responsible for the racist attitude and behavior of his clergy

Among scholars historians this book is accepted as a serious academic reference and as such  cited and referenced a great number of times That way the book became a reference book in the libraries of many universities around the globe 

The earliest surveys of this book are the ones of Russian S Troicky and of Swede O Neumann Neumann stressed three things particular to this book the role of V Novak in spreading and defending the idea of Yugoslavism abundance of the documentation used to support the book content and that Some passages have been written by a scholar in a dignified academic gown in other parts of the book the author assumes the role of public prosecutor The abridged edition of this book published in 1960 is reviewed in the Istorijski glasnik and the same review echoed in the Historical abstracts 

A number of short notes about this book can be found  scattered in the works related to this period of history Some are neutral and some rejective and disapproving 

The book has six full editions and one abridged

Cecilia subtitled Memoirs of an Heiress is an 18th century novel by Frances Burney It is a comical satirical love story It was highly admired by people like Edmund Burke Mary Wollstonecraft and Choderlos de Laclos

Cecilia was published in July 1782 Before this dramatists such as Arthur Murphy wanted her to write a play because they had been impressed with the dramatic scenes and conversations in her earlier book Evelina Her father seemed delighted with the idea and Frances Burney began writing the lively play The Witlings They tried reading it in the home of Burneys old friend and mentor in writing Samuel Crisp Her sister Susanna Burney told her sister in a letter that it had gone very well Frances then must have been the more shocked when she received a letter from Crisp and Dr Burney saying she must never put the play put on Frances Burney tried to change their minds but Dr Burney was firm In fact he wished for her to stop writing plays and continue writing the more ladylike novels instead In the Novel way there is no danger he said The stress because of this made Burney unhappy Critics believe this is why Cecilia is somewhat darker and sadder than her first lighter novel

Cecilia opens with the beautiful 20 year old heroine Cecilia Beverley saying goodbye to her country home to go on a journey to London She is an orphan heiress But she will inherit her money only if her husband will take her surname that is become Mr Beverley

Cecilia goes to an opera where she sees the strange gruff old man again his name is Albany He shouts out at her a strange warning that she is in danger from the people around her and she should be helping the poor and leaves The next morning she sees a poor but honest woman named Mrs Hill who comes and begs her to help her and her starving family because Mr Harrel refused to pay them Cecilia tries to make him pay but he makes useless excuses constantly and finally Mr Arnott feeling sorry for the Hills lent him the money to pay them at last

Cecilia shocked at the meanness of Mr Harrel decided to see if she could stay with any of her other guardians but finds out they are in different ways perhaps just as bad while Mr Harrel spends and gambles his money her other guardian Mr Briggs is a selfish miser and Mr Delvile is a vain man over proud of his family

Jane Austen a famous writer talked about Cecilia in her novel Northanger Abbey And what are you reading Miss  Oh It is only a novel replies the young lady while she lays down her book with affected indifference or momentary shame It is only Cecilia or Camilla or Belinda or in short only some work in which the greatest powers of the mind are displayed in which the most thorough knowledge of human nature the happiest delineation of its varieties the liveliest effusions of wit and humour are conveyed to the world in the bestchosen language

The title of Austens Pride and Prejudice is probably from Dr Lysters speech at the end of Cecilia remember if to pride and prejudice you owe your miseries so wonderfully is good and evil balanced that to pride and prejudice you will also owe their termination

In her last novel Persuasion Anne Elliot talks about the inimitable Miss Larolles

In Thackerays Vanity Fair Rebecca Sharp writes to Amelia Sedley and says they used to read Cecilia at Chiswick

Pansori is a professional art which requires sorikkun to have a high level of singing skill Also it is a performing art because one singer takes roles of various characters in a story Music literature and play are the key elements that coexist in pansori It was established as an independent performing art by associating with many adjacent genres of Korean traditional music such as Minyo Mooga Sijo Japga and Gasa It is also the only genre that started with popular arts and led to ethnic arts in Korea

There is an opinion that in the traditional society Pansori indicated Ba tang sori and if a singer sang certain parts of a story usually famous parts it was called just sori Today if a singer sing a full story it is called Ba tang sori whereas if a singer sing just some parts of the story the sori is called Toe maksori or Ma disori Toe mak sori was mainly sung by sorikkun in the 20th century However after Dong Jin Park a famous male sorikkun sang the full story of Heungbuga for five hours in 1968 many sorikkun tried to sing Ba tang sori which requires sorikkun more efforts to sing

Park Chan Ho was the first Korean to play baseball in the MLB in the USA

Park was born in Gong joo in the province of the Choong cheong in 1973 and he started a baseball player from the elementary school in the region he was actually born At first he wanted to be an athlete but he had a more talent in baseball than athlete Then he was called by the baseball coach of his elementary school From then he played the baseball and he was famous for the speed ball in their ages Thus he was scouted in the Han Yang University However he wanted to go to USA to be belonged to MLB so he found out that some teams in MLB wanted him Then in 1994 he started the player for LA Dodgers From then he was in minor league in the team but the coached admitted and thought him as a MLB as soon

As he was been famous for in the MLB so he was taken out for the Korean National Baseball team for main pitcher in2006 in World Baseball Classics Thus he was good at playing baseball in the all matches and he was noticed that he functioned as a cheering up the other players He once won 18 games in one year was selected as an all star player and made 100 wins in his own life three years ago In addition to this he participated in the 18th Asian Games in Bang Kok so he got the gold medal and got the privilege that he did not have to go into the army All this privilege is originated from the getting an awarding from the vice premier in 1998 However as it was showed above he did not any awarding in the MLB except for the selecting the all star players in 2001 It means that the prejudice against the Asian race exists now

He was selected in the 5th starter of LA Dodgers At that time there were so many famous pitchers in the team There are Ramon E Martinez Nomo Hideo and Pedro Julio Astacio Pura etc The players were players in that period in the MLB The most surprising was the first pitcher who participated in the all games and then the second pitcher who are selected in the 5th starter However in the practicing matches he committed error by himself and then he was in the trouble situation but after the game he was also noticed that he had to go down for minor leagues Nevertheless he displayed his abilities and potentials to the all of coaches in the Dodgers In a series of games he was participated in the middle of the game the results of the game was a record with no losing point during 2innings As a result of this kind of good game fortunately he was left in the major leagues

He got first winning in April 7th in 1996 when the time is first year left in the major leagues The match was against with Chicago Cubs and he was participated in the middle of the game Then he recorded no losing point during 4innings so that he got the first winning point and he started with the period of prosperity Then he was selected in the fixed starter of LA Dodgers and then his annual salary was sharply increased From then on he was really famous for the Korean super pitcher in the LA and all of United States And he pitched whole game first in 1997 and then in 1998 he got fifteen winnings and nine loses and in 1998 thirteen winnings and eleven loses etc

During about ten seasons he was really good at baseball game However all of sports players had more or less tough seasons for about one or two times It means that the suffering was stimulus for the players so that they were trying to recover the trial but Park Chan Ho was not exception He was traded into another team such as Texas Rangers Sandiego Padres New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillis Then he was always in the minor leagues and of course he was cut down for his annual salary At last he announced that he decided to resign the player and to be a good coach in this year

It means that the Asian players can be a MLB player and they can achieve their purpose Thus we will show our potential to citizens of USA In addition to this the players who are in the Korean leagues and the amateur players have a dream that they will be in the leagues Then the players are motivated by the different chances and they also contribute to develop economy of our society And then if they stop the players they will become coaches in Korea and then our chronic problem about the culture of sports players will have some solutions

Northanger Abbey was the first novel by Jane Austen

The story starts whilst following a young seventeen year old girl named Catherine Morland who is accompanying her rich relations Mr Allen and Mrs Allen to the modern city Bath Still innocent and inexperienced Catherine Morland is a plump country girl with no friend in the city

The first few days are disappointing to her because she does not have anyone to dance with at the ball Of course it was only the most disgraceful thing to be left alone at a ball Then later she meets an excitinggentleman Mr Tilney and falls in love with him immediately  but the next day he has disappeared She is greatly upset and in low spirits for the rest of the day Then her spirit is brightened by a flirtatious friend named Isabella Not knowing all the evil intentions of her friend she rejoices at finding another friend

Isabella lures Catherine into the fun of reading gothic novels which make Catherine think they are all true she is not able to separate the reality from the exciting fiction Then she is introduced as Isabella wants to match her up to Isabellas brother John Thorpe a rather coarse strong young man who likes to quiz people John Thorpe finds himself falling in love with her and thinks Catherine likes him in return

Catherine then meets Henry Tilney again and is introduced to Miss Tilney the sister of Mr Henry Tilney a sensible clear minded intelligent lady who is much different from Isabella Catherine also gets acquainted with Miss Tilneys father General Tilney a strong stern man

Isabella joyfully tells Catherine of her engagement with Catherines brother James Morland and therefore somehow hints another relationship between Catherine and John Thorpe A little while after John Thorpe proposes to Catherine who does not realise he is asking her to marry him Did you ever hear the old song Going to one wedding brings on anotheryou will come to Belles Isabellas wedding I hope Catherine cheerfully says Yes at which he says twisting himself around and forcing a foolish laugh we may try the truth of this same old song Catherine innocently says May we but I never sing Later when Isabella tells her that John is in love with her she is really surprised but says no immediately Then Eleanor Tilney invites Catherine to Northanger Abbey Catherine of course is very happy to go Catherine there learns that the gothic novels are wrong and that Northanger Abbey is a perfectly normal place and is certainly not haunted

Still yet innocent Catherine observes General Tilneys talks and conversations and suspiciously thinks that perhaps he has murdered his wife because he avoided talking about her She persuades Eleanor Tilney to take her to Mrs Tilneys room but when General Tilney comes she rushes away in fear Catherine later goes again but is this time found by Henry Tilney and she accidentally reveals her suspicions to Henry who does not get angry at her Then retreating to her room in a burst of tears she is worried that Mr Tilney does not like her any more

Later Eleanor Tilney assists her with a rather cold unwelcoming way of talking and takes her to an open stage coach to immediately go home Catherine is frightened and surprised and thinks it is all because of her mistaken thoughts of General Tilney and his wife When she goes home she is sullen and quiet

Henry Tilney to Catherines surprise visits her house and asks her to marry him even though General Tilney said no He explained that at first John Thorpe who had thought Catherine would marry him soon had lied to General Tilney that she was very very rich General Tilney quickly tried to make her marry Henry but a little later met John Thorpe again after Catherine had said she would not marry him He angrily told General Tilney another lie that Catherine was penniless General Tilney horrified rudely made Catherine go home Catherines parents say they have to wait until General Tilney says yes Finally Eleanor marries the most charming man in the world who is very rich and this makes the General so happy he says that Henry can be a fool if he liked it Later he finds out Catherine is not really as poor as he had thought so he is even happier Finally Catherine and Henry were married the bells rang and everybody smiled

Lexemes are the head words in a dictionary They are units of meaning independent of any inflectional endings or whether it is one word or several Come in is a lexeme so is raining cats and dogs The largest English dictionaries have about half a million lexemes The true figure is undoubtedly a great deal higher

A phoneme is any of the units of sound which distinguish between one word and another In most English accents there are about 24 consonantal phonemes and 20 vowel phonemes in the language but only 26 letters

The history of the alphabet begins in Ancient Egypt more than a millennium into the history of writing The first pure alphabet emerged around 2000 BCE to represent the language of Semitic workers in Egypt and was derived from the alphabetic principles of the Egyptian hieroglyphs Most alphabets in the world today either descend directly from this development for example the Greek and Latin alphabets or were inspired by its design

By 2700 BCE the ancient Egyptians had developed a set of some 22 hieroglyphs to represent the consonants of their language plus a 23rd that seems to have represented word initial or word final vowels The first purely alphabetic script is thought to have been developed around 2000 BCE for Semitic workers in central Egypt Over the next 500 years it spread north and all subsequent alphabets around the world have either descended from it or been inspired by one of its descendants with the possible exception of the Meroitic alphabet a 3rd century BCE adaptation of hieroglyphs in Nubia to the south of Egypt

The oldest examples are in Egypt and date to around 1800 BCE   These inscriptions may show that the alphabet was invented in Egypt

Luigi Cherubini was an Italian born composer who spent most of his working life in France He is famous for his operas as well as for his religious music Beethoven thought that Cherubini was the greatest composer who was living at that time

Cherubini was born in Florence The exact date of his birth is not known He was only six years old when his father taught him to play the harpsichord He was a child prodigy By the time he was thirteen he had composed several religious works In 1780 he was given a scholarship by the Grand Duke of Tuscany to study music in Bologna and Milan 

At first Cherubini composed operas about serious stories He composed in the style of Italian composers of that time Soon he felt he wanted to travel to learn other ways of composing He went to London in 1785 and then to Paris where he met many important people including Marie Antoinette He spent the rest of his life in France

His opera Dmophon was performed at the Grand Opra in 1788 It helped to make him famous He soon became director of the Thtre de Monsieur in the Tuileries and three years later he went to the Thtre Feydeau  He started to try out many new ideas in his music His opera Lodoska was very popular for the way he showed heroism His best known work is Mde Les deux journes was also highly successful for a while 

The French Revolution affected Cherubinis life He tried not to show that he had been friendly with aristocrats before the revolution Hoping to get government jobs he wrote several patriotic works in order to please the revolutionary leaders Later he was made Napolons director of music in Vienna and he conducted some of his music there

After he had written his opera Les deux journes audiences in Paris started to tire of Cherubinis music They wanted to hear younger composers such as Adrien Boieldieu Cherubini found it difficult to get his stage works performed Instead he wrote church music When France became a monarchy again he was appointed surintendant de la musique du roi He kept this title until 1830 when there was another revolution

In 1815 he briefly went again to London There he was asked to compose a symphony an overture and a work for chorus and orchestra This helped to make him more famous outside France

Cherubinis Requiem in C minor which marked the anniversary of the execution of King Louis XVI of France was a great success Beethoven Schumann and Brahms all liked it very much In 1836 Cherubini wrote a Requiem in D Minor which he meant to be performed at his own funeral It uses a male choir only because the religious authorities had criticised the fact that he had written for ladies voices in his C minor Requiem

Cherubini produced some chamber music including several string quartets and a quintet for two violins viola and two cellos He also wrote some piano sonatas

In 1822 Cherubini became director of the Conservatoire In 1835 he wrote a book called Cours de contrepoint et de fugue 

There are several stories told by people who lived at that time showing that Cherubini often became angry  Hector Berlioz tells an amusing story in his autobiography about how Cherubini in a bad temper chased him round and round the library  But he also had many friends including Rossini Chopin and especially the painter Ingres The two men had the same interests Cherubini was a keen amateur painter and Ingres enjoyed practising the violin In 1841 Ingres painted a well known portrait of Cherubini

During his life Cherubini received the highest official honours including Chevalier de la Lgion dhonneur and Membre de lAcadmie des Beaux Arts In 1841 he was made Commandeur de la Lgion dhonneur the first time a musician had been given that title 

Cherubini died in Paris at age of 81 and is buried at Pre Lachaise Cemetery just four metres from his friend Chopin

During the first ten years of his life in Paris Cherubini concentrated on writing dramatic stage works After 1800 things became more difficult for him in this field Napoleon was ruling in France and the two men did not like one another much The audiences expected an Italian composer to write beautiful melodies rather than anything dramatic The Feydeau Theatre where he had enjoyed several triumphs did not exist any more Cherubini concentrated on his teaching at the Paris Conservatoire Even after Napoleon had lost his power Cherubini left it to younger people such as Rossini and Giacomo Meyerbeer to compose operas He preferred to write religious pieces

By the end of the 19th century Cherubinis music was almost forgotten and he was only really remembered for his theoretical writing During the late 20th century people became interested in his music again and his religious compositions are sometimes performed However his operas do not belong to any popular tradition and are hardly ever staged now although they contain much excellent music

I Vow to Thee My Country is a British patriotic song created in 1921 when a poem by Sir Cecil Spring Rice was set to music by Gustav Holst

The lyrics come from a poem by Cecil Spring Rice that he wrote in 1908 when he was working at the British Embassy in Stockholm Sweden At first called Urbs Dei or The Two Fatherlands the poem is about how a Christian owes her loyalties to both her homeland and the Kingdom of Heaven The first verse as written had a very direct and heated patriotism that has become less popular since the First World War

In 1912 Rice was sent to Washington DC as the British ambassador to the United States of America While serving as ambassador he tried to get President Woodrow Wilson to give up on neutrality and join Britain and her Empire in the war against Germany After America entered the war Rice was called back to Britain Shortly before he left the United States in January of 1918 he re wrote and re titled Urbs Dei after making big changes to the first verse to talk more about the huge losses that British soldiers were having in the war years

The first verse talks about Great Britain and mainly about those who died during the First World War The end verse that starts with the line And theres another country is talking about heaven The final line of the end verse uses the Proverbs 317 as its base which reads Her ways are of pleasantness and all her paths are peace

In 1921 Gustav Holst changed the music from a section of the song Jupiter from his suite The Planets to create a setting for the poem The music was made a bit longer so that it would fit the last two lines of the first verse the end result is usually called the Thaxted This was first performed in 1925 and became very common at Armistice memorial ceremonies

Later on Z Randall Stroope would arrange a choir version of this song called Homeland He still used the Jupiter theme from the planets but also used two additional verses of his own to pay homage to his father who marched in the Bataan Death March

The lyrics as usually sung without the middle verse because it is not suitable for modern use

The Perfect Fool is an opera in one act with music written by the English composer Gustav Holst Holst wrote the work over the time period from 1918 to 1922 The opera was first played at the Covent Garden Theatre London on May 14 1923 At the beginning Holst had asked Clifford Bax to write the libretto but Bax did not want to do so

In the musical score Holst made fun of the musical works of Verdi Wagners work Parsifal and Debussy In the opera the Fools part is only one word long One popular way of thinking of the operas meaning is that the Princess symbolises the world of opera and the Fool is the British people

The opera did not do well and audiences thought that the opera did not make any sense Although the opera was given a live BBC broadcast a year after it was first played it is not often played today 

Comet Hale Bopp is the biggest and brightest comet that has come by Earth in the last century It was called the Great Comet of 1997 It is probably the most seen comet in history  even more than the famous Halleys comet

Hale Bopp was discovered by two astronomers Alan Hale and Thomas Bopp This is a long period comet It is so big that its coma is as big as the Sun It didnt come close enough to the sun to cross Earths orbital path so we couldnt see a meteor shower from the dust trail

Scientists found lots of organic chemicals in Hale Bopp which they never saw before It was also the first comet that had the gas argon in it It also has a sodium tail See the picture on the left

A person named Chuck Shramek saw a not very bright Saturn like thing following Hale Bopp and called the Art Bell radio program and told them about it Lots of people thought a UFO was following behind the comet even though many astronomers including Alan Hale tried to tell them it was just a star A few months later the Heavens Gate cult said they had to join the alien spaceship by leaving their earthly bodies and lots of people killed themselves

group Opisthobranchia

clade Nudipleura

Nudibranchs are a widespread and successful group of marine Gastropod molluscs The name means naked gills They are shelless and uncoiled Gastropods famous for their brilliant colours There are more than 3000 known species

Nudibranchs are one of the groups which are informally known as sea slugs This is a term which includes other Gastropod groups which look similar to nudibranchs Sea slugs is an informal term it is not a monophyletic group 

The body forms of nudibranchs vary greatly They are opisthobranchs a clade which shed their shells after the larval stage 

Unlike most other gastropods they are bilaterally symmetrical They have undergone secondary detorsion Most species have venomous appendages on their sides These are used to deter predators Many also have a simple gut and a mouth with a radula

Unusually for molluscs they lack a mantle cavity Nudibranchs are hermaphrodite and thus have a set of reproductive organs for both sexes but they rarely fertilize themselves

Most nudibranchs are carnivorous Some feed on sponges others on polyps others on bryozoans and some eat other sea slugs or on some occasions members of their own species Other groups feed on tunicates barnacles or anemones

The surface dwelling nudibranch Glaucus atlanticus is a specialist predator of jellyfish such as the Portuguese Man o War This predatory mollusc sucks air into its stomach to keep it afloat and using its muscular foot it clings to the surface film If it finds a small victim Glaucus simply envelops it with its large mouth but if the prey is a larger siphonophore the mollusc nibbles off its fishing tentacles the ones carrying the most potent nematocysts Like some others of its kind Glaucus does not digest the nematocysts instead it uses them to defend itself by passing them from its gut to the surface of its skin

Among this group can be found the most colourful creatures on earth In the course of evolution sea slugs have lost their shell and have developed other defence mechanisms Their anatomy may resemble the texture and color of the surrounding plants giving them camouflage Many have an intense and bright colouring which warns that they are distasteful or poisonous

Nudibranchs that feed on hydroids can store the hydroids nematocysts in the dorsal body wall The nematocysts wander through the alimentary canal without harming the nudibranch Then the cells are brought to specific places on the creatures hind body Nudibranches can protect themselves from the hydroids and their nematocysts It is not yet clear how but special cells with large vacuoles probably play an important role They can also take in plants chloroplasts and use them to make food for themselves

Another method of protection is the release of a sour liquid from the skin Once the specimen is physically irritated or touched by another creature it will release the slime automatically

The taxonomy of the Nudibranchia is still under investigation 

Sea slug an informal name for a group of Gastropods which look similar but are not monophyletic Their similar shape and life styles is an example of convergent evolution The group includes

It would seem that their similar growth pattern with the loss of torsion bilateral symmetry reduction of the Gastropod shell and somewhat similar life styles evolved a number of times in the Gastropods

Moritz Wagner was a German explorer collector geographer and naturalist 

Wagner devoted three years to the exploration of Algiers It was there that he made an important discovery in natural history which he later developed 

His idea first based on a study of flightless beetles was that geographical isolation could play a key role in speciation Although at first rejected this idea turned out to be important in the theory of evolution

From 18521855 together with a companion Wagner travelled through North and Central America and the Caribbean In May 1843 Wagner toured the Lake Sevan region of Armenia In his old age he committed suicide in Munich aged 73 His brother Rudolf was a physiologist and anatomist

Wagners early career was as a geographer and he published a number of geographical books about North Africa the Middle East and tropical America 

He was also a keen naturalist and collector and it is for this work he is best known among biologists Ernst Mayr the evolutionist and historian of biology has given an account of Wagners significance 

During his three years in Algeria Wagner studied the flightless beetles Pimelia and Melasoma Each genus is split into a number of species each of which is confined to a stretch of the north coast between rivers which descend from the Atlas mountains to the Mediterranean As soon as one crosses a river a different but closely related species appears

Wagner was able to make similar observations in the Caucasus and in the Andean valleys leading him to conclude after the Origin of Species had been published

This was an early description of a process of geographical speciation Another formulation of this idea came later Organisms which never leave their ancient area of distribution will never change This cannot be literally true and is an overstatement of his idea

The fate of this idea was unhappy Unfortunately Wagner combined his idea with some peculiar ideas on variation and selection The leading evolutionists attacked Wagners idea of geographic speciation and it suffered a long decline However in 1942 it was reintroduced by Mayr and the importance of geographic speciation became one of the core ideas of the evolutionary synthesis

Modern experts such as Ernst Mayr Jerry Coyne Allen Orr agree that Wagner first identified geographical speciation However his migration theory was based on a rather simple Lamarckian idea of evolution Wagner argued in letters to Darwin that he had missed a vital geographic component in understanding the evolution of new species Darwin at first responded in a friendly way to these letters and agreed that geographic isolation was important Later he found Wagners increasingly hysterical tone and one sided argument upsetting and wrote across his copy of Wagners 1875 paper most wretched rubbish partly because Wagner ignored the importance of natural selection and lifted parts of Darwins theory that he liked without attribution all the while claiming that Darwins views were incorrect

As well as Darwin the Reverend JT Gulick also found Wagners theories overstated but in a later paper Gulick says that Moritz Wagner in his Law of the Migration of Organisms was the first to insist on the importance of geographical isolation as a factor in evolution but when he asserted that without geographical isolation natural selection could have no effect in producing new species he went beyond what could be sustained by facts

Ernst Mayrs formulation cleared up the issues which Wagner had left unresoved A new species develops if a population which has become isolated from its parental species acquires during this period of isolation characters which promote or guarantee isolation when the external barriers break down The zoological taxonomist Bernhard Rensch was also significant in keeping geographical speciation on the evolutionary menu He identified geographical separation as the most frequent initial step towards kladogenesis

The importance of Wagners insight is undeniable today It was obscured for many years by his other mistaken ideas but it was a genuine natural history insight gained by observation of insects in their natural habitats

Africanized honeybees are a hybrid of the European honeybee and African bees They are more dangerous and defensive than regular honeybees Because of this some people call them killer bees

About fifty years ago scientists brought African and European bees to Brazil in South America to see if they could mate them They wanted to do this to make a bee that would make more honey in a hotter place Scientists called these new bees Africanized honeybees These bees however were very different from regular honeybees They would suddenly leave the colony and build a hive somewhere else Scientists found out that the queen would decide to leave after a few months usually taking half the colony with her They could even take over European hives by killing the European queen bee and making their own queen bee the queen 

Africanized honeybees are much more protective of their beehive and more likely to sting When one of them get surprised or scared they all attack together and sting the same animal or person with hundreds of stings Actually their sting is the same as a regular honeybees but because they sting all together they are much more dangerous They usually chase their target much farther than regular honeybees and they stay angry and ready to fight for a much longer time They have many more guard bees than regular honeybees However if left alone theyll usually not attack

Because of the queens strange behavior of leaving the hive and starting new colonies Africanized honeybees spread out quickly from Brazil They have moved towards the north so that they have spread through most of South America Mexico and the south parts of Texas New Mexico Arizona and California Scientists are not sure how far they will spread Some think they cannot go much more towards the north because they do not survive well in really cold winters or extremely dry summers Some disagree

Mammal like reptile is an old term for the therapsids those synapsids which gave rise to the true mammals 

The term is both outmoded and a mistake because mammals did not descend from reptiles Both groups descended from early amniotes probably in the Lower or Middle Carboniferous The precursors of reptiles are called sauropsids and the precursors of mammals are called synapsids or more narrowly therapsids

There are a number of characteristics which cannot be seen on fossils but which are of great importance 

Mammals are distinguished from reptiles by fundamental differences in the development of the blood system These differences are such that it would be almost impossible for mammals to be derived from reptiles

This supports the division of amniotes into sauropsida and synapsida

The cleidoic egg is the type of egg which reptiles and birds lay Mammalian reproduction has evolved from laying cleidoic eggs to live birth The cleidoic egg is sometimes called the amniotic egg because it is characteristic of amniotes

These eggs have a protective shell and are laid out of water The shell is porous to air and may be flexible or calcareous The eggs contain all the food the embryo needs to develop into a hatchling As a result the amphibians larval stage the tadpole is not needed by reptiles or birds The special membranes that support these eggs are typical traits of all amniotes including mammalsp105

The significance of the cleidoic egg is that it enables reproduction out of and often away from water The cleidoic egg has been called a private little pond from the way it gives water and nutrition to the embryo Cleidoic eggs must have evolved in the Lower Carboniferous when early Amniotes evolved Amniotes include mammals and monotreme mammals do lay eggs Marsupial and eutherian mammals have the same kind of eggs but without the shell They give birth to live young because the development takes place internally We know that some fossil groups of reptiles such as Ichthyosaurs also gave birth to live young

The basic reproduction strategy of amphibia is to lay a huge number of eggs which are left to their own fate The strategy of amniotes is to invest more in the production of eggs lay fewer eggs and take some care of them Because the eggs are laid on land internal fertilisation is needed Thus from the initial step of a cleidoic egg comes a number of changes in behaviour With the changes in behaviour comes better and more flexible brains Some reptiles for example Crocodiles and birds look after and protect their young Mammals are an extreme case they carry the protection and nursing of the young much further All mammals provide milk for their young and many smaller mammals raise their young in burrows providing a meaasure of security Humans go even further still with the long period of learning before their young are independent Along with this in human evolution goes a reduction in inherited behaviours and a great increase in learned behaviours and social life These later adaptations were made possible by the earlier evolution of the cleidoic egg

The cleidoic egg is a good example of an evolutionary innovation which permitted the invasion of a vast range of new habitats and led to one of the greatest adaptive radiations in the history of the vertebrates In comparison the amphibia whose reproduction is tied to water are represented today by just a few highly specialised groups

Terrapins are turtles that live in brackish water They are named for the diamond pattern on their shells They eat mollusks crabs and fish

Brazil is currently divided into five regions by the Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatstica These divisions are composed of states with similar cultural economical historical and social aspects and although information given by this type of division is not very accurate from the scientific point of view this division is the most widely used in Brazil because official information given by the IBGE uses this system

The Vale do Ao metropolitan area is a metropolitan area in Minas Gerais Brazil comprising only the four municipalities of Coronel Fabriciano Ipatinga Santana do Paraso and Timteo but have an influence area of 22 other municipalities

The region has become internationally known due to large companies that are in the region such as the Cenibra ArcelorMittal Timteo and Usiminas all with an increasing volume of exported products

The mantle is a significant part of the anatomy of molluscs it is the dorsal body wall which covers the organs of digestion reproduction and movement 

In many but not all species of molluscs the epidermis of the mantle secretes calcium carbonate and conchiolin and creates a shell

The word mantle means cloak or cape and does often resemble a cloak The edges of the mantle may extend far beyond the main part of the body forming flaps double layered structures adapted for many different uses including for example the siphon

The mantle cavity is a central feature of molluscan biology This cavity is formed by the mantle skirt a double fold of mantle which encloses a water space This space contains the molluscs gills anus and organs for taste excretion and reproductive organs

The mantle cavity functions as a respiratory chamber in all molluscs In bivalves it is usually part of the feeding structure In some mollusks the mantle cavity is a brood chamber and in cephalopods and some bivalves such as scallops it is a locomotory organ

The mantle is highly muscular In cephalopods the contraction of the mantle is used to force water through a tubular siphon and this propels the animal rapidly through the water In other molluscs it is used as a kind of foot for locomotion

The Carboniferous was the geological period after the Devonian and before the Permian It lasted from about 360 to about 300 million years ago

In the USA the Carboniferous is divided into the Mississippian and the Pennsylvanian In Europe the terms upper middle and lower are used or the specific names of the constituent series or stages

The early tetrapods split first into two major groups the amphibians which laid their eggs in water and the amniotes distinguished by laying their cleidoic eggs on land The amniotes gave rise to two groups both of which became dominant at different times They were the Synapsids which eventually gave rise to the mammals and the Sauropsids which gave rise to the dinosaurs and other reptiles These momentous events took place in the lower part of the Carboniferous the Mississippian

The Carboniferous is named after the Coal Measures the remains of peat formed by dense tropical wetland forests This biota occurred in the upper part of the period the Pennsylvanian from 315300 million years years ago

These forests were on the equator and the wetlands which are always low lying stretched from America in the west through what is now Europe to China in the east because the continents were all together at the time The river plain which was the heart of the wetland stretched 5000km from eastern Canada to the Ukraine and was 700km widep6 

The kind of climate and geography has no exact parallel today but the Amazon Basin the Mississippi River system and the Okeefenokee swamp give some idea The swamps were dominated by giant clubmosses including Lepidodendron They were the earliest trees later superseded by conifers and flowering plants Also occasionally swept down by the river were the plants from the levee such as horsetails ferns and tree like pteridosperms

The wetland forests ended when the land level was raised by the pressure of the Gondwana continent against Laurussia causing the zone of contact to be raised The end of the Coal Measures marks the end of the Carboniferous period China was too far away to be affected and there the wetland forests continued for another 50 million years into the early Permianp30

The Mesozoic era is often called the era of the dinosaurs It lasted from about 250 million years ago to about 65 million years ago It is the middle of three eras that make up the Phanerozoic

Its three periods are

The Mesozoic era began and ended with huge extinction events It began after the PermianTriassic extinction event and ended with the KT extinction event which killed the dinosaurs

Before the Mesozoic was the Palaeozoic era After it was the Cainozoic era

The Palaeozoic era is the earliest of the three eras of the Phanerozoic Its name means early life It lasted from about 542 to 250 million years ago and ended with the greatest extinction event the PermianTriassic extinction event

The Palaeozoic began with an explosion of life forms The Cambrian explosion marks the era with thousands of new life forms in the ancient seas It lasted from about 542 million years ago to about 251 million of years ago and is divided into six periods The era saw many important events including the development of most invertebrate groups lifes conquest of land the evolution of fish reptiles insects and vascular plants the formation of the supercontinent of Pangea and no less than two distinct ice ages The earth rotated faster than it does today so days were shorter and the nearer moon meant stronger tides

Blackjack is a kind of card game which usually involves gambling It is often played in casinos There is a dealer who deals cards from a special device called a dealers shoe or a shuffling machine

It is a dealer versus players game Each player has their own game against the dealer Cards are dealt in succession and bets placed at each stage Players win if their card numbers add up to more than the dealers to a limit if 21 Hands which add up to more than 21 lose Face cards count as 10 

Blackjack an ace and a face card is the top scorer Five cards adding to 21 or fewer is the next ranking hand Apart from that unbusted hands rank by total add up All hands below the dealers lose hands equal to the dealers keep their chips

Players have a choice whether or not to get extra cards To mean no more cards players may say stick or knock the table or put their chips on top of the cards The dealer has set rules as to when he takes extra cards for himself In the UK the bank must stand on 16 These rules never vary and it would be illegal to do so The rules are usually built into the gambling regulations of the state or country

Blackjack has an element of skill because the odds change as the cards are dealt The critical information is the numbers of tens which have been dealt This is because they are the common cause of busting or breaking 21 This is called card counting and though it is legal casinos have been know to bar players they think are doing it

This is an example of a Blackjack game Players are named by gambling chip colour white brown blue and black

The dealer has given two cards each to the four players who are betting One of the dealers two cards is face up so all the players can see it and the other is face down

The dealer turns their card over and gets a 6 together with the Ace takes them to 17 and stands because the dealer must stand on 17 Results

The Phanerozoic eon is the current eon in the geologic timescale and the one during which abundant animal life has existed It covers roughly 545 million years and goes back to the time when diverse hard shelled animals first appeared Its name is derived from the Greek words and meaning make life appear since it was once believed that life began in the Cambrian the first geological period of this eon The time before the Phanerozoic formerly called the Precambrian is now divided into the Hadean Archaean and Proterozoic eons

The exact time of the boundary between the Phanerozoic and the Proterozoic is slightly uncertain In the 19th Century the boundary was set at the first abundant metazoan fossils But several hundred taxa of Proterozo metazoa have been identified since systematic study of those forms started in the 1950s Most geologists and paleontologists would probably set the Proterozoic Phanerozoic boundary either at the classic point where the first trilobites and archaeocyatha appear at the first appearance of a complex feeding burrow called Trichophycus pedum or at the first appearance of a group of small generally disarticulated armored forms termed the small shelly fauna The three different dividing points are within a few million years of each other

The Phanerozoic is divided into three eras the Palaeozoic Mesozoic and Cainozoic In the older literature the term Phanerozoic is generally used as a label for the time period of interest to paleontologists but that use of the term seems to be falling into disuse in more modern literature

The time span of the Phanerozoic includes the rapid emergence of a number of animal phyla the evolution of these phyla into diverse forms the emergence of terrestrial plants the development of complex plants the evolution of fish the emergence of terrestrial animals and the development of modern faunas During the period covered continents drifted about eventually collecting into a single landmass known as Pangea and then splitting up into the current continental landmasses

The Ordovician period is the second of six of the Paleozoic era It covers the time between about 488 million years to 444 million years ago It follows the Cambrian period and is followed by the Silurian period The Ordovician named after the Welsh tribe of the Ordovices was defined by Charles Lapworth in 1879 to resolve a dispute between followers of Adam Sedgwick and Roderick Murchison who were placing the same rock beds in northern Wales into the Cambrian and Silurian periods respectively Lapworth recognizing that the fossil fauna in the disputed strata were different from those of either the Cambrian or the Silurian periods realized that they should be placed in a period of their own

While recognition of the distinct Ordovician period was slow in Britain other areas of the world accepted it quickly It received international sanction in 1906 when it was adopted as an official period of the Paleozoic era by the International Geological Congress

The Ordovician ended with a series of extinction events that together amount to the second greatest extinction of the Phanerozoic

Sea levels were high during the Ordovician Shallow inland seas were the greatest for which evidence is preserved in the rocks

During the Ordovician the southern continents were collected into a single continent called Gondwana Gondwana started the period in equatorial latitudes and as the period progressed drifted toward the South Pole Early in the Ordovician the continents Laurentia Siberia and Baltica were still independent continents

The Ordovician was a time of calcite sea geochemistry in which low magnesium calcite was the primary inorganic marine precipitate of calcium carbonate

For most of the Ordovician life continued to flourish but near the end of the period the End Ordovician extinction event seriously affected planktonic forms like conodonts graptolites and some groups of trilobites Brachiopods bryozoans and echinoderms were also heavily affected and the cone shaped nautiloids died out completely except for rare Silurian forms 

The extinctions may have been caused by an ice age that occurred at the end of the Ordovician period the end of the Ordovician was one of the coldest times in the last 600 million years of earth history

On the whole the fauna that emerged in the Ordovician set the scene for the remainder of the Palaeozoic The fauna was dominated by suspension feeders mainly with short food chains The ecological system reached a new grade of complexity far beyond that of the Cambrian fauna

Though less famous than the Cambrian explosion the Ordovician featured an adaptive radiation which was no less remarkable Marine genera increased fourfold resulting in 12 of all known Phanerozoic marine fauna Another change in the fauna was the strong increase in filter feeding organisms The articulate brachiopods cephalopods and crinoids took over Articulate brachiopods in particular largely replaced trilobites in shelf communities This illustrates the greatly increased diversity of carbonate shell secreting organisms in the Ordovician compared to the Cambrian Although solitary corals date back to at least the Cambrian reef forming corals appeared in the early Ordovician

Molluscs which appeared during the Cambrian or even the Ediacaran became common and varied especially bivalves gastropods and nautiloid cephalopods Now extinct marine animals called graptolites thrived in the oceans Some new cystoids and crinoids appeared

It was long thought that the first true vertebrates appeared in the Ordovician but recent discoveries in China show they probably originated in the Lower Cambrian The very first Gnathostomata appeared in the Upper Ordovician

During the Middle Ordovician there was a large increase in bioeroding organisms This is known as the Ordovician Bioerosion Revolution It is marked by a sudden abundance of hard substrate trace fossils

In the Lower Ordovician trilobites were joined by many new brachiopods bryozoans planktonic graptolites and conodonts and many types of molluscs and echinoderms including the ophiuroids and the first sea stars Nevertheless the trilobites remained abundant with all the Late Cambrian orders continuing and being joined by the new group Phacopida The first evidence of land plants also appeared

Trilobites in the Ordovician were very different from their predecessors in the Cambrian Many trilobites developed bizarre spines and nodules to defend against predators such as primitive sharks and nautiloids Other trilobites evolved to become swimming forms Some trilobites even developed shovel like snouts for ploughing through muddy sea bottoms Some trilobites such as Asaphus kowalewski evolved long eyestalks to assist in detecting predators whereas other trilobite eyes in contrast disappeared completely

The renowned Burgess Shale fauna disappears in the Middle Cambrian It is now known that it did not go extinct but suvived and thrived where the circumstances were right Recently discovered lagersttten has been found in Morocco The site contains remarkable fossils of soft bodied animals from a muddy ocean floor The fauna also includes some hard bodied animals such as horseshoe crabs Probably low oxygen conditions kept predators and scavengers to a minimum

The Silurian is the period that extends from the end of the Ordovician about 444 million years ago to the beginning of the Devonian period about 416 mya As with other geologic periods the rock beds that define the periods start and end are well identified but the exact dates are uncertain by several million years The base of the Silurian is set at a major extinction when 60 of marine species were wiped out the Ordovician Silurian extinction events

The Silurian was the first period to see macrofossils of extensive terrestrial biota in the form of moss forests along lakes and streams

The first fossil records of vascular plants that is land plants with tissues that carry food appeared in the second half of the Silurian period The earliest known representatives of this group are the Cooksonia and Baragwanathia A primitive Silurian land plant with xylem and phloem but no differentiation in root stem or leaf was much branched Psilophyton This plant reproducied by spores and respired through stomata on every surface and probably photosynthesizing in every tissue exposed to light 

Some evidence suggests the presence of primitive predatory arachnids and myriapods in Late Silurian rocks Predatory invertebrates would indicate that simple food webs were in place that included non predatory prey animals

The Devonian is the period of the Paleozoic era from from 416 million years to 359 million years ago It is named after Devonshire England where rocks from this period were first studied

Sea levels were high and there was a great variety of fish and other marine organisms The Devonian fish included the Agnatha the Acanthodii the Placoderms the Chondrichthyes and the early Osteichthyes

During the Devonian the first stages of fish evolution into tetrapods occurred Various terrestrial arthropods also became established The first seed bearing plants spread across dry land forming huge forests

The supercontinent Pangaea was starting to form Tectonic and volcanic activity was high A series of extinction events occurred towards the end of the Devonian including a major event at the Frasnian Famennian boundary about 364 mya

The Proterozoic eon comes before the Phanerozoic It was a period before the first abundant complex life on Earth The name Proterozoic comes from the Greek earlier life The Proterozoic Eon extended from 2500 million years ago to 542mya and is the most recent part of the former Precambrian

The Proterozoic consists of 3 geologic eras from oldest to youngest

The well identified events were

Study of these rocks shows that the eon featured massive rapid continental accretion supercontinent cycles and mountain building

The Cainozoic is the present geological era The word is derived from Greek kainos new and zoe life The era covers the period from 655 million years ago to the present It started after the CretaceousTertiary extinction event which saw the demise of the last non avian dinosaurs and the end of the Mesozoic Era 

During the Cainozoic the continents moved into their present positions The climate started warm but global cooling continued steadily and finally ice ages occurred On land the Cainozoic is the era of mammals and of birds and flowering plants Grassland became a major habitat and aquatic mammals took over the roles of predatory reptiles like the mosasaurs and plesiosaurs As a result the ecological landscape of the Cainozoic has become quite different from the Mesozoic

Previously what is now the Cainozoic was divided into two periods the Tertiary and the Quaternary The Tertiary coresponded to the PalaeogeneNeogene Now the term Tertiary is not used officially 

The Cainozoic is spilt down into three periods and the periods are split into stages

Token passing is a communication protocol used in telecommunications The system uses a signal called a token to limited when a device can transmit on the network Only the device with the token can transmit When that device is done the token is sent to the next device With large transmissions the token may move to the next station before the transmission is finished The device has to wait until it gets the token back before it can continue to send data The most well known examples of token passing are token ring and ARCNET

The rules of the system say how long a device may keep the token how long it can transmit for and how to create a new token if there is not one in use

Carrier Sense Multiple Access is a Media Access Control protocol When transmitting on a medium that is shared by many transmitters the transmitter first checks to see that nothing else is already transmitting Examples of shared transmission medium include an electrical bus or part of the electromagnetic spectrum

Carrier Sense means that a transmitter uses feedback from a receiver to know if the medium is already in use before trying to send That is it tries to find a signal from another station before trying to transmit If a signal is found the station waits for that transmission to end before starting its own transmission

Multiple Access means that many stations send and receive on the medium Transmissions are usually received by all other stations using the medium

The Archean eon is the geological period after the Hadean and before the Proterozoic It lasted from 3800 million years ago to 2500mya It contains the first sedimentary rocks and the first fossil life forms which were cyanobacteria and acritarchs

Most of the rocks which survive are volcanic and metamorphic in origin Volcanic activity was everywhere the heat flow from the Earth was at least twice as much as today The question of when plate tectonics began is a major research area Small protocontinents formed There were oceans already early in the Archaean

The atmosphere almost entirely lacked free oxygen and instead CO2 was a major constituent Fossil bacterial mats called stromatolites are found throughout the Archaean after about 3500mya These were formed by cyanobacteria who used photosynthesis and gave off oxygen as a by product

The Archean is one of the four main time periods of Earth history When the Archean began the Earths heat flow was nearly three times higher than it is today It was still twice the current level at the transition from the Archean to the Proterozoic

Most of the surviving Archean rocks are metamorphic or igneous Volcanic activity was considerably higher than today with numerous hot spots rift valleys and lava eruptions

The Earth of the early Archean may have supported a tectonic condition different from that of the present Some scientists argue that because the Earth was much hotter tectonic activity was more vigorous than it is today resulting in a much faster rate of recycling of crustal material This may have prevented continents formating until the mantle cooled and convection slowed down Others argue that the subcontinental lithospheric mantle was too buoyant to subduct and that the rarity of Archean rocks is a function of erosion by subsequent tectonic events The question of whether or not plate tectonic activity existed in the Archean is an active area of modern geoscientific research

An explanation for the general lack of Hadean rocks is the large amount of rocky and icy debris present in the early Solar System After the eight planets formed large numbers of leftover protoplanets asteroids and comets pursued eccentric orbits throughout our system bombarding the early Earth and the other planets and moons until approximately 3800 MA This activity may have prevented any large crustal fragments from forming by literally shattering the early protocontinents A barrage of particularly large impactors known as the Late Heavy Bombardment represents the climax of this violent era

The Hadean is the geological eon before the Archaean It began at the Earths formation about 46 billion years ago and ended 38 billion years ago The name Hadean comes from Hades Greek for Underworld due to the conditions on the Earth at the time The geologist Preston Cloud first used the term in 1972 Meteorite bombardment volcanism and high temperatures were very wide spread on the early Earth

There are no sedimentary rocks from the Hadean at all The earliest geological objects on Earth are some zircons dated to about 4400 million years ago Oceans would probably have formed as soon as the temperature allowed It is thought that constant bombardment kept the Earth in a molten state until about the end of the eon 

Early in Earth history the Moon was torn out by a massive collision with a proto planet The evidence for this giant impact hypothesis is

No life forms are known from this eon The early atmosphere contained carbon dioxide methane and nitrogen but almost no oxygen

The Permian is a geological period which started 299 million years ago and ends 251 million years ago It is the last period of the Paleozoic era and ended in the largest mass extinction known to science 

The climate in the Permian was quite varied At the start of the Permian the Earth was still at the grip of an Ice age from the Carboniferous Glaciers receded around the mid Permian period as the climate gradually warmed drying the continents interiors In the late Permian period the drying continued although the temperature cycled between warm and cool cycles

During the Permian tetrapod life which evolved in the Carboniferous became widespread and diverse The first modern trees appeared in the Permian

The Permian was also a period of adaptive radiation in insects Beetles appeared so did flies 22 out of a total of 36 known orders of insects are known from the Permian Some became extinct in the end Permian event but more radiation followed in the Mesozoic Insects were probably by the end of the Permian the largest phylum in terms of number of species

Early relatives of cockroaches were the most common insects and dragonflies ruled the air True Odonata appeared in the Permian

All the major land masses were collected together in the super continent Pangaea At the end of the period the greatest flood basalt lava flows in the Phanerozoic raised world temperatures and damaged the environment These formed the extensive Siberian traps The causes of the PermianTriassic extinction event are not yet agreed between scientists Trilobites once a dominant life form in the ocean became extinct together with 90 of all marine species

A circus is a special kind of entertainment that can be enjoyed by children and adults Circuses are a group of performers that may include acrobats clowns trained animals trapeze acts musicians hoopers tightrope walkers jugglers and other artists who perform stunts Circuses usually travel about to different parts of the country or to different countries They perform in a huge tent called the Big Top There may be room for hundreds of people in the audience The seating is tiered In the middle is the circular area where the artists perform This area is called the ring The person in charge of the whole show is the ringmaster Not all circuses travel about A few circuses perform in their own building

There are many different acts in circuses Some people do acrobatics and gymnastics Often a group of gymnasts will finish up standing on top of one another in a pyramid The gymnasts may also do jumping acts on trampolines Some people are jugglers throwing things in the air and catching them There may be people who walk on stilts or who ride on unicycles They may perform magic which may include swordswallowing knife throwing or fireeating There are always clowns who do funny things to make people laugh They trip over things and fall over throw buckets of water over one another or put custard pies into one anothers faces Sometimes these clowns are also very skilful acrobats musicians or jugglers They may pretend to be stupid at first but they often show that they are very clever

During the last two centuries and until recently the modern circus used many kinds of animals There were wild animals such as lions tigers or bears There may also have been camels horses elephants sea lions and domestic animals such as dogs In recent years people have changed their ideas They think that it is unkind to make wild animals perform tricks that are unnatural to them Many of their trainers used cruel methods to teach these animals to do tricks eg hitting the animals giving them electric shocks or causing pain in other ways The animals were always touring around living in tiny cages Many countries now do not want to see wild animals in circuses

In Ancient Rome the circus was a round or oval building for showing horse and chariot races horse shows staged battles acts with animals jugglers and acrobats The Roman circus had tiered seats The important people sat at the bottom near the action The Latin word circus comes from the Greek word kirkos meaning circle or ring 

The first circus in Rome was the Circus Maximus in the valley between the Palatine and Aventine hills At first it was made of wood It was rebuilt several times the last building of the Circus Maximus could seat 250000 people

After the period when Rome was powerful Europe did not have a circus tradition In China there were shows with acrobatic performances but they did not influence the Western circus which started to be popular towards the end of the 18th century In London there were circuses with horse riding These were started in 1768 by Philip Astley A Royal Circus was set up in Lambeth London by John Hughes Circuses grew in size and had lots of animals They were a bit like a zoo They had wild animals such as lions and elephants In 1793 a circus building was opened in Philadelphia USA Circuses became popular in the USA especially the circus of Dan Rice In 1840 Thomas Cooke brought his circus with horses from the USA to England The circus started to become popular in many countries all over the world The Barnum Bailey Greatest Show On Earth toured from 1897 to 1902 They showed animal acts and human acts There were even shows with freaks people who were physically unusual eg dwarfs and giants During most of the 20th century this is what circuses were mostly like

In 1919 Lenin head of the USSR said he wanted the circus to be treated as a serious art form just like opera and ballet The Moscow Circus School which was started in 1927 is still one of the best circuses today The artists are very skilful acrobats gymnasts etc Chinese circuses also have artists who are some of the worlds best gymnasts

Catherine Morland is one of the main characters in Jane Austens book Northanger Abbey She enjoys reading the mysterious and scary gothic novels that were popular in her time She often has a tendency to blur the lines between fiction and reality which causes her a great deal of trouble throughout Northanger Abbey She is the neighbor of Mr Allens a wealthy man and goes with him to Bath a city in Northeastern Somerset England Jane Austen used her to mock the obvious classics where the perfect heroes fall in love with the heroines and they marry and live happily ever after

Jane Austen in the beginning of Chapter Two describes her as having a heart that was affectionate a disposition cheerful and open without conceit or affectation

The book Northanger Abbey begins with No one who had ever seen Catherine Morland in her infancy would have supposed her born to be an heroine Her father Richard is a clergyman who even though he is not rich is not poor her mother is a woman of useful plain sense with a good temper and what is more remarkable with a good constitution Catherine is called plain when she is young with a thin awkward figure a broken wikt linksallowsallow skin without colour dark broken wikt linklanklank hair and strong features She likes to play boys games more than playing with dolls and does not like lessons though she does like stories and fables Catherine likes to tinkling the keys of the old broken wikt linkforlornforlorn spinnet but she hates learning music and the day which dismissed the music master was one of the happiest in Catherines life She does not draw well she did not like writing or accounts or French However she is usually nice to her brothers and sisters and listens to her parents

Catherine becomes almost pretty at 15 when she grows plumper cleaner and more broken wikt linkanimationanimated She begins reading better books like those that Pope Gray Thompson and Shakespeares Mrs Allen invites her to come to Bath with her and she agrees There she is always very polite to Mrs Allen and is humbly satisfied when a few men call her a pretty girl She falls in love with Henry Tilney and even though they misunderstand each other some times they quickly become good friends She also becomes friends with broken wikt linkeleganceelegant Eleanor Tilney and she is invited to Northanger Abbey General Tilney Henrys father is kind to her and she is happy But sometimes she is too imaginative for instance she thinks General Tilney murdered his wife Henrys gentle talk with her soon makes her more clear sighted The sudden rudeness of General Tilney makes her very sad until Henry comes and proposes to her he also explains the Generals first attentions and later rudeness the General had at first thought Catherine was very rich and later thought Catherine was really poor Actually Catherine is neither  she lives quite comfortably At the end of the book they marry happily

In 1959 he released an album called Kind of Blue which became very famous and popular In 2008 it had sold 4 million copies In 2006 Davis was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and described as one of the key figures in the history of jazz

Miles Davis was born in 1926 in Alton Illinois His father Dr Miles Henry Davis was a dentist In 1927 the family moved to East St Louis They also owned a big ranch in northern Arkansas where Davis learned to ride horses

Daviss mother Cleota Mae Davis wanted him to learn to play the piano She was a good blues pianist but did not tell her son this Davis started to learn music when he was 13 when his father gave him a trumpet and arranged for him to have lessons with local musician Elwood Buchanan Buchanan taught Davis to play the trumpet without vibrato and Davis always played like this Buchanan was said to slap Daviss knuckles every time he started using heavy vibrato Davis later said I prefer a round sound with no attitude in it like a round voice with not too much tremolo and not too much Baseline bass Just right in the middle If I cant get that sound I cant play anything

When he was 16 Davis played the trumpet professionally when he was not at school At 17 he played in bandleader Eddie Randles band for a year Saxophone player Sonny Stitt tried to persuade Davis to join the Tiny Bradshaw band but Daviss mother wanted Davis to finish his final year of high school

In 1944 the Billy Eckstine band visited East St Louis Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker were in the band and Davis joined them as third trumpet player when trumpeter Buddy Anderson was out sick When the band left to finish the tour Davis parents still wanted him to finish his studies

After he graduated from high school in 1944 Davis moved to New York City to study at the Juilliard School of Music 

When he arrived in New York he spent most of his time trying to get in contact with Charlie Parker even though some people had told him that he should not When he found Parker Davis became involved in jam sessions that took place every night in two of Harlems night clubs Mintons Playhouse and Monroes Other famous musicians like Thelonious Monk and Kenny Clarke also tookpart in these sessions 

Davis left Juilliard early having first asked permission from his father He did not like the classes at Juilliard because he thought they focused too much on classical European and white music He also said that his Juilliard classes helped him to understand music theory

He began playing professionally in many jazz groups performing in several 52nd Street clubs with Coleman Hawkins and Eddie Lockjaw Davis In 1945 he went into a recording studio for the first time as a member of the group of Herbie Fields In 1946 he made his first recording as a bandleader with a group called Miles Davis Sextet plus Earl Coleman and Ann Hathaway He did not make many recordings as a bandleader at this time

Around 1945 Dizzy Gillespie stopped working with Parker and Parker hired Davis as Gillespies replacement in his quintet Also in the group were Max Roach at the drums Al Haig at the piano and Curley Russell as bass player

With Parkers quintet Davis recorded several times He had a solo on Parkers signature song Nows the Time This solo led to the beginning of a style of jazz called cool jazz The group also toured the United States During a tour in Los Angeles Parker had a nervous breakdown and went to the Camarillo State Mental Hospital for several months Davis found himself stuck in LA He stayed with and played music with jazz musician Charles Mingus Later he got a job with Billy Eckstine on a California tour that brought him back to New York In 1948 Parker returned from Los Angeles and Davis joined his group again

The musicians in Parkers group were not getting on very well Parkers behavior was unpredictable because of his drug addiction Davis and Roach did not agree with Parker hiring Duke Jordan as a pianist and would have preferred Bud Powell In December 1948 Davis left the group after an argument with Parker at the Royal Roost He began to work more independently with different groups in New York

In 1948 Davis grew close to the Canadian composer and music arranger Gil Evans Davis used to meet other musicians at Evans house like Roach the pianist John Lewis and the baritone saxophone player Gerry Mulligan Evans had been the arranger for the orchestra of Claude Thornhill and it was the sound of this group as well as Duke Ellingtons example that inspired the creation of a large group including a french horn and a tuba

Davis took a very active role in the project and it soon became his project They tried to achieve a sound similar to a human voice over carefully arranged compositions

The group first played in the summer of 1948 at the Royal Roost They were active to the end of 1949 and had several changes of musician There were many white musicians in the group and this made some African American jazz players angry Many of them were unemployed at the time Davis did not listen to them

The group got a recording contract with Capitol Records and they had several recording sessions between January 1949 and April 1950 This music was released on an album called Birth of the Cool This album gave its name to a new style of jazz called cool jazz Davisknew how important his project was and even turned down a job with Duke Ellingtons orchestra This group also led to the beginning of the lifelong friendship between Davis and Gil Evans

Josef Mysliveek was a Czech composer in the classical music period Although his music is not often performed these days he composed a lot of attractive music which often sounds like Mozart During the 1770s he was a good friend of the Mozart family

Josef Mysliveek was born near Prague He was a twin His father was a miller who had quite a lot of money After he left school he became a miller in the family business He also studied music He had already been a chorister in the choir of St Michals church where Felix Benda was choirmaster From 1760 he studied counterpoint with Frantiek Habermann and organ with Josef Seger He started to compose He wrote six sinfonias which were called after the first six months of the year 

When his father died Mysliveek decided to become a composer He left the family business to his younger brother He wanted to learn more about composing so in 1763 he travelled to Venice to study with Giovanni Pescetti In Italy he became known as Il Boemo and also Venatorini the little hunter which is what his name means literally Most composers in those days were employed by wealthy nobles or rulers but Mysliveek earned his living through teaching performing and composing music He often got sums of money from wealthy people who liked his music Although he came from a wealthy family he was careless with his money When he died he was very poor

Mysliveek stayed in Italy for the rest of his life He only revisited Prague once Several of his operas were performed there He also went to Vienna in 1773 and Munich from 1776 1778 He composed operas for several Italian theatres He met Mozart in Bologna in 1770 Mozart was only 14 at the time He was good friends with the Mozart family until 1778 when the Mozarts broke off their friendship because Mysliveek promised but then did not arrange for Mozart to write an opera for the theatre in Naples 

Mysliveek had many sexual relationships during his life although we do not know the names of his lovers In the end he became ill with syphilis He was very ill during the last part of his life His face became a very strange shape apparently because he was operated on by a bad surgeon Mozart was very upset when he saw him looking so ill

A lot of his music sounds like some of the early works of Mozart Mozart in return uses several musical themes from compositions by Mysliveek He also made an arrangement of an operatic aria by Mysliveeks Il caro mio bene Mozart changed the words and wrote Ridente la calma KV 152 for soprano with piano accompaniment

He wrote twenty six opera seria more than any other composer at that time They are full of da capo arias in which the singers can show off their technique His orchestral music does not sound Czech it is much more Italian in style However some of his chamber music has some Czech folk tunes

His other pieces include oratorios symphonies concertos and chamber music including some of the earliest known string quintets composed with two violas He was also one of the first composers to write good music for wind ensemble He wrote some excellent violin concertos

Frederick Sanger OM CH CBE FRS is an English biochemist 

Sanger is a two time Nobel laureate in chemistry the only person to have been so Sanger is the fourth person to have been awarded two Nobel Prizes either individually or in tandem with others

In 1958 he was awarded a Nobel prize in chemistry for his work on the structure of proteins especially that of insulin 

In 1980 Walter Gilbert and Sanger shared half of the chemistry prize for their contributions concerning the determination of base sequences in nucleic acids The other half was awarded to Paul Berg for his fundamental studies of the biochemistry of nucleic acids with particular regard to recombinant DNA

Sanger retired in 1983 to his home Far Leys in Swaffham Bulbeck outside Cambridge 

In 1992 the Wellcome Trust and the Medical Research Council founded the Sanger Centre named after him The Institute is on the Wellcome Trust Genome Campus near Hinxton only a few miles from Sangers home John Sulston the founding director asked Sanger if the centre could be named in his honor Sanger agreed but warned It had better be good It was opened by Sanger himself on 4 October 1993 with a staff of less than 50 people The Institute now has a leading role in the sequencing of the human genome The Institute now has over 900 people and is one of the worlds largest genomic research centres

Although he retains his dislike of violence he has lost his Quaker religious faith and calls himself an agnostic In an interview published in the Times newspaper in 2000 Sanger is quoted as saying My father was a committed Quaker and I was brought up as a Quaker and for them truth is very important I drifted away from those beliefs one is obviously looking for truth but one needs some evidence for it Even if I wanted to believe in God I would find it very difficult I would need to see proof

He declined the offer of a knighthood as he did not wish to be addressed as Sir but later accepted the award of an Order of Merit

In 2007 the British Biochemical Society was given a grant by the Wellcome Trust to catalogue and preserve the 35 laboratory notebooks in which Sanger recorded his remarkable research from 1944 to 1983 In reporting this matter Science journal noted that Sanger the most self effacing person you could hope to meet was now spending his time gardening at his Cambridgeshire home

The 1899 Atlantic hurricane season was during the summer and fall of 1899 Nine storms were seen during this time five of them were hurricane and the other four were tropical storms Hurricane Three or the Hurricane San Ciriaco was the longest lived Atlantic hurricane It also killed about 3433 people making it the tenth deadliest Atlantic hurricane 

Tropical Storm One 

Tropical Storm One was a weak tropical storm in late June One started in the northwest corner of the Gulf of Mexico It made landfall in Texas and quickly died the same day 

This storm was seen about 2 days before it hit Hispaniola It later hit Florida in the Panhandle on August 1 Two died the next day This storm killed 6 people and caused almost 600000 in damage

Hurricane Three 

Hurricane Three which was called the Hurricane San Ciriaco was the longest lived hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean The hurricane affected about six countries This hurricane lived from August 3 to September 4 nearly a month It killed about 3433 people

Hurricane Four was a category 2 hurricane that struck Haiti in early September The hurricane caused no damage or deaths 

Hurricane Five was a category 3 hurricane that mostly stayed at sea But before it died it hit Newfoundland as a weak hurricane 

Six was a strong tropical storm in early October 1899 It died not very long after making a landfall near Gainesville Florida

Tropical Storm Seven was a weak tropical storm It lasted during the middle of October 1899 Seven did not affect any land

Paul Czanne was a French painter He was born and died in Aix en Provence in the south of France

The artistic career of Paul Czanne spanned more than forty years from roughly 1860 to 1906 A prolific artist he produced more than 900 oil paintings and 400 watercolours including many incomplete works 

Cezannes work is broadly post impressionist His work helped the transition from the 19th century idea of art to the very different world of art in the 20th century Czanne forms the bridge between late 19th century Impressionism and the early 20th century Cubism The line attributed to both Matisse and Picasso that Czanne is the father of us all is significant

Czannes work demonstrates a mastery of design colour and composition His brushstrokes are clearly recognizable He used planes of colour and small brushstrokes that build up to form complex fields The paintings convey Czannes intense study of his subjects a searching gaze and a struggle to deal with the complexity of human visual perception

In Paris Czanne met the Impressionist Camille Pissarro in the mid 1860s Initially the friendship was that of master and disciple with Pissarro exerting an influence on the younger artist Over the course time their landscape painting excursions in Louveciennes and Pontoise led to a working relationship between equals

Czannes early work is often concerned with the figure in the landscape imaginatively painted Later in his career he became more interested in working from direct observation and gradually developed a light airy painting style that was to influence the Impressionists enormously In Czannes mature work we see the development of a solidified almost architectural style of painting He ordered whatever he saw into simple forms and colour planes His statement I want to make of impressionism something solid and lasting like the art in the museums and his contention that he was re creating Poussin after nature proved his desire to unite observation of nature with the permanence of classical composition

Many of his paintings show people bathing with the Montagne Sainte Victoire in the background These mountains are situated east of Aix en Provence He also painted many still lifes and portraits of his wife with these mountains 

His colleagues included Pissarro Monet and Renoir Ambroise Vollard an art critic with a gallery was among the first people who bought Czannes artworks In 1895 Vollard had the first exhibition showing Czannes works in his gallery in Paris 

Czannes work influenced other artists especially Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque who started Cubism as well as Henri Matisse Paul Czanne can also be seen as a post impressionist who contributed to modernism in painting Paul Cezanne painted over 900 oil paintings and 400 watercolours over 200 of them being Still Life

Alice DeeJay was a Dutch electronic music group who achieved success from 1999 to 2002 The group consisted of record producers Pronti Kalmani and DJ Jurgen with lead singer Judith Anna Pronk

Myriapoda is a subphylum of arthropods containing millipedes centipedes and others The group contains 13000 species all of which are terrestrial Although their name suggests they have many legs myriapods range from having over 750 legs to having fewer than ten legs 

The fossil record of myriapods reaches back into the late Silurian although molecular evidence suggests a diversification in the Cambrian period and Cambrian fossils exist which resemble myriapods

Myriapods have a single pair of antennae and in most cases simple eyes The mouthparts lie on the underside of the head with an epistome and labrum forming the upper lip and a pair of maxillae forming the lower lip A pair of mandibles lie inside the mouth Myriapods breathe through spiracles that connect to a tracheal system similar to that of insects

There has been much debate as to which arthropod group is most closely related to the Myriapoda Under the Mandibulata hypothesis Myriapoda is the sister taxon to Pancrustacea a group comprising the Crustacea and Hexapoda Under the Atelocerata hypothesis Hexapoda is the closest whereas under the Paradoxopoda hypothesis Chelicerata is the closest This last hypothesis although supported by few if any morphological characters is supported by a number of molecular studies

There are four classes of extant myriapods Chilopoda Diplopoda Pauropoda and Symphyla containing a total of around 12000 species While each of these groups of myriapods is believed to be monophyletic relationships among them are less certain

Centipedes make up the order Chilopoda They are fast predatory and venomous hunting mostly at night There are around 3300 species ranging from the diminutive Nannarup hoffmani to the giant Scolopendra gigantea which may exceed convert30cmin0

Most millipedes are slower than centipedes and feed on leaf litter and detritus They are distinguished by the fusion of each pair of body segments into a single unit giving the appearance of having two pairs of legs per segment Around 8000 species have been described which may represent less than a tenth of the true global millipede diversity One species Illacme plenipes has the greatest number of legs of any animal with 750 The name millipede is a compound word formed from the Latin roots milli and ped although millipedes typically have between 36 and 400 legs Pill millipedes are much shorter and are capable of rolling up into a ball like pillbugs

About 200 species of symphylans are known worldwide They resemble centipedes but are smaller and translucent Many spend their lives as soil infauna but some live arboreally Juveniles have six pairs of legs but over a lifetime of several years add an additional pair at each moult so that the adult instar has twelve pairs of legs

Pauropoda is another small group of small myriapods They are typically 0520 mm long and live in the soil on all continents except Antarctica Over 700 species have been described They are believed to be the sister group to millipedes and have the dorsal tergites fused across pairs of segments similar to the more complete fusion of segments seen in millipedes

Arthropleuridea were ancient myriapods that are now extinct The most famous members are from the genus Arthropleura which was a giant probably herbivorous animal that could be up to convert3mft long Arthropleuridea may be a division of the millipedes

 Thomas Linley was an English composer and violinist He was born in the same year as Mozart and like Mozart he was an astonishing child prodigy He would almost certainly have been one of Englands greatest composers if he had not died at the age of 22

Thomas came from a musical family His father also called Thomas Linley was a composer singing teacher and harpsichord player His young son was soon showing exceptional musical skills We do not know who taught him the violin in his early years but people writing at the time all say he was a brilliant player He went to Italy to study the violin and composition with Nardini in Florence He met Mozart there in 1770 and he also met Charles Burney in the same year Burney wrote that Linley was the most promising genius of the time

In 1771 Linley went back to England He was the leader of the orchestra in the theatre in Drury Lane He often played concertos between the acts of oratorios

During the last five years of his life he composed a large amount of excellent music Unfortunately a lot of it has been lost Gainsborough twice painted a portrait of him

He died in a boating accident when he was on holiday with his family in Lincolnshire

Kaiane Aldorino won Miss World 2009 on December 12 2009 She was born July 8 1986 in Gibraltar In 2009 Gibraltar sent a candidate for the first time 

Thomas Linley was an English composer harpsichordist and singing teacher He studied with Thomas Chilcot organist of Bath Abbey and later with William Boyce and possibly also with Paradies the Italian harpsichordist who had come to live in England

He soon became very well known as a singing teacher and composed a lot of music for the Drury Lane theatre London

He married a girl called Mary Johnson and the couple had twelve children Several of them were extremely gifted musicians especially Thomas who sadly died at the age of 22 in a boating accident

Thomas Linley was chosen to be a member of the Royal Society of Musicians in 1777 He is buried in Wells Cathedral

A hypothetical imperative is a rule of the form If you want x then do y Moral theories may generally have this structure This means that only those who want x must do y Another view is that moral values are not relative to some objective but are the same for all that is they are unconditional or categorical

The term was coined by Immanuel Kant Kant said that moral values had to be unconditional categorical he wrote a categorical imperative 

William Boyce is one of the most important English composers of the 18th century He was composing during the last years of the Baroque period and the early years of the Classical Period He is famous for his church music as well as music for the theatre and orchestral music

Boyce was born in the City of London His father was a cabinet maker His house was known by the sign of a Naked Boy which hung outside  

Boyce was a choirboy at St Pauls Cathedral and then studied music with Maurice Greene after his voice broke  When he had finished his studies he got a job as organist at the Earl of Oxfords chapel in Cavendish Square Two years later he went to St Michaels Cornhill He was still studying music now his teacher was Pepusch

Boyce wrote songs for Vauxhall Gardens Many people would have heard these songs He became composer to the Chapel Royal in 1736 This was a great honour He wrote several big works although we do not know much about them or about their performances Some time during the 1740s he composed a theatre work called The Secular Masque The words were by John Dryden In 1749 he was given the title of Doctor of Music after a performance of his anthem O be joyful

Boyce was very famous by now He went to live in a large house in Chancery Lane He seems to have married and started a family He was asked to compose for the theatre in Drury Lane It is surprising he had not been asked to write theatre music before It may be because he was going deaf This would have made it difficult for him to rehearse his music with the orchestra

Boyce wrote a good deal of music for the theatre There seems to have been some rivalry with the composer Thomas Arne Probably the composers themselves did not want this rivalry it was encouraged by their supporters

In 1755 when Maurice Green died William Boyce was made Master of the Kings Music in his place He was expected to compose odes for every New Year and for the Kings birthday He did this for the rest of his life

Not much of Boyces works were published during his lifetime He wrote eight symphonies The earlier ones are in a Baroque style Later his style started to change to become more Classical but by the time he was very deaf he could not hear new music that was being composed by other people so his style did not develop any more He spent a lot of his time putting together a collection of church music called Cathedral Music It included music from two centuries of English church music especially music by John Blow Henry Purcell Pelham Humfrey and Orlando Gibbons He encouraged singers to sing with a score in front of them instead of just the part that they sing so that they could see how their part fitted in with the others This is normal today but it was a new idea at the time He had to spend a lot of his time writing unimportant music for the king which was unlikely ever to be performed more than once

Boyce is best known for his eight symphonies his anthems and his odes He also wrote the masque Peleus and Thetis and songs for John Drydens Secular Masque incidental music for William Shakespeares The Tempest Cymbeline Romeo and Juliet and The Winters Tale and a lot of chamber music including a set of twelve trio sonatas He also composed the British and Canadian Naval March Heart of Oak The lyrics were later written by David Garrick His music is always skilfully written especially his fugues and dances 

Boyce was largely forgotten after his death In the 19th century he was known mainly for editing Cathedral Music Today some of his orchestral and instrumental pieces are often played

The Kalgan River is located in Western Australia near Albany It is one of the oldest rivers in the World and has seen dinasours on its banks

The river was named the Riviere des Francais by the French Scientific Expedition in 1803 led by Nicolas Baudin Early settlers called it the French River The explorer Dr Alexander Collie wrote down the name of the river as Kal gan up in April 1831 The name Kalganup is thought to be the Noongar word for place of many waters Kalganup is also thought to mean place of fishes and there are still the remains of Aboriginal fish traps to prove the point

The Quaternary is a geological period It is the second period of the Cainozoic era It contains two stages

The status of the Quaternary as a period has recently been confirmed by the International Commission on Stratigraphy The Quaternary now follows the Tertiary and the Neogene is the second and last sub period of the Tertiary

During the Quaternary there were the extinctions of many large mammalian species due to climate change and hunting by humans

iCal is a personal calendar application made by Apple Inc that runs on the Mac OS X operating system iCal was the first calendar application for Mac OS X to offer support for multiple calendars and the ability to publishsubscribe calendars to WebDAV server

Originally released as a free download for Mac OS X v102 on September 10 2002 with the release of Mac OS X v103 it was bundled with the operating system as iCal 15 Version 2 of iCal was released as part of Mac OS X v104 Version 3 with Mac OS X v105 and Version 4 as part of Mac OS X v106

Apple licensed the iCal name from Brown Bear Software who have used it for their iCal application since 1997

iCal development is quite different from other Apple software because it was designed independently by a small French team working secretly in Paris led by Jean Marie Hullot a friend of Steve Jobs iCals development has since been transferred to Apple US headquarters in Cupertino

It has been reported that some users of iCal who have their calendar on a CalDAV server can not view or add events to their calendar This issue is specific to Google Calendar users

The release of Snow Leopard introduced several bugs into Snow Leopard with regard to iCal alarms These problems include alarms not firing all alarms being set to one fixed date and time in the past preventing them from firing alarms from repeat events being fired for all historic occurrences of that repeated event resulting in dozens of alarms for one event Updates to Snow Leopard 1061 and 1062 have not addressed these problems

iCal supports times zones ie if the function is enabled and the computers time zone changes all the events in iCal are shifted to compensate for the time zone difference The bug is that this function also occur when it is turned off therefore when ever the computers time zone changes all the events in iCal shift as well As of today there is still no fix for this bug

The Palaeogene is the first geological sub period in the Tertiary It is composed of three stages Palaeocene Eocene and Miocene

The Neogene is the second geological sub period in the Tertiary It is composed of two stages Miocene and Pliocene

The Palaeocene is the first geological epoch in the Neogene It started after the end of the Cretaceous and lasted for about 10 million years It was followed by the Eocene epoch

The Palaeocene began and ended with an extinction event each of quite a different character The epoch began with the KT extinction event caused by a combination of a meteorite strike and a huge volcanic flood basalt eruption which produced the Deccan Traps in what is now India This caused the extinction of many groups including the dinosaurs and many other reptiles The epoch ended with the PalaeoceneEocene Thermal Maximum a deep ocean anoxic event This means that the ocean depths were lacking oxygen so no higher forms of life could survive This produced a mass extinction of between 3550 of deep water forms such as benthic foraminifera and co incided with a major change of mammalian types on land

After a cooler start the climate grew warmer during the epoch far warmer than today and the world was heavily forested There were no ice caps at the poles Warm seas circulated throughout the world including the poles The earliest Paleocene featured a low diversity and abundance of marine life but this trend reversed later in the epoch Tropical conditions gave rise to abundant marine life including coral reefs With the demise of marine reptiles at the end of the Cretaceous sharks became the top predators At the end of the Cretaceous the ammonites and many species of foraminifera became extinct

Marine faunas also came to resemble modern faunas with only the marine mammals and an important family of sharks the Carcharhinidae are missing

Non avian dinosaurs may have survived to some extent into the early Danian stage of the Paleocene Epoch circa 645 Mya The controversial evidence for such is a hadrosaur leg bone found from Paleocene strata in New Mexico but such stray late forms may be derived fossils This means they were fossilised then erosion uncovered them then they were buried again in a younger layer of rocks

The Palaeocene is divided into three stages

The Eocene is a geological epoch or stage the second in the Tertiary It lasted from about 558 million years to 34 million years and was followed by the Oligocene epoch During its 22 million years modern mammals became prominent Most modern mammalian orders and many of the modern families are present by the end of the Eocene

The Eocene like the Palaeocene before it had a climate much warmer than today At the start of the Eocene the PalaeoceneEocene Thermal Maximum was reached This lasted for 100000 years and caused a large extinction event At the end of the Eocene another extinction event occurred this time probably caused by meteorite strikes in Siberia and Chesapeake Bay

The land was heavily forested with temperate forests into the polar regions and the many herbivorous mammals were browsers not grazers

Islam is the official religion of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan In the 1998 census it found 97 of the total population were Muslims and in 2007 at 97 and out of Muslim population The estimated population of Muslims of Pakistan in 2009 is 175376000 Pakistan has the second largest Muslim population in the world after Indonesia The majority of Muslims in Pakistan are Sunnis and the Shia Muslim population is the second largest in the world after Iran more than 50 million

Islam arrived in the area of modern Pakistan in 711 CE 79 yrs after the of death of the prophet Muhammad when the Umayyad dynasty sent a Muslim Arab army led by Muhammad bin Qasim al Thaqafi against the ruler of Sindh Raja Dahir this was due to the fact that Raja Dahir had given refuge to numerous Zoroastrian Princes who had fled the Islamic conquest of Iran Muhammad Bin Qasims army was defeated in his first three attempts The Muslim army conquered the northwestern part of Indus Valley from Kashmir to the Arabian Sea The arrival of the Arab Muslims to the provinces of Sindh and Punjab along with subsequent Muslim dynasties set the stage for the religious boundaries of South Asia that would lead to the development of the modern state of Pakistan as well as forming the foundation for Islamic rule which quickly spread across much of South Asia Following the rule of various Islamic empires including the Ghaznavid Empire the Ghorid kingdom and the Delhi Sultanate the Mughals controlled the region from 1526 until 1739 Muslim technocrats bureaucrats soldiers traders scientists architects teachers theologians and Sufis flocked from the rest of the Muslim world to Islamic Sultanate and Mughal Empire in South Asia and in the land that became Pakistan

The Lower Cretaceous is the first epoch of the Cretaceous period from 1455 million years ago to 996 mya Before it came the Jurassic period and after it came the Upper Cretaceous Lasting for about 47 million years this is the longest stage in the Phanerozoic eon

The Lower Cretaceous is best displayed in England where it is composed of two series of rocks Between the two is a major rise in sea level 

The two parts of the Cretaceous represent the sea level where the divisions were first defined In the Lower Cretaceous the sea level was much lower than in the Upper Cretaceous In the Wealden Southern England was a huge tropical river delta in the Greensand the same areas were just offshore However in the Upper Cretaceous the deposits were made in deeper water on what was then the continental shelf Sea level then stood at its highest level in the Mesozoic

A trio sonata is a type of music for three instruments which was very popular during the 17th century and early 18th century the period known as the Baroque period

A trio sonata is written for three voices in other words it can be played by three different instruments The two upper voices share the same musical themes They often imitate one another They are of equal importance The third part the lowest part is played by basso continuo which means the accompaniment This continuo is usually played by two instruments typically a cello or bass viol and a keyboard instrument such as the harpsichord That makes four players of course However the harpsichord players left hand notes are the same as the cellos notes This is the third part of the trio

Some of the best trio sonatas are those by Arcangelo Corelli His collection of trio sonatas numbered opus 1 and 3 are sonata da chiesa four movements finishing with a fugue His op 2 and 4 sonatas are sonata da camera type each movement is a kind of dance Corellis trio sonatas are for two violins and continuo 

The trio sonata by Johann Sebastian Bach that belongs to the The Musical Offering is for violin flute and continuo 

Bach also wrote six trio sonatas for organ These are played by one player The organists two hands each play on different manuals so that they sound like two different instruments The organists feet play the third part on the pedals Each part is strictly a single line so that these works can also be played by other instruments

Bach also wrote sonatas for one melodic instrument and harpsichord These pieces are really trio sonatas although he does not call them trio sonatas The melodic instrument plays the top part the harpsichordist plays the second part with his right hand and the third part is the lowest part of his left hand notes

Some other composers who wrote trio sonatas are Tomaso Albinoni Henry Purcell Dieterich Buxtehude George Frideric Handel Georg Philipp Telemann Johann Pachelbel and Antonio Vivaldi 

The CretaceousTertiary extinction event about 655 million years ago is called the KT extinction event for short It is the famous event which killed the dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous period

It was a large scale mass extinction of animal and plant species The event marks the end of the Mesozoic era and the beginning of the Cainozoic era

Dinosaur fossils are only found below the KT boundary This shows they became extinct before or during the event Mosasaurs plesiosaurs pterosaurs and many species of plants and invertebrates also became extinct 

Mammalian and bird groups got through the event with some extinctions Those that survived became widespread and varied during their later evolutionary radiation

Scientists think the KT extinctions were caused by one or more catastrophic events such as massive asteroid or meteorite impacts and increased volcanic activity 

Several impact craters and massive volcanic activity such as that in the Deccan Traps in India have been dated to the approximate time of the extinction event These geological events would have reduced sunlight and hindered photosynthesis leading to a massive disruption in Earths ecology

Evidence is accumulating that there were multiple impacts across the CretaceousTertiary boundary such as the Chicxulub crater in Mexico Boltysh crater in Ukraine Silverpit crater in North Sea and the Shiva crater offshore western India The Shiva crater is a sea floor structure located beneath the Indian Ocean west of Mumbai India It was named by the paleontologist Sankar Chatterjee after Shiva the Hindu god of destruction and renewal

John Rutter is an English composer and choral conductor He has composed a lot of church music Many of his anthems and songs are very popular indeed with church choirs as well as choral societies He writes in a style that can be enjoyed easily and at the same time it is excellent music

Rutter was born in London He went to school at Highgate School Another pupil in the school was John Tavener who was also to become a famous composer although his style of music is very different

Rutter studied music at Clare College Cambridge He became director of music at Clare College in 1975 and made the choir internationally famous

In 1974 Rutter visited the United States where he conducted his new cantata Gloria which became a great favourite He also conducted his Eight Childhood Lyrics

In 1981 Rutter started a choir of his own the Cambridge Singers He still conducts them They have made many recordings Rutter still lives near Cambridge and spends his time composing and conducting all over the world

Rutter has been given many honours including honorary Fellow of Westminster Choir College Princeton Fellow of the Guild of Church Musicians In 1996 the Archbishop of Canterbury gave him the Lambeth Doctorate of Music to celebrate all he has done for church music He was made a CBE in 2007

Rutter also works as an arranger and editor His collection of Carols for Choirs which he prepared together with Sir David Willcocks is extremely widely used in Britain

Rutters compositions include Christmas carols anthems and longer choral works such as a Gloria a Magnificat and a Requiem

In 2002 his setting of Psalm 150 written for the Queens Golden Jubilee was performed at the thanksgiving service in St Pauls Cathedral London He has also written an opera for young people called Bang His Mass for Children was first performed in 2003 in the Carnegie Hall New York

Most of his songs and anthems were written at first with piano or organ accompaniment but he has also arranged many of them for orchestral accompaniment as well

The PermianTriassic extinction event was the largest extinction in the Phanerozoic eon 96 of all marine species and 70 of terrestrial vertebrates became extinct It ended the Palaeozoic era and began the Mesozoic era

The event forms the boundary between the Permian and Triassic periods at about 2514 million years ago Because so much biodiversity was lost the recovery of life on earth took much longer than after other extinction events This event has been described as the mother of all mass extinctions The pattern of extinction is still unclear as different studies suggest one to three different pulses 

There are several proposed mechanisms for the extinctions These include large or multiple meteorite impacts increased volcanism sudden release of methane hydrates from the sea floor Gradual changes include sea level change oceanic anoxic events increasing aridity and a shift in ocean circulation driven by climate change

One thing is probably significant One of the largest ever flood basalt eruptions took place across the PTr junction These eruptions from 251 to 250 million years ago produced the Siberian Traps a huge volcanic province in Siberia This would certainly have made the worlds climate much worse and is now thought to be the main cause of this great extinction

Camille Pissarro was a painter He was among the most well known and prolific painters of Impressionism He was born on Saint Tomas in the Virgin Islands At the time these islands belonged to Denmark today they belong to the United States Pissarro died in Paris

The Franco Prussian War of 187071 compelled Pissarro to flee his home in September 1870 he returned in June 1871 to find that the house and along with it many of his early paintings had been destroyed by Prussian soldiers By December 1870 he and his family had taken refuge in London and settled in Crystal Palace southwest London 

Through the paintings Pissarro completed at this time he records Sydenham and Norwood at a time when they were just recently connected by railways One of the largest of these paintings is a view of St Bartholomews Church at Lawrie Park Avenue commonly known as The Avenue Sydenham in the collection of the National Gallery London

Whilst in Upper Norwood Pissarro was introduced to the art dealer Paul Durand Ruel who bought two of his London paintings Durand Ruel subsequently became the most important art dealer of the new school of French Impressionism

Returning to France in 1890 Pissarro again visited England and painted some ten scenes of central London He came back again in 1892 painting in Kew Gardens and Kew Green and also in 1897 when he produced several oils of Bedford Park Chiswick 

Snowball Earth or Icehouse Earth refers to times when the Earths surface was nearly or entirely frozen The occurrence of Snowball Earths is still controversial but it is now probable that extensive glaciation occurred in periods of the Proterozoic What is still debatable is how extensive those glaciations were Proponents claim the theory explains sedimentary deposits of glacial origin at tropical latitudes and other enigmatic features of the geological record Opponents do not draw the same inferences from the geological evidence and doubt the geophysical feasibility of an ice or slush covered ocean

There were three or four significant ice ages during the late Neoproterozoic Of these the Marinoan was the most significant and the Sturtian glaciations were also truly widespread These were both in the Cryogenian period before the Ediacaran Even the leading Snowball proponent Hoffman agrees that the million year long Gaskiers glaciation did not lead to global glaciation although it was probably as intense as the late Ordovician glaciation The status of the Kaigas glaciation or cooling event is unclear Some do not recognise it as glacial and others believe it may indeed be a third ice age It was certainly less significant than the Sturtian or Marinoan glaciations and probably not global in extent Evidence does suggest that the Earth underwent a number of glaciations during the Neoproterozoic

The Snowball Earth hypothesis has been invoked to explain glacial deposits in the Huronian supergroup of Canada The palaeomagnetic evidence which suggests ice sheets at low latitudes is contested The glacial sediments of the Makganyene formation of South Africa are slightly younger than the Huronian glacial deposits and were deposited at tropical latitudes Perhaps the rise of free oxygen that occurred during this part of the Paleoproterozoic removed methane in the atmosphere through oxidation As the Sun was notably weaker at the time the Earths climate may have relied on methane a powerful greenhouse gas to maintain surface temperatures above freezing In the absence of this methane greenhouse temperatures plunged and a snowball event could have occurred

Niccol Piccinni was an Italian composer He wrote over 80 operas During his life he worked with the greatest librettists of his age including Metastasio 

Piccinnis music is hardly ever played today but in his day many of his operas were extremely popular He is mainly remembered today because he was invited to Paris where people wanted him to be a rival of Gluck There were lots of arguments between the people who supported Piccinni and those who supported Gluck

Piccinni was born in Bari His father who was a musician did not want his son to study music but the bishop persuaded him to change his mind Niccol went to the music conservatoire in Naples He started to write comic operas His opera La Cecchina ossia la buona Figliuola with a libretto by Goldoni played for two years in Rome and was produced in all the important European capital cities It was probably the most popular opera buffa of the 18th century

Piccinni wrote music with a sentimental feeling that was very popular in the mid 18th century It was typical of a lot of music in the early Classical music period

A few years later Piccinni was invited by Queen Marie Antoinette to go and live in Paris He had married in 1756 his pupil Vincenza Sibilla She was a singer but he never allowed his wife to sing on stage again after they married

The people who had invited Piccinni to Paris were people who did not like Glucks music They wanted Piccinni to be a rival to Gluck They enjoyed arguments and they wanted to try to make the two composers enemies There were a lot of arguments between the people who supported Piccinni and those who supported Gluck The whole affair is often called the war between the Piccinnists and the Gluckists It was very stupid because the arguments had nothing to do with music Both composers were asked to compose an opera about the same story Roland Gluck never finished the opera because he wanted to finish his career by writing Alceste He did not want to be compared to Piccinni Then both composers were asked to write operas about the story Iphignie en Tauride Glucks opera was first produced on 18 May 1779 Piccinnis Iphignie followed on 23 January 1781 The rival parties went on arguing even after Gluck left Paris in 1780 Then some people tried to get a new rival for Piccinni they invited Sacchini to Paris But Piccinni continued to be popular When Gluck died in 1787 Piccinni suggested that a public monument should be built to his memory Glucks supporters refused to support the idea

In 1784 Piccinni became professor at the Royal School of Music a school which later became part of the Conservatoire When the French Revolution broke out in 1789 Piccinni returned to Naples At first he was warmly welcomed by King Ferdinand IV but when his daughter married a French democrat the Neapolitans were angry They said he was a revolutionist He was not allowed to leave his house for four years

For the next nine years he tried to make a living in Venice Naples and Rome but he returned in 1798 to Paris where the public gave him a warm welcome but he made no money He died at Passy near Paris

He produced over eighty operas but although his later work shows the influence of the French and German stage his music is typical of Italian musicians of the 18th century

Silent Night is a very popular Chrismas carol and song It was first performed in 1818 by Franz Xaver Gruber and Joseph Mohr Gruber was an organist and headmaster of a primary school Mohr was a priest Mohr had written the poem in 1816 Gruber made the melody for it before Christmas 1818 Little else is known on how the song came to be 

One of the theses is that at the time it was not possible to play the organ in the church For this reason Gruber and Mohr created a song that could be accompanied by a guitar There are many other stories about how the song came to be

The audience liked the performance very much Gruber sang and Mohr played the guitar It is because of an organ maker called Mauracher that the song became known to a wider audience Mauracher could capture the attention of the crowd at a performance in Leipzig in 1832 From there it spread first to the German speaking countries then to the world Today there are translations into more than 300 languages and dialects 

The song was first published on a leaflet in 1833 with other authentic Tyrolean songs Frederick William IV of Prussia wanted to know the authors of the song and asked St Peters Archabbey Salzburg in 1854 The abbey found Gruber who was still alive In the meantime the song had been attributed to Michael Haydn 

The author Hertha Pauli who was born in Austria had to flee from the persecutions during the Second World War In 1943 she found that many Americans thought that Silent Night was an American popular tune She then wrote the chilrens book Silent Night The Story of a Song where she explained where the song was from

Paul Abraham Dukas was a French composer and teacher of classical music

Paul Dukas was born in Paris to a Jewish father and Catholic mother He was taught music by Thodore Dubois and Ernest Guiraud at the Conservatoire de Paris where he became friends with the composer Claude Debussy He then worked as a music critic and orchestrator

Although Dukas wrote a lot of music he destroyed many of his pieces because he was unhappy with them Only a few are left His first important surviving work is the Symphony in C This is in the style of Beethoven and Csar Franck Like Francks only symphony Dukas is in three movements not the usual four Allegro non troppo ma con fuoco Andante espressive e fuoco Allegro spiritoso 

In 1897 Dukas wrote another work for orchestra Lapprenti sorcier based on Goethes poem Der Zauberlehrling A short version of the The Sorcerers Apprentice was used in the Walt Disney film Fantasia Dukass use of rhythm and his skill in writing for orchestras can be seen in both the Symphony in C and the The Sorcerers Apprentice

For the piano Dukas wrote two complex and difficult works a Sonata in E flat minor and Variations interlude and finale on a theme of Rameau again in the style of Beethoven and Franck The Sonata has not been performed very often but lately pianists such as Marc Andr Hamelin have started to add it to their concerts There are also two smaller works for piano solo

The opera Ariane et Barbe Bleue which he wrote between 1899 and 1907 has often been compared to Debussys Pellas et Mlisande This is because it is similar in its musical style and both operas are based on words by Maurice Maeterlinck Dukass last big work was the grand oriental ballet La Pri This is about a man who goes to the Ends of the Earth to find immortality and finds a mythical Peri holding The Flower of Immortality

Because the opening of the opera is very quiet Dukas later added a short Fanfare pour preceder La Peri which gave the usually noisy audiences time to settle in their seats before the main opera began 

In later life Dukas became well known as a music teacher with many famous students including Joaqun Rodrigo Manuel Ponce Maurice Durufl Xian Xinghai Olivier Messiaen Jehan Alain Carlos Chvez and David Van Vactor After Dukas died he was buried in the Pre Lachaise cemetery in Paris

List of extinction events Major extinction events are important to both geology and evolution this is a list of the largest 

There are five major extinction events in the Phanerozoic eon and many smaller events In order of time latest first

1 KT extinction event The CretaceousTertiary extinction event ended the Mesozoic era and started the Cainozoic era

2 EndTriassic extinction event

3 PTr extinction event The PermianTriassic extinction event ended the Palaeozoic era and started the Mesozoic era

4 Late Devonian extinctions at the FrasnianFamennian junction

5 EndOrdovician extinction event After a series of lesser events the end Ordovician extinction resulted in an estimated 84 species loss

Other extinction events in the Phanerozoic also had significant impact on the evolution of the biota

VendianCambrian extinction event Extinctions have been claimed for three groups the acritarchs trace fossils and the famous Ediacaran fossils

Blaise Compaor is the President of Burkina Faso He has been the president since 1987 He started a political party called the Congress for Democracy and Progress This is the ruling party of Burkina Faso Compaor became president in 1987 after a military coup and the assassination of Thomas Sankara who was president then

The Vendian is the last period in the Proterozoic just before the Cambrian It contains the famous Ediacaran softbody fossils It is a term often used but is has now been replaced by the Ediacaran period by the International Union of Geological Sciences

Cassiopeia is a constellation in the northern sky It was named after a queen in Greek mythology called Cassiopeia It looks like a letter W or M with five bright stars It has two very bright stars called Cas and V509 Cas

In 1572 a supernova called Tychos Star or SN 1572 was seen in Cassiopeia by many people

Ediacara can refer to several things

A Jathera is a shrine constructed to commemorate common clan ancestors Each village in the Punjab has a Jathera which can be visited by members of different surnames Many villages have a Jathera for each clansurname

When members of a clan form a new village they continue to visit the Jathera in the ancestral village If this is not possible a link is brought from the old Jathera to construct a new Jathera in the new village

People visit the Jathera when getting married on the 15th day of the Indian month and sometimes on the first Sunday of an Indian month

The Ediacaran period was named after the Ediacara Hills of South Australia It is the last geological period of the Proterozoic Eon The Edicaran is followed by the Cambrian the first period of the Paleozoic Era and the Phanerozoic Eon 

The period is famous for the first larger bodied fossils which are probably the first recorded metazoans These were trace fossils first found in Englands Charnwood Forest Leicestershire They did not know what it was that they had found and it was over 60 years later before fossils from the same period were found in South Australia

The status of the Ediacaran as an official geological period was confirmed in 2004 by the International Union of Geological Sciences This made it the first new geological period declared in 120 years 

The Ediacaran period was previously called the Vendian period The Vendian period was proposed in 1952 by Russian geologistpaleontologist Boris Sokolov The term Vendian is still widely used

The Ediacaran Period represents the time from the end of global Marinoan glaciation to the first appearance worldwide of certain trace fossils at the base of the Cambrian Although the Ediacaran period does contain soft bodied fossils its start is defined at the base of a carbonate layer referred to as a cap carbonate This caps glacial deposits and shows a sudden climatic change at the end of the Marinoan ice age

The Ediacaran lasts for about 90 million years of which only the last 50 million years show the soft bodied fossils The period starts with the end of the 200 million year long Cryogenian period Between that and the fossils comes another severe but short glacial period known as the Gaskiers glaciation

The period ends with the mass extinction of virtually all the Ediacaran fauna Cambrian fauna are quite different The causes of this extinction are poorly understood

The Ediacaran biota are the somewhat puzzling fauna of the Ediacaran period This geological period was from 635542 million years ago but the fossil biota was only from 575542 mya This was after a series of ice ages and just before the Cambrian period The biota consists of soft bodied multicellular organisms probably animals which left trace fossils in rocks of Ediacaran age 

The biota is quite unusal and there is no sign of it in the preceeding Marinoan glaciation The biota appears to suffer a fairly severe extinction event at the boundary with the Cambrian Some of the biota may have survived into the early Cambrian

There have been several different interpretations of the biota The standard view is that the traces are fossils of well known phyla with body plans that disappeared before the Cambrianp27

Quite different ideas have been put forward Seilacher thought few if any of the forms belonged to living phyla Conway Morris opposed this idea Rentallak suggested the biota might be lichens

As Narbonne explains the Ediacaran biota occupies a critical position in the fossil record Before them for a long period of the Archaean and most of the Protoerozoic the only fossils were those of bacteria and bacterial mats a form of life which has continues to the present day The Ediacaran biota is found worldwide and the most typical forms did disappear just before the Cambrian radiation which begins with the shelly fossils That is probably enough to justify the description of the change as an extinction event though what caused it is not clear One suggestion is that the evolution of animals which grazed upon the soft bodied forms would have been sufficient to cause a collapse of the biota The biota was extremely varied and composed of many different body forms and hence species The ecology was benthic in both shallow and deeper water Narbonne notes the absence of depth related zonation the apparent absence of burrowing organisms and the absence of animals capable of preying on the soft bodied forms If these conditions changed the soft forms would be in perilp6

Ediacaran type fossils are recognised globally in 25 localities and a variety of depositional conditions and are commonly grouped into three main types named after typical localities Each assemblage occupies its own habitat and after a burst of diversification changes little for the rest of its existence

In the White Sea region of Russia all three assemblage types have been found in close proximity This and the faunas overlap in time makes it unlikely that they represent evolutionary stages Since they are found on all continents except Antarctica geographical boundaries do not appear to be a factor The same fossils are found at all palolatitudes

Probably the three assemblages mark organisms adapted to survival in different environments An analysis of one of the White Sea fossil beds where the layers cycle from continental seabed to inter tidal to estuarine and back again a few times found that a specific set of Ediacaran organisms was associated with each environment

It is no surprise that not all environments are exploited Of 92 possible modes of life combinations of feeding style tiering and motility no more than a dozen are occupied by the end of the Ediacaran Just four are represented in the Avalon assemblage The lack of large scale predation and vertical burrowing are perhaps the most significant factors limiting the ecological diversity the emergence of these during the early Cambrian allowed the number of lifestyles occupied to rise to 30

Antonio de Trueba was a Spanish poet novelist and folklorist born at Montellana Biscay in 1821 where he was privately educated 

An arrangement of a musical composition is a reworking of a piece of music so that it can be played by a different instrument or combination of instruments from the original For example a song written for one voice with piano accompaniment might be arranged so that it can be sung in parts by a choir or a piece for violin might be arranged so that it can be played on a clarinet instead The person who does the arrangement may be the composer himself or it may be someone else

In music history composers often published their compositions saying that the music could be played or sung by various instruments For example when English composers published madrigals in the late 16th century they often stated that they could be sung by singers or played on viols In the Classical music period a composer might publish a sonata stating that it could be played on the violin or flute or recorder This helped to sell more copies because violinists flautists and recorder players might all want to buy the music In a sense this is not really an arrangement because no changes have been made to the music 

However when violin or cello music is arranged so that it can be played on a viola some changes may be necessary as the viola may be playing in a different key or some chords may be more awkward the way they were originally written This in an arrangement

A popular piece such as The Flight of the Bumble Bee by Rimsky Korsakov can be played by almost any melodic instrument violin xylophone tuba etc These are all arrangements

When a piece for choir and orchestra is printed for choir members to use the orchestral part is printed on two staves so that it can be played on a piano for rehearsals This is another kind of arrangement

In music history many composers have made arrangements of music composed by others They did this in order to learn about musical composition as well as in order to be able to play it on another instrument For example Johann Sebastian Bach made arrangements of four concertos by Vivaldi so that they could be played on the organ

Arrangements are often made by people who play instruments that have not had much music written for them People who play the viola guitar tuba etc often arrange other music so that they have a larger repertoire

Sometimes composers have made changes to the orchestration of works for orchestra written by others They may have done this because instruments had changed since the music was written or simply because they thought they could do it better For example Mozart made an arrangement of Handels Messiah adding instruments such as clarinets which Handel would not have known Rimsky Korsakov made arrangements of the operas by Musorgsky thinking that he was improving them

Arrangements are sometimes made because a player has some disability Cyril Smith a pianist who only had one arm played piano duets with his wife Phyllis Sellick They arranged piano duets so that they could be played by three hands

Sometimes arrangements are made of well known classical pieces in which the music is jazzed up or made to sound more popular for film or theatre performances Sometimes musicians think this is not a good thing Sometimes small vocal groups such as the Swingle Singers make lighthearted versions of works by Bach and others 

Musicians will never all agree about which is better an arrangement or the original version Each piece of music should really be judged on its own

A Homing pigeon is a special breed of pigeons These pigeons have been domesticated They have been selectively bred to find their way home They can do this over very long distances The wild rock pigeon from which these birds are bred also has this homing ability This means that it will generally return to its own nest and its own mate This made it relatively easy to breed from the birds that repeatedly found their way home over long distances Flights as long as 1800 kilometers have been recorded by birds in competition pigeon racing Their average flying speed over moderate distances is around 48 kmhCitation neededdateJune 2009 but even speeds of up to 95 kmh have been observed

Homing pigeons are called carrier pigeons when they are used to carry messages This is possible where a message is written on thin light paper and rolled into a small tube attached to the birds leg this is called pigeon post Pigeons can only go back to one mentally marked point that they have identified as their home So pigeon mail can only work when the sender is actually holding the receivers pigeons White homing pigeons are used in Release Dove ceremonies at weddings funerals and some sporting events

A musical transcription is an arrangement of a piece of music for a different instrument or instruments This use of the word transcription is almost the same as arrangement Musicians often disagree about what should be called a transcription and what is an arrangement Usually transcriptions are almost like the original whereas a musician who makes an arrangement may put some ideas of his own into the music

Another meaning of transcription is writing down music which existed before but had not yet been written down This could be because it is jazz or because it is folk music which traditionally is taught from one generation to another by listening and imitating In the early 20th century some composers became interested in writing down the traditional folksongs of their countries Bla Bartk and Zoltan Kodaly in Hungary and Cecil Sharpe and Ralph Vaughan Williams in England transcribed folk songs they heard being sung in the villages of their countries

Some composers have made tributes to other composers by arranging some of their compositions for orchestra Ravels transcribed Mussorgskys piano piece Pictures at an Exhibition for orchestra Webern made a transcription for orchestra of a ricercar from Bachs Musical Offering In both cases something of the transcribers own style can be heard in the new version

Sometimes transcriptions are made for practical reasons Mozart made transcriptions of some music from his own operas arranging them for small groups of instruments so that they could play it for popular entertainment Stravinsky transcribed some of his ballet music for piano eg The Rite of Spring for piano duet and some dances from Petrouchka for piano solo

The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences or Kungliga Vetenskapsakademin is one of the Royal Academies of Sweden The Academy is an independent scientific non governmental organization set up to support the sciences mainly the natural sciences and mathematics

The Academy was started on 2 June 1739 by naturalist Carl Linnaeus economist Jonas Alstrmer mechanical engineer Mrten Triewald civil servants Sten Carl Bielke and Carl Wilhelm Cederhielm and politician Anders Johan von Hpken

The academy was set up to find useful knowledge and to write about it in Swedish The academy was meant to be different from the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala which had been started in 1719 and published in Latin It was built near the main business centre in Stockholm The Swedish scientists wanted it to be like the Royal Society in London and Academie Royale des Sciences in Paris France

Groups of the Academy meet to give out international prizes

and national prizes

Karolinska Institutet and before 1968 the Royal Caroline Institute is one of Europes biggest medical universities 

It was started in 1810 on Kungsholmen island on the west side of Stockholm It later moved to Solna just outside Stockholm and a second campus has been built in FlemingsbergHuddinge south of Stockholm

A committee of the institute decides on the winners of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 

The Karolinska University Hospital in Solna and Huddinge is the universitys research and teaching hospital It is one of Swedens largest centres for training and research with 30 percent of the medical training and 40 percent of the medical academic research While most of the medical programs are taught in Swedish most of the PhD programs are taught in English

The institute is a member of the League of European Research Universities In the 2009 Academic Ranking of World Universities the institute is the best university for medicine and pharmacy in Europe 8th in the world It is listed as the best university in Sweden

Karolinska Institutet was started between 1810 and 1811 to teach army surgeons It was called the Medico Chirurgiska Institutet 

In 1817 the name Karolinska was added as a reference to Karoliner which was the name of soldiers under the Swedish king Karl XII The full name became Kongl Carolinska Medico Chirurgiska Institutet 

In 1968 this name was changed to Karolinska Institutet

The Swedish Academy started in 1786 by King Gustav III is one of the Royal Academies of Sweden It was copied from the Acadmie franaise it has 18 members The motto of the Academy is Talent and Taste The main thing the Academy does is to help the purity strength and greatness of the Swedish language To help do this the Academy publishes two dictionaries

The first is a dictionary in a single book called Svenska Akademiens ordlista In 2005 it was up to its 13th edition The second dictionary called Svenska Akademiens ordbok is so big it needs many books like the Oxford English Dictionary The first book in the set was printed in 1898 and in 2005 work had got as far as words beginning with the letter T

Since 1901 the Academy has decided who will win the Nobel Prize in Literature given in memory of Alfred Nobel

The Academy uses a building now known as the Stockholm Stock Exchange Building The bottom floor was used as a trading exchange and the upper floor was used for dances New Years Eve parties etc In 1786 the ballroom was the biggest room in Stockholm that could be heated and be used in the winter The king asked if he could use it The Academy has has met there every year since In 1914 the Academy gained the right to use the upper floor as their own forever This is where they meet and amongst other business choose the Nobel Prize winners Because of this the Academy is one of the most important literary groups in the world

The current members of the Swedish Academy listed by seat number 

The Norwegian Nobel Committee is the group which gives the Nobel Peace Prize every year It has five members who are elected by the Norwegian Parliament and has the same political makeup as the parliament 

Alfred Nobel died in December 1896 and in his will he left a lot of money to start a number of prizes to given each year to be called the Nobel Prize The money would be looked after by the Nobel Foundation and the prizes would be given out by a number of different groups The other Nobel Prizes would be given by existing Swedish groups the Swedish Academy the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and the Karolinska Institutet The job of giving the Nobel Peace Prize was given to the Norwegian Parliament A group of five people to be called the Norwegian Nobel Committee would decide who should win the prize The Peace Prize would be given to the person who had done the most work to get countries to work together to make the worlds armies smaller or to hold peace talks when needed Legal expert Fredrik Heffermehl has said that a parliament could not be expected to handle a legal jobs like looking after a will Parliaments make and change laws but a will can not be changed unless it has clearly become out of date At the time this problem was not talked about very much as the Norwegian Parliament felt that they needed to act quickly in case the money was lost in a legal battles They agreed to give the Peace Prize on 26 April 1897 and on August 5 1897 they worked out the rules for who could be elected to the Norwegian Nobel Committee 

The first Peace Prize was given in 1901 to Henri Dunant and Frdric Passy At first the committee was filled with active members of the parliament and every year its reports were talked about in parliamentary sessions These links to the Norwegian Parliament were later weakened so that the committee became more independent The name was changed from the Norwegian Nobel Committee to the Nobel Committee of the Norwegian Parliament in 1901 but changed back in 1977 Now members of parliament cannot be on the committee unless they have said that they will be leaving the parliament soon The committee is currently made up of five people who have all left the parliament

But the committee is still mainly made up of politicians A 1903 idea to elect a law expert was rejected In 1948 the election system was changed to make the committee have the same political makeup as the parliament The Norwegian Labour Party which had a majority of seats in the Norwegian Parliament made this change Many people do not like this change but it is still the way the committee is elected There have been suggestions about having non Norwegian members in the committee but this has never happened

The Norwegian Nobel Committee is helped by the Norwegian Nobel Institute started in 1904 The committee might get more than a hundred different names for people to be given the prize It asks the Nobel Institute in February every year to study about twenty possible winners The director of the Nobel Institute is also the secretary to the Norwegian Nobel Committee Currently this position is held by to Geir Lundestad Thorbjrn Jagland has been the Norwegian Nobel Committees leader since 2009

The Oligocene is the last geological epoch in the Palaeogene It lasted for about 11 million years from 34 mya to 23 mya It was preceded by the Eocene and followed by the Miocene During the Oligocene the world continued to get cooler from its peak in the mid Eocene The world was still largely forested but grasslands began to spread Ice formed in Antarctica The period is seen as one of transition both in climate and in the biota

Sidney Poitier is a Bahamian American actor movie director author and diplomat He became a star in American movies and plays which went against racial stereotypes and made black actors more respected in mainstream roles

Poitier was born in Miami Florida USA and grew up with his family on remote Cat Island in the Bahamas His mother was called Evelyn and his father was called Reginald James Poitier They had a farm Poitiers birth was premature and people did not expect him to survive but his parents stayed three months in Miami until he became well Because he was born in Miami Poitier automatically gained US citizenship

When he was 15 Poitiers parents sent him off Miami to live with his older brother At 17 he moved to New York City and got several menial jobs During this time he was arrested for vagrancy after having to leave his home for not paying rent He decided to join the United States Army He worked as a dishwasher until he got a job with the American Negro Theater

Poitier was tone deaf and could not sing or dance This is what black actors did at the time so audiences did not like him He worked very hard to improve his acting skills and to get rid of his Bahamian accent He eventually got a leading role in the Broadway play called Lysistrata and he got excellent reviews At the end of 1949 he got a job working for Darryl F Zanuck in the film No Way Out He played a doctor treating a white bigot After this job he soon got more film roles The acting jobs he got were better and more interesting than the roles most black actors played at the time

In 1955 he played a member of an badly behaved high school class in Blackboard Jungle This was an important role in Poitiers career 

Poitier was the first black actor to win the Academy Award for Best Actor

He acted in the first production of A Raisin in the Sun on Broadway in 1959 and later starred in the film version released in 1961 He was also in The Bedford Incident and A Patch of Blue co starring Elizabeth Hartman and Shelley Winters In 1967 he was the most successful actor at the box office with three successful films Guess Whos Coming to Dinner To Sir with Love and In the Heat of the Night The last film featured his most successful character Virgil Tibbs a Philadelphia Pennsylvania detective 

However Poitier began to be criticized for typecasting himself playing black characters who had only good personalities like his character in Guess Whos Coming To Dinner Poitier agreed with this but although he wanted more different roles but also wanted to set a good example with his characters and go against the negative stereotypes that had come before He was the only major black actor in the American film industry at the time

Poitier has directed several films the most successful being the Richard Pryor Gene Wilder comedy Stir Crazy The first film he directed was the western Buck and the Preacher He was also the star with Harry Belafonte Other films he has directed are Uptown Saturday Night Lets Do It Again A Piece of the Action and Ghost Dad

Poitier was first married to Juanita Hardy from April 29 1950 until 1965 He has been married to Joanna Shimkus a Canadian born actress since January 23 1976 He has four daughters by his first marriage and two by his second

He has written three autobiographical books This Life The Measure of a Man A Spiritual Autobiography and Life Beyond Measure  letters to my Great Granddaughter

In April 1997 Poitier was became ambassador of the Bahamas to Japan He is also the ambassador of the Bahamas to UNESCO From 1998 to 2003 he was a Member of the Board of Directors of The Walt Disney Company

In 2001 Poitier received an Academy Honorary Award for his overall contribution to American cinema In August 2009 he received the Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama

The Pliocene is a short epoch at the end of the Neogene It lasted from 53 million to 26 million years ago The Pliocene follows the Miocene epoch and is followed by the Pleistocene epoch

The world continued to get cooler and drier in the Pliocene Tropical rain forests shrank and deciduous forests shrank Grasslands grew and many herbivorous mammals became grazers instead of browsers Hominid evolution took a new turn as some apes started to live on the savannah instead of the forests

A grazer is an animal usually a herbivorous mammal which eats grass rather than trees and shrubs It is contrasted with browsers which eat trees shrubs The life style dentition and digestive system of grazers has to be different from browsers to handle the problems of eating and digesting grass This is well illustrated in the evolution of such groups as horses

Fauna means animal life It is a group term it means the animal life typical of the time or place 

So one might speak of the Eocene fauna as being different from the Miocene fauna Or say the fauna of a particular habitat It is a similar term to flora in Botany The flora and fauna of a savannah is different from that of a rain forest

Foraminifera or forams as they are called are an important group of tiny single celled eukaryotes They are mostly marine though a few live in fresh water and even on damp land areas In the sea they live both in the plankton and in the deeper water They have tests made of calcium carbonate

The organism has pseudopodia like an amoeba It uses these to capture and eat bacteria and small diatoms Also many of them keep algal endosymbionts Some are idioplastic which means they eat the algae but keep the algal chloroplasts for their own benefit

Forams are often used to date strata in palaeontology The detailed record of forams from deep sea drilling projects are the basis of a fossil index for geological periods or stages This is called biostratigraphy

Deep sea forams from the Mariana Trench are below the carbonate compensation depth below which all CaCO3 dissolves They have evolved organic tests instead of calcium carbonate ones This suggests that the tests are a vital part of their life style perhaps protecting them from other micro predators

Take Me Away was released to radio only in Australia in 2005

Strata are layers of rock or sometimes soil In nature strata come in many layers It is a term in sedimentary and historical geology the singular is stratum  

These layers are laid down as sediment often in the sea and are slowly changed by pressure heat and chemical action into rocks 

The strata are often typical of a particular time and place and allow geologists to relate rocks in different places For instance chalk was laid down in the Upper Cretaceous period and consists mainly of the remains of microscopic algae called coccoliths

In normal strata the later strata are laid down on earlier strata in horizontal layers In the long passage of time sedimentary rocks may get deformed by huge forces in the Earth volcanism orogeny or other causes Then it requires research to work out what has happened to the strata

When strata rise above sea level they get worn down by erosion such as weather This causes gaps in the sequence of strata which may have risen and sunk many times in Earth history These gaps are called unconformities in geological jargon

In many formations of strata there are repeating patterns For example clay layers alternate with sandstone layers or carbonate layers alternate with shales This is usually caused by repeating cycles of climate In warmer times the sea rises and carbonate rocks are deposited in shallow subtropical seas Later ice builds up at the poles and the sea level drops Then the same area is close to shore and gets sand and mud washed down by rivers 

Rocks showing repeat patterns of strata are called rhythmites Sometimes the patterns are caused by annual climate changes Geologists call those varves

The story takes place in 2154 on Pandora The movie opens with Jake getting into a fight in bar on Earth before he goes to Pandora Pandora is a fictional Earth like moon in a distant planetary system Some humans have traveled from Earth to Pandora because it is a source of a very valuable mineral called unobtanium The largest deposit of the mineral is under a large tree that the local Navi people have named Hometree The tree is very important to the Navi Parker Selfridge is the military leader of the mining operation He uses marines for security The marines need to move the Navi people before they can start mining the unobtanium They have tried to do this many times They have offered the Navi clothing education and such but none has been working Their next plan is to just blow the place up

Pandora is inhabited by the Navi They are a blue skinned species of humanoids with feline characteristics Physically the Navi are much stronger and taller than humans They live in harmony with Nature and worship a mother goddess called Eywa The human scientists on Pandora want to learn about the Navis culture To do this they have created avatars Avatars are Navi bodies modified with human DNA They are controlled mentally by human operators These avatars are used to interact with the Navi people to try to create peace Jake Sully is a paraplegic marine His brother was a scientist trained to be an avatar operator After his brother dies Jake replaces him to control his avatar Jake receives the mission to form relations with the Navi His goal is to get the Navi to move To do this he was to become friends with the Navi so he could learn what it would take to get them to move Many people like Grace an avatar specialist did not think his experience was good enough On a mission in avatar form he gets lost in the jungle

Jakes avatar is saved by Neytiri a female Navi Neytiri takes Jake to Hometree where her clan the Omaticaya live As a shaman Neytiris mother shows interest in Jake She asks her daughter to teach Jake about their culture Together Jake and Neytiri have many adventures in Pandora Neytiri shows Jake the spirit that every living thing has Jake is respected when he first comes to the Navi They call him a sky dreamer Once he learns their culture he impresses all of them and earns their respect He becomes a member of the Omaticaya clan and is seen as one of them At first Neytiri does not like him Their friendship forms as he becomes more skilled and her equal They mate under the tree of Eywa At first Neytiris father is quite mad about it Over time he accepts it

Time passes and Jake has not gotten the Navi people to move Park Selfridge sees this He tells Jake that it has taken too long and that they are going to bomb Hometree Jake tries to warn the Navi people The Navi people feel that he has betrayed them because he knew this was going to happen The Navi try to fight back but their bows and arrows are useless against the Marines The Hometree is bombed and thousands of Navi people died Neytiris father is one of the dead Jake and Grace have failed They are jailed by the mining company because they fought with the Navi

With the help of a woman marine pilot they escape in a helicopter They go to a nearby base to change into avatar mode They then go to Hometree to see the Navi Jake tells the Navi people that they still must fight He joins with one of the Navi warriors to train them Soon more Navi come to defend their land The marines choose to just destroy the Navi rather than try and move them Many people do not think this was right They think it is inhumane These people are not listened to and the Marines went to attack the Navi There is a very large battle between the Marines and Navi When it looks as if the marines are going to win many of the animals of Pandora join the battle They fight with the Navi against the marines Near the end of the battle Jake in his avatar fights Parker Selfridge When he is almost dead Neytiri saves him The Navi eventually win but many die After the battle the Marines are sent home to planet Earth Jake Sully is changed into his avatar permanently and becomes the leader of the Navi with Neytiri

If Cameron was inspired by every science fiction book he read when he was a kid the look of the Navi was inspired by a dream that Camerons mother had before he wrote Avatar She dreamt about a 12 foot tall blue woman and he thought that image was cool Camerons aim was to make us think about how we interact with nature and others Cameron said the Navi represent our higher selves or our aspirational selves and the humans represent the parts of ourselves that are trashing our world and maybe condemning ourselves to a grim future

Paramecium is one of the best known protists often taught in school biology courses Paramecium is a ciliate genus They are a clade of protists which move by the synchronous waves of tiny projections from their cuticle These projections are called cilia The species range from 50 to 350 m in length They live in freshwater ponds and eat bacteria and other protists such as single celled algae

Paramecium species usually have bacterial symbionts and some species have green algal symbionts

Reproduction in Paramecium has been researched for many years Paramecium has two nuclei They cannot survive without the macronucleus and cannot reproduce without the micro nucleus Reproduction is either accomplished by binary fission conjugation or rarely by endomixis a process of self fertilisation During binary fission a fully grown organism divides into two daughter cells Conjugation consists of the temporary union of two organisms and the exchange of micro nuclear elements Without the rejuvenating effects of conjugation a paramecium ages and dies Only opposite mating types or genetically compatible organisms can unite in conjugation

This reproductive system is unique to ciliates and is one of the reasons why we think the Protista is not a natural clade but just a convenient collection of single celled organisms of various origin

This species consists of 14 syngens each genetically isolated from every other and biochemically unique Each syngen has two mating types The syngens are so similar in appearance that they have not been given separate species names

The Canonic Variations on Vom Himmel hoch da komm ich her BWV 769 is a well known piece of music for organ by Johann Sebastian Bach An organ with two manuals and pedals is needed to play this work There are five variations All the music is based on a Christmas hymn called Von Himmel hoch which was very well known to the people who went to the Lutheran church where Bach was organist

Bach composed the piece when he became a member of Mizlers Music Society in Leipzig in 1747 It was printed in 1747 Another version was published later This was an autograph manuscript which also included other organ music the six trio sonatas and the Great Eighteen Chorale Preludes The most important difference Bach made in this version is that the fifth variation was moved to the middle

In June 1747 Bach was allowed to become a member of the Correspondierde Societt der Muscialischen Wissenschaften There were 14 members when Bach joined The society studied and encouraged people in Leipzig to compose music To celebrate becoming a member Bach gave to the society a version of the Canonic Variations and also a portrait of himself that had been painted by Elias Gottlob Haussmann In the portrait Bach is seen holding up a copy of another composition which uses a lot of canon

The five variations on Von Himmel Hoch are not variations in the usual musical sense They are not five statements of the theme with ornamentation They are five movements which all use canon to build up the music During the last years of his life Bach composed several works which were based on canons Several of his works from that period are canonic including organ pieces from Parts III and IV of the Clavier bung the Goldberg Variations for harpsichord the Musical Offering and the Art of the Fugue

The Canonic Variations are based on the Christmas Hymn Von Himmel hoch da komm ich her The words and melody were composed in 1539 by Martin Luther Bach had used the chorale before It comes in his Christmas Oratorio in his Magnificat and in several organ preludes including the short one from the Orgelbchlein which can be heard in Britain and other countries on radio and television each Christmas Eve at the end of the world famous carol service from Kings College Cambridge

There are five variations

This is a two part canon between the right and left hand It is a canon at the octave because the second part starts an octave lower than the first part The hands play on different manuals so that they can produce a different sort of sound like a duet between two instruments The chorale tune is heard in the pedals It is played in long notes with gaps of a bar and a half between each phrase The music of the canon played by the hands sounds in parts like the shape of the chorale It starts with six notes going down Bach may have done this deliberately to suggest Christ coming down to earth This sort of symbolism or word painting in which the actual notes of the music show the meaning of the words is very common in Bachs music and in a lot of other music of that time

Again there is a canon between the hands and the chorale tune in the pedals It is strict three part writing This time it is a canon at the fifth The canon is based on the first and second lines of the chorale When the start of the canon comes back near the end it is syncopated At the very end the hands play a scale going up Bach may have meant this to sound like angels going up to heaven or the soul going up

The canon this time is between the left hand and the pedals The canon moves mostly in quavers and is based on the chorale tune The right hand plays a free melody and also the chorale tune in long notes at the top

This variation has a new tune in the right hand It is very lively and is very syncopated The bottom of the left hand plays the same tune in canon but it only moves at half the speed of the upper part This is called augmentation The top of the left hand meanwhile has a freer part The pedal has the chorale tune in long notes Three bars before the end we hear the BACH motif in the left hand These are the four notes that Bach often uses to represent his name

The last variation becomes more and more grand and finishes in a big climax It works well when it is played as the last variation

At the beginning of this variation the canon is simply the melody of the chorale It is played by the right and left hand but this time the left hand plays it upside down It is a canon at the sixth Later it becomes a canon at the third  The pedal simply plays a bass part

In the next section the right hand moves in fast notes while the pedal plays the chorale tune and the bottom part of the left hand plays it in canon upside down at the second Then the right and left hands swap round and there is a canon at the ninth

In the last section marked forte the pedal part plays the chorale tune upside down At the very end as the music rises to a climax it repeats the last line of the chorale tune finishing on the lowest pedal note the bottom C The hands meanwhile play on the same manual There is a stretto all the voices start the tune quickly one after another At the very end we hear the BACH motif again

Bach is often said to be a mathematical composer This set of variations are a good example of a piece of music in which Bach is trying to show different techniques of composing A lot of skill is needed in order to compose complicated canons like this making the music sound good at the same time The description of the music may sound very complicated but one can enjoy the music without understanding all the techniques used to compose it However it is always fascinating to see how Bach has put all these ideas together 

In music voice refers to several melodic lines being sung or played at the same time These lines are called voices even if they are not being sung but being played on instruments Another word for the same thing is part but the word part can also mean a section of a piece so it can be confusing

The word part meaning voice is often used when describing polyphonic music For example a 3 part fugue would have three voices It might be sung by three people or it might be played by three instruments or just by one keyboard instrument playing all three parts

An elf is a mythical creature of various origins that is usually regarded as a good being that helps to make trees and nature good It is therefore commonly associated with paganism and witchcraft 

Elves are usually described as a taller human but with more firmer touch to them In the Lord of the Rings however elves were described as human sized hence changing the description of elves

In most modern fantasy scenarios elves are one of the 3 main races although if these 3 are described as the good races they then become one of 6 races including orcs goblins and trolls andor giants

John Blow was an English composer and organist He had a great deal of influence on English music His best pupil was Henry Purcell who was the greatest English composer of his time

Blow was born at Newark on Trent As a boy he sang in the choir the Chapel Royal He was still very young when he started composing anthems One of these anthems known as the Club Anthem was written by Blow together with three other choirboys Pelham Humfrey Michael Wise and William Turner all of whom were to become well known composers when they grew up The diarist Samuel Pepys heard him sing once but Blows voice was breaking by then and Pepys wrote in his diary that he made an unpleasant sound 

In 1668 he became organist of Westminster Abbey In 1674 he was made a gentleman of the Chapel Royal When Pelham Humfrey died Blow took over two of his jobs He was in charge of a small choir at the kings court He also became Master of the Children of the Chapel Royal He stayed in that job for the rest of his life Many of the boy choristers he taught later became great composers They include William Croft Jeremiah Clark and Daniel Purcell Henry Purcells voice had already broken by this time and he became an apprentice to Blow

In September 1673 he married Elizabeth Braddock but ten years later she died when giving birth to a child

In 1676 Blow became one of three organists at Westminster Abbey In 1677 he was given the title of Doctor of Music In 1680 he seems to have resigned from his job as organist at Westminster Abbey so that his young pupil Henry Purcell could take his place By 1685 he was one of the private musicians of James II He composed a long anthem God spake sometime in visions for King Jamess coronation

In 1687 he became choirmaster at St Pauls Cathedral The choir was just being reformed after the rebuilding of the cathedral following the Great Fire of London Michael Wise had been appointed as choirmaster but then he died so Blow was given the job In 1695 he became organist of St Margarets Westminster and he also took his old job at Westminster Abbey again when Henry Purcell died

In 1699 he became Composer to the Chapel Royal This was the first time anyone had been given this title However he does not seem to have composed much after 1700

Blow died on 1 October 1708 and was buried in the north aisle of Westminster Abbey close to Henry Purcell

Blow composed a large amount of music He wrote the same sort of music as Henry Purcell except that Purcell also wrote trio sonatas as well as a lot of music for the theatre Blow wrote a large amount of church music We know fourteen services and more than a hundred anthems by Blow He also wrote other vocal music such as odes and music for harpsichord and just one piece of music for the stage Venus and Adonis

A diary is a book which a person writes about what they have seen or heard or what they have been doing Diaries are usually handwritten People like to keep diaries for a variety of reasons they may want to keep a record for themselves about what they have done during their life They may sometimes want to publish it so that other people can read it Some diaries may be important for business or military purpose Children in schools are often asked to write a diary This helps them to write about what they have been doing and expressing their thoughts

Some people such as Samuel Pepys have become famous as a diarist Pepys lived at an interesting time We know a lot about what London was like by reading his diary Anne Frank wrote a diary while she was hiding from the Nazis

In modern times people write blogs on the internet This is a modern kind of diary

The word diary can also be used for a pocket diary a small book in which people can write down their appointments so that they can remember what they are supposed to be doing each day

Classical economics is the first modern school of economic thought Its main developers include Adam Smith Jean Baptiste Say David Ricardo Thomas Malthus and John Stuart Mill

Adam Smiths book The Wealth of Nations was the beginning of classical economics Smith said that if everyone did what was best for themselves the result would be best for society Before that economics was about the kings personal interests and the wealth of a nation was measured by the kings treasury Smith said whats important is whats best for the whole nation and that wealth should be measured by the yearly income of the nation He wanted to discover how wealth can grow and how people could do things to support that growth Smiths book said land labor and capital were the three factors of production and the main contributors to a nations wealth

Prices naturally adjust to having more or less of something supply and demand If there is too much of something prices go down so that people have more reason to buy it If a lot of people want something there may not be enough of it there will be a competition among the people who want to buy it and some people will agree to pay more to get what they want and prices go up 

Smith said markets should be free At the time some big companies were controlled by the government Sometimes the rulers made laws that were good for themselves but not for workers or customers For example in the American colonies colonists could grow cotton but were not allowed to make clothing from it They had to ship it to England to be made into clothing then buy it back after it was finished Smith said this was bad for individuals and for society He thought it was better for money to flow freely and naturally between buyers and sellers without outside interference Money would naturally go to the sellers who made the best product at the best price This way if people did what was best for them it would end up being best for society as a whole almost like an invisible hand was guiding everything 

Jeffrey Lee Jeff Probst is an American game show host executive producer and a reporter He was born in Wichita Kansas but mostly grew up in Bellevue Washington He is best known for being the host of the American version of the reality show Survivor 

On September 21 2008 Probst won the first Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality Competition Program On September 20 2009 he won the same award again

Survivor is an American reality television game show It came from the Swedish show Expedition Robinson made in 1997 by Charlie Parsons and first shown in May 2000 Mark Burnett produces the American show It is hosted by Jeff Probst So far there have been 19 seasons with a 20th season on its way

Each season has a group of people who have never met each other living in a far away place They are divided into two to four groups called tribes Each tribe must find food and water make fire and make homes for themselves while taking part in challenges to get a reward or broken wikt linkimmuneimmunity Sometimes a player will have to be removed from the game due to an injury or infection The last two or three players face a jury the last seven or more players voted off The jury asks the final few questions and then votes for the winner of the title of Sole Survivor and a million dollar prize

Each season the 16 to 20 strangers are divided into two to four teams called tribes The tribes are usually given some tools to survive with such as a machete a pot and water canteens to hold water The tribes are encouraged to build shelters to protect themselves In some seasons the tribes started with some food such as rice given by the show and in other seasons the tribes have no help in the beginning Early seasons allowed players to bring one luxury item with them Others seasons have brought players into the game unprepared making them start with only the clothes they are wearing and the tools that are provided

The tribes have been divided in many different ways Early seasons divided tribes so that they have equal amount of people from different ages and genders Some seasons divided the tribes by age gender andor race Usually the tribes are divided before the show starts but some seasons have had one more players choose the tribes after the game starts

Tribes are given different names and colors which are used on the tribe flags challenge courses on screen text and other items Each player is given a buff an elastic ring of material patterned with the logo for their season that can be worn around the arm the head Players have to wear the buff where it can be seen at all times so the audience can tell whos on which tribe When the tribes are switched the players must give up their old buff and get a new one for their new tribe

In each season the tribes have to compete in challenges where the players will use strength teamwork and problem solving For the first half of the game the tribes compete against each other in challenges For the second half after the merge each player usually competes against each other in challenges 

There are two types of challenges

Sometimes theyre can be a combined rewardimmunity challenge

In seasons which start with more than two tribes there is a dissolve of the tribes where the players will be re divided into two tribes after one to four Tribal Councils

In many seasons the tribes have been switched before the merge The members of each tribe are swapped around Sometimes the tribes are switched by doing a random shuffle to a schoolyard pick where two players would start picking players for their tribe There has also been a Tribe Switch which is done by allowing players to join the other tribe This process usually defeats many early alliances and strategies and can cost a player the game early or save them from being voted off early

When there are 8 to 12 players left in the game the two tribes merge When they merge the two tribes come together to make one new tribe From this point Challenges are won by one person The merged tribe also chooses a new tribe name and makes a new tribe flag with materials given by production There was no merge in Palau The Koror tribe had won every immunity challenge and members of the other tribe Ulong were being voted off one by one When there was one Ulong member left they simply joined Koror

In the later seasons hidden immunity idols have been made available These idols usually a small object that fits with the theme of the Survivor location are hidden near camp or on Exile Island with clues on its location given usually to a chosen player or to exiled or kidnapped players Once found the player with an idol may keep it or give it to another player before the start of Tribal Council and it may not be stolen from that player The player doesnt have to show this idol to other players though may use it to join alliances and for voting purposes Other players may find out that someone has the idol by peeking into other players personal items In the first few seasons of the twist only one idol was ever in play but in Survivor Fiji Survivor China Survivor Tocantins and Survivor Samoa two hidden immunity idols were made available to the players The hidden immunity idol can only be used up until and including the Tribal Council of the final four or five players depending on the season

The use of the idol by a player to become immune has changed through the seasons

During Guatemala the hidden immunity idol was not returned to the game after its use Since then if the idol is played or the player with the idol leaves the game without playing it the idol is replaced at a new spot to be found and new clues are given out During Gabon the players all decided to throw a hidden immunity idol into the sea In this case it was not replaced at a new spot In some seasons fake hidden immunity idols have been made by contestants these idols dont work if played

The idea of Exile Island was started in Survivor Palau when a player had to stay alone on a beach due to losing the Immunity Challenge The idea was later used again in Survivor Panama and was used in every season after that except Survivor China and Survivor Samoa A chosen player is sent to a small island away from the main tribe camps usually for at least a day after a reward challenge and returning at the next immunity challenge The player chosen may be the first loser of a challenge or a person chosen by either the winning or losing tribe while the players are divided in tribes or an individual challenge winner in the individual phase after the merge In Micronesia and Tocantins one person from each tribe was sent to Exile Island Unless stated otherwise players who win the right to choose who goes to Exile Island may also choose to go themselves

Also whenever the number of players is uneven when tribes are being made the player without a tribe will be tribeless and sent to Exile Island after formation In this case the player will return and join the tribe which loses a member at the next Tribal Council

Once chosen the exiled player is taken to the island by boat On the island there are few tools to survive with usually a water canteen a machete a pot and a small amount of shelter The little amount of food on Exile Island can make a player weaker causing them to perform worse in challenges The separation from other players can cause a player to become on outcast on their tribe Players are often sent to Exile Island for one or both of these strategic reasons

The person exiled gets a clue to the hidden immunity idol which may or may not be located on the island an instant comfort or the right to change tribes If the exiled player is asked to return after the Tribal Council they will also be safe from being voted out at that Tribal Council

Tribal Council is held at the end of each episode Here the tribe votes one person out of the tribe The first time any player visits Tribal Council they are asked to take a torch and light it from a fire pit They say that this is part of the ritual of Tribal Council because fire represents life As long as you have fire you are still in this game When your fires gone so are you If the Jury has already been started they are asked to enter and watch Probst then asks the players questions about details and events since the tribes last Tribal Council Before the vote if a player has been awarded individual immunity through an immunity challenge he is then asked if he wants to give it to another player Whoever has the immunity after this possible switch cannot be voted out

The players then vote for another player in secret and the player who gets the most votes must leave the game Players cannot vote for themselves Players also have to write neatly and avoid using of uncommon nicknames If the number of votes for one player is above half of the total votes Probst will stop reading and that player is eliminated keeping the rest of the votes in secret to the players themselves

As said earlier the player with the Hidden Immunity Idol get the chance to play the idol at certain points at Tribal Council

The eliminated players fire is put out and Probst tells them The tribe has spoken and Its time for you to go The player then leaves the Tribal Council area and says some last words that are shown at the end of the episode The rest of the tribe members are then told to return to camp with their torches in some seasons this has allowed a tribe access to a source of fire while in other seasons the tribe is not allowed to return to camp with their torches lit if they do not yet have their own source of fire or a way of starting one

When there is a tie before there are four players left the non tied players will vote once again where the only possibilities for elimination are the tied players If the second vote does not break the tie a two minute discussion will start where the non tied players must come to a decision as to who should be voted off If a decision is not reached in two minutes the tied players are safe from being voted off and the non tied players choose rocks out of a bag without looking The player who chooses the differently colored rock is eliminated

In the event of a tie at the final four there will be a revote but if the revote does not break the tie the tied players will compete in a challenge In Palau Panama Cook Islands and Gabon this challenge was a fire making contest In Marquesas the random rock tiebreaker was used at the final four which host Jeff Probst later said was a mistake

In the very rare case that a tribe is down to two players before the merge as in Palau those two will also face off in a challenge to decide who is to leave the game This has only happened once to date

Very rarely a player may choose to quit the game The players wish is granted for whatever reasons If a player quits at Tribal Council as was the case in Pearl Islands and Palau that players torch is laid down Depending on the players reasons for quitting they may or may not get to say their final words

In very rare cases when players have to leave the game due to injury or completely leave the game on their own terms outside of Tribal Council Tribal Council is usually not held with the other tribe being informed of the player leaving if still before the merge However there have been occasions where after a player is removed an immunity challenge and a Tribal Council are still held This usually happens when the game starts with more than eighteen players

All eliminated players except usually the Final 9 leave the game entirely The rest of the players who leave the game except the final two or three who will go on to the final vote are the jury a group of people who vote to decide the winner of the game Once the Jury starts to form the members are at every Tribal Council but are not allowed to speak or talk to the players still in the game they are only there to watch the questioning and voting that occurs Jury members are there until the end of the final Tribal Council and are not allowed to talk about their voting or issues with the remaining players with other jury members or the final players This rule continues through the game and up until the winner is announced

The last two challenges before the Final Tribal Council have always followed a similar pattern

Before to the second to last challenge the players are usually given a small food reward for making it this far The second to last immunity challenge is usually a very hard multi part challenge and usually is the most complex challenge of the entire season often combining elements from previous challenges A Tribal Council is then held to vote off one player

Before the last challenge the remaining players partake in a memorial activity appropriate for the theme of the show where they pay respect to the players who have been eliminated before them This usually leads right into the last immunity challenge which usually focuses on balance or endurance and which can last from minutes to almost half a day In most seasons with three players in the challenge winning immunity on this challenge allows that player to choose whom he or she wants to go with to the Final Tribal Council raising their chance at winning the game Because of this the challenges can allow players to talk and try to make last minute deals giving up immunity for assurance of being taken to the Final Two A Tribal Council is then held to vote off the last eliminated player Only the person with Immunity votes since the other two votes would cancel each other out At this point the game is no longer in the remaining players control as the next day they face the Final Tribal Council where their fate will be decided

A similar pattern has been used in newer seasons in which three players go to the Final Tribal Council The final challenges and rituals take place one vote earlier in the game The last immunity challenge is held amongst the final four players and the winner while assured a place in the final three does not choose his or her competition for the prize

On the last day of the competition the surviving players usually either clean up tear down or burn down their camp as a tribute to surviving to the end of the game They then make their way to the final Tribal Council

During the final Tribal Council the following events usually occur

After this vote the container with the votes is taken away by the host The players are told that the vote will be revealed during the live finale and the votes are secured until the live finale of the show when the votes are revealed and the winner is announced Sometimes the final tribal council and finale are changed so they look like one event until moments later the camera shows the studio audience This is possible by re creating on a studio the Tribal Council set from the location of filming

Before the use of a Final 3 the jury has always been odd numbered ensuring that no tie would be possible However with every Final 3 jury or as in the case of Micronesia of an even numbered jury for a Final 2 a tie may be possible it is unknown what tie breaker is used to break a tie if it happens During the finale of Micronesia the host had a white envelope that he said held the tie breaker but its contents were not revealed as there was no tie

The player chosen as Sole Survivor gets a cash prize of 1000000 The Sole Survivor also gets a car given by the shows sponsor except in Survivor Cook Islands In a few seasons the final players have also agreed to play for the tribe flag or other representative object from camp

In addition the final five or six contestants may have the chance to compete for a car The winner of this challenge has never won the game leading to the idea of a Survivor car curse 

Every player gets a prize for being on Survivor depending on how long he or she lasted in the game In most seasons the runner up gets 100000 and third place wins 85000 Sonja Christopher the first player voted off in Survivor Borneo got 2500 The prize was raised for Survivor All Stars The known prizes for Survivor All Stars were as follows 2nd 250000 3rd 125000 4th 100000 Tina Wesson the first player voted off in Survivor All Stars got 25000 In Survivor Fiji the first season with tied runners up the two runners up got US100000 each and Yau Man Chan got US60000 for his 4th place finish The prizes for other seasons with more than sixteen contestants are unknown 

All players also get an additional 10000 for being on the reunion show

There have also been additional prizes given out outside of the usual mechanics of the show

The United States version is produced by Mark Burnett and hosted by Jeff Probst It is shown on Thursdays on CBS The first season of Survivor was broadcast as a summer replacement show in 2000 Since then the show has been broadcast each US television season Each competition is called a season but each season has a different name and lasts from 13 to 15 episodes Starting with Survivor The Australian Outback there have been two Survivor seasons shown during each US television season

Acritarchs are early microfossils the remains probably of eukaryote cells It is the resistant single layered cell walls or perhaps a cover secreted by cell walls that we see in early rocks of the Proterozoic era These structures are organic in their chemical composition not calcium carbonate Their precise nature is not known but they look like the resting stages of modern dinoflagellates

Acritarchs appear in quantity in organic rich shales and siltstone strata 14 to 16 billion years oldp57 They include a wide range of forms so it is not clear whether or not they are monophyletic At about 1 billion years ago they started to increase in abundance diversity and especially size and number of spines Their populations crashed during the Cryogenian period 860 million years ago They proliferated in the Cambrian explosion and reached their highest diversity in the Paleozoic They survived at least until the Ordovician periodp256

The increased spininess possibly resulted from the need for defence against predators large enough to swallow them or tear them apart Other groups of small organisms from the Neoproterozoic era also show signs of anti predator defences

A recent discovery has greatly extended our knowledge of acritarchs Large acritarchs have been found in silica based rocks of Archaean age in South Africa These rocks date to 3200 million years ago which makes them the second oldest life to be found as fossils The earliest are cyanobacteria found in stromatolites

The significance of this is that acritarchs are eukaryotes This means that eukaryotes were present at least 15 billion years earlier than had been supposed

Coccoliths are the microscopic plates which form chalk They are made by one of the most important eukaryote phytoplankton These are single celled protists whose full name is coccolithophorids or coccolithophores The spherical skeleton of coccoliths is a coccosphere

Chalk makes up much of the marine strata in the Upper Cretaceous period and is 95 to 99 made up of coccoliths the calcium carbonate plates which coccolithophorids produce 

Coccoliths were first examined by Cristian Gottfried Ehrenberg who thought they were inorganic products They were named and identified as made by living organisms by Thomas Henry Huxley who realised they were a major part of the rock we call chalk The story of how the tiny cell produces its coccosphere is told by Westbroek

Coccolithophores are a major contributor to the carbonate in deep sea sediments In the Northeast Atlantic during the last glacial interglacial cycle coccoliths comprised 70 80 of the total carbonate during the warm periods and a lower percentage during glacial times 

Coccoliths are first seen at the end of the Triassic period 200 million years ago It is interesting that another group of tiny algae the diatoms make their entry into the fossil record at almost the same time The coccolith all time peak was in the warm inland and continental shelf seas of the Cretaceous period They are still of huge ecological and geological importance

Emiliania huxlei is one of the most important planktonic algae on the planet today It is the most common coccolithophorid in the oceans of the world It dominates in the northeast Atlantic in the northeast Pacific and in the eastern Mediterranean It forms gigantic blooms readily seen on satellite imagery This blooming life style started between 80000 and 50000 years ago and marks the start of the so called Ehux Acme zone in the fossil record

Ehux is only seen in relatively young sediments and must have evolved fairly recently The first appearance datum of Ehux in the sediment is used as a biostratigraphic marker Depending on the different proxies used and the location this entry has been dated at 270000 years ago using correlation with planktic foraminiferal delta O18 records Weaver dated it at 242268000 years ago

Class Prymnesiophyceae

The cells typically have two slightly unequal flagella and a unique organelle called a haptonema This is is superficially similar to a flagellum but differs in its arrangement of microtubules and in its use The name comes from the Greek hapsis touch and nema thread 

Molecular and morphological evidence places them in five orders coccolithophores make up the Isochrysidales and Coccolithales Other groups include phytoplankton which produce the toxic algal blooms

Southam is a small town in Warwickshire England It is often mistaken for a village but has been a town since medieval times

There is an ancient stone wall called The Holy Well

The first battle in the English Civil War was in Southam In August 1642 small groups of soldiers from the opposing sides accidentally met at Southam and in the fight some were killed They were on their way to Edge Hill where the first big battle took place History books usually say Edge Hill was the first fight Later MediaKing Charles I rode through the town and fined the people because they did not ring the church bells for him Later still MediaOliver Cromwell who slept in the Manor House

In the 1600s Southam was an important resting place for horse drawn carriages and even in recent times had an unusually large number of inns and public houses A main road that Welsh sheep farmers used to travel to London passed through Southam The town was also at an important junction between Birmingham Coventry Daventry Northampton Banbury Oxford Leamington Spa and Warwick

Southam never had a canal or railway built through it This meant that it remained a small town while other places with canals and railways grew rapidly in the 1800s In recent years a lot of new houses have been built increasing the population from 2000 in 1950 to 8000 in 2010

There is a fine church which dates from 1200 It was extensively restored in Victorian times but still has lots of medieval stone work The Manor House is in the centre of the town In 2008 during routine maintenance fine wood carvings were discovered under the plaster The carvings are of hearts and arrows and are at least 300 years old The company that owns the building paid for the beautify work to be fully restored

There are small industrial estates around the town some with important businesses including the computer games company MediaCodemasters There are plans for a large supermarket to be built in the town While this would change the character of the town even more it could benefit people who find the current small shops and supermarkets too expensive and provide more people with work Some people do not want a supermarket saying that other shops would close

Pelham Humfrey was an English composer in the Baroque period Although he died at the age of 26 he had an important influence on English composers such as William Turner and Henry Purcell He lived at the time of the Restoration when England was ruled by a king once more after two decades of republican rule during which music had not been allowed in churches

Life 

We do not know much detail about his early life He seems to have been a choirboy in the Chapel Royal by 1660 During this time he was obviously becoming a very gifted composer Other boys in the choir included John Blow and William Turner As a young man he travelled to France where he heard music by French composers such as Lully and Italians such as Carissimi This helped him to form his own style He became a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal He wrote some fine anthems although the diarist Samuel Pepys thought that he was showing off This may be because Pepys did not like the new kind of music He married the daughter of his old choir master Henry Cooke He became Master of the Children of the Chapel Royal This meant that he was in charge of the children in the kings chapel choir He was also a court composer

He became ill and died at the age of 26 He was buried in the cloisters of Westminster Abbey

Humfrey composed a lot of music during his very short life It helped to form the English Baroque style He mostly wrote church music but he also wrote some music for the theatre

Humfrey liked to compose music which excited peoples emotions Some of his melodies jump around in unexpected ways There is a lot of chromaticism Some of his best anthems include O Lord my God By the waters of Babylon and Like as the hart He wrote 27 songs Five of them are religious songs and they are some of the best songs of that time

William Turner was a composer and singer in the Baroque period He lived at the same time as English composers such as Pelham Humfrey and Henry Purcell although he lived a lot longer than they did He is remembered today as a composer of about 40 verse anthems As a singer he was a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal from 1669 until his death

Turner started being a choir boy at Christ Church Oxford Then he became a choir boy in the Chapel Royal in London He wrote an anthem together with John Blow and Pelham Humfrey known as the Club Anthem When his voice broke in 1666 he had three years out of the choir but returned in 1669 and sang as a countertenor in the Chapel Royal for another 71 years until his death He became a member of the Kings Private Musick Besides his work at the kings court he was also a vicar choral of St Pauls Cathedral and later a lay vicar of the choir of Westminster Abbey In 1696 he was given a doctorate of music by Cambridge University After that he was known as Dr Turner

Most of his music was written before 1700 It is nearly all church music but he did write a few pieces for the theatre He wrote 40 anthems three service settings and a motet One of his best anthems is God standeth in the congregation of Princes It includes a very dramatic solo for bass to the words God reigneth over the heathen

Goombas are an enemy in the Mario series They are short brown mushroom shaped enemies that are easily killed by jumping on their head They appear in almost every Mario game

Goombas were first introduced in the video game Super Mario Bros and was the last enemy implemented into the game Players stated that the Koopa Troopa was too tricky an enemy so the designers decided to introduce the Goomba as a basic enemy When they decided to do this however they had very little space left in the game They used a single image twice to convey the notion that the Goombas are walking rotating it back and forth causing it to look lopsided as it walks and giving the motion the appearance of a trot The Goombas resemblance to the Super Mushroom forced designers to change the mechanics and appearance of the Super Mushroom They used the Goombas ability to be jumped on and defeated to teach players how to deal with enemies and to not fear the Super Mushroom The Goombas are designed after a kind of mushroom called shiitake Early concept art for the Super Mario Bros film showed that the design of the Goombas were originally intended to be for Koopa Troopas another kind of Mario enemy A separate company from the primary makeup departments designed the Goombas in the film

The Urutora Shirzu is the name for all the shows produced by Tsuburaya Productions featuring Ultraman his many Kyodai and the countless number of ultra beings and the Ultra Monsters The Ultra Series is one of the tokusatsu superhero productions from Japan along with Kamen Rider Series Super Sentai Series and the Metal Hero Series

Ultraman is a Seijin from star of lightM 78 Many Ultramen are usually red and silver and have glowing yellow eyes and they have many abilities most of them are to fire energy beams from many positions of crossed hands The Ultra beings main weakness is that they can only stay on Earth in giant form for a small time usually not longer than three minutes because of the small amount of energy supply This is marked by a blue light on the characters body usually called the Color Timer or warning light which begins to blink red with increase in blinking as his energy supply goes down but Red warriors like Ultraseven had orb on their head instead of color timer During this time the Ultra beings must either find a way to recharge or finish the fight as soon as possible or forced to turn to human form or worse certain death Sometimes some ultra warriors take them back to their home planet or when reflected sun rays by the mirrors on his color timer might charge him up Some say another reason for Ultraman to recharge is because the Earth is badly polluted by humans so Ultraman only has three minutes on Earth but can survive long enough in outer space The time limit only happens inside the Earths atmosphere but they have none of those problems in outer space In this case Ultramen almost always merge with a human host or create a human form for themselves in order to survive on Earth more often than not reviving a rescently dead person with their own lifeforce Ultra beings also appear to be near immpossible to permently kill as several times an Ultra being has been killed only to be revived by another member of their species In other cases a large enough amount of energy can be provided to bring them back to life usually provided by their human allies even after being completely destroyed as was the case with Mebius death at the hands of Empera Seijin only to be revived shortly thereafter by the life energy of his allies

Ultramen always try to avoid battles in a place where there are innocent people near them and try to cause the least amount of destruction as possible from the side effects of their fights when fighting in the city when and if they can not a city like Tokyo would be destroyed

In 1993 Tsuburaya Productions and Toei Company co produced Ultraman vs Kamen Rider a connection with the original Ultraman and Toeis Kamen Rider Ichigo This direct to video feature is co copyrighted by both Toei and Tsuburaya Productions

In Japan there have been several box sets that were released which would each contain a particular Ultra series As of now there are only four such box sets The sets were released as part of the Digital Ultra movement where the shows would be re released with digital remastering

The following are the series which have been released as such

The Digital Ultra re release order of the series may not match the time order in which they were originally aired in Japan

Ultramans licensing rights outside of Japan have been the subject of a long legal dispute between Tsuburaya Productions and Chaiyo Productions based in Thailand Tsuburaya had previously worked together with Chaiyo on the production of two movies The 6 Ultra Brothers vs the Monster Army and Jumborg Ace Giant the latter of which featured another Tsuburaya superhero Jumborg Ace in 1974 Sompote Saengduenchai founderpresident of Chaiyo Productions claimed and maintained that in 1976 the late Noboru Tsuburaya Eijis son who had died in 1995 had given him and his company a contract which had given him rights to everything Ultraman outside Japanese territories in exchange for a monetary loan 

In anger of the reason that the document failed to state clearly and exactly what had been given to Tsuburaya in exchange for these rights Japanese and Thai courts accepted this contract as real and bonding because of the supposed hanko of the late Noboru Tsuburaya in the document Tsuburaya Productions insisted and maintained that the contract was a fraud and repeatedly opposed the issue

In the course of the legal battle Sompote presented photos of himself sharing his photos of Thai Buddhist stating that Eiji had based Ultramans face on the said structure a claim which he has continued to hold since the dispute began No other proof supporting this claim was known to exist

After an 8 year battle in the courts of both countries Sompote Saengduenchai was awarded a favorable decision on April 27 2004 The exact ruling fell into some dispute Some said it only gave him selling rights for the first six Ultra Series and Jumborg Ace outside Japan and broadcasting rights of said shows within Thailand Other accounts usually reported in the ThaiAsian media said that Chaiyo had got the rights to those six shows everywhere outside Japan The dispute could be taken as Chaiyos side of the story as Tsuburaya was reported in the Japanese media to continue taking more action against them

Tsuburaya decided not to market any of the disputed six Ultra Series outside Japan until it had completely settled the rights cases with Chaiyo although the company continued to sell all of the Ultraman programs created after Ultraman Taro including the theatrical feature Ultraman the Next throughout the world Because of the copyright dispute sending literature on Ultraman into Singapore and Malaysia was stopped It also resulted in a slow coming down against Thai Ultraman fans who were assumed to be outright Chaiyo supporters

In 2005 the American company BCI Eclipse announced they had acquired the DVD rights to the original Ultraman from Chaiyo A 3 disc box set containing the first 20 episodes of the series was released on July 18 2006 and a second 3 disc box set containing the remaining 19 episodes was released on November 7 2006 Both sets feature the original Japanese dialogue track as well as the English dubbed version produced by United Artists for North American people At certain times the English dialogue track changed to the Japanese dialogue for small time This was because BCI had used audio from older recordings in which many scenes had to be cut or shortened for the American broadcast in order to fit running time Tsuburaya Productions still held on to the complete original English dubbing materials which they had obtained from a warehouse in 1997 and refused to provide them for BCI

During the time of the legal battle Chaiyo created three of their own Ultras Ultraman Millennium Dark Ultraman and Ultraman Elite These were not used for other reasons than stage shows and for selling Chaiyo also created a TV series he called Project Ultraman un aired as of late March 2008 a joint project in China featuring his own Ultraman and attaching Hong Kong star Ekin Cheng to the project

On August 23 2006 Tsuburaya Productions created a new law for ultramans right against Chaiyo for copyright and the court case was taken to China The Chinese courts in Beijing opened The Ultraman Copyright Study Group in response to the law for ultramans right In April 2007 the Thailand Intellectual Property Court ruled in favor of Tsuburaya Productions ordering Chaiyo to stop making commercial profits from Chaiyo produced Ultraman characters such as Millennium Dark and Elite The supporters were also fined THB 15000000 plus interest and attorneys fees Project Ultraman went on a break as a result of the ruling which said that even if Chaiyo owned the right to some of the Ultraman series it did not own the right to Ultraman and his brothers including the design Chaiyo gained permission to sell the original series but lost the right to create and market its own Ultraman or even use the original without Tsuburaya permissionFactdateDecember 2007

On February 5 2008 the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Tsuburaya Productions of Japan after they made an appeal to the initial ruling The ruling ended the long legal battle by finding Sompote Saengduenchai was not a co creator of Ultraman The decision ended Sompotes bid to continue his enterprise and the court gave Sompote 30 days to stop gaining money from Ultraman The final ruling saw Tsuburaya Productions as the main copyright owner Sompote was also required to pay THB 10700000 plus interest at the rate of 75 per cent a year starting from December 16 1997 when the original law for ultramans right was filed

Macedonia is a region in the southeastern Europe in Balkans In ancient times it was a greek kingdom and its greatest leader was Alexander The Great Today its borders have changed and it has been separated in three countries Greece with the region of Macedonia or Greek Macedonia the country Macedonia or Vardar Macedonia and Bulgaria with Macedonia of Pirin

Greece and the Republic of Macedonia have been arguing over the name Macedonia ever since the indipendence of the Macedonia The Republic of Macedonia had to choose a temporary name in order to be recognized by the United Nations The two countries have been discussing a solution for a new name that both find acceptable Bulgaria hasnt taken part in the dispute but has some disagreements with Macedonia Even though Bulgaria was the first country to recognize Macedonia with its name it doesnt support the Macedonian ethnicity and language but claim its all Bulgarian

A clone is any cell or individual which is identical to another 

In biology cloning is the process of producing one or more genetically identical individuals With whole individuals it usually means the deliberate production of an identical copy This was first achieved in mammals with the famous Dolly the sheep Human identical twins are natural clones so are the progeny of asexual reproduction and any parthenogenetic reproduction which does not involve meiosis

In genetics and cell biology cloning refers especially to the DNA sequence and by implication all the other macromolecules 

Clones in cell lines occur but there are some obvious provisos Changes to the DNA in any shape or form means the daughter cells are not identical with the mother cells Typically during development genes are switched on and off and the daughter cells gradually become differentiated into mature tissue cells These are not identical with the original stem cells so they are clones only in the sense of being derived from the same mother cell

The laboratory copying of a molecule to produce exact copies is also called cloning

Jean Baptiste Lully was an Italian composer violinist and dancer who spent most of his life working in the court of Louis XIV of France He took on French nationality in 1661 He was the most important French composer of his time Lully realized that music in the Italian style was not suitable for the French language so he composed his operas in a special way He created the tradition of French opera He also wrote a lot of ballet music and some church music Lully is remembered for the strange way in which he died

Lully was born in Florence Italy Lully did not have much education He taught himself a lot of what he could do He learned to play the guitar and the violin and to dance 

In 1646 he was taken to France where he was given a job teaching Italian to a Duchess He had the opportunity to hear a lot of good music and by the time he was 20 he was an excellent composer violinist and dancer

He started to work for Louis XIV in 1652 He composed some music for the Ballet de la Nuit The king liked it very much He became composer of instrumental music to the king His orchestra had 24 violins They were not very good so he got the kings permission to start another group which he called Petits Violons There were 16 in the group and Lully trained them properly He did not let them put too many ornaments in the music

He became a Frenchman in 1661 The next year he became Music Master to the Royal Family and he also married The king and queen signed the marriage document so Lully was obviously an important man

Lully composed lots of ballets for the King during the 1650s and 1660s He was one of the dancers in these ballets The king also danced He worked with the great playwright Molire composing music for Molires comedies These include Le Mariage forc LAmour mdecin and Le Bourgeois gentilhomme Together with Molire he created the Comdie Ballet which became a great French tradition

When the king got older he could not dance and so he became less interested in ballet So Lully became more interested in composing operas He earned a lot of money from this because there was an arrangement with the king that Lully would have complete control of any music that was published in France Lully had become a very powerful man and many other musicians did not like this There were a lot of arguments especially when Lully did not allow music in puppet shows

Lully had lots of successes in his life He also had many love affairs both with men and women There were several scandals but the king always forgave him because he was a great friend

Late in 1686 the king had been ill but he got better so he asked Lully to organize a concert to celebrate the fact that he was well again The concert was given on 8 January 1687 The orchestra played a Te Deum Lully conducted the orchestra Conductors did not yet use batons in those days Instead Lully banged a big stick on the floor to keep the orchestra together Suddenly he hit his toe with his stick The wound in the toe got an infection He did not want the doctors to cut off his toe The infection spread to the rest of the body and he died on 22 March

Lully was rich when he died He left 800000 livres He had five houses in Paris as well as two country houses

Lully lived in the middle of the Baroque period He liked fast lively music especially music that could be danced to He changed peoples taste in musical style He used a lot of instruments that had not been used in orchestras before His friendship with Molire resulted in a new musical form the comdie ballet which combined theatre comedy and ballet

Lully also created the style of French opera called tragdie en musique or tragdie lyrique Instead of having his opera music divided into recitatives and arias he often combined the two so that events in the story happened quickly

For the first time not including the season before All Stars there were eighteen players In the first seven seasons there were only sixteen This was the second season where the starting tribes were divided by gender It was also the first season to have an amputee and not one but two open lesbians

The season began like Survivor The Amazon The tribes were divided by gender The male tribe was Lopevi named after one of Vanuatus volcanic islands the female tribe was Yasur named after Mount Yasur On Day 11 there was a tribal switch like in other seasons which ended up moving two people from each tribe over to the other tribe

On Day 20 the tribes were merged into one tribe They named the new tribe Alinta a name suggested by Scout meaning people of fire

Eliza Orlins and Ami Cusack were chosen from this season to return for Survivor Micronesia as members of the Favorites tribe where they placed 10th and 11th

The players were brought into the game at a native gathering with the natives dividing the group into men and women The men were clearly worshiped at the ceremony suggesting they would have better luck in the game After the ceremony the men were named the Lopevi tribe and the women the Yasur tribe and sent to find their camps in the dark Lopevi lost the first challenge mainly due to Chris however the older men of the tribe started an alliance and worked to vote off one of the younger men Brook This would continue through the next two tribal councils that Lopevi took part in In Yasur a strong clique started around Ami and the women that did not fit in were voted out 

The tribes were switched on day 11 mixing the two tribes later voting only strengthened Amis alliances On Day 19 the two tribes now with 6 women and 4 men merged into one tribe which they named Alinta The men were quickly targeted at the next three tribal councils leaving Chris as the only male By this time the players in Amis alliance were her Julie and Leann while Twila and Scout had formed a closer pairing with Eliza as an outsider among the women When Chris didnt win the next immunity challenge Twila brought Chris into a plan to vote out one of Amis group if they could bring Eliza into their foursome Chris was successful at this and Leann was voted out at the next tribal council Ami and Julie soon followed even though they had tried to vote off Chris The final four was Chris Eliza Twila and Scout Chris won the last two immunity challenges and took Twila with him into the final two The jury saw Chris power to stay in the game with the odds against him both from the first challenge and as the last man standing and voted him the Sole Survivor 5 2

fnb1 John K had to spend a day with the other tribe for the point of giving immunity to one of them at tribal council that night He chose Ami because he thought she was safe even without immunity

Jesus also known as Jesus Christ or Jesus of Nazareth is the central figure of the Christian religion Most historians agree that he was a Jew from a place called Galilee in the country that is today called Israel They also agree that he was thought of as a teacher and a healer and that he was baptized by John the Baptist He was crucified in Jerusalem on the orders of Pontius Pilate

The name Jesus came from the Aramaic name Yeshua from Hebrew Yah shua meaning God is salvation in English and was a popular name of the time Jesus is often called Jesus Christ or Christ The word Christ comes from the Greek word christos and means the one marked on the head with oil or the anointed one In Jesus country anointing was done to show that a person was chosen to be a king or a leader Jesus is also called Messiah which comes from the Hebrew term Moshiach and also means the anointed one

Stories about the life of Jesus have been recorded by different writers The best known are four books called the Gospels They form the beginning of the New Testament a part of the Bible Gospel means Good News The Gospels are claimed to be written by followers of Jesus They tell a little about his birth and mostly about his adult life his teachings ministry death and a reported resurrection There are four Gospels the Gospel of Mark the Gospel of Matthew the Gospel of Luke and the Gospel of John 

Several Jewish and Roman historians such as Flavius Josephus Tacitus Pliny the Younger and Suetonius mention Jesus in their writings They usually only mention his execution or problems between the Roman government and his followers they do not talk about his life

This section is about the birth ministry and death of Jesus It is taken from the four books of the Bible called the Gospels of Matthew Mark Luke and John They were written in the 1st century CE Nearly all other writing about Jesus is based on these four books 

The Gospels of Matthew and Luke say that before the birth of Jesus both Mary his mother and the man that she was promised to Joseph knew that Jesus was going to be the Messiah or King that had been promised to the Jewish people in the ancient Jewish books 

Lukes Gospel tells most of the story At the time that Jesus was born the Roman Empire ruled most of Europe England the Middle East and North Africa The Government wanted every single family to have their name taken down to be taxed so everyone had to go back to the place where they came from Joseph came from the small town of Bethlehem near Jerusalem so even though Mary was close to giving birth to her baby they had to travel with thousands of other people 

When they got to Bethlehem every room was full There was nowhere for them to stay except in a stable an animal shed The baby Jesus was born in the stable was wrapped up and put to sleep on the straw in the feed bin Luke tells us that the shepherds who were minding the sheep on the hillside came in to see the baby and went away singing thanks to God for the newborn king

In the Gospel of Matthew it says that wise men from another country saw a new star in the sky and came to find the young Jesus because they knew that the Messiah was going to be born under a star and that the star was a sign that Jesus was born to be a king

Most Christians celebrate the day that Jesus was born as the holiday of Christmas Although the Gospels do not say what day Jesus was born early Christians living in Rome chose the 25th of December because there was already a Roman holiday on that day 

The arrival of Jesus was prophesied by John the Baptist He baptized Jesus in the Jordan River During the baptism the Spirit of God like a dove came down upon Jesus and the voice of God was heard According to the Bible the Spirit led Jesus into the desert where he fasted for 40 days There he resisted the Devils temptations Then Jesus went into Galilee settled in Capernaum and began to preach about the Kingdom of God He was about 30 years old

Jesus taught mainly by telling stories He taught that God alone was the true king and that people should love God and love each other as the Hebrew Bible told them to do Jesus performed miracles that were signs of Gods power such as giving hungry people food and wine healing sick people and making dead people alive again He also set people free from evil spirits 

Jesus gathered together twelve men known as the Twelve Apostles whom he chose and trained to spread his message He had many other disciples including many women but because of Jewish customs the women disciples could not travel to distant places on their own as teachers

The Bible says Jesus became famous He went to Jerusalem where many people were visiting the city for a Holy Day When they heard that he was coming they greeted him as if he was a king They thought perhaps he would free them from the Roman rule but Jesus rode into Jerusalem on a donkey as a sign that he came in peace 

Jesus did a lot of things that upset the Jewish religious leaders He often showed disrespect for customs that the Jews had kept for many centuries For example Jews did no work at all on the 7th day of the week the Sabbath because it was a holy day but Jesus often showed disrespect for this custom In Johns Gospel chapter 5 there is the story of Jesus healing a crippled man Jesus saw a man lying on a mattress He healed the man and told him to pick up the mattress and go home Carrying the mattress on the Sabbath was against religious custom so the religious leaders argued with Jesus about it They then watched everything he did and remembered all the things that were against the religious customs 

In Marks Gospel chapter 11 it says that when Jesus arrived in Jerusalem he went to the Jewish Temple He became angry at what he saw There were people selling things there and money lenders who were cheating poor people Jesus chased away all the people who were selling things He said the chief priests and scribes had turned the temple into a den of thieves because they were making money from the poor and taking away homes from poor women who had no other way to pay for the temple worship

The Gospels say that the temple leaders were angry and wanted to kill him They told the Roman Government that Jesus wanted to become the king of the country and take it over The gospels say the Roman Governor thought that Jesus should be set free but that the Jewish leaders said If you do that then you are not the friend of Caesar 

The Governor sentenced him to death for claiming to be the king of the Jews The Roman soldiers killed Jesus by crucifixion they nailed his hands and feet to a cross This was a common way for the Romans to kill rebels and criminals

Jesus body was buried in a tomb which belonged to one of his followers He was placed there in a hurry because the Sabbath day when no one could work started when the sun went down On the day after the Sabbath early in the morning women came to wash the body and treat it with spice and perfumed oil But the Gospels say that the body of Jesus was gone and that he was seen alive afterwards

Some people like the disciple Thomas said Im not going to believe this until I have seen it with my own eyes But the Bible says that more than 500 people including Thomas saw Jesus alive again There are many stories in the Gospels about what Jesus did once he was resurrected Finally Lukes Gospel says that Jesus took his disciples to a hill where he blessed them and told them to spread his teaching through all the world and that then clouds came down and he was lifted up to Heaven

Most Christians celebrate the time that the Gospels say he died and was raised from the dead as the holiday of Easter

The Christian Church is founded on Jesus The things that Christians believe about Jesus are based on the four Gospels of the Bible and on letters or Epistles that were written in the 1st century explaining Jesus teachings to his followers 

Jesus did not write these letters They were mainly written by a Jewish man called Paul At first he tried to stop Christianity from spreading Then he became a Christian himself and was an important leader As Christian churches started in different towns and countries Paul wrote letters to them A lot of the ideas that Christians believe are written in Pauls letters There is also lots of instruction for running churches and families

There are other letters in the New Testament by other writers including Peter James and John These letters all help to build the beliefs that modern Christians have People of other faiths do not use the letters and do not agree with the Christian teachings 

See section Other views about Jesus

Whether or not Jesus is God has been argued about for a long time Most Christians including those from Catholic Orthodox and Protestant denominations believe Jesus was both God and man Jesus is described in different parts of the New Testament as being the Word of God the Son of God the Son of Man and even God himself 

These teachings which are believed by most Christians are not believed by many other people The Islamic teaching is that Jesus was a prophet but he was not part of God or the Son of God In Jesus own time many Jews became very angry at Jesus for saying that he was the Son of God and also because his followers said he was the Messiah Most Jews do not believe this 

These Bible verses tell the Christian teaching that Jesus is God

Jesus is also referred to as the Son of God 

All Christians believe that these verses say Jesus is God All Christians believe that Jesus death on the cross allows all people to be forgiven by God for their sins Most Christians believe that if a person asks God to forgive them He will do so and they will get to live forever with him in Heaven

Christians believe that by the teaching of the Bible Jesus was not only truly God but also truly human and that this was part of Gods plan to bring humans closer to understanding him People who do not have Christian beliefs believe that Jesus was an ordinary person and not God made human 

Verses from the Bible 

In Matthews Gospel Jesus is often called the Son of Man Matthew has borrowed these words from the Old Testament where they are often used to show that humankind is very far from God In the Bible God is often praised and thanked for helping ordinary humans who are called the sons of man In Psalm 8 the writer King David asks God What is man and the son of man that you should care so much and give him such wonderful power over the Earth and all its creatures

In Matthews Gospel 2430 Jesus says They shall see the Son of Man coming in the clouds of Heaven with power and great glory Like King David in Psalm 8 Jesus is making a difference between his ordinary human life and his great power as the Son of God

One of the best loved parts of the Old Testament is a song called Psalm 23 It starts 

In the Gospels Jesus often spoke about himself as being like a shepherd caring for sheep He called himself the Good Shepherd who would even give his own life to protect his sheep He told the Jewish people referring to non Jewish or Gentile believers that he had other sheep that do not belong to this flock In one of his last conversations with his disciple Peter he told him Feed my sheep in other words Take care of my people

In Jewish religion from ancient times there was a belief that humankind was sinful and that people needed to be forgiven by God They believed that there were two ways to get Gods forgiveness by prayer and by sacrifice Prayer could be done anywhere but sacrifices were done at the temple A person would bring an animal often a lamb or if they were poor a dove They would put their hands on the animal to lay their sins on it Then the animal would be killed as a punishment for the sin This type of sacrifice continued until the temple in Jerusalem was destroyed in 71 AD Paying money to the temple was also a sort of sacrifice When Jesus drove the traders out of the temple they were the people who sold lambs and doves and the people who exchanged Roman money into special temple money 

Part of Christian belief is that Jesus Christ did not just come as a human person so that he could teach a better way of life Christians also believe that Jesus was the ultimate sacrifice for the sin of humankind that Jesus is the Saviour the one who is here to save Christians believe that unlike ordinary people Jesus was completely pure and free from sin but that when he died on the cross he took on himself all the sins of every person who would believe in him like the lamb sacrificed in the temple

Based on Johns Gospel Christian teaching is that the death and resurrection of Jesus are the sign of his power to forgive the sins of any person who turns to him and truly asks for forgiveness The Bible says that sinners who are forgiven should try to live a new life and not go back to their sinful behaviour Christians believe that knowing about Gods love helps people to live a new and better life 

These are three verses from the Bible that are important in this Christian belief 

God loved the world so much that he gave his only Son so that whoever believes might not die but have eternal life Johns Gospel 316 

Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life If anyone comes to the Father they must come by me Johns Gospel 146 

If we say we have no sins we are fooling ourselves and not telling the truth But if we tell our sins humbly to God then He has promised to listen and to forgive our sins and make us clean from all our badness from the First Letter of John

Some people who are not Christians believe that Jesus lived at the time that the Gospels say but do not believe that Jesus was the Son of God or Saviour They believe that Jesus was an ordinary but very good person a teacher and perhaps a prophet 

Some people accept Jesus as a moral example without any connection to a God Mohandas Gandhi said I am a Muslim and a Hindu and a Christian and a Jew even though he was born a Jain Gandhi worked hard in his life to make the followers of all these religions respect each other This is how many people see Jesus too  a teacher who said that all people were neighbours and that Jews Romans Greeks Samaritans and other people should all live in peace with each other

Muslims consider Jesus to be the second to last Prophet and Muhammad to have been the very last Prophet They believe that Jesus and Muhammad were both ordinary men chosen by God

Muslims do not believe that Jesus was God or the Son of God Islam is strictly monotheistic and thus any inclinations towards deification of an individual apart from God is viewed as idolatry and polytheism They believe that Jesus cannot be part of God because there is only one God Islam teaches that Jesus did not die on the cross but that he was raised to Heaven in body and soul Muslims always say peace be upon him after saying Jesus name as a sign of respect

Among the teachings accepted by Muslims are that Jesus will return to the earth in the End Of Days and that he will destroy the false messiah or anti Christ prior to the day of judgment Muslims also accept Jesus claims to be a healer and believe in the many miracles attributed to him such as raising the dead to life giving sight to the blind etc and believe that all his miracles were granted to him from God

Even though Jesus was a Jew and his teaching came out of the Jewish religion most Jewish people do not believe that Jesus was the Messiah that is promised in the Jewish Scriptures 

In the Gospels it tells that Jesus made the Jewish teachers very angry with his teachings It says that part of their anger was because he told them they were hypocrites which means that they externally made themselves appear to be living a holy life but internally their hearts were far from Gods 

In the Gospels the other reason that they became angry was that Jesus acted as if he was the Messiah and said he was the Son of God This meant that he was either a terrible liar that he was mad and just imagined it or that it was true But Jesus did not seem to be mad So that left only two choices If Jesus was lying then he was doing something badly against the Jewish religion It was because of the claims that Jesus was the Son of God that some of the Jewish leaders wanted him killed and they handed him to the Roman rulers The Romans did not care if Jesus said something that was against the Jewish beliefs But they knew that people had also said that Jesus was King of the Jews The Jewish leaders claimed this was against the Roman Governments laws Although the Roman leaders did not agree they had him killed to prevent a possible riot 

Although today and through history most Jews do not believe what Christians say about Jesus there are some Jews who do believe that Jesus was the Messiah promised in the Jewish Scriptures Jews who believe this are called Messianic Jews

Some writers have said that perhaps Jesus never existed Ideas have been put forward that the whole of the Gospel writing about Jesus is just a good story or myth and that Jesus perhaps never existed

Other writers have shown that parts of the story of Jesus are similar to other religions such as the stories of Gilgamesh and Mithras They also show that Christianity holds its main Holy Days at a time when there was already a Roman or Jewish festival such as Easter at the time of the Passover

In the later part of the 20th century and in the 21st century nearly all scholars both Christian and non Christian agree that Jesus was a real historic person Both Christian and non Christian scholars base their studies of him on the Gospels They are believed to have been written between 60 90 AD

By tradition the Gospels were written by four men Matthew Mark Luke and John who gave their names to these books This story is in all modern Bibles and is thought to contain very important teaching for Christians Other differences that can be found in versions of the Gospels are mostly small and do not make a difference to what is known about the life of Jesus and his teaching

Marks Gospel which is thought by biblical scholars to be the earliest has the name of a young disciple of the apostle Paul who is mentioned several times in the Acts of the Apostles and Pauls LettersThe Gospel was probably written in Rome and is thought by scholars to be from the memories of Jesus follower or disciple Peter It does not tell about Jesus birth it starts when he was 30 years old at the time when the disciples got to know him It shows Jesus as a man of action going around the country teaching and healing people

Matthews Gospel was written next Matthew was one of Jesus disciples He was a Jewish man that was hated by other Jews because he worked for the Roman rulers as a tax collector Matthew tells that one day Jesus saw him sitting at his desk in the market place and said Follow me Most Biblical scholars believe that Matthew had read Marks Gospel and decided to fill in some things that Mark left out because while Mark wrote his Gospel for the Church of Rome Matthew wanted to write for Jewish Christians all over the Roman Empire Matthew was a well educated Jew so he knew the Jewish Scriptures Matthew knew the scripture teachings that the Messiah or Gods anointed one would come In his Gospel he often mentions these teachings He also starts off by giving a list of Jesus ancestors because this was important to Jewish readers

Luke was not a Jew and he writes in a way that is easy for other people who are not Jews to understand He explains Jewish customs and laws He wrote a second book called the Acts of the Apostles which tells what the disciples did after Jesus had left them

It is believed by scholars of the Bible that John was a disciple of Jesus and was probably the youngest of the twelve men who were Jesus main followers He lived to be an old man and because of his teaching about Jesus he was sent to a small island called Patmos John writes with one particular idea in mind He wants to prove to the reader that Jesus is Gods way of saving humans from the terrible problem of sin or evil John starts by telling the reader that Jesus was God John says that Jesus is Gods Living Communication Every part of Johns Gospel is written to show that Jesus came from God taught the Message of God and is the way for people to understand Gods Love

The Gospels tell many of the stories that Jesus told when he was teaching people about the way that God loved them and the way they should live Two of the most famous stories are the story of the Prodigal Son and the story of the Good Samaritan In the first story it is shown how much God loves his people and in the second story is shown how people should love each other 

In this story from Lukes Gospel Jesus tells how a rich man had two sons They would both get a share of his money when he died The younger son said Father give me my money now so I can go and enjoy myself while Im young He took the money to the city and spent it all on parties with his friends Soon he had none left to feed himself He was ashamed He got a job caring for pigs but he was almost starving He said to himself Ill go home to my father and I will say Father I have sinned Please let me be a servant in your house 

As he went home he did not know that his father looked out for him every day When his father saw him coming he ran along the road to put his arms around his son The son said Father I have sinned Please let me be a servant in your house The father said Bring the finest clothes Kill the fattest calf to make a feast When the elder brother heard all this he was angry and said Im a good son to you but you never even gave me one little goat to have a party with my friends The father said You have always been with me I love you greatly and all I have is yours but my son who was lost is now found My son who seemed to be dead is alive Be happy with me Jesus said that this is the way God loves and forgives his people when they ask for forgiveness

In this story from Lukes Gospel Jesus shows what it means to be a good neighbour Near the Jews lived the Samaritans They followed the Hebrew Scriptures but they worshiped differently to the Jews so the Jews were prejudiced against them One day a Jewish man was on a journey when a band of robbers beat him up robbed him and left him naked and almost dead by the road A Jewish priest came along and saw him He thought If I touch that naked bleeding man I will be unclean and I will not be able to go to the Temple So he pretended that he had not seen him Another Jew a Holy Man came along and acted in the same way At last a Samaritan came along with a donkey When he saw the wounded man he stopped He washed his wounds with wine and olive oil Then he put him on his donkey and took him to the nearest inn He paid the innkeeper and said Keep him until he is well and whatever is owing I will pay when I come back this way Jesus said to the people who were listening Which one of these people acted like a good neighbour They said He that stopped and helped Jesus said You go and act the same way

The United States of America is a country on the continent of North America It is made up of 50 states and a federal district After the United States was on the winning side of two World Wars it became one of the worlds superpowers It is famous for its influence over finance trade culture military politics and technology

In the United States of America there are 50 states Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine MarylandMassachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington West Virginia Wisconsin and Wyoming

The United States is a federal republic The federal government is set up by the Constitution There are three branches of government They are the executive branch the legislative branch and the judicial branch State governments work very much like the federal government

The executive branch is the part of the government that enforces the law Members of the US Electoral College elect a president who is the leader of the executive branch as well as the leader of the armed forces The president decides whether or not the bills that the Legislative branch passes will become laws and the President may veto any bill The President may also make executive orders to ensure that people follow the law Two of the most famous executive orders were President Abraham Lincolns Emancipation Proclamation and President Dwight D Eisenhowers order to send 1200 soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division to allow the Little Rock Nine into a school that refused to admit African Americans students The president is in charge of many departments that control much of the day to day business of government For example Department of Commerce makes rules about trade and business The president chooses the heads of these departments and also nominates judges at the federal level However the Senate part of the legislative branch must agree with all of the people the president chooses The president may serve two 4 year terms

The legislative branch is the part of the government that makes laws The legislative branch is called Congress Congress is divided into two houses

One house is the House of Representatives The House of Representatives is made up of Representatives who are each elected by voters from an set area within a state The number of Representatives a state has is based on how many people live there the more people a state has the more representatives it gets Every 10 years the US Census Bureau conducts a census or count of the population of the United States States gain or lose Representatives based on their total population as shown by the census Representatives serve two year terms The total number of representatives today is 435 The leader of the House of Representatives is the Speaker of the House who is also the person who would become president if the president or vice president were unable to serve

The other house is the Senate In the Senate each state is represented equally by two senators Because there are 50 states there are 100 senators Before the President makes treaties or appoints officials the Senate must approve them Senators serve six year terms The Vice President of the United States serves as president of the Senate but may only cast votes in order to break a tie vote In practice the vice president is usually absent from the Senate and a senator is selected to serve as president pro tempore or temporary president of the Senate

Representatives and senators propose laws called bills in their respective houses A bill may be voted upon by the entire house right away or may first go to a small group of members of that house known as a committee which may recommend a bill for a vote by the whole house If one house votes to pass a bill the bill then gets sent to the other house if both houses vote for it it is then sent to the president who may sign the bill into law or veto it If the president vetoes the bill it is sent back to Congress If Congress votes again and passes the bill with at least a two thirds majority the bill becomes law and cannot be vetoed by the president

Under the American system of federalism Congress may not make laws that directly control the states instead Congress may use the promise of federal funds or extenuating circumstances such as national emergencies to encourage the states to follow federal law This system is both complex and unique

The Judicial Branch is the part of government that interprets what the law means The Judicial Branch is made up of the Supreme Court and many lower courts If the Supreme Court decides that a law is not allowed by the Constitution the law is said to be struck down and is no longer a valid law The Supreme Court is made up of nine judges called justices who are nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate One of these justices called the chief justice heads the court A Supreme Court justice serves until he or she dies or resigns When that happens the president nominates someone new to replace the justice who left If the Senate agrees with that choice the person becomes a justice If the Senate does not agree with the presidents choice then the president must nominate someone else

Famous court cases such as Marbury v Madison have firmly established that the Supreme Court is the ultimate interpreter of the United States Constitution and has the power to strike down any law that conflicts with it 

The United States of America consists of 50 states 5 territories and 1 district States can make laws about things inside the state but federal law is usually about things dealing with more than one state or dealing with other countries In some areas if the federal government makes laws that say different things from the state laws people only have to follow the federal governments law because the state law is not a law any more Each state has a constitution of its own different from the federal Constitution Each one of these is like the federal Constitution because they talk about how each states government is set up but some also talk about specific laws

The federal and a lot of state governments are dominated today by two groups of politicians the Republicans and the Democrats although other people can sometimes be elected too like people from the Green Party or the Constitution Party The two main parties get support from different people and businesses who give money to the parties Since people give money to the politicians the politicians must listen those peoples opinions This is called lobbying All Americans are allowed to lobby the government but when small groups have a lot of money they are better at lobbying Some people think that this is a problem and want rules to be made to change this

Since 2009 the president is a Democrat so Democrats have slightly more power in the federal government However there are still many powerful Republicans who can try to stop the Democrats from doing things that they believe will be bad for the country Also the Democrats do not always agree with each other on what to do And if enough people decide to vote against Democrats in the next election then they will lose power In a republic like the United States no party can do whatever they want All politicians have to argue compromise and make deals with each other to get things done They have to answer to the people and take responsibility for their mistakes

The USAs large cultural economic and military influence has made foreign relations or relations with other countries an especially important topic in American politics and the politics of many other countries

The United States has grown from 13 states in 1776 to 50 states and 1 district today The country grew from East to West It conquered and bought lands

The states are divided into counties Two states do not use the word county Louisiana uses the word parish Alaska uses the word borough

The United States also consists of several other lands that are not states Most of these are colonial territories and are not a part of the Mainland US Some examples are

The United States also includes one federal district that was split from a state

The Philippines was once a possession of the United States and before that it was a possession of Spain Now the Philippines is an independent country Palau the Federated States of Micronesia and other Pacific island nations were once governed by the United States as a United Nations Trust Territory but are now independent

The US military has bases in many countries The US Naval base at Guantanamo Bay was rented from Cuba even after that country had a Communist revolution

The United States is the third biggest country in the world Its geography varies a lot and includes

The climate varies along with the geography from tropical in Florida to tundra in Alaska Large parts of the country have warm summers and cold winters Some parts of the United States like parts of California have a Mediterranean climate

The United States has a capitalist economy The country has low unemployment and inflation and a large trade deficit 

The country has rich mineral resources with many gold oil coal and uranium deposits Farming makes the country among the top producers of among others corn wheat sugar and tobacco American produces cars airplanes and electronics About 34 of Americans work in the service industry

The top 15 trading partners in terms of total trade are

11 of the people in the United States are foreign born 18 speak a language other than English at home For people 25 and older 80 have are high school graduates while 25 have a bachelors degree or higher

The 2000 Census counted self reported ancestry It identified 43 million German Americans 305 million Irish Americans 249 million African Americans 245 million English Americans and 184 million Mexican Americans

The social structure of the United States has a big range This means that some Americans are much much richer than others The average income for an American was 37000 a year in 2002 However the richest 1 of Americans have as much money as the poorest 90 51 of all households have access to a computer and 41 had access to the Internet in 2000 a figure which had grown to 75 in 2004 Globally less than one percent of people own a computer Furthermore 679 of American families owned their homes in 2002 In addition there are 200 million cars in the United States two for every three Americans and roughly one third of all cars in the world The debt has grown to over 13000000000000

The level of Christianity in the US has gone down 862 called themselves Christian in 1990 and 765 said this in 2001  However the United States is still one of the most religious countries in the Western World and the most religious country where most people are not Catholic Unlike most other Protestant countries most Americans believe in God  The religious memberships in 2001 were Protestant 52 Catholic 245 none 132 2 Buddhist Jewish 13 and 05 03 for Muslim Agnostic Atheist Hindu and Unitarian Universalist There is a large difference between those who say that they belong to a religion and those who are members of a church of that religion show that church membership in 2001 was 53 Christian 23 Jewish and 01 Muslim others lower

The United States does not currently have an official language although the United States Congress has considered officially designating English as such for many years since it is the most used language and the language in which the United States Declaration of Independence and United States Constitution are written Spanish has increased in usage in certain sectors of society due to a flow of immigrantsespecially from Mexico and Cuba French is also a main language in parts of Louisiana because France once owned the area

American popular culture goes out to many places in the world It has a large influence on most of the world especially the Western world American music is heard all over the world and American movies and television shows can be seen in most countries 

The American flag is made up of 50 stars on a blue background and has 13 stripes 7 red and 6 white The 50 stars represent the 50 states The red stands for courage The blue stands for justice The white represents peace and cleanness The 13 stripes represent the 13 original colonies

Canada is the second largest country in the world in land area after Russia It has the longest border with water of any country in the world It is next to the Pacific Arctic and Atlantic Oceans 

Around formatnumexpr round 1 million people live in Canadas ten provinces and three territories with the majority living in the southern sections of Canada This is almost the same number as in the US State of California

Canada has six time zones It extends from the west coast across the prairies and central Canada to the Atlantic provinces In the north there are three territories stretching between Alaska and Greenland Four of the five Great Lakes are shared between Canada and the United States and they make up 16 of the Earths fresh water The St Lawrence Seaway joins the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean allowing ocean going vessels to travel as far inland as Thunder Bay in Ontario Canada

Canada shares land and sea borders with the USA Denmark and France

The geography of Canada is very different from place to place from high alpine areas in the west flat grasslands and prairies in the centre and ancient shield rocks in the east Canada contains some of the very last untouched boreal forest in the world

The Canadian or Laurentian Shield is a vast area of ancient pre cambrian rocks lying in an arc around Hudson Bay covering more than one third of Canadas land area This is a unique land of lakes bogs swamps trees and rocks It is a terrain that is very dangerous and difficult to traverse cross country because of rivers lakes bogs steep cliffs and muskeg

Native people lived in what is now Canada for thousands of years before the first Europeans arrived They are known as the First Nations and the Inuit people The Mtis have part First Nations and part European backgrounds

The Vikings were the first Europeans known to land in Canada in what is now Newfoundland led by the Viking explorer Lief Erikson They did not stay there long however In the early 16th century Europeans started exploring Canadas eastern coast beginning with John Cabot from England in 1497 and later Jacques Cartier in 1534 from France Alexander Mackenzie later reached the Pacific coast over land where captains James Cook and George Vancouver went by sea The Europeans also traded beaver furs to the First Nations

Parts of Canada were settled by France and parts by England and Scotland In 1605 Port Royal was built in Acadia by the French led by Samuel de Champlain and in 1608 he started settling Quebec The British took control of the French areas after a battle on the Plains of Abraham near Quebec City in 1759

After the American Revolutionary War many people in the new United States wanted to stay loyal to Britain Thousands came north to Canada and settled in Nova Scotia New Brunswick Quebec and Ontario They were called United Empire Loyalists During the War of 1812 the United States tried to conquer Canada but were defeated

On July 1 1867 Canada was united under a federal government It included the provinces of Ontario Quebec New Brunswick and Nova Scotia Sir John A Macdonald was the first prime minister Manitoba the Yukon territory and the Northwest Territories became part of Canada in 1870 British Columbia joined in 1871 and Prince Edward Island in 1873

There were two Red River Rebellions in 1869 70 and 1885 both led by Louis Riel He fought for more rights for the Mtis people a mix between French and First Nations A railroad across the country the Canadian Pacific Railway finished in 1885 made it easier for Canadians to move to the west Many Europeans came to the prairies so Alberta and Saskatchewan became provinces in 1905

Canadian soldiers fought in World War I for the British Empire More Canadians died in this war than any other war Canada became better known as a country after its success in capturing Vimy Ridge from the Germans in France in 1917 Women were given the right to vote by the end of the war partly because of the help they gave making weapons while the men fought in Europe In 1931 Canada became fully independent From 1931 on the Government of Canada made all decisions about Canada

Canadians also fought in World War II The Dieppe Raid in 1942 went very badly and most of the soldiers were killed wounded or taken prisoner Canadians were important in 1944 at Normandy and they liberated the Netherlands

In 1949 Newfoundland and Labrador became the 10th province of Canada In 1956 Canadian Lester Pearson who later became prime minister helped end the Suez Crisis As a result he won the Nobel Peace Prize In 1965 Pearson helped Canada get a new flag the Maple Leaf Before that Canadians had used the Red Ensign In 1982 Canada changed its constitution including a new Charter of Rights and Freedoms The main part of the Constitution is still the 1867 British North America Act

Many French Canadians today wish to form their own country separate from the rest of Canada The province of Quebec held a referendum in 1980 but only about 40 wanted to separate Another referendum was held in 1995 with almost 50 voting in favor of leaving Canada

Today about 25 of Canadians speak French as their first language Many people can speak both French and English Although most French Canadians live in the province of Quebec there are French speaking communities and people all across Canada For example 40 of the people in the province of New Brunswick and 20 of those in Manitoba have a strong French background as do some people in Ontario mainly along its border with Quebec

In 1999 Nunavut was created as Canadas third territory out of the eastern Northwest Territories in an agreement with the Inuit people

A large number of immigrants from almost every part of the world come to live in Canada Canada has a greater mix of people with different backgrounds than almost anywhere on Earth after Australia One example is the former Governor General of Canada Michalle Jean who came to Canada as a young child with her family from Haiti in 1968

Ottawa is the capital of Canada The current head of government the prime minister is Stephen Harper who replaced Paul Martin Jr in January of 2006 Each province and territory has a premier to lead its government

Canada has a government called a constitutional monarchy It has a monarch and is a democracy The head of state is Queen Elizabeth II who is officially the Queen of Canada She appoints a Governor General to represent her in the country however the choice of Governor General is made by the prime minister

The Queens powers are mostly exercised by the Governor General The Governor General like the Canadian sovereign is not political and remains above politics and because of that they do not usually use their powers without the advice of ministers

The Parliament of Canada passes the laws of the country The king or queen has the right to veto a law but this right has not been used for some time The day to day operations of the government are run by the cabinet The cabinet is usually formed from the largest party in Parliament

Many people from other parts of the world think of Canada as a very cold and snowy place While it is true that much of Canada is very far north most Canadians live in the southern parts where the weather is much milder Nearly two Canadians in three live less than convert100kmmi from the US border In some cities the temperature can get very cold in the winter especially inland Warm air systems moving in from the Pacific Ocean bring more rain than snow to the Pacific coast while colder temperatures further inland do result in snow Most of Canada can get quite hot in the summer often over 30 degrees Celsius

Canadians are known to play winter sports such as ice hockey and skiing and snowboarding and also enjoy many summer sports and games

Canada has lots of natural resources Its large amounts of fish have been used for centuries for food and money Hydroelectric power is abundant because of Canadas many rivers Forests of the west are used for wood Besides these renewable resources Canada has metal ores and oil deposits

Islam is a religion whose holy book is called the Quran People who follow Islam are called Muslims Muslims believe that there is only one god who is called Allah in the Arabic language In English Allah can be called God or by one of many other names

Muslims also believe that Muhammad was the last of many prophets from God They believe that the Quran is the exact word of God as revealed to Muhammad Muslims also call Muhammad a messenger of God

After Muhammad died Muslims wrote down stories about what he had said and done Muslims call these stories Hadith Muslim scholars collected all of these Hadith in books and compared them to each other They decided which Hadith were most likely to be true records of the Sunnah that is the words and actions of Muhammad Muslims see the Sunnah as an important source of guidance along with the Quran Islam has rules based on the Quran and the Sunnah These laws are called Sharia Muslim lawyers have studied Sharia and written down their ideas about how to judge different cases These ideas about Sharia are called Fiqh

The word Islam literally translates in English to becoming peaceful acceptance submission self surrender Comes from the word Slam meaning peace Muslims believe that the ummah are all brothers and sisters of Islam and should be treated with utmost respect

According to Islamic Tradition there are five basic things that Muslims should do They are called The Five Pillars of Islam

The Quran is the holy book of Islam Muslims believe the Quran is the sayings of God 

Islam teaches that the Quran was revealed by God to Muhammad with the help of an angel called Jibril The Quraan teaches the Muslims to follow the right path by only doing good to please God alone The Muslims believe that if they do good in this life time without being indulged with sinful acts and behaviours will certainly go to JannahQuran has a total of 114 chapters In each chapter there are many verses Many Muslims try to memorize the entire Quran and ones who do are called a Hafiz or Hafez

Other important books are the Sunnah or biographies of Muhammad and Hadith compilations which are collections of sayings attributed to Muhammad

Muslims pray in a place of worship called the mosque The Muslims place of worship is properly known as a masjid in Arabic Most masjids have at least one dome and some have one or more towers But a masjid does not need to have a dome or tower Muslims take their shoes off before entering the masjid to pray Prayer is one of the most important things that a Muslim does

The Muslim is called to prayer five times a day This call to prayer is called Adhan The muezzin a man appointed to call to prayer uses a loud speaker which carries the voice for the people nearby This is often done out loud publicly in Muslim countries

Sometimes Muslims pray on a carpet which is called prayer carpet or prayer rug in English Common Arabic names include sajjda and namazlk At the times of prayer they will determine the direction of Qibla roll out their prayer carpet and say their prayers to God

In 2009 a study was done in 232 countries and territories This study found that 23 of the global population or 157 billion people are Muslims Of those between 75 and 90 are Sunni and between ten and twenty percent are Shia A small minority belong to other Islamic sects In approximately fifty countries the majority of people are Muslims Arabs account for around twenty percent of all Muslims worldwide

The majority of Muslims live in Asia and Africa Approximately 62 of the worlds Muslims live in Asia with over 683 million followers in Indonesia Pakistan India and Bangladesh In the Middle East non Arab countries such as Turkey and Iran are the largest Muslim majority countries in Africa Egypt and Nigeria have the most populous Muslim communities

Most estimates indicate that the Peoples Republic of China has approximately 20 to 30 million Muslims However data provided by the San Diego State Universitys International Population Center to US News World Report suggests that China has 653 million Muslims Islam is the second largest religion after Christianity in many European countries and is slowly catching up to that status in the Americas

Like with other religions over the time different movements have developed in Islam These movements are based on different interpretations of the scriptures The following sections list the most common movements 

Sunni Islam is the largest movement in Islam After Muhammad died the Sunnis believed that Abu Bakr should lead Islam This is because they believe leaders of Islam should be chosen by the consensus of the Ummah the Muslim world After he died Omar took his place then Osman and then Ali All of them were companions of the Prophet Muhammad and lived in Medina Sunni beliefs are usually based on the Quran and the Sunnah

The Shia are the second biggest movement in Islam They believe that just as only God can appoint a prophet he can appoint a second leader after the prophet Shia Muslims believe that God chose Ali as the leader after Prophet Muhammad They say that before he died Muhammad chose Ali as his replacement 10 20 of Muslims in the world are Shia which means that there are about 130 million to 190 million world wide Although Shia is not the biggest movement in Islam Shia Muslims have the largest population in Iran Azerbaijan Bahrain IraqKuwait Lebanon Syria Afghanistan Pakistan Saudia Arabia Yemen Turkey 11 million and India 56 million

The Sufi are not a movement like the Sunni or the Shia They focus more on the spiritual and mystic elements of Islam Some followers of Sufism are Sunni others are Shia

The movements listed above are not the only Islamic movements although almost all Muslims are a part of them Other Muslim movements include Ahmadiyya and Ibadism

Islam has been widely criticised Some of the first people who criticised Islam in writing were Christians like John of Damascus In the medieval period some Arab philosophers like the poet Al Maarri also criticised Islam The Jewish philosopher Maimonides compared Islamic views of morality to the Jewish approach that he himself believed in He believed that Islam was a copy of the Jewish and Christian religions with a few minor changes He thought these changes were made to suit Muhammads desire for fame and his quest to start a new religion He thought Muhammad wanted to be seen as equal to the likes of Moses and Jesus Medieval Christian writers thought that Islamic beliefs were not valid They tried to show Muhammad was possessed by Satan In the 19th century the Orientalist scholar William Muir wrote harshly about the Quran

In modern times critics also say that Islam does not tolerate the view that parts of Islamic law may be too harsh Other critics see Muhammads personal life negatively Still others question how authentic the Quran is and if it can impose moral guidelines These reports also say that women and animals may be treated badly by Islamic law and practice

Some people have responded to these forms of criticism Montgomery Watt and Norman Daniel say that some of the criticisms are the product of old myths and prejudice Carl Ernst writes that Islamophobia has played a part in establishing what he calls myths  Removed as I was unable to find that reference Eptalon 24208

Muslim scholars like Muhammad Mohar Ali argue against claims of discrepancies in the Quran and allegations that Muhammad was unduly influenced by Judeo Christian tradition  

Judaism is the religion of the worlds approximately 15 million Jews It is one of the oldest religions and the first monotheistic religion to teach the belief in one God Both Christianity and Islam have similarities with Judaism These religions accept the belief in one God and the moral teachings of the Hebrew Bible

The basic laws and teachings of Judaism come from the Torah the first five books of the Hebrew Bible These are taught in both written and oral traditions 

The Hebrew Bible is the most important holy book of Judaism It is a collection of writings called the Tanakh in Hebrew It is divided into three parts  Torah Neviim and Ketuvim 

The most important teaching of Judaism is that there is one God who wants people to do what is just and compassionate Judaism teaches that a person serves God by studying the holy writings and doing what they teach These teachings include both ritual practices and ethical laws Judaism teaches that all people are created in the image of God and deserve to be treated with dignity and respect

The covenant with God is an agreement that Jews believe God made with Abraham the ancestor of the Jewish people According to the Bible God promised to bless Abraham and his descendants if they worshiped God and were faithful to Him God made this covenant with Abrahams son Isaac and Isaacs son Jacob Jacob was also called Israel and so his descendants were known as the Children of Israel or the Israelites God later gave the Israelites the Ten Commandments and other laws through their leader Moses These laws told the Israelites how to live their lives and build their community 

The Jews are sometimes called the Chosen People meaning that they have special duties and responsibilities commanded by God For example the Jews must establish a just society and serve only God Thus the covenant assures the Jews of Gods love and protection but it also makes them accountable for their sins and shortcomings 

Judaism does not try to convince others to accept its beliefs and practices But it does accept people who choose to convert to Judaism 

Jews believed that God would send a Messiah to save them The word Messiah comes from the Hebrew word mashiah which means the anointed one The Book of Isaiah describes the Messiah as a just ruler who will unite the Jewish people and lead them in Gods way The Messiah will fix wrongs and defeat the enemies of the people 

Many Jews still expect a Messiah to come but others speak instead of a Messianic time of world peace They believe a time of justice and peace will come through the cooperation of all people and the help of God

Maimonides was a famous Jewish teacher of the 12th century He made a list of 13 principles that include the basic beliefs of Judaism

The two most important groups of books in Judaism are the Bible and the Talmud The beliefs and rituals of Judaism come from these books Later Jewish teachers and scholars wrote more books called commentaries which explain and say more about the teachings of the Bible and Talmud 

The Torah is the most important of all Jewish writings The first five books of the Hebrew Bible make up the Torah The Torah contains the basic laws of Judaism and describes the history of the Jews until the death of Moses Jewish tradition says that God told Moses what to write in the Torah which is also called the Five Books of Moses 

Jews divide the Bible into three parts and call it the Tanakh The three parts are the Torah which is the first five books the Neviim which are the books of the prophets and the Ketuvim meaning the Writings which are other books of history and moral teachings

There are various important actions in Judaism These are called mitzvot A mitzvah is a commandment from God to the Jewish people The word mitzvah means commandment in Hebrew but perhaps based on common Yiddish usage many people think of a mitzvah as a good deed or a good thing to do Traditionally Jews believe that the Torah specifies mitzvot for all people all of mankind must keep seven laws as taught to Noah and his children after the flood The Jews must keep 613 mitzvot which are listed in the Torah Some mitzvot are for everyday life and some are observed only at special times such as on Jewish holidays Many of these 613 commandments relate to the Holy Temple in Jerusalem and therefore cannot be done since the Temple was destroyed

Religious Jews believe that Moses brought the Ten Commandments and the Torah down from Mount Sinai Rabbinic Jews also believe that there is another part of the Torah besides the 5 books of Moses It is called the Mishnah also called the Oral Torah or Oral Law It explains how to follow the laws written in the 5 books There is a commentary of the Mishnah called the Gemara Together the Mishna and the Gemara make up the Talmud Karaite Jews however believe that there is no additional Torah besides the 5 books of Moses

Traditional Jews believe that God gave the written Torah and the oral Torah to Moses and that Moses told it to the Jewish people and that it is the same today as it was back then Traditional Jews also believe that all of the commandments must still be followed today

Liberal Jews believe that the Torah was inspired by God but written by human beings Liberal Jews believe that all of the ethical laws in the Torah must still be followed but many ritual laws do not need to be followed today 

It is considered good in Judaism to talk about the commandments and to try to understand how to follow them The Talmud has many stories about Rabbis who argued about the commandments Over time some opinions have become the rule for everyone Some rules are still being argued about

There is no single leader of Judaism who can decide how to follow the commandments or what to believe Even though Jews believe different things and they disagree about the rules they are still one religion and one people

The Ten Commandments are special because they were heard by all of the Jewish people at Mount Sinai However in traditional Judaism all of the 613 mitzvot in the Torah are equally important

The Ten Commandments are

One of the commandments is to keep the Jewish Sabbath or Shabbat Shabbat starts every Friday at sunset and ends on Saturday at sunset Shabbat is a day of rest to thank God for making the Earth

The tradition of resting on Shabbat comes from the Torah According to the Torah God created the world in six days and on the seventh day Shabbat He rested Many Jews go to their temple or synagogue to pray on Shabbat

Religious Jews follow special rules on Shabbat These rules require Jews not to do creative work on Shabbat One reason for this is to remind people that God is the creator and ruler of the world no matter how great a persons creative power is it cannot compare with Gods creation of the universe and everything in it Many of these categories of creative work include actions that people might not think of as work For instance on Shabbat a Jew cannot

Traditional Jews are very careful about Shabbat It is a special day Everyone walks to the synagogue They say extra prayers No one goes far from home People visit friends They invite guests for dinner and for lunch People study Judaism together

Liberal Jews do not follow all of the same rules They go to synagogue and visit friends and have special meals But they may also drive cars go shopping and use electricity

Jews who follow the religious rules called kashrut only eat some types of food that are prepared by special rules Food that a Jew can eat is called kosher food

Traditional Jews are very careful about kashrut They usually can not eat in non kosher restaurants or in the home of someone who does not keep kosher Sometimes this makes it hard to visit people or to do business It is important to understand that this is part of their religion

Liberal Jews may or may not keep kosher It is best to ask them individually

There are other rules for kosher food as well

For a very long time all Jews believed the same basic things about Judaism About 200 years ago a small group of Jews in Germany decided to stop believing in many parts of Judaism and try to become more modern and more like Germans Those Jews were called Reform Jews

Today there are three main kinds of Judaism Reform Conservative and Orthodox Judaism There are also kinds with a smaller number of people such as Reconstructionist Judaism and Karaite Judaism Each group has its own practices according to how it understands the Jewish laws Some do not believe in keeping most of the laws For example Reform Judaism does not require eating kosher food or keeping the Sabbath at all Reform Judaism teaches Jews to focus on the ethical laws of Judaism Conservative Judaism developed after Reform Judaism The leaders of Conservative Judaism felt that Reform Judaism was too radical They wanted to conserve Jewish tradition instead of reforming it Orthodox Jews do not believe that Reform or Conservative Judaism are correct because they change too many things in ways that are not allowed 

In the most recent survey of Jews in the United States in 2000 2001 it was found that 35 of American Jews say they are Reform 27 say they are Conservative 10 say they are Orthodox 2 say they are Reconstructionist and 25 do not say what type they are 

In Israel almost all Jews go to Orthodox synagogues There are very few Reform or Conservative synagogues In Israel Jews do not call themselves Reform Conservative or Orthodox Instead they mostly call themselves Haredi Dati Masorati or Chiloni Surveys suggest that about 20 of Israelis say they are secular 25 say they are Dati or Haredi and 55 say they are traditional

Names are very important in Judaism Many Jews believe that a name not only tells you who someone is but also tells you something about them Names of God are very special in Judaism so Jews do not write them or speak them fully but use other words instead That is why some Jews write G d with a  instead of an o

HaShem Means The Name It is the word Jews use most often when not praying to talk about God

Adonai means My Lord This name tells Jews about Gods position God is the King of the World and his name Adonai lets us know that

Elohim means one who is strong enough to do everything This name is used when talking about Gods power to create or Gods justice This tells us that God is the creator and that God rules the world with just laws

The two names above are so special that Orthodox Jews use these names only when they pray and read the Torah When they are not praying or reading the Torah they say Hashem or Elokim

God  Some Jews write God by replacing the o with a dash like this G d They do this because Gods name is so holy they are not allowed to throw away a piece of paper with God written on it However if by accident God is written then the paper can be disposed of in a special way and buried in a special place Others say that God is just an English word not Hebrew and so it is not holy

YHWH is the most sacred name of God in Hebrew and is not pronounced by most Jews No one knows where the name came from or what exactly it means It looks like the Hebrew word hayah which is the verb to be Jews believe that the name YHWH shows that God is endless Instead of trying to say it most Jews say haShem which means The Name Some people pronounce this name as Yahweh or Jehovah Scholars of religion sometimes refer to YHWH as the Tetragrammaton from Greek words meaning four letters

The Jewish scriptures say that Judaism began with a man named Abram who lived in the city of Ur According to the Midrash Abram strongly believed that the people in Ur were wrong to pray to different gods and statues He believed that there was really only one god who was not a statue The Torah tells that God spoke to Abram and told him to leave Ur with his family and move to Canaan were he started a new religion God told him that his name would be changed to Abraham The Midrash also says that angels taught Abraham a new holy language which Jews believe is the language today known as Hebrew Hebrew continues to be the language of Judaism Abrahams grandson Jacob is said to be the one who first had the name of Israel

According to the Torah at one time the Hebrew people moved to Egypt because of famine in Canaan The 12 tribes sold everything that they had to Egypt because Pharaoh had what Israel lacked In the end they sold them selfs into slavery Pharaoh agreed and eventually the famine ended but the tribes where bound to slavery Later God told Moses that he would be a ambassador to God and plead the case to free the 12 tribes of Israel Pharaoh said No time and again and each time he did God sent many terrible punishments to the Egyptians to make him to free the Hebrews Finally the Pharaoh let the Hebrews go free but then decided to send the Egyptian army after them The Hebrews escaped when God made the waters of the Red Sea open a path for them The waters then returned and drowned the Egyptian army The Torah says that after this Moses met with God on Mount Sinai and received the Ten Commandments and the Torah from God

The Hebrews or Israelites in twelve tribes began a country called Israel in Caanan They fought many wars against other peoples in the area The name Jew comes from the name of one of these tribes Judah

Later this country broke apart into two kingdoms Israel and Judah Israel was conquered by Assyria in the 8th century BC and the people were taken away Later Judah was conquered by Babylonia in the early 6th century BC and its people were taken captive to Babylon They were allowed to go back to Judah again when Babylon was conquered by Persia Some Jewish people stayed in Babylon and others also lived in other countries

By 50 BC Judah was ruled by the Roman Empire During this time the main language of Judea was Aramaic The Jews did not like the Roman government or customs and often made trouble for the Romans In 70 AD after a revolt against the government by the Jewish community the Romans destroyed Judeas capital city Jerusalem and sent almost all Jews into exile

After this the Jewish people did not have their own country They were a small minority in almost every place they lived This time is called the Diaspora when Jews spread around the world They lived in many other countries Jews living in Spain and Portugal used the language Ladino Jews living in Germany Poland and Russia used the language Yiddish Jews living in North Africa spoke Judeo Arabic or Haketia the local name for Ladino Jews have lived in most but not all places in the world including India China Yemen and Ethiopia Even today Jews who do not live in Israel are often said to live in the Diaspora In some places like India Jews lived without any problems In other places like most of Europe and Islamic countries there was bigotry or even hatred against Jews and they lived under unfair laws Sometimes Jews suffered from outright persecution sometimes they were forced to dress in special ugly clothes pay higher taxes than others not build higher houses than others not to ride a horse or donkey wear certain badges etc But Jews were known as skillful bankers In Europe where the Roman Catholic church forbade Christians from lending money against interest Jews worked as bankers and money lenders

One nomad nation the Khazars converted to Judaism in the 8th century The Khazar khanate which was in the modern Ukraine and Byelorussia was the only independent Jewish state before modern day Israel The Khazar state was destroyed by the Eastern Vikings in 987

The Jewish People have always believed that they have a special mission from God They do things in their own ways such as having special rules about food and eating not working on the Shabbat keeping their own holidays and not marrying people from other religions Because of this people in many different times and countries have thought that the Jews were strange and maybe dangerous Many countries made laws that the Jews could not work in some jobs or live in some places Sometimes Jewish people were killed because of their religion The word antisemitism describes the hatred for Jews

During the 1930s and 1940s the Nazi or National Socialist government of Germany conquered most of Europe They did terrible things to the Jewish people because they believed they were responsible for the problems in Germany during and after the First World War The Nazi government killed more than six million Jewish people Before they were killed many of the Jews were made to be slaves and some of them were forced to help in the killing and slavery of the others

In 1948 after World War II the United Nations made the country of Israel for the Jews in Palestine which is in the same place as the original Israel in the Middle East The land had been part of the Ottoman Empire before World War I Then Britain controlled the area under the oversight of the United Nations Many Jews moved back to Israel then called Palestine starting in the late 1800s When the country of Israel was made in 1948 there were about 600000 Jews in it Today there are about 5600000 Jews in it 

When Jews moved back to Palestine there were people living there Most of them did not want to live in a Jewish country This was the beginning of the Israeli Arab or Israeli Palestinian conflict which continues today

Jews have come to Israel from all over the world bringing different languages music food and history to create a unique culture Israel is the only country in the world where most people are Jews and where Hebrew is the main language

Jewish history continues today in both Israel and the Diaspora Outside of Israel there are many Jews in the United States Great Britain Canada France Russia the Uktraine Germany Argentina Brazil South Africa and Australia There are smaller numbers of Jews living in other parts of the world 

Some of the major problems faced by the Jewish people today include resolving the Israeli Palestinian conflict and dealing with high rates of assimilation in some countries like the United States

Many famous people have been Jewish or have come from Jewish families

Some famous people from Jewish backgrounds are

Christianity is a religion that believes there is only one God Christianity is based on the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth Jesus was killed by being nailed to a cross under Pontius Pilate the local Roman governor at the time The New Testament a section of a book known as the Bible tells about Jesus Many Christians see the Bible both the Old Testament and New Testament as sacred People who believe in Christianity are called Christians They believe in one God and they also believe that Jesus was born the Son of God and the Messiah Christians believe that Jesus birth was foretold in the Old Testament Christians think of Jesus Christ as a teacher an example of how to live and a revealer of what the Christian God teaches Christians also believe that Jesus is the saviour of all people According to Christian belief Jesus suffered died and was raised from the dead to save people from sin They believe that Jesus went up into heaven Most Christian groups believe that Jesus will come back to Earth and judge everybody both alive and dead giving everlasting life to certain Christians Christians call the message of Jesus Christ the Gospel or The Good News The first four books of New Testament are called the gospels because of this

Just like Judaism and Islam Christianity is an Abrahamic religion Christianity started out as a Jewish sect in the eastern Mediterranean It quickly grew in number of believers and influence over a few decades and by the 4th century had become the dominant religion in the Roman Empire During the Middle Ages the rest of Europe mostly was Christianized At that time Christians were mostly a religious minority in the Middle East North Africa and parts of India Following the Age of Discovery through missionary work and colonization Christianity spread to the Americas and the rest of the world 

Christianity has been an important part of the shaping of Western civilization at least since the 4th century As of the early 21st century Christianity has has approximately 22 billion followers which is about a third of all people of Earth

Worship is thought by most Christians to be a very important part of Christianity all through its history Many Christian theologians have called humanity homo adorans which means worshipping man and so the worship of God is at the very center of what it means to be human This would mean that because God created all humanity then Christians should worship and give praise to God

In Catholic belief and practice a sacrament is a religious symbol or often a rite which shows divine grace blessing or sanctity for the Christian who does it Examples of sacraments would be Baptism and the Mass The word is taken from the Latin word sacramentum which was used to translate the Greek word for mystery

The two most regularly used sacraments are Baptism and Eucharist Most Catholics use seven Sacraments Baptism the ritual immersion of a candidate to welcome them into the church Confirmation the sealing of the Covenant the Eucharist a ritual where consecrated bread and wine representing Jesus body and blood are consumed Holy Orders Reconciliation of a Penitent Anointing of the Sick and Marriage Some Christian denominations prefer to call them ordinances These are the Orders from Christ to all believers found in the New Testament

Roman Catholics Anglicans Eastern Christians and traditional Protestant groups center their worship around a liturgical calendar Some events that are part of this calendar are the holy days such as solemnities which honor an event in the life of Jesus or the saints times of fasting such as Lent and other events such as memoria Christian groups that do not follow a liturgical tradition often keep some celebrations such as Christmas Easterand Pentecost A few churches do not use a liturgical calendar

Even though Christians have many differences of beliefs and opinions they share some beliefs that they believe are very important to their faith

Creeds are direct doctrinal statements or confessions usually of religious beliefs They started as formulas used when someone was baptised During the Christological controversies of the 4th and 5th centuries they became statements of faith 

Some of the main Christian creeds are

Most Christians accept the use of creeds and often use at least one of the creeds given above A smaller number of Protestants notably Restorationists a movement formed in the wake of the Second Great Awakening in the 19th century of the 19th century United States oppose the use of creeds

The most basic part of Christianity is the belief in Jesus as the Son of God and Messiah The title Messiah comes from the Hebrew word meaning anointed one The Greek translation is the source of the English word Christ

Christians believe that as the Messiah Jesus was anointed by God as ruler and savior of all people Christians also believe that Jesus coming was the fulfillment of messianic prophecies of the Old Testament The Christian belief of the Messiah is much different than the contemporary Jewish concept The main Christian belief is that through the death and resurrection of Jesus sinful humans can be reconciled to God Through this they believe they are given salvation and the promise of eternal life

There have been many theological disagreements over the nature of Jesus over the first centuries of Christian history But Christians generally believe that Jesus is God incarnate and true God and true man Jesus having become fully human suffered the pain and temptations of a mortal man but he did not sin As fully God he defeated death and came back to life again According to the Bible God raised him from the dead he ascended to heaven is seated at the right hand of the Father and will return again to fulfill the rest of Messianic prophecy such as the Resurrection of the Dead the Last Judgment and the final creation of the Kingdom of God

The Matthew and the Luke say the Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born from the Virgin Mary Only little of Jesus childhood is written in the canonical Gospels but infancy Gospels were popular in antiquity However the time of Jesus adulthood the week before his death are written much about in the Gospels Some of the Biblical writings of Jesus ministry are his baptism miracles preaching teaching and deeds

Christians believe the resurrection of Jesus to be the main part of their faith and the most important event in human history because it would show that Jesus has power over death and has the authority to give people eternal life Among Christian beliefs the death and resurrection of Jesus are two main events of Christian doctrine and theology From what the New Testament says Jesus was crucified died a physical death was buried in a tomb and came back from the dead three days later The New Testament writes that several times Jesus appeared many times before his Twelve Apostles and disciples and one time before more than five hundred brethren at once before Jesus Ascension to heaven Jesus death and resurrection are remember by Christians in their worship services and most commonly during Holy Week which has Good Friday and Easter Sunday in the week 

Most Christian churches teach the New Testament description of the resurrection of Jesus Some liberal Christians do not accept that Jesus came back from the dead as they believe it to be a good symbolic and spiritual myth Arguments over the death and resurrection of Jesus are very common at many religious debates and interfaith dialogues Paul the Apostle an early Christian convert and missionary wrote If Christ was not raised then all our preaching is useless and your trust in God is useless The Unitarian church is one of the few denominations where the resurrection of Jesus is not taught

Protestantism teaches that eternal salvation is a gift that is given to a person by Gods grace It is sometimes called unmerited favor This would mean that Salvation is God bringing humans into a right relationship with God through faith in Jesus Christ It is the belief that one can be saved from sin and forever death Many Protestants believe in the assurance of salvationthat God can put confidence in a believer that he has truly received salvation from Jesus Christ

Catholicism teaches that although in most cases someone must be baptized a Catholic to be saved it is sometimes possible for people to be saved who have not fully joined the Catholic Church Catholics normally believe in the importance of works and sacraments in getting salvation The Catholic Church teaches that faith is important but it also believes that salvation also requires good works and piety such as obedience to commands taking the sacraments going to church doing penance and giving alms saying prayers and other things to receive eternal life

The formal study of theology of salvation is Soteriology

Different denominations and traditions of Christianity believe in forms divine grace Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy teach the complete importance of the free will to work together with grace Reformed theology teaches the importance of grace by teaching that a person is completely incapable of self redemption but the grace of God overcomes even the unwilling heart Arminianism believes in a synergistic view while Lutheran and most other Protestant denominations teach justification by grace through faith alone

Trinity is the teaching that God is three different beings the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit In the words of the Athanasian Creed the Father is God the Son is God and the Holy Spirit is God and yet there are not three Gods but one God There are some different ideas about the Trinity among others

Trinitarianism is the group of Christians who believe in the Trinity Today almost all Christian denominations and Churches believe this Nontrinitarianism is the beliefs systems that do not believe in the Trinity Many different nontrinitarian views such as adoptionism or modalism existed in early Christianity leading to the disputes about Christology

Christianity uses the Bible many canonical books in two parts the Old Testament and the New Testament It is believed by Christians that they were written by people who were inspired by the Holy Spirit and therefore it is most often believed to be the word of God There are some differences in Bible versions and editions throughout Christianity

Most Christians believe that human beings will receive judgement from God and are given either eternal life or eternal damnation This includes the Last Judgment as well as the belief of a judgement particular to the soul after death 

There are also some differences among Christians in this belief For example in Roman Catholicism those who die in a state of grace go into purgatory where they are cleansed before they can go into heaven Some churches for example Jehovah Witnesses believe that the soul sleeps

Christians believe that at the second coming of Christ at the end of time all who have died will be raised up from the dead for the Last Judgment when Jesus will establish the Kingdom of God There is also the belief of Universal Reconciliation That is the belief that all people will someday be saved an that hell is not forever Christians who believe in this view are known as Universalists

Christians have different ways to talk about the purpose of Jesus coming 

Other differences

People who call themselves Christians may show or live their faith in different ways They may also believe different things Through history the three main groups or denominations of Christianity have been the Orthodox the Catholic and the Protestant churches Not all Christians use these titles Some believe Christianity is bigger and includes others Some believe Christianity is smaller and does not include all these churches

Some of these groups could not agree on certain points about Christian teaching or practice The first split was in the 5th century after the Church Council of Ephesus There council agreed Nestorianism was wrong the Assyrian Church of the East did not agree and split from the rest The argument was about the nature of Jesus Should he be regarded as God and human in one combined nature or in two separated natures Most of the bishops following the Pope refused to stay in communion with any bishop who would not say two separated natures This was also discussed at the Council of Chalcedon about 50 years later The Christians who did not agree with the decision of the Council to excommunicate them became the Non Chalcedonian Orthodox The largest Non Chalcedonian Churches are the Coptic Orthodox in Egypt the Ethiopian Orthodox the Armenian and some Lebanese Orthodox Churches In general these churches are known as Oriental Orthodox Churches Recent discussions between the Roman Catholic Pope John Paul II and the Coptic Orthodox Pope Shenouda III concluded that they believe many of the same things after all even though the Coptic Church does not recognise the Pope of Rome as its leader 

The third split happened in the 11th century It is called the Great Schism It was mostly based on personal disagreements between the Bishops of Rome and Constantinople The disagreements were made worse because the two cultures often did not understand one another Also many Crusaders from Western Europe behaved badly The Christians in Western Europe were led by the Bishop of Rome known also as the Pope They are called the Catholic Church Most Christians in Eastern Europe Russia and the Middle East belong to the Orthodox Churches led by the Bishops of other cities or areas 

In the 15th century the invention of the printing press made it easier for more people to read and study the Bible This led many thinkers over the years to come up with new ideas and to break away from the Pope and his church They started the Protestant or Reformed churches Some Catholics and Orthodox do not consider Protestants to be fully Christian The most important Protestant leaders were Martin Luther and John Calvin Later some of these groups disagreed amongst themselves so that these denominations split again into smaller groups The main Protestant denominations today are the Baptist Lutheran and Calvinist Presbyterian Churches In England a similar protest against the Pope first political and later religious led to the Church of England which has bishops and officially calls itself Reformed Catholic but is often referred to as Protestant The Anglican communion of churches includes several churches called Episcopal or Episcopalian because they have bishops Some Anglican Churches have a style of worship that is closer to the Protestant services others worship more like Catholics but none of them accept the Pope or are accepted by him In general the Protestant denominations differ from the Catholic and Orthodox Churches in having given up some of the traditional sacraments having no ordained priesthood and not having the same fondness for Mary the mother of Jesus that the Catholic and Orthodox churches have

Protestants think it is more important that a person chooses to follow Jesus This is one of the main differences to the Catholic and the Orthodox Catholic and Orthodox Christians think that the ongoing growth in holiness that should take place over a persons lifetime is more important 

Most Christian worship has Scripture reading talk about Scripture from a leader singing prayer together and a small time for church work such as collecting money Christians may meet in special buildings also called churches or outdoors or at schools or anywhere Christians feel they are needed

The main worship service in Catholic Churches is the Mass and the main worship service in many Orthodox Churches is called the Divine Liturgy In both of these Churches along with the other parts of worship the Eucharist or Communion is central Here a priest by prayer asks God to change a small amount of bread and wine into what Catholics and Orthodox believe is Jesuss real body and blood but without changing the accidents of the bread and wine Then the people each may receive a portion Many Protestant churches have ceremonies more or less similar to the Mass some every week others a few times a year Some Protestants believe Jesus is really present at the Communion service and some believe the bread and wine are symbols to help them remember what Jesus did Other Protestant churches do not have Communion at all

Catholics have developed a short ceremony Eucharistic Benediction worshipping Jesus present in the Eucharist They also may visit a church building to pray in the presence of the Eucharist Eucharistic Adoration

Orthodox and Catholic spirituality place importance on the use of human senses such as sight and on the use of beautiful things Catholic spirituality often involves the use of statues and other artistic representations candles incense and other physical items as reminders or aids to prayer The Orthodox Churches also use candles incense bells and icons but not statues Orthodox and Catholic worship also makes use of movements such as the Sign of the Cross made by each person touching first the forehead then chest one shoulder then the other shoulder There is also bowing kneeling and prostration in Catholic and Orthodox worship

There are other denominations that do not fit into the three largest categories While some of these groups see themselves as Christian many of the other Christian groups do not agree that they are Christian All of these groups began after 1800 AD Most of them do not believe Jesus is God or do not believe in the Trinity or for other reasons do not believe what other Christians believe Some of the larger and more important of these are

One denomination which is Protestant is the Seventh day Adventist Church

Christianity has large history from the time of Jesus and his apostles to the present time Christianity began in the 1st century AD as a Jewish sect but quickly spread throughout the Greco Roman world Although it was originally persecuted under the Roman Empire it became the state religion in the end In the Middle Ages it spread into Northern Europe and Russia During the Age of Exploration Christianity expanded throughout the world and is now the largest religion of the world

The religion had schisms and theological disputes that had as result three main branches the Roman Catholic Church the Eastern Orthodox churches and Protestant churches

With an estimated number of Christians being somewhere around to 22 billion split into around 34000 different denominations Christianity is the worlds largest religion The Christian share of the worlds population has been around 33 for the last hundred years This has caused Christianity to spread throughout the world mainly in Europe and North America It is still the main religion of Europe the Americas the Philippines and Southern Africa However it is becoming smaller in some areas some of them are Oceania Northern Europe France Germany the Canadian provinces of Ontario British Columbia and Quebec the Western and Northern parts of the United States and parts of Asia

In most countries in the developed world the number of people going to church who claim to be Christians has been dropping over the last few decades Some believe that this is only because many no longer use regular membership in places for example churches while others believe it is because people may be thinking that religion is no longer important

Most churches have for a long time showed that they want to be tolerant with other belief systems and in the 20th century Christian ecumenism advanced in two ways One way was more cooperation between groups such as the Edinburgh Missionary Conference of Protestants in 1910 the Justice Peace and Creation Commission of the World Council of Churches started in 1948 by Protestant and Orthodox churches and similar national councils for example the National Council of Churches in Australia with Roman Catholics

The other way was creating unions for different churches to join together Congregationalist Methodist and Presbyterian churches joined together in 1925 to form the United Church of Canada and in 1977 to form the Uniting Church in Australia The Church of South India was formed in 1947 by the union of Anglican Methodist Congregationalist Presbyterian and Reformed churches And other such formations have been done by different Christian groups throughout the years

The Cryogenian is a geological period from 850 million years ago to 630mya It lies in the middle Proterozoic eon before the Ediacaran period

The period is important to both Earth science and biology because it contains the two longest and most severe ice ages of all time 

These two snowball earth events were previously considered together as the Varangian glaciation They covered much possible all the Earth with ice The root cause of the temperature drop may have been the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere by photosynthesising bacteria and eukaryotes in the previous periods Much else happened the supercontinent Rodinia broke up and another began to form Fossil steroids suggest the presence of early sponges and amoeboid cells with tests appear in the fossil record

Peri was born in Rome but studied in Florence He had several church jobs playing the organ and singing He also worked at the court of the Medici family playing instruments and composing incidental music for plays and madrigals

In the 1590s Peri worked for Jacopo Corsi the most important patron of music in Florence They felt that art at that time was not as good as the classical art that had been produced 2000 years ago in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome They wanted to write drama like the old Greek tragedies In music they started to write monody which meant a solo song with a continuo bass accompaniment They soon started to realize that just monody on its own could become boring so they developed it into recitative and aria Peri and Corsi asked the poet Ottavio Rinuccini to write some words for them and together they produced the opera Dafne It was probably nothing like what the Ancient Greeks would have done but it was the first opera in modern times

In 1600 Rinuccini and Peri wrote another opera together Euridice We still have the music Euridice although unfortunately the music to Dafne has been lost

Before the Reward Challenge Bruce Aras and Shane returned from looking for food to find the rest of their tribe had let the fire go out After a lesson about responsibility around the campsite they pulled together and won the Reward Challenge for bathroom and supplies and chose to send Terry to Exile Island because they thought he was his teams leader Bobby started problems with his teammates by not agreeing with how the reward should be used La Mina tried to organzie their camp but were having with Terry at Exile Island Terry found the Hidden Immunity Idol which he kept as a secret from his teammates after his return Dan pulled in Ruth Marie as a fifth person in his alliance but after losing another Immunity Challenge Sally told the La Mina men that she was a more weaker player In the end they thought strength was more important than loyalty as Ruth Marie was voted out 4 2

At La Minas camp while Austin and the other men looked for creatures they could eat from the ocean Dan told Nick about his space flights at NASA At Casaya the women were talking about how disrespectful they thought Shane was In a combined Reward and Immunity challenge Casaya won a barbecue and a trip to a local village as well as the right to send someone from La Mina to Exile Island Because the losing tribe would be going to Tribal Council Sally the only woman left in La Mina was sent to Exile Island and was given Immunity She was not allowed to vote at Tribal Council Although she was alone she liked how her being gone would break up the mens alliance Meanwhile Casaya enjoyed their reward They rode a boat to a village and gave some toys to children Shane saw someone smoking and talked about giving up all his clothes just to smoke a cigarette He ended up smoking after having to stop for a long time Later the tribe enjoyed barbecue played soccer and partied At Tribal Council the four men talked about how tight their alliance was and about the chance of a 2 2 tie vote In the end Terry voted with the younger men and Dan was voted off 3 1

La Mina got treemail that they are to go to Casaya for the tribal merge Before they came Shane pulled his tribe together in an agreement to vote out the other Tribe in the next four Tribal Councils While building a bigger shelter Nick accidentally chipped Bruces tooth with a machete but Bruce was fine Meanwhile Terry tried to tell some Casaya members to vote with La Mina but no one would say yes At the Immunity Challenge the survivors hung on a pole with only their hands and feet Terry won winning immunity Before Tribal Council Bruce named the new tribe Gitanos meaning gypsies in Spanish Later that night Nick who they thought was the second strongest player was voted out

With Nick voted out the old La Mina tribe tried to get some old Casaya members to vote with them At the reward challenge the players were split into three teams and Bruce Aras and Sally won Austin and Danielle were sent to Exile Island together while the winners enjoyed a big breakfast in a rain soaked bed At the immunity challenge the players competed in an obstacle course with a few players getting removed from the challenge in each round Terry ended up winning his second second immunity challenge in a row Back at camp the old La Mina tribe tried to get Bruce and Danielle to vote with them the two outcasts of their alliance to switch to the La Mina alliance Terry told Danielle that she could have the immunity idol if she switched At Tribal Council Danielle and Bruce still voted with Casaya and with a 6 3 vote got rid of Austin

After another La Mina was voted off Sally and Terry were trying very hard to keep themselves in the game At the Reward Challenge the team of Bruce Courtney Sally and Terry won videos from home peanut butter jelly sandwiches and ice cold milk They chose Aras to be sent to Exile Island Back at the camp a worried Shane told Cirie whos a nurse that he was having problems with his testicles When the winning team got back they brought some of their reward with them At the Immunity Challenge the players had to choose between a feast of cheeseburgers fries and soft drinks or the immunity challenge Bruce Cirie Courtney Danielle and Shane chose to feast Whereas Aras Sally and Terry chose to participate Terry barely won against Aras with Sally placing third When the Survivors got back to camp Sally and Terry were still trying to get members of Casaya to vote with them Although old La Mina tried the old Casaya members still said no and Sally was voted out 6 2

Terry seemed to become less happy about being outside of the Casaya alliance In a Reward Challenge where the players voted about the other players Courtney was shocked to find out that they thought she was the most unpopular of the tribe By guessing what most of the tribe had chosen for their answers Cirie won the challenge and sent Terry to Exile Island taking Aras and Danielle to share her reward Cirie then worried about what effect her decisions might have with the other players Back at the camp Courtney was upset because of some of the opinions told in the challenge and Shane was upset because he hadnt been chosen by Cirie for the reward Shane tried to ally himself with Courtney but failed Bruce who had been sick for many days had more pain Finally he couldnt take it any longer and asked for medical help The medical team came and took him out of the game Later that day with the Reward winners came back Jeff Probst brought Terry back to the camp from Exile Island and said that because Bruce was removed there was no Immunity Challenge or Tribal Council and Bruce would become a member of the Jury if he was in good enough shape

The other players continued to worry about Shanes odd behavior he had found a piece of wood and was pretending it was his BlackBerry and he was sending messages to people back home At the Reward Challenge Terry won a 2007 GMC Yukon and he Courtney and Danielle won a meal together During their reward Terry made a deal with Courtney and Danielle for the three of them to work together Back at camp Cirie went fishing and caught a big fish After returning to camp Danielle told Terry she was worried that if they were in the final three with Courtney she thought he would pick Courtney to go to the final two with because she was less popular Terry told Danielle that if either of them won the final immunity challenge they would take the second place winner to the final two When Courtney found out she became upset because she felt it suggested she was being carried by other players Terry won his fourth Immunity Challenge in a row and the old Casaya alliance had to vote out one of their own Shane thought the alliance wanted to vote out Danielle but Courtney thought that her new alliance with Danielle Terry and fourth member Cirie was voting against Aras Cirie who didnt like her low position in this alliance started a new alliance with Aras and Danielle to vote against Courtney With the votes split three ways Courtney was voted off

Players competed in a Reward Challenge of obstacles from past challenges for a visit with loved ones The winner would choose who gets what with their loved one Terry won and he choose himself and his wife along with Shane and his son Boston to spend the night at a villa He also chose Ciries husband HB to spend the night at the camp Aras to just get a hug from his mother and Danielle to get a few words with her mom from where she was standing After the loved ones left the players went to the Immunity challenge For the fifth time in a row Terry won immunity Back at camp Aras wanted to break his alliance with Shane after finding out that Shane wanted to take Courtney to the final two Aras then made an alliance with Cirie and Danielle In the end Shane was voted off

Terry was accidentally tripped by Ciries torch and yelled at her while she was taking care of the bonfire but Aras protected her saying that it was an accident This left Terry further separated from the rest of the tribe Aras having won the Reward Challenge chose to take Cirie on a luxurious yacht trip through the Panama Canal but not before leaving with a argument with Terry as he said he was complaining every time he lost challenges and said disparaging comments about women Both Terry and Danielle were sent to Exile Island for losing the Challenge During their trip Aras and Cirie talked about how they wanted to be in the Final 2 together while Danielle and Terry also talked about their fate in the game while they were on Exile Island Soon after returning from their reward Cirie built her first fire In the Immunity Challenge Cirie and Terry were putting up a good fight but Aras ultimately won the challenge ending Terrys Immunity winning streak Before the tribal council Aras apologized for what he had said after the Reward Challenge which Terry accepted Meanwhile Cirie and Danielle practiced making fire since they thought this would be the tiebreaker if there was a tie In the end the guess proved right as the vote did end up tied between Danielle and Cirie With Terry not wanting to give Danielle the Hidden Immunity Idol she and Cirie will have a fire making challenge However right before they started the scene was cut ending this episode leaving the viewers hanging

After trying many times to start fires that continue to wear out Danielle won the fire starting tie breaker and Cirie was removed from the game The next morning Terry showed the now powerless Immunity Idol back at camp and in a surprise Reward Challenge he won a protein enriched meal that would be useful for the last Immunity Challenge The final three were taken to Exile Island to take part in a tribute to the players voted off before them The three placed the old torches of the thirteen players on the big skull shaped shelter in the center of the island and burned it in the process Danielle won the last immunity after Terry fell off and Aras jumped off after getting a nod from Danielle Danielle voted out Terry thinking that she would have a better chance of winning against Aras and because Aras was a fellow member of the old Casaya tribe Aras and Danielle got celebrated with a feast the next day While walking along the beach rocks Aras fell and sliced open his hand and back needing eight stitches At the last Tribal Council Aras and Danielle were asked questions from who helped them the most in getting to the Final as to why the other player deserved the million dollar prize more Shane who thought neither of the two deserved the million dollars asked them to pick a number between one and a million At the live reunion Aras had won in a 5 2 vote and became the twelfth Sole Survivor

Germany also contains parts of Europes longest rivers such as the Rhine the Danube and the Elbe

In Germany there are sixteen Bundeslnder or states

Spain is a country in the Southern Europe It is in the Iberian Peninsula near Portugal and Gibraltar France and the little country of Andorra are on its northeast side where the Pyrenees mountains are 

The people of Spain are called Spaniards Most people there speak Spanish but there are other languages in different parts of the country They are Catalan Basque and Galician Leonese Aragonese Aranese Occitan and even Portuguese The religion of most of the people in Spain is Roman Catholic

Since 1975 Spain has had a king who only does what the constitution allows him to For example the king can declare a war but only if the Government asks him to do so The parliament is called Las Cortes Generales and has two bodies El Congreso and El Senado and it is chosen by the Spanish people by voting This kind of government is called a constitutional monarchy The King of Spain is Juan Carlos I The President of the executive branch of the government is Jos Luis Rodrguez Zapatero

The government and the kings palace are in Madrid the capital of Spain 

Spain has more than five hundred thousand square kilometres of land It is smaller than France but it is bigger than Sweden or Germany Around forty three million people live in Spain

Spain has 17 parts called autonomous communities Each part has its own government

People have lived in Spain for a long time There have been people living there since the Stone Age Some of the first people to live there were Iberians and Celts and the Phoenicians made a few cities there to get tin and silver to trade Later the Roman Empire controlled Spain for about five hundred years then as the Roman Empire broke up groups of Germanic people called VisigothsSuebiAlans and Vandals moved into the Iberian Peninsula and took it over

In 711 Arabic people took over and later groups from North Africa called the Moors ruled most of Spain for eight hundred years they called the land Al Andalus They were Muslims and Muslim Spain was the farthest western point of Islamic civilization This civilization was quite advanced at architecture and urban planning The Moors were very wealthy because they controlled the gold trade from the Ghana Empire in West Africa They built many beautiful buildings in all the land they controlled People can see many of their buildings still standing in cities in Andalusia such as Seville Granada and Cordoba 

Muslim Spain was multicultural and tolerant Jews Christians and Muslims lived side by side There was also a large Slavic population near the Mediterranean coast Though these people were at first brought in to be slaves many Slavic generals rose to become rulers of their own cities for a short time The Caliphate of Crdoba fell apart in the early 11th century Muslim Spain was focused on learning the greatest library system outside Baghdad was also there

The Kingdom of Len the most important in early Spanish Middle Ages was born in 910 This Kingdom developed the first democratic parliament in Europe in 1188 where the third state was represented and developed an economic system in 1202 where the monetary system was fixed After 1301 Len had the same King as the Kingdom of Castile and kept as an independent territory until 1833 when Spain was divided into regions and provinces

In the year 1492 they took the last part of Spain that still belonged to the Moors Granada Boabdil the last Moorish King of Granada surrendered to King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile on 2 January 1492 It was Ferdinand and Isabella of Castile who now ruled all of Spain

Before this there were a number of Christian countries in what is now called Spain Two of these countries Castile and Aragon came together when Ferdinand II of Aragon married the queen Isabella of Castile It is very important to know that the King ruled as much as the Queen

In the same year 1492 they sent Christopher Columbus to sail across the Atlantic Ocean Columbus found the islands of the Caribbean Sea

When other European sailors explored more like Hernn Corts and Francisco Pizarro they found out that there were two continents there  North America and South America Spain sent many soldiers and businessmen to North and South America and they took over very large parts of those two continents This empire did not make Spain a rich country for most of the money had to be spent in wars Many of these wars were fought against other European countries who were trying to take over parts of the Americas

Meanwhile at home the Muslim manuscripts had been either burnt or taken to other countries Jews had also been expelled from Spain Some Jews remained but they had to become Christians Among the few things kept and respected in Spain were in music harmony and stringed instruments The buildings that had been built by the Moors were kept and many Muslim religious buildings were turned into churches Some Jewish religious buildings were also turned into churches Many Arab words became part of the Spanish Language

The grandson of Ferdinand and Isabella Charles at the death of his grandfather inherited Castille and Aragon he also inherited many territories at the death of his grandfather Maximilian I of Austria Charles received from Maximilian the Austria state and the territories of Burgundy He was named Charles I in Spain but he was elected as the emperor of the Sacred German Empire and was called Charles V in this territory This made the empire bigger than ever However it was not a single country but many independent countries with a single King At first many Spaniards did not want Charles be their king so they fought against him However he won

Charles did not like the Protestant Reformation that was happening in Europe and fought against it

In the 18th century some of the parts of that large empire became their own countries or were taken over by new countries such as the United States of America

Spain was invaded by Napoleon of France Spain Britain and Europe sent its troops to defend the peninsula since it was so weak

There was not much peace in Spain during the first part of the 20th century Some Spaniards tried to set up a government chosen by the people and they made Alphonse XIII leave the country However in 1936 two different groups of Spaniards went to war over whether the government should be a democracy or take orders from one person In 1939 those who wanted democracy were defeated and a nationalist dictator named Francisco Franco took over the government

Francisco Franco died on November 20 He had decided that Spain should have a monarchy again and he chose Juan Carlos the grandson of Juan of Bourbon who had been forced to leave the country to be king But the king did not rule as a dictator instead he chose to set up a democracy

On February 23rd 1981 a group of people who had supported the now dead General Franco tried to take control of the democratic Spanish Parliament by force they entered the building and fired guns in the air It was seen live on Spanish television and there was widespread fear that this might be the start of another civil war However the king Juan Carlos quickly appeared on television and broadcast to the nation that they should remain calm The persons responsible for the attempt to take over the country were arrested

Now Spain is a modern democratic country and does business with many countries around the world It is the eighth largest economy in the world and is an important part of the European Union

At least 94 percent of Spain is Roman Catholic

The middle of Spain is a high dry flat land called La Meseta In La Meseta it can be very hot in the summer and cold or very cold in the winter Spain also has many mountain ranges In the north there is a range of mountains called Los Picos de Europa Here it is very cold in winter with a lot of snow but with gentle warm summers In the south east of the country is a range of mountains called La Sierra Nevada This range of mountains contains the highest mountain in mainland Spain Mulacen at 2952 metres La Sierra Nevada is very popular in winter for it winter sports especially skiing Snow remains on its peaks throughout the year On the south coast the weather is warm and temperate  temperate weather is neither very hot nor very cold Since Spain is in the south of Europe it is very sunny Many people from Northern Europe take their vacations in Spain enjoying its beaches and cities

World War I was a war fought by a multitude of countries which is why it is called a world war It started in 1914 and ended in 1918 Other names it has been called are The First World War and The War to End all Wars It was called the Great War before World War II began 135 countries took part in World War I and more than 15 million people died in the war 

World War I was fought on most of the continent of Europe The actual fighting that happened during the war was fought on many different fronts The Western Front was where most of the fighting between Germany and the Allies happened The system of trenches marked the Western Front as the Western Front There was also a no mans land that broke into this area Most of the fighting that happened in this area was trench warfare The Eastern Front was fought in Central and Eastern Europe and was one of the main places where World War I took place The fighting done on the Eastern Front was not trench warfare like it was on the Western Front but instead depended on having front lines of soldiers ready to fight the enemy The other fronts that had a lot of fighting includes the Middle Eastern Front and the Italian Front Fighting also took place in Africa and at sea

The war was ended by the signing of many different treaties the most important being the Treaty of Versailles citation neededdateJanuary 2012

World War I was the first war where tanks airplanes and submarines or underwater boats were used as common weapons 

One person who strongly supported Serbian power had sent five men to kill Ferdinand All five of the men failed to kill the Archduke while he passed through the large crowd The grenades thrown at the car did not kill him After failing their mission the five men decided to give up and go home One of these men was a Bosnian student named Gavrilo Princip who was also part of a group called Young Bosnia

The archduke and his wife were entering the city when the controller of their car took a wrong turn onto a large street with many people Princip saw the archduke and his wife He took out a gun from his pocket and shot at Ferdinand two hit the archduke one hit his wife and the other hit the car Both Ferdinand and his wife died shortly after

Austria Hungary blamed Serbia for the assassination Germany which supported Austria Hungary said that they should make a list of things that Serbia should do as punishment for killing the Archduke Austria Hungary was very strict perhaps because they wanted an excuse to start the war Though Serbia agreed to most of ten of the things on the list they could not agree to them all Austria Hungary then declared war on Serbia 

Russia joined the war on Serbias side because the people of Serbia were Slavic like Russia and the Slavic countries had agreed to help each other if they were attacked Since Russia is a large country it had to move soldiers closer to the war but Germany feared that Russias soldiers would also attack Germany Russia did not like Germany because of things Germany had done in the past to become stronger Germany declared war on Russia and used a plan to attack Russia that had been created before the war but it also involved attacking France and Belgium France and also Great Britain joined the war because Great Britain had agreed to help Belgium if it were ever attacked by someone else

This quickly led to a full scale war Austria Hungary declared war on Serbia Both countrys allies became involved in the war and soon most of Europe became involved

Germany was friends with Austria Hungary Russia was friends with Serbia The German government was afraid that because Austria Hungary had attacked Serbia that Russia would attack Austria Hungary to help Serbia Because of this Germany felt it had to help Austria Hungary by attacking Russia first before it could attack Austria Hungary The problem was that Russia was also friends with France and the Germans thought the French might attack them to help Russia So the Germans decided that they could win the war if they attacked France first and quickly They could mobilize very quickly They had a list of all the men who had to join the army and where those men had to go and the times of every train that would carry those men to where they would have to fight France was doing the same thing but could not do it as quickly The Germans thought that if they attacked France first they could knock France out of the war before Russia could attack them

Russia had a big army but Germany thought that it would take six weeks to mobilize and a long time before they could attack the Central Powers That wasnt true because the Russian Army mobilized in ten days Also the Russians drove deep into Austria

 Britain v Germany  Great Britain was allied with Belgium It also became quickly involved in the war On August 4 1914 it declared war against Germany when Germany attacked Belgium to reach Paris before Russia could mobilize and open up a second front against Germany Britain had the biggest empire as it ruled over a quarter of the world and was afraid that Germany would take its and Frances colonies and become the most powerful and biggest empire in the world Britain was also worried about Germanys growing military power This was because Germany was growing its very large army into one of the most powerful in the world Britains army was quite small but more professional compared with large armies like Germanys or Russias armies Britain had the largest and best navy in the world and initially thought that was enough to keep other navies from attacking But now the Germans were growing a large navy too The Germans were quickly building ships and putting even more men in its army and Germany was almost going to become as powerful as Britain

Turkey went into the war because it had lost much of its empire before the war and wanted to get it back from Britain and France Serbia which was once an Ottoman colony had already become its own country before the war When Austria went to war against Serbia Turkey declared war soon after

Greece went into the war because its leader supported the Allied cause Greece and Serbia became free again but many Greeks still lived in lands that were once Greek but were now Turkish The Greeks especially wanted to regain control of the land to the north that was under Bulgarian and Turkish rule so they declared war after a civil war

Turkey defeated the Greeks and discovered an island now named Cyprus Although today it is known as the Greeks this is only because the English had made a terrible mistake and told Greece that it was the English and they had given it to the Greeks for a certain amount of moneyclarify Soon after there was a battle between the Turks and the Greeks Turkey had killed most of the Greek army and the Greeks did try to invade Turkey again Another war was sparked by an explosion made by the Greeks They had bombed a train in the Turkish side

The Greeks failed their mission and Turkey swept Greece back into their own territory From then on the Greeks never again declared war while Turkey had one of the biggest armies in the world The Turkish empire is made of Turkey and half of Cyprus

Bulgaria like Greece and Serbia was owned by Turkey before got its freedom and took a lot of Turkish land But when the Bulgarians did a short time before the war the Serbians and Greeks felt cheated because the Bulgarians got a lot of land which they felt was Greek or Serbian The Greeks and Serbians took back Bulgarian land and irritated Bulgaria which made Bulgaria become friends with Turkey They declared war on Serbia and Greece Serbia and Greece won

Romania was on the side of the Central powers until 1916 when they were forced into the war by the Allied powers

Most people thought the war would be short They thought the armies would move around quickly to attack each other and one would defeat the other without too many people getting killed They thought the war would be about brave soldiers  they did not know what the war would really be like Only a few people like Lord Kitchener said that the war would take a long time

Germanys generals had decided that the best way to defeat France was to go through Belgium using a plan called The Schlieffen plan This was invented by the Germany Army Chief of Staff Alfred von Schlieffen They could then attack the French army at the north side and the south side at the same time The German Army went into Belgium on the 4 August On the same day Great Britain started a war on Germany because Britain was a friend of Belgium The British had said some time before in 1839 that they would not let anyone control Belgium and they kept their promise

When the Germans got to the Belgian city of Lige the Belgians fought very hard to stop them from coming into the city The Germans did finally push the Belgians out of the city but it had taken longer than the German generals had planned Then the Germans attacked the north side of the French army The French and the British moved men up to fight the Germans They could do this because the Belgians had fought so long at Lige But the Germans pushed the French back at the Fronteirs and the British held the Germans back at Mons but afterwards they also fell back to join up with the retreating French army until they were stopped at the river Marne This was called The Miracle of the Marne

Trench warfare was incredibly costly in terms of human life New advances in weaponry including machine guns and long range artillery had an increased rate of fire that proved incredibly effective in cutting down soldiers during mass charges a tactic leftover from older warfare The men on both sides took spades and dug holes because they did not want to be killed The holes joined up into trenches until the lines of trenches went all the way from Switzerland to the North sea In front of the trenches there was barbed wire that cut anyone who tried to climb over it and mines that blew up anyone who tried to run across the no mans land that was in between the trenches Gas was also an important weapon used

In the East the Russians had attacked the Germans The Russians pushed back the Germans but then the Germans defeated the Russians at the Battle of Tannenberg

The machine guns long range artillery the trenches and mines made it very difficult to attack The generals were used to fighting wars without these so they ordered their armies to attack in the old style of marching in rows allowing the enemy to shoot them down easily At the battle of the Somme in 1916 60000 British men died in a single day It was one of the bloodiest days in the history of the British army

The British used whistles to communicate to other soldiers so before they shelled the German trenches they would sound the whistle however the Germans realised this tactic and after the shelling when the British soldiers came to finish of the German soldiers the Germans were ready with their machine guns because they knew the Britons were coming 

The first thing a new recruit would notice on the way to the Frontline was the smell rotting bodies in shallow graves men who hadnt washed in weeks because there were no facilities overflowing cess pits creosol or chloride of lime used to stave off the constant threat of disease and infection Cordite the lingering odour of poison gas rotting sandbags stagnant mud cigarette smoke and cooking food Although overwhelming to a new recruit they soon got used to the smell and eventually became part of the smell with their own body odour

Front line trenches were usually about seven feet deep and six feet wide The front of the trench was known as the parapet The top two or three feet of the parapet and the parados would consist of a thick line of sandbags to absorb any bullets or shell fragments 

In a trench of this depth it was impossible to see over the top so a two or three foot ledge known as a fire step was added Trenches were not dug in straight lines Otherwise if the enemy had a successive offensive and got into your trenches they could shoot straight along the line Each trench was dug with alternate fire bays and traverses

Duck boards were also placed at the bottom of the trenches to protect soldiers from problems such as trench foot Soldiers also made dugouts and funk holes in the side of the trenches to give them some protection from the weather and enemy fire 

The front line trenches were also protected by barbed wire entanglements and machine gun posts Short trenches called saps were dug from the front trench into No Mans Land The sap head usually about 30 yards forward of the front line were then used as listening posts 

Behind the front line trenches were support and reserve trenches The three rows of trenches covered between 200 and 500 yards of ground Communication trenches were dug at an angle to the frontline trench and was used to transport men equipment and food supplies

Airplanes were first used a lot in World War I Airplanes were not used very much in fighting before World War I It was the first war to use airplanes as weapons Airplanes were first used to take pictures of enemy land Generals military leaders were using airplanes as an important part of their attack plans at the end of the war World War I showed that airplanes were something that could be used in a war

Airplanes in World War I were made of wood and canvas a type of rough cloth They did not last for a long time They could not fly very fast at the beginning of the war They could only fly up to 116 kilometers per hour or 72 miles per hour At the end of the war they could fly up to 222 kilometers per hour or 138 miles per hour But they could not fly as fast as planes today Guns were put on planes for the first time during the war Pilots people who fly the plane used the guns to shoot enemy planes One pilot used metal sheets pieces of metal to protect his airplane Other pilots began using metal sheets on their airplanes to protect them Pilots also made their airplanes better with machine guns guns that shoot bullets very fast and quick Machine guns made fighting harder and more dangerous between airplanes 

Pilots had to wear certain clothes when flying an airplane in World War I The pilots clothes kept them warm and protected them from the wind and cold Pilots wore a leather coat to protect their bodies They wore a padded helmet and goggles large glasses with special lenses to protect their head and face They wore a scarf around their neck The scarf kept the wind from blowing against their neck when they turn their heads

The German generals decided to use submarines These submarines were named U boats from the German word Unterseeboot The U boats attacked American ships that were carrying food and weapons to Great Britain The Germans thought that the Americans were helping only the British and not being neutral Neutral means that a country is not involved in the war But then some Americans were killed by the submarines 

Germany also wrote a secret telegram note to Mexico in code suggesting that the two countries work together to attack the United States This note is called the Zimmermann Telegram because the person who sent it was named Arthur Zimmermann It offered Mexico to get back some of its land that the United States took from them such as Texas New Mexico and Arizona Some spies from the United Kingdom found out about the note and told the United States American people became angry and many decided that they wanted their country to enter the war to punish Germany Because of these things in parton April 6 1917 the United States declared war against Germany and became part of the Allies

In 1917 there was a revolution in Russia The Tsar had to say he would not be Tsar any more and that the people should have power At first it was thought that Russia would fight harder now that the Tsar was gone But the Russian people didnt want to fight anymore because there was not sufficient food appropriate armament or adequate roads to supply its army The war had been putting burdens on them and many of them were poor and hungry They began to hate their new government because it wouldnt stop the war

Then there was an October Revolution Two factions fought to rule over Russia The passive Mensheviks lost against radical Bolsheviks The leader of the Bolsheviks was Vladimir Lenin which was Communist who followed the ideas of Karl Marx The new government the Germans for peace and signed a peace treaty called Brest Litvosk with the Central Powers in March 1918 at the city of Brest Litovsk The Germans and Russians stopped fighting This gave Germany lots of land in eastern Europe and the Baltic Sea

After the war the Germans had to agree to the Treaty of Versailles Germany had to pay 33 billion in reparations They also had to take responsibility for the war Part of the treaty said the countries of the world should come together to make an international organization to stop wars from happening This organization was called the League of Nations The US Senate didnt agree with this even though it was the idea of the US president Woodrow Wilson Woodrow Wilson tried to tell the American people that they should agree but the US never joined the League of Nations Problems with the Treaty in Germany would later lead to the Second World War

The start of the war is usually said to be on September 1 1939 with the invasion of Poland but some sources show July 7 1937 with the Japanese invasion of China The United States reacted to the Japanese invasion of China by placing an embargo on Japan France United Kingdom and most of the twos colonies reacted to the German invasion of Poland by declaring war on Germany Germany expanded its territory greatly in Europe By 1941 most of Europe was under German control while only Britain remained fighting against the Axis in North Africa Mediterranean and the Atlantic In June 1941 the Axis Powers invaded the Soviet Union starting the largest theatre of war in history This would harm the Axis military power greatly In December 1941 Japan attacked Western colonies in the Pacific 

The Japanese victories were stopped in 1942 and the European Axis victories were also stopped by 1943 both in North Africa and in the Soviet Union After that the Allies started to fight back from all sides The Axis lost North Africa and was forced to defend Italy since 1943 In 1944 the Allies invaded France heading towards Germany while the Soviets kept closing in from the East Germany surrendered in May 1945 Japan formally surrendered on August 15 1945 The war ended with the Allied victory

After the war the United Nations was set up to develop support between countries and to prevent future wars However the Cold War began between the two superpowers the Soviet Union and the United States Decolonization of Asia and Africa where those countries controlled by European countries were given their independence happened as well This was because European power was weakened from the war Economic recovery and the political integration were among other results of the war

The countries that joined the war were on one of two sides the Axis and the Allies

The Axis Powers at the start of the war were Germany Italy and Japan There were many meetings to create the alliance between these countries Rome Berlin Axis in October 1936 Anti Comintern Pact in November 1936 which Italy later joined in November 1937 and Pact of Steel in May 1939 Germany made the Axis Powers formal alliance in September 1940 with Tripartite Pact Finland Slovakia Romania Bulgaria Hungary and Thailand joined the Axis later However as the war continues many Axis countries changed to join the Allies instead

The Allied Powers were the United Kingdom and some of its Commonwealth France Poland and China at the start of the war In June 1941 The Soviet Union joined the Allies after Germany attacked it On December 11 1941 four days after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor the United States joined the Allies

World War I had greatly changed the way of diplomacy and politics in Asia Europe and Africa with the defeat of the Central Powers Many empires which sided with the Central Powers were disestablished The Russian Empire however which didnt side with the Central Powers was disestablished as well The war also the changed map of Eastern Europe with many new countries bore The war led to strong irredentism and revanchism in Europe These senses were especially strong in Germany which had no choices but sign the Treaty of Versailles The Germans also had 13 of their homeland area and all colonies taken away and they had to pay back a very large sum of money to the Allies This was about 269 billion German Mark The number of soldiers and military vehicles it could have was also limited while its air force was completely banned Soon Lenins death brought Stalin to power in the Soviet Union the communist state which was created from the result of the Russian Civil War 

In Italy nationalists were unhappy with the outcome of the war thinking that their country should have gained far more territory from the past agreement with the Allies The following fascist movement in 1920s brought Mussolini the leader of the country He promised to make Italy a great power by creating its colonial empire 

After the Kuomintang the government party of China unified the country in 1920s the civil war between it and the its past ally Communist Party of China began In 1931 Japan claimed Mukden Incident as a reason to take over China which was the first step of its plan to rule Asia Japan was able to take over Manchuria and set up its puppet state Manchukuo while the League of Nations could not do anything to stop it The Tanggu Truce a ceasefire was signed in 1933 In 1936 the Kuomintang and the communists agreed to stop fighting against each other to fight Japan instead In 1937 Japan attacked China again

After the German Empire was disestablished the democratic Weimar Republic was set up There were disagreements between the Germans which involved many political ideologies ranging from nationalism to communism The fascist movement in Germany rose because of the Great Depression Adolf Hitler leader of the Nazi Party became the Chancellor in 1933 even though he was jailed once after a failed coup After the Reichstag fire Hitler created a totalitarian state where there is only one party by law Hitler wanted to change the world order quickly rebuilt the army navy and air force especially after Saarland was reunited in 1935 In March 1936 Hitler sent the army to Rhineland The Spanish Civil War began in July 1936 The war ended with the nationalist victory supported by Italy and Germany

In March 1938 Germany sent its army to Austria which had only a little reaction from European countries Shortly after that the Allies agreed to give Sudetenland part of Czechoslovakia to Germany so that Hitler would promise to stop taking more land But the rest of the country was either forced to surrender or invaded by March 1939 The Allies now tried to stop him by promising to help Poland if it was attacked Just before the war Germany and the Soviet Union signed Molotov Ribbentrop pact agreeing that they would not attack each other for ten years In the secret part of it They agreed to share Eastern Europe for themselves

World War II began on September 1 1939 as Germany invaded Poland On September 3 Britain and France followed by the Commonwealth declared war on Germany They could not help Poland much and just only sent a small French attack on Germany from the West The Soviet Union invaded eastern Poland soon after Germany on September 17 Finally Poland was divided but it never formally surrendered and continued fighting on the side of the Allies elsewhere

Germany then signed an agreement to work together with the Soviet Union After that the Soviet Union forced the Baltic countries to allow it to keep Soviet soldiers in their countries Finland did not accept the Soviet call for its land so it was attacked in November 1939 The war ended in March 1940 with a peace treaty France and Britain thought that the Soviet Union might enter the war on the side of Germany and drove the Soviet Union out of the League of Nations 

After Poland was defeated the Phoney War began in the Western Europe While British soldiers were sent to the Continent there were no big battles fought between two sides Then in April 1940 Germany decided to attack Norway and Denmark so that it would be safer to transport iron ore from Sweden The Allies tried to disrupt but failed Chamberlain was replaced by Churchill as Prime Minister of United Kingdom in May 1940 because the British were unhappy with his work

 Axis early victories 

On May 10 Germany invaded France Belgium Holland and Luxembourg and quickly won by using blitzkrieg tactics The British were forced to leave mainland Europe at Dunkirk On June 10 Italy invaded France declaring war on France and the United Kingdom Soon after that France was divided into occupation zones One was directly controlled by Germany and Italy and the other was unoccupied Vichy France

By June 1940 the Soviet Union moved its soldiers into the Baltic States and took over them followed by some parts of Romania Although there were some help between the Soviet Union and Germany earlier this event made it serious Later when the two could not agree to work more closely together relationships between them became worse and about to become a war

Then Germany began an air battle over Britain to prepare for a landing on the island but the plan was finally canceled in September German navy succeeded in destroying the British ships transporting goods in the Atlantic Italy by this time began its operation in the Mediterranean The United States which had not join the war on either side started to help the Allies By help protecting British ships in the Atlantic the United States found itself fighting German ships by October 1941 although it was not a formal war

In September 1940 Italy began to invade British held Egypt In October Italy invaded Greece but it only resulted in an Italian retreat to Albania Again in early 1941 an Italian army was pushed from Egypt to Libya in Africa Germany soon helped Italy Under Rommels command by the end of April 1941 the Commonwealth army was pushed back to Egypt again Other than North Africa Germany also successfully invaded Greece Yugoslavia and Crete by May Despite these victories Hitler decided to cancel the bombing of Britain after May 11 

At the same time Japans progress in China was still not much although the nationalist and communist Chinese began fighting each other again Japan was planning to take over European colonies in Asia while they were weak and the Soviet Union could feel a danger from Germany so a non aggression pact between the two was signed in April 1941 However Germany kept preparing an attack on the Soviet Union moving its soldiers close to the Soviet border

FileEastern Front 1941 06 to 1941 12png300pxthumbThe Axis in the Eastern Front 

By December the Red Army facing the Axis army had received more soldiers from the East It began a counter attack that pushed the German army to the west The Axis lost a lot of soldiers but it still saved most of the land it received before

By November 1941 the Commonwealth counter attacked the Axis in North Africa and got all the land it lost before However the Axis pushed the Allies back again until stopped at El Alamein

In Asia German successes encouraged Japan to call for oil supplies from the Dutch East Indies Many Western countries reacted to the occupation of French Indochina by banning oil trading with Japan Japan planned to take over European colonies in Asia to create a great defensive area in the Pacific which would let it free to get resources But first before any future invasion it had to destroy the American Pacific Fleet in the Pacific Ocean On December 7 1941 it attacked Pearl Harbor as well as many harbours in several South East Asian countries This event led the United States United Kingdom Australia Western Allies and China to declare war on Japan while the Soviet Union remained neutral Most of the Axis nations reacted by declaring war on the United States

By April 1942 many South East Asian countries Burma Malaya the Dutch East Indies and Singapore had almost fallen to the Japanese In May 1942 the Philippines fell The Japanese navy got many quick victories But in June 1942 Japan was defeated at Midway Japan could not take more land after this because a large part of its navy was destroyed during the battle

Japan then began its plan to take over Papua New Guinea again while the United States planned to attack the Solomon Islands The fight on Guadalcanal began in September 1942 and involved a lot of troops and ships from both sides It ended with the Japanese defeat in early 1943

On the Eastern Front the Axis defeated Soviet attacks during summer and began its own main offensive to southern Russia along Don and Volga Rivers in June 1942 trying to take over oil fields in Caucasus and a great steppe Stalingrad was in the path of the Axis army and the Soviets decided to defend the city By November the Germans had nearly taken Stalingrad however the Soviets were able to surround the Germans during winter and forced the heavily lost German army in the city to surrender in February 1943 Even though the front was pushed back more than its position before the summer attacks the German army still become dangerous to an area around Kursk

In August 1942 by the Allied defense at El Alamein the Axis army failed to take the town The Allies continued by starting its own offensive which drove the Axis west across Libya in a few months later just after the Anglo American invasion of the French North Africa forcing it to join the Allies The Axis army faced Allied armies from the east and west and had to defend Tunisia It was completely lost in May 1943

In the Soviet Union July 4 1943 Germany started an attack around Kursk But within a week a lot of German soldiers were lost because of the Soviet well created defenses Hitler canceled the attack before any clear outcome The Soviets then started their own counter attack which was one of the turning point of the war After this the Soviets became an attacker on the Eastern Front instead of the Germans 

On July 9 1943 affected by the earlier Soviet victories the Western Allies landed on Sicily This resulted in the arrest of Mussolini in the same month In September 1943 the Allies invaded mainland Italy following the Italian armistice with the Allies Germany then took control of Italy and disarmed its army and built up many defensive lines to slow the Allied invasion down German special forces then rescued Mussolini who then soon created the German occupied client state Italian Social Republic

In early 1944 the Soviet army drove off the German army from Leningrad ending the longest and deadliest siege in the history After that the Soviets began a big counter attack By May the Soviets retook Crimea Since the attacks in Italy from September 1943 the Allies succeeded in capturing Rome on June 4 1944 and made the German forces fall back

On D Day June 6 1944 the Allies began the invasion of Normandy France The code name for the invasion was Operation Overlord The landings were successful and led to the defeat of the German forces in France Paris was cleared out of the Germans on August 25 and the Allies continued to pushed the Germans back to the Rhine before the beginning of 1945 The Allied invasion in Italy also pushed the Germans there to their last defensive line

On June 22 the great Soviet offensive codenamed Operation Bagration almost destroyed the German Army Group Centre Soon the Germans were forced to defend Ukraine and Poland Arriving Soviet troops caused uprisings against German government in Eastern European countries but all of those failed to succeed without helped by the Soviets Then another Soviet offensive forced Romania and Bulgaria to join the Allies Communist Serbs partisans under Josip Broz Tito retook Belgrade with some help from Bulgaria and the Soviet Union By early 1945 the Soviets attacked many German occupied countries Greece Albania Yugoslavia and Hungary Finland also stopped fighting the Soviets and joined the Allies 

On December 16 1944 the Germans tried for the last time to win on the Western Front by attacking the Allies in the Ardennes Belgium which was also the last German major attack in the war but it failed every target By March 1945 the Soviet army moved quickly from Vistula River in Poland to East Prussia and Vienna while the Western Allies crossed the Rhine closing in from Western Germany By late April the Allies pushed forward in Italy while the Soviets attacked Berlin The two linked up on Elbe river on April 25

Hitler killed himself in April 30 1945 two days after Mussolinis death He appointed his navy commander Grand Admiral Karl Dnitz to be the President of Germany Opposing Hitlers will to have Germany continue fighting Dnitz wanted to surrender to the Western Allies 

German forces surrendered in Italy on April 29 Germany surrendered to the Western Allies on May 7 known as V E Day and was forced to surrender to the Soviets on May 8 The final battle in Europe was ended on May 11

In the Pacific American forces arrived on the Philippines in June 1944 And by April 1945 American and Philippine forces advanced and cleared much of the Japanese forces but the fighting continued in some parts of the Philippines until the end of the war British and Chinese forces advanced in Northern Burma and captured Rangoon by May 3 American forces then take Iwo Jima by March and Okinawa by June Many Japanese cities were destroyed by Allied bombings and Japanese imports were cut off by American submarines

The Allies wanted Japan to surrender with no terms but Japan refused The United States then dropped two atomic bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki On August 8 the Soviets invaded Manchuria quickly defeated primary Imperial Japanese Army there On August 15 Japan formally surrendered to the Allies The surrender documents were signed formally on board of USS Missouri on September 2 1945 ending the war

The Allies managed to occupy Austria and Germany Germany was divided onto western and eastern part under the Western Allies and the Soviet control accordingly The Allies began denazification removing Nazi idea from history and most of found high rank Nazis were brought to the special court Germany lost a quarter of the land in 1937 with the land was given to Poland and the Soviet Union The Soviets also took some parts of Poland and Finland as well as three Baltic countries  

The United Nations was formed on October 24 1945 to keep peace between countries in the world However the relationship between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union had been worse since the war was still fighting and soon after the war each powers quickly built up their power over controlled area In Western Europe and West Germany it was the United States While in East Germany and Eastern Europe it was the Soviet Union which many countries were transferred to Communist states The Cold War started after the formation of the American led NATO and the Soviet led Warsaw Pact 

In Asia Japan was put under American occupation Korea was divided into North and South Korea each claiming to be legal representative of the Koreans which led to Korean War in 1948 Civil war in China continued fighting in 1946 and resulted with nationalists retreat to Taiwan in 1949 The communist Peoples Republic of China was formed on the mainland In the Middle East the Arab disagreement on United Nations plan to create Israel marked the beginning of conflicts between the Arab and Israeli 

After the war decolonization took place in many European colonies Bad economy and people want to rule themselves were main reasons for that In most events it happened peacefully except some countries such as Indochina and Algeria In many region European withdrawal caused divisions among the people who had different ethnic group or religion

In many parts of the world economic recovering was different In general it was quite positive United States became richer than any countries and by 1950 it took over the worlds economy It also ordered Marshall Plan to help European countries German Italian and French economies recovered However the British economy was badly harmed and continued to worsen for more than ten years The Soviet economy grew very fast suddenly after the war was over This was also happaned with the Japanese economy becoming the one of the largest economies in 1980s China returned to the same production level as before the war by 1952

There was no exact total number of deaths because many were unrecorded Many studies said that more than 60 million people died in the war mostly civilians The Soviet Union lost around 27 million people almost half of the recorded number This means that 25 of the Soviets killed or wounded in the war About 85 of the total deaths were on the Allies side and the other 15 were on the Axis Mostly people died because they were sick hungry to death bombed or get killed because of their ethnics

The Nazis killed many groups of people they selected known as The Holocaust They targeted Jews the Roma Slavs gay men and other ethnics or group Around 11 to 17 million civilians died Around 75 million people died in China caused by the Japanese The most well known Japanese crime was the Nanking Massacre which hundred thousands of Chinese civilians were raped and murdered There were reports that the Germans and Japanese tested biological weapons against civilians and prisoners of war

Although many of the Axiss crimes were brought to the first international court crimes caused by the Allies were not

Other than the Holocaust about 12 million mostly Eastern Europeans were forced to work for the German economy German concentration camps and Soviet gulags caused a lot of death Both treated prisoners of war badly In the case of the Soviets this was even their own soldiers who survied and returned home

Japanese prisoner of war camps many of which were used as labour camps also caused a lot of deaths Death rate of Western prisoners was 271 seven times that of prisoners under Germans and Italians More than 10 million Chinese civilians were made slave for work in mines and war factories Between 4 to 10 million people were forced to work in Java

Between 1942 and 1945 Roosevelt signed an order which made Japanese Americans go to internment camps Some Germans and Italians were included too

The Allies agreed that the Soviet Union could use prisoners of war and civilians for forced labor Hungarians were forced to work for the Soviet Union until 1955

Before the war in Europe the Allies had a larger population and economy than the Axis If colonies are included the GDP of the Allies then would be two times of that of the Axis While in Asia China had only 38 higher GDP than the Japanese if their colonies are counted

The Alliess economy and population compared with the Axiss lessened in the early Axis victories However this was no longer after the United States and Soviet Union joined the Allies by 1941 The Allies was able to have a higher production level compared with the Axis because the Allies had more natural resources Though it could be said that rarely use of women in the labour force in Germany and Japan Allied bombings and Germanys change to a war economy took a great part Also Germany and Japan did not plan for a long war and had no ability to do so Both tried to improve their economies by using slave laborers

Germany had two different ideas of how it would occupy countries In Western Northern and Central Europe Germany set economic policies which would make it rich During the war it was as much as 40 of total German income While in the East the war with the Soviet Union meant it could not use the land to gain resources The Nazis mainly use the racial policy and murdered a lot of people they thought non human The Resistance the group of people who fight Germany secretly could not harm the Nazis much until 1943

In Asia Japan claimed to free colonised Asian countries from European colonial powers Although they was welcomed at first in many territories their cruel actions turned the opinions against them witnin a short time During the occupation Japan could use 4 million barrels of oil and by 1943 it produced oil in the Dutch East Indies up tp 50 million barrels 76 of its 1940 rate

The war brought new methods for fighting and killing to the later wars The air forces improved greatly such as air transport strategic bombing as well as radar and weapons for destroying aircraft Jet aircrafts developed and would be used in worldwide air forces

At sea the war focused on using aircraft carriers and submarines Aircraft carriers soon replaced battleships The important reason was they were cheaper Submarines a deadly weapon since the World War I also took an important part in the war The British improved weapons for destroying submarines such as sonar while the Germans improved submarine tactics

The style of war on the land changed from the World War I to be more moveable Tanks which were used to support infantry changed to primary weapon The tank was improved in speed armour and firepower during the war At the start of the war most commanders thought that tanks should be faced with higher quality ones However early tanks could harm armour just a little And German idea to keep away from let tanks fight one another meant tanks facing tanks was rarely happen This was the successful tactic used in Poland and France Ways to destroy tanks also improved Even though vehicles became more used in the war infantry remained the main part of the army and most equipped like in the World War I

Portable machine gun became widely used A good example was the German MG42 Many of them suited to fight in cities and jungles The assault rifle a development combining features of the rifle and submachine gun became the main weapon for most armies after the war

One of the developments included the way to send code messages A good example was the German Enigma The way to read code messages also improved Another feature of military intelligence was the use of deception especially by the Allies Others include the first programmable computers modern missiles and rockets and the atomic bombs

A bird nest is a place where a bird lays its eggs There are all kinds of nests from cup nests to digging holes in the ground to simply stuffing some leaves inside the o of a McDonald sign The word can be used as a noun or a verb as in a bird nests in a nest They are in all kinds of sizes some can be as big and heavy as a car like an old eagles nest while some can be tiny as a broken wikt linkthimblethimble like the nest of a Bee Hummingbird

Usually the female builds the nest and the male helps her In some species though the male does nothing and in others the male builds the nest and the female does nothing

Many birds glue their nests together with materials like spider webs silk mud and even their own saliva Most nest builders like to put soft things inside their nest Some birds even put herbs and spices in their nest Scientists think these herbs help fight off bacteria in a way they cant completely understand yet

The cup nest is probably the most common of all bird nests Its name tells you that a cup nest is shaped like a cup or bowl Many songbirds built cup nests These nests can be built in the branches of a tree like in the crack where one branch joins another however some can simply stick the nest right onto the branch of a tree They use lots of materials that act like sticky glue mud rotten wood dung spider webs and caterpillar silk They even use their own saliva mixed with food to keep the nest firmly stuck on the branch

Cup nesters use all kinds of materials to build a nest twigs grass leaves moss and they use all sorts of materials to keep it from falling apart Most cup nesters use rough broken wikt linkscratchyscratchy material for the outside and put soft cozy material like moss fur feathers and cotton on the inside

Many cup nesters enjoy nesting very close to the ground in low bushes sometimes they will even nest in potted plants on a broken wikt linkporchporch Some of them actually just build their nests on the ground Sparrows cardinals and many other song birds like to nest near the ground far away from owls hawks and Blue Jays that may eat their babies

There are several types of cup nests A suspended cup nest is attached to the branch at the top and sides but then drops like a bag down below It really looks more like a vase than a cup The bird is almost hidden when she warms her eggs The mother bird can sit down on the branch above the nest and bend down to feed her baby birds Orioles are very famous for building amazingly long bags that hang far below the branch

The smallest cup nests are made by hummingbirds They can be as tiny as a broken wikt linkthimblethimble like the Bee Hummingbirds nest That tiny nest holds eggs that are as tiny as peas The largest cup nest is probably the storks His nest can be nine feet deep and six feet wide The storks nest is so big smaller birds actually make nests in its cracks holes and branches

Adherent nests adhere to buildings trees cliffs or other vertical structures Swallows can build an almost perfectly round nest out of mud Some species make cup shaped nests while others make jug like nests with little holes in the sides They put little balls of mud in their mouth and mix it with their saliva making a special clay As it dries it becomes hard

Bird saliva is very good for making glue in fact some species of swiftlets make their whole nest out of simply saliva The male regurgitates a long thin strand of saliva from broken wikt linkglandglands under its tongue This saliva is used to be made into a half cup nest which sticks to a cave wall and dries quickly This saliva nest is thought to be a delicacy in China and it is very expensive They put it into a soup called Birds Nest Soup

A platform nest are built mostly by raptors They are usually huge and very very high up  on the sides of cliffs maybe or high up in a big tree It takes months and months making these nests adding branch by branch They often return to the same nest year after year and continue to build it It is because of this that platform nests get so big a Bald Eagles nest for example can weigh as much as a ton It is so heavy it can sometimes hurt the tree it is built in

A few water birds build platform nests right on the water where they can float The nests dont move though because they are anchored to plants that are attached to the bottom of the body of water These birds build nests on water because they dont walk well on land so they find a shallw part of the water to build their nests Then they do not walk to their nests  they swim to it When the babies are ready they simply jump into the water and begin their aquatic life

Earth hole nests are nests that are inside the earth They are burrows on the ground or in the sides of cliffs They like using abandoned rabbit holes too The Burrowing Owl only uses already dug holes for its nest

Puffins for instance dig a tunnel that is usually two to three feet long At the end they make a nest of feathesr and grass and lay their eggs They are able to do this because of their sharp bill and claws A puffin can work for hours to make its tunnel Kingfishers too digs or burrows its hole It can burrow up to six feet into the side of a cliff and lay its eggs there

Many birds nest right on the ground After carving out a little hole ground and mound nesters line the nest with grass or other materials Geese even pick feathers from their breasts and make a nice downy bed for their eggs Most ducks geese and quail like the ground for nesting Penguins nest on the ground too pushing rocks around the nest to keep it from washing away with flood waters Usually males make ground nests

The Trumpeter Swan makes a big mound nest and flamingos make mounds too Flamingos make their mounds completely out of mud They can be up to 18 inches high and 12 to 20 inches in width

These nests are barely a nest at all just a small depression in the ground or a pile of dead leaves to lay eggs on These scrape nesting birds usually have eggs that match the color of dead leaves or rocks This is needed because these eggs are in danger of being eaten by animals like rats raccoons snakes and others that eat eggs

Many scrape nesters actually tries to distract creatures that might be dangerous by pretending they have a broken wing and trying to distract it This makes a predator chase the mother bird and leave the eggs

A Car bomb is a bomb device that is hidden within a vehicle It is usually driven into places that have large groups of people Terrorists use car bombs more than any other organization The car with the bomb attached to it will explode This will usually cause fires and small pieces of metal which cause most of the damage

The Brothers Karamazov is a Russian novel written by Fyodor Dostoevsky Dostoevsky said Id die happy if I could finish this final last novel for I would have expressed myself completely

The Brothers Karamazov is the story of the lives of three Russian brothers who are very different in body mind and spirit and are often thought of as representing those three parts of mankind It was written in 1879 to 1880 in Russia mostly in St Petersburg It was published in 1879 to 1880 in a series It is his most complicated and deep novel and most people think it is Dostoevskys greatest

There are four brothers in the Karamazov family Ivan the atheist broken wikt linkintellectintellectual Dmitry the emotional lover of women Alyosha the hero and Christian and twisted broken wikt linkcunningcunning Smerdyakov the broken wikt linkillegitimateillegitimate child who is treated as the family servant Fyodor Pavlovich Karamazov is a very careless father and woman lover Dmitry comes to hate him because his father loves the same woman as he does Grushenka and because of this he often threatens that he will kill his father When Fyodor Pavlovich is killed by Smerdyakov he is accused of killing his father

Throughout the book there is a search for truth about man about life and about God After it was published all kinds of people such as Sigmund Freud Albert Einstein and Pope Benedict XVI thought it was the greatest book in all broken wikt linkliteratureliterature

Fyodor Dostoevsky was born in 1821 the son of an army doctor While he was away at the Academy of Engineers his father died  reportedly murdered by his own servants Though broken wikt linkbiographybiographers disagree whether Dostoevskys father was really murdered or not Dostoevsky apparently believed that his father had been murdered and it is even possible that he felt feelings of guilt for it as if he had been the one who had killed his father People like Sigmund Freud argue that this had an influence when he wrote The Brothers Karamazov After 17 years of schooling and family life in Moscow he spent six years in St Petersburg as an officer He resigned in 1844 and two years later became famous with his first published book Poor Folk Young Dostoevsky began to become involved with the Petrashevsky Circle  a group of political discussion groups by young people in St Petersburg who did not like the rule of Emperor Nicholas I Because of this Dostoevsky was arrested and held for eight months in the prisons of the Fortress of St Peter and St Paul Meanwhile he was put on trial while he was away and sentenced to death

On 22 December 1849 8 AM he was pretended to be led out with twenty other people for execution by firing squad in the Semenovsky Square in St Petersburg The first group was actually broken wikt linkblindfoldblindfolded and tied up while the second group watched This terrible mock execution made one of the prisoners go insane But then the order was suddenly changed and he was given katorga for four years This had a great influence on his life After that he was to serve the military in Siberian broken wikt linkexileexile

Dostoevskys four years in prison camp greatly influenced his book and his life He began to suffer from epilepsy when he was in prison and would have epilepsy for the rest of his life He shows how epilepsy feels like through the character Smerdyakov Also in prison he began believing in God and having religious and philosophical inclinations Through the character Rakitin Dostoevsky makes fun of the clever people who jumped from one popular idea to another without caring about the truth In prison he also met Ilyinsky who had been sent to prison for killing his father Almost ten years after he met Ilyinsky Dostoevsky found out that Ilyinsky was innocent and later became free when the real murderer confessed Dmitry Karamazov is like Ilyinsky in many ways

Also shortly before he wrote The Brothers Karamazov his own son Alexei died He creates in Alyosha what his son possibly might have been like and reflects his own sadness in scenes where Captain Snegriev loses Ilyusha or when Zosima comforts a woman who has lost her little son Alexei

Throughout Dostoevsky was concerned with the justice of God and the idea that if God does not exist then everything is permitted

When he was young Fyodor Pavlovich Karamazov was a broken wikt linkvulgarityvulgar and broken wikt linkeccentriceccentric man who liked money and women too much From his first wife Adelaida he had one son Dmitry Karamazov From his second wife Sophia he had Ivan and Alyosha Karamazov Karamazov does not care about his sons and they are all brought up by friends and relatives Dmitry who is a soldier comes back when he is twenty eight years old to take an broken wikt linkinheritanceinheritance his mother had left to him Karamazov wants the inheritance for himself and they get angry and fight with each other Cold clever Ivan is called to stop their fight and the broken wikt linkgentlegentle kind Alyosha who also lives at the town comes to help Alyosha studies in a monastery with the Elder Zosima Dmitry and Fyodor agree that maybe Elder Zosima can help stop their fight and Alyosha though feeling worried about the meeting says he will arrange it

Fyodor Karamazov is vulgar sarcastic and mocking at the meeting and tries to make everybody angry and uncomfortable with his talk and stories Alyosha is very sad and embarrassed The Elder Zosima however is calm polite and even kind to him even when Karamazov is mocking him telling him to be honest with himself 

Dmitry arrives late and the meeting soon becomes a big fight between father and son They are not only angry at each other because of money they are both in love with Grushenka a beautiful woman living in the town While they are fighting the Elder Zosima suddenly bows down to Dmitry saying Forgive me Dmitry is very shocked and later Zosima explains to Alyosha that he knows Dmitry is going to have very much suffering In the middle of their fight the elder also goes out to give advice to lots of people including Mrs Khokhlakov whose broken wikt linkcripplecrippled daughter Lise keeps on laughing at the awkward Alyosha He also comforts a woman whose three year old son has died This is probably an echo of Dostoevskys sadness about his dead son

Four years ago Fyodor Karamazov became a father to a fourth son Smerdyakov Smerdyakovs mother was a retarded and mute woman called Stinking Lizaveta Lizaveta died when she gave birth to Smerdyakov and he became Karamazovs servant Smerdyakov grows up to have a strange and mean personality and has epilepsy Even though Karamazov always treats him like a servant though he is not stupid He likes to talk about philosophy with Ivan and soon agrees with lots of Ivans ideas especially the idea that the soul does not live forever and so there is no good or evil

Dmitry explains to Alyosha that when he was a soldier he was angry that beautiful Katerina kept on ignoring him and he tried to broken wikt linkseduceseduce her by saying he would give her 4500 rubles her father needed to pay his debt if she came to his house When her father tries to kill himself because of the debt she comes to Dmitrys house at night like he told her to However he is so amazed and broken wikt linkaweawed by her self sacrifice that he just gives her the money without trying to seduce her Shocked Katerina kneels and bows down to him like a simple Russian woman and runs out Later when a relative gave her a lot of money she offered to marry Dmitry and they became engaged But when they came to Karamazovs town he fell in love with Grushenka instead and even stole 3000 rubles from Katerina to have a wild party with Grushenka He asks Alyosha to tell Katerina that he cannot be engaged to her anymore and also asks Alyosha to get 3000 rubles from his father so he can pay Katerina back Alyosha sadly agrees He goes to his fathers house where he argues about God with Ivan In the middle of their argument Dmitry suddenly runs in and all hell seemed to have broken loose He beats up his father and threatens to kill him someday Alyosha helps his hurt father and goes to visit Katerina at Mrs Khokalovs house

When he goes there he is shocked to see Grushenka there too Grushenka had just promised Katerina she would not marry Dmitry and she would marry a lover she used to have long ago instead Katerina is so happy she cries out that Grushenka is a dear angel and that she has brought me back to life and made me happy Katerina even kisses Grushenkas hands and lips and acted as though she were in love with Grushenka But Grushenka suddenly insults Katerina saying she might stay with Dmitry after all just now I thought to myself And what if I take a fancy to him again that Mitya fellow since I took a fancy to him once and it lasted nearly a whole hour I may even go right now and tell him to come and stay with meThats how fickle I am She also broken wikt linkmaliciousmaliciously talks about Katerinas visit to Dmitry at night crying going to visit gentlemen after dark to try and peddle your charms for money Why I know all about that This makes Katerina so angry she goes into a hysterical fit As Alyosha goes out of the house a maid gives him a letter from Lise Lise writes that she loves him and wants to marry him Alyosha laughs quietly and sweetly as he reads the letter and praying for all the sad people he loves he goes to a peaceful sleep

Zosima knowing he will die soon talks to the monks and to Alyosha about faith love and goodness He also says that humans should not be judgmental and above all rememberdo not be proud He also says Do not hateNever cease to explain the Gospels to the peopleDo not be avariciousDo not hoardHave faith and defend its banner Raise it raise it high

Alyosha goes to visit Mrs Khokhlakovs house to see Katerina On the way he sees a group of boys throwing rocks at another small boy who proudly and broken wikt linkfiercefiercely fights back When the boy runs away Alyosha tries to talk to him but the boy hits him with a rock and bites his finger Alyosha is concerned and sad

He is surprised to see Ivan with Katerina and realizes they love each other very much He tries to make them be honest with themselves and realize their own feelings but they are too proud to do so Ivan broken wikt linkscornscornfully thinks his love is not important and that Katerina needs Dmitry in her life not him Katerina who has been very hurt because of Dmitry thinks that she can never be happy and everybody will betray her in the end so she proudly tries to sacrifice herself for other people Ivan leaves

Katerina tells Alyosha that Dmitry beat and broken wikt linkhumiliatehumiliated a man named Captain Snegriev in front of his young son and she asked him to very tactfully very delicately as you and you only can dotry to give him these two hundred roubles Alyosha agrees He goes to Captain Snegrievs house and finds out that he is suffering even more than they knew he was extremely poor his children were sick and his wife was mad and Dmitrys angry humiliation of him had taken away his honor too He also realizes that Ilyusha his son was the boy who bit his finger angrily and now he knows that Ilyusha did like that because he was Dmitrys brother and because a rock hit Ilyusha in the chest he has gotten very sick Alyosha tries to give the 200 roubles to Captain Snegriev At first he is overjoyed but he is too proud to take it and throwing the money down runs away crying

Alyosha has lunch with his brother Ivan in a restaurant and Ivan explains to him why he cannot believe in God Listen if everyone must suffer in order to buy eternal harmony with their suffering pray tell me what have children to do with it Its quite broken wikt linkincomprehensibleincomprehensible why they should have to suffer and why they should buy harmony with their suffering He says that to love God would be like a tortured man loving his torturer Alyosha reminds Ivan about Christ and Ivan in a famous chapter of the book says a prose poem he made up called The Grand broken wikt linkinquisitorInquisitor

The Grand Inquisitor is a story about how in the 16th century Jesus comes to a town in Spain He begins to heal sick people but a very powerful cardinal puts him in jail At night the cardinal says to Jesus that free will for humans is bad and impossible You overestimated themMan is weak and broken wikt linkdespisedespicable He talks about Jesus rejecting to Satans three broken wikt linktempttemptations were wrong He says that people with free will are usually too weak to have strong faith and most people will be damned forever Because of this he says the Church is trying to give people security instead of freedom He finishes his speech by saying angrily if anyone has ever deserved our fire it is You and I shall have you burned tomorrow Dixi He waits for his prisoner to say something But suddenly quietly Jesus goes to the old man and kisses him gently on his old bloodless lips And that is His only answer The Grand Inquisitor shocked lets Jesus out and says he must never come back Jesus leaves When Alyosha asks What about the old man Ivan replies The kiss broken wikt linkglowglows in his heartBut the old man sticks to his old idea

As Ivan finishes his story he says everything is permitted but then will you too turn your back on me But Alyosha goes to him and kisses him softly on his lips Ivan is touched and says Alyosha took that from his poem Ivan leaves and Alyosha goes back to Zosima who is dying

Alyosha hears Zosimas last lesson of love and forgiveness for everyone saying that humans should not judge each other but have trust in God He says that Alyosha reminds him of his older brother who died when he was young When Elder Zosima was young he had been a wild and impious man in the army He had challenged another man to a duel because of a girl Before the duel however his heart was changed and after the other man shot at him he did not shoot his gun at the other person He left the army and joined the broken wikt linkmonasterymonastery shortly after He talks about how much he loves the Bible and how people should all love each other When he has finished his speech he suddenly goes down to the floor opens his arms as if he is embracing the world praying and kissing the groundas he had taught others to doquietly and joyfully he gave up his soul to God Zosimas last lesson is very different from Ivans arguments and the story about the guilty man who repented becomes free and is forgiven is almost an opposite with the story of the Grand Inquisitor where an innocent man is put in jail and judged Zosima dies happy and his final act is a symbol of everything he taught in his life

Most people all think that because Zosima was so holy his body will not decay and some miracle will happen It shocks everybody when Zosimas body begins to have a bad smell and decay very quickly after his death His enemies rudely say this means Zosima was not a saint but an evil person in disguise for instance broken wikt linkharshharsh Father Ferapont crazily tries to make demons go out of Zosimas room Alyosha is very very shocked and feels even angry that God could let such a wiseholy and good man like Zosima be so humiliated He feels doubtful and sad and without thinking says yes when Rakitin makes him visit Grushenka Rakitin and Grushenka both wanted Alyosha to be sinful like them But instead of his broken wikt linkpuritypurity becoming defiled Alyosha and Grushenka become comforted by each other They become friends Grushenka makes Alyosha have faith and hope again after Zosimas death and Alyosha helps the confused Grushenka spiritually That night he sees Zosima in a dream and Zosima tells him he has done a good deed for Grushenka He wakes up standing and going outside falls down and kisses the earth like how Zosima died He did not know why he was hugging the earth why he could not kiss it enough why he longed to kiss it allHe kissed it again and again drenching with his tears vowing to love it always alwaysHe was a weak youth when he fell on the ground and he rose a strong and determined fighter He knew itAnd never never thereafter would Alyosha forget that moment

Dmitry tries all kinds of things wildly to try to pay Katerina the money he has stolen from her No one will borrow him the money and he has nothing to sell Finally he goes to Grushenkas house and when he finds she is not there he rushes to his fathers house There he is caught by Gregory an old servant and panicking he hits Gregory and leaves him bloody and broken wikt linkunconsciousunconscious He goes back to Grushenkas house and is shocked when he hears that Grushenka went back to her old lover He decides he must kill himself but wants to see Grushenka one last time before he does However when he goes to see Grushenka her real lover is actually a silly old and ugly Pole who cheats at cards When Grushenka sees him cheat and hears the coarse and mean things he says she realizes she actually loves Dmitry not the Pole When he insults her Dmitry locks him up in the room They begin a wild party with fruit and wine he has bought with thousands of rubles he mysteriously and suddenly has gotten and he and Grushenka plan their future together Dmitry is still worried about paying Katerina back and he is afraid Gregory might die Suddenly some officers rush in and arrest him Fyodor Karamazov has been murdered and they think Dmitry did it

The police question Dmitry and are very suspicious of him because he has suddenly gotten so much money and because everybody said he had blood on his hands as soon as he came out of his fathers house They say he must stand on trial Dmitry says that the money he had was gotten this way when he had stolen money from Katerina he had spent only half of it and sewed the rest secretly into a little bag and when he had heard Grushenka had run off with the Pole he had decided to just spend the rest of it in a wild party before he killed himself however nobody believes him and he is put in jail

Meanwhile Alyosha has made friends with the schoolboys who had been throwing rocks at Ilyusha and makes them be friends again Alyosha helps Ilyushas family and all the boys love him very much He becomes friends with Kolya a boy about two years older than Ilyusha who is proud and immensely enjoyed bossing the younger boys around Kolya is very impressed with Alyosha and says theres only one person in the world who can tell Kolya Krasotkin what to do meaning Alyosha he even cries Oh Karamazov well become very close friends And shall I tell you what I like most about you Its that you treat me just like an equal But we are not equalsyou are by far my superior Kolya is very clever and knows it but when he talks to Alyosha about what he thinks of life Alyosha quickly sees that his philosophy is just lots of ideas mixed up together from Rakitin however Alyosha respectfully listens to him and tells him clearly what he thinks about life A doctor that Katerina sent comes and says that Ilyusha will die and Kolya finally begins to cry out loud at the sight of his sick unhappy friend

Alyosha visits Grushenka who has changed spiritually Even though she is still fiery tempered and proud there is a new gentleness in her He also visits Lise who has become extremely hysterical She says she does not want to marry him and often laughs and cries for no reason She says she hates the world and wants to die When he leaves she slams the door on her finger and whispers Im a vile vile vile broken wikt linkdespisedespicable creature Alyosha meets Ivan and tells Ivan that he knows that Ivan thinks that he is involved in the murder of his father and says It was not you who killed fatherit was not you not you God has sent me to tell you this Surprised and troubled Ivan hurries angrily away

Ivan has been visiting Smerdyakov who keeps on saying he knows that Ivan secretly wanted Fyodor Pavlovich Karamazov to die Feeling worried and guilty he goes to visit Katerina who shows him a letter written by Dmitry when he was drunk threatening to kill his father and get the 3000 roubles Ivan decides that Dmitry has killed his father until he visits Smerdyakov again and Smerdyakov openly admits that he killed Fyodor Pavlovich Smerdyakov also says that he was able to do this because of Ivans ideas that everything was allowed Ivan is horrified and so guilty he sees a devil that keeps on taunting him and finally goes mad on the day Smerdyakov hangs himself

The next day the trial of Dmitry Karamazov opened in the court Katerina tells the story of Dmitry helping her father and giving her money without saying anything bad about him The clever lawyer Fetyukovich makes all the witnesses who think Dmitry is guilty look silly Dmitrys case seems to be going well until Ivan comes and says that he has murdered his father which makes everybody confused Then Katerina horrified jumps up and screams that Ivan is innocent and shows everybody the letter Dmitry wrote to her doing the very opposite of her first broken wikt linktestimonytestimony Immediately after this she feels so guilty and sad for betraying Dmitry that she goes into hysterics The prosecutor Ippolit Kirrillovich say that Dmitry is guilty not crazy and that he has done the worst sin a son killing his own father On the other hand the lawyer Fetyukovich says that there is no real proof that Dmitry is guilty and that Fyodor Pavlovich Karamazov was never a real father to Dmitry he also says that the only way for Dmitry to start a new life is to be set free Almost everybody think Dmitry is innocent feel sorry for him and think he will be set free However the jury says he is guilty and he is put into jail to wait for his broken wikt linkexileexile to Siberia

After the trial Katerina takes Ivan to her house and nurses him Alyosha asks her to see Dmitry who has decided to escape and she agrees She goes to see Dmitry and they forgive each other Grushenka suddenly comes in and is shocked to see Katerina Katerina asks her to forgive her too but Grushenka angrily says no Katerina hurries away and Alyosha who has seen everything goes to Ilyushas funeral he has died There he says a speech to the schoolboys about love and forgiveness asking them to remember this day always and the book ends hopefully with the boys cheering Three cheers for Karamazov

Dostoevsky calls him the hero of The Brothers Karamazov At the beginning of the book Dostoevsky describes him

He is special because of his very deep faith in God his unselfishness and his love for all humans He refuses to judge people and often is very broken wikt linksensitivesensitive to other peoples feelings He is gentle modest and very kind but never foolish or nave and because of this almost everybody likes and trusts him The gift of making people love him was inherent in him he gained peoples affection directly and effortlessly it was part of his nature Dmitry calls him the cherub Fyodor Pavlovich Karamazov had come to love his son deeply and sincerely in fact his feelings for Alyosha were such as a man like him could never have expected to have for anyone He says to Alyosha with you alone I feel like a decent person at certain moments and that Alyosha is his only true sonthe only one Im not afraid of Ivan says that he likes Alyosha because he has strong beliefs and is one of the only people he talks really sincerely to While Ivan is horrified at childrens sufferings and says that this is one of the reasons why he cannot believe in God Alyosha actively helps and loves children like Kolya and Ilyusha He is almost a symbol of love and forgiveness and represents the spiritual part of mankind He influences the schoolboys and teaches them what Zosima taught him

Also called Dmitri Mitka Mitenka Mitri Fyodorovich

He is described as unruly as a boy and as a young manirresponsible violent passionate unruly impatient He has Alyoshas good heart but his fathers sensuality He is usually controlled by his strong emotions like when he runs madly after Grushenka even after he had engaged with and sincerely even loved Katerina He is a symbol of humans and their struggle between good and evil and more especially the bodily part of mankind The prosecutor in the book says Dmitry Karamazov represents Russia directly as it is todayshe is all there our old mother Russia we can smell her Oh like him we are such asincere people we are an amazing mixture of good and evil we love enlightenment and Schiller but we also love to rage and storm in broken wikt linktaverntaverns and to tear out the beards of our drunken drinking companions He becomes a better and stronger man in the end and this shows the writers belief in hope for humankind

Also called Vanka Vanechka

The brother of Alyosha by the same mother Sofia Ivan is perhaps one of the most complicated characters in the story He is an extremely clever student and is proud and filled with doubt Dmitry calls him silent as the grave He cannot believe in God or thinks that if God is real he must be a very mean God who doesnt care about humans He says that everything is possible there is no good or bad However he is disgusted at the life of his father which logically is right according to his beliefs He is too proud to follow his own happiness by acting on his own love for Katerina His final madness shows the novels rejection of his beliefs The sad problem with Ivan is that his head is not in harmony with his heart with his feelings he loves Gods world although with his reason he cant accept it Ivan has both a strong sense of justice like Alyosha and is unhappy at the suffering of children but unlike Alyosha who actively makes friends with and helps children Ivan does not do anything about it It is unclear what will happen to him but the novel ends so cheerfully it suggests he will probably find some way of spiritual broken wikt linkredeemredemption

The father of Dmitry Ivan Alyosha and probably Smerdyakov Lustful vulgar lying coarse and without caring about who he hurts he is extremely selfish and cares only about his own desires He is more afraid of Ivan than Dmitry but he likes Alyosha even though he likes to tease and scare him He does not care much about his sons or his wives Joyce Carol Oates describes him as a certain perverse blend of the broken wikt linkdegradedegraded and the spiritual a brilliant comic creation who cannot sit down to drink without questioning the meaning of life However together with his lustfulness there is a surprising simpleness in him As a general rule people even the wicked are much more naive and simple hearted than we suppose And we ourselves are too

Also called Grusha Grushka

Betrayed when she was young by a lover she comes to town and makes almost all the men in the town fall in love with her Dmitry and Fyodor Karamazov both love her and hate each other because of her The book says in all fairness it must be said she was very very beautiful and her beauty was that typical Russian beauty which inspires passion in so many menShe was twenty two and she looked exactly her age She is very clever for instance she saves up money very well proud and actually much purer than most people think She likes to torture both Dmitry and his father for fun to laugh at them and to have revenge for the hurt she received from her first lover she can also be quite broken wikt linkcrueltycruel like when she lied to Katerina hurting and insulting her However a hidden gentleness sincerity and kindness inside her opens up and begins to grow after she becomes friends with Alyosha Alyosha said I expected to find a wicked soulBut instead I have found a true sister a treasure a loving soul

Silent broken wikt linkcunningcunning Smerdyakov is the son of an idiot woman named Stinking Lizaveta which is where his name comes from He was brought up by the servants Martha and Gregory and later became Fyodor Karamazovs cook He has epilepsy and is very mean sometimes showing his evil openly and sometimes pretending to be very humble and afraid He sometimes plays the guitar to Maria the landladys daughter He has great respect for Ivan and Ivans beliefs strongly influence his murder of Mr Karamazov He is Ivans shadow and puts into action all Ivans secret thoughts and wishes He hangs himself later

Smerdyakov is almost Ivans double at times when Alyosha asks him politely if he knows where Dmitry is he replies coldly Its not as if I were his keeper A few pages later Ivan says You are always harping upon it What have I to do with it Am I my brother Dmitris keeper Later when Fyodor Pavlovich is drunkenly talking about how he made Alyoshas mother Sofya become unhappy by insulting her God Ivan angrily reminds him that Sofya was his mother too Fyodor exclaims in surprise

Your motherWhat do you mean What mother are you talking about Was sheWhy damn it of course she was yours tooExcuse me why I was thinking IvanHe he he He stopped A broad drunken half senseless grin overspread his face

It is possible that he was thinking that Ivan was Lizavetas son  perhaps he even confused Ivan with Smerdyakov himself

A brave proud and clever young boy who makes friends with Alyosha after Ilyusha becomes ill

Inside The Brothers Karamazov people struggle between religious faith and doubt When Fyodor Karamazov asks Is there a God or not Ivan says No there is no God Fyodor turns to Alyosha Alyosha does God exist Alyosha firmly answers God does exist Dostoevsky writes in his book that a life of faith is higher better purer and happier than a life of doubt cold hurting and confusing Zosima and Alyosha love humans and are a symbol of faith while Dostoevsky shows that he thinks that doubt is bad by Ivans madness and Smerdyakovs murder Dostoevsky also shows in the chapter The Grand Inquisitor that though faith may not be able to be solved by logic there is something in it deep moving and impossible to explain by words like in Jesus and Alyoshas kiss or in Zosimas bowing down to the ground It also searches about free will Ivan says that free will is a heavy burden while Zosima and Alyosha agree that free will is a joy and a gift of God to humans Another important theme is that of forgiveness Zosima says everyone must forgive and love and Alyosha never judges or criticizes people Zosima says that people should forgive each other freely because peoples sins are so connected with each other that everybody has some responsibility for each other like when Dmitry without thinking much about it grabs Captain Snegrievs beard and pulls him leading finally to Ilyushas death People like Ivan do not like this idea he continues to broken wikt linkinsistinsist that he does not have any responsibility for other peoples sins and when he finally is forced to accept it he becomes insane

Dmitry also though he did not kill his father at first wants to suffer to find peace and a new life Both brothers feel guilty as if they were the ones who killed their father Alyoshas strong sense of responsibility makes Elder Zossima tell him to go out into the world for he has work to do there Dostoevsky thought that people should be married to the world around them for he argues everyone is a part of Gods creation

For the main article see The Grand Inquisitor

The existence of God has concerned people for a long time is there a God or not Dostoevsky broken wikt linkevidentevidently thought there was

He wrote in his books the two opposite sides of the question from Ivan the atheist intellectuals view and the Elder Zosimas view The author called the part in which Ivan and Elder Zosima each speak their beliefs as the broken wikt linkculminateculminating point of the novel Dostoevsky wrote in his notebook about The Grand Inquisitor Those blockheads have never even conceived so powerful a rejection of God as exists in the Inquisitor and the preceding chapter to which the whole book will serve as answer  Throughout Europe there has not been and does not exist so powerful an expression from the aesthetic point of view as mine

In the book Ivans argument is that there is no justice in the world He is very unhappy with the suffering of people on earth and says I must have retribution or I will destroy myself And not retribution in some remote infinite time and space but here on earth and that I could see myself But there is no absolute justice in the world So Ivan says that there are only two things that can be true either God is not real or if He is real He must be an unjust and unwise God

Ivan has also not forgotten Jesus Christ When Alyosha exclaims Butyou asked whether there was in the world a single creature who could forgive Well there is And He can forgive everyone for everything because He Himself gave His innocent blood for everyones sins and for everyones sake You forgot to mention Him Ivan replies by the story of The Grand Inquisitor In The Grand Inquisitor Ivan shows to Alyosha what he believes is the wrong of Jesus rule and a possibly better more just one

Readers immediately wrote letters to Dostoevsky after Book Five about The Grand Inquisitor was published in great worry and Dostoevsky replied my heros blasphemy will be triumphantly refuted in the next issue on which I am now working with fear trembling and veneration since I consider my task  a broken wikt linkciviccivic deed However when Book Six Dostoevskys answer to The Grand Inquisitor was published he was much more worried I dont know whether I succeeded I reckon myself that I wasnt able to express one tenth of what I wantedI tremble for it in this sense will it be answer enough  I wrote it with a great deal of love DH Lawrence felt that we cannot doubt that the Inquisitor speaks Dostoevskys own final opinion about Jesus

The Elder Zosimas words before he dies is evidently Dostoevskys reply to Ivan Elder Zosima believes in a kind and just Jesus who loves people very dearly and cares for them so much that he died for them

About suffering the Elder Zosima says that since God is kind and just all the suffering comes from man But since everyones lives are connected Elder Zosima says we cannot blame anybody All is like an ocean all is flowing and blending a touch in one place sets up movement at the other end of the earth Instead of demanding justice he says everyone should begin changing and forgiving each other Instead of saying nobody is guilty he says everybody is responsible

The pain of suffering according to Elder Zosima is a passing thing  it will not last He refers to the Book of Job and says

Though Dostoevsky wrote of Elder Zosimas reply as the reply of Ivans arguments he defends Christianity throughout the whole book and through the characters themselves Elder Zosima is happy and respected loved and loving and dies peacefully and joyfully but Ivan who is so unhappy for the justice of humans says I could never understand how one could love ones neighbor and knocks a broken wikt linkpeasantpeasant into the snow to freeze He will freeze thought Ivan and he went on his way And at the end his horror at the thought that he was in a way his fathers murderer drives him insane Elder Zosima however is very different he blesses and helps people even when he is dying and Alyosha almost always noticed that many almost all went in to the elder for the first time with apprehension and broken wikt linkuneasyuneasiness but almost always came out with bright and happy faces Even Ivan respects Father Zosima after meeting him and seriously receives his blessing and kisses his hand

The narrator is unnamed and though he knows the coldness and darkness of the subjects he writes about he writes warmly and inventively in a tone of serious comedy Although the narrator is sometimes allowed to be broken wikt linkomniscentomniscent he also talks of himself as I says things that are not directly related to the plot in a style that some people have criticized It is possible that this writing style is because of the way Dostoevskys books were written in the day he would hurriedly write down ideas in his notebook and at night his wife Anna Snitkina Grigoryevna who was a broken wikt linkstenographstenographer would have them copied neatly out

The critical reception of The Brothers Karamazov has been quite special and strong Dostoevsky published his books in a series of journals and every one made people argue about it and think very much about it Sigmund Freud called it the most magnificent novel ever written Franz Kafka was greatly influenced by Dostoevskys works

Critic Robin Feuer Miller wrote that The Brothers Karamazov was Dostoevskys last and arguably greatest novel

Virginia Woolf said Alone among writers Dostoevsky has the power of reconstructing those most swift and complicated states of mind This is the exact opposite of the method adopted perforce by most of our novelists They reproduce all the external appearances tricks of manner landscape dress and the effect of the hero upon his friends but very rarely and only for an instant penetrate to the broken wikt linktumulttumult of thought which rages within his own mind But the whole broken wikt linkfabricfabric of a book by Dostoevsky is made out of such material We have to get rid of the old tune which runs so persistently in our ears and to realize how little of our broken wikt linkhumanityhumanity is expressed in that old tune 

On 7 June 1880 on the night before his famous Pushkin speech he wrote at midnight to his wife As I walked across the hall during intermission a host of people youths and graybeards and ladies rushed toward me exclaiming Youre our prophet Weve become better people since we read The Karamazovs The next evening after the triumph of his speech he wrote to her When I appeared on the stage the auditorium thundered with applause I bowed and made signs begging them to let me read but to no avail elation enthusiasm

However not everybody loved The Brothers Karamazov Tchaikovsky an important writer of music in Russia was interested in The Brothers Karamazov but finally decided that it was broken wikt linkintoleranceintolerable and that all the characters were crazy Some people like Henry James Vladimir Nabokov and D H Lawrence were very critical of it For example Lawrence said that in The Brothers Karamazov he did not like these broken wikt linkmorbidmorbidly broken wikt linkintrospectiveintrospective Russians morbidly wallowing in adoration of Jesus then getting up and spitting in His beard Its all broken wikt linkmasturbationmasturbation half baked and one gets tired of it One gets tired of being told that Dostoevskys Legend of the Grand Inquisitor is the most profound declaration which ever was made about man and life The more Dostoevsky gets worked up about the tragic nature of the human soul the more I lose interest I have read the Grand Inquisitor three times and never can remember what its really about He also said The Brothers Karamazov was too depressing because alas more drearily true to life At first it had been lurid romance Now I read The Grand Inquisitor once more and my heart sinks right through my shoes

The French Revolution of 1830 also known as the July Revolution was the throwing off of Charles X of France from power His cousin Louis Philippe the Duc dOrlans became king However after 18 hard years on the throne he also would be taken off the position of king It showed the change from one kind of monarchy to another This change was from the Bourbon Restoration to the July Monarchy This also marked the change of power from the House of Bourbon to the House of Orlans People who supported Bourbon would be called Legitimists Supporters of Louis Phillipe were called Orleanists Louis Philippe was king of the French until the French Revolution of 1848

On September 16 1824 Charles X came to the throne of France He was the younger brother of Louis XVIII When Napolon Bonaparte was defeated he had become King of France Both Louis and Charles ruled because of their birth not because a great number of people wanted them to This was the first of two things that began Les Trois Glorieuses the Three Glorious Days of the July Revolution

When Napoleon broken wikt linkabdicateabdicated in 1814 Europe and mostly France was in great confusion The Congress of Vienna met to draw the continents political map again A great number of European countries came to the congress However there were four most important powers that controlled the decision These powers were the United Kingdom Austria Russia and Prussia represented by King Frederick William III Another very imprtant person at the Congress was Charles Maurice de Talleyrand He was a French broken wikt linkdiplomatdiplomat under Napoleon France was considered an enemy state

Talleyrand suggested that Europe go back to its first legitimate government He meant the government before Napoleon This plan was largely accepted by members of the Congress France went back to its 1789 borders and the House of Bourbon came back to the throne In the eyes of the Congress the political situation in France and Europe was now back to normal However the new king Louis XVIII felt that ideas of nationalism and democracy were still in his country So they made and signed the Charte constitutionnelle franaise the French Constitution It is also known as La Charte This was the second thing that began the July Revolution

People quickly learned about the Saint Cloud ordonnances from the Le Moniteur Angrily workers were fired and business closed down Unemployment which had been growing through early summer increased Large numbers of workers therefore had nothing to do but protest

Newspapers such as the Journal des dbats Le Moniteur Universel and Le Constitutionnel had already stopped being put in print This was because of the new law Almost 50 journalists from 12 city newspapers met in the offices of the liberal Le National There they signed a protest and promised their newspapers would continue to run

That evening police came to a news press and took away newspapers that were against the law An angry unemployed mob shouted hotly A bas les Bourbons Vive la Charte Armand Carrel a Republican journalist wrote in the Le National

 France falls back into revolution by the act of the government itself the legal regime is now interrupted that of force has begun in the situation in which we are now placed obedience has ceased to be a duty It is for France to judge how far its own resistance ought to extend

A Baja Bug is an original Volkswagen Beetle changed so that it can operate in open desert sand dunes and beaches Other kinds of air cooled Volkswagens are sometimes changed this way

Baja Bugs were first made in Southern California in the late 1960s as an inexpensive answer to the commercial built Volkswagen based dune buggies of the mid 1960s especially the Meyers Manx

The first Baja Bug may have been built by Gary Emory of Parts Obsolete in or around 1968 The first racing Baja Bug is credited to automotive cartoonist Dave Deal whose car was raced in the Mexican 1000 of 1968 The first fiberglass body kit was introduced in 1969 by the Miller Havens company

In the days before fiberglass body parts builders simply changed a stock VW The cars metal body parts were partially cut away to allow more ground clearance and suspension travel This came to be known as a cut baja More engine power was had by using cylinder heads and sometimes even fuel injection systems from VW Type 3 cars

The Beetle was popular in places with few roads because of its rear mounted air cooled engine flat floorpan and torsion bar suspension In fact magazine advertising of the time said that the Beetle was so watertight it floated These good things made the Beetle the perfect choice to make into an off road car It was successful both then and now in the Baja 1000 off road race

Basic changes are simple Lightweight fiberglass body panels are fitted after the metal body parts front and rear are removed The rear change leaves the engine totally open to aid in cooling Tubular steel bumpers are fitted to the body and floorpan to protect the engine and those riding in the car Shortened fiberglass fenders and sometimes more tubular steel parts are added to the cars sides The torsion bar front and rear suspensions made it easy to raise the body and to allow the use of large off road tires and wheels as well as longer shock absorbers Some people even get rid of the torsion bar suspension and install coilover type springs that mount to a roll cage This kind of car would have lots of suspension travel and a smooth ride

Though few Baja Bugs are built anymore since the creation of tube framed purpose built buggies known as sand rails and the shrinking supply of early Volkswagens they remain a popular choice in the desert since few beaches in the US are open to for use by cars or motorcycles Many are fitted with highly modified Volkswagen engines and a few have engines from such cars as the Ford Pinto Chevrolet Corvair Porsche Mazda Subaru or other four to eight cylinder water cooled engines Fancy Baja Bugs for use only on roads remain popular as well

Volkswagen itself created a concept car in 2000 called Dune and was meant to remind people of the Baja Bug

Comparative anatomy is the scientific comparison of animal bodies The purpose of comparative anatomy is to see their working structure and to decide upon the phylogenetic relationships between different groups of animals The separation of animals into phyla is done mainly by comparative anatomy see List of animal phyla

The main techniques used are dissection and microscopy Dissection is an ancient method used to find out the inside structure of a living thing It is still used by medical students to learn about the details of the human body Simple microscopes were first invented in the 17th century and the compound microscope became available in the 19th century The purpose of microscopy is to let us see the small details of structure Also the careful comparison of large collections of animals is often done

The great era of comparative anatomy was from about 1800 to about 1950 It was used by those who did not believe in evolution such as Georges Cuvier and by those who did such as Thomas Henry Huxley Charles Darwin himself used comparative anatomy as the main tool in his work on barnacles Nowadays the main method used to find out relationships is molecular evolution which uses DNA sequence analysis However for many research purposes zoologists still dissect animals To get a degree in biology you need to know about the structure of animals

Dissection is a standard laboratory technique in biology and pathology To dissect is to cut up a body so as to reveal its structure The body could be that of a human an animal or a plant Dissections are regularly done in autopsies to help determine the cause of death They are done by zoologists to find out the internal structure of animal bodies The comparative anatomy of animals revealed by dissections gives clues as to their evolutionary relationships

List of animal phyla is a list of the major groups af animals usually classified as a phylum Modern sources have been used the list is different from that of Linnaeus or Cuvier A list of this type may be arranged alphabetically but equally it might be arranged according to evolutionary relationships No list will be completely satisfactory Authorities differ in what they consider a phylum and in the actual name of the phylum Despite this there is agreement on most phyla Most modern surveys include groups above the phylum superphyletic groupings based on evidence of common descent 

Differences of opinion about evolutionary relationships have been reduced by the use of molecular evolution and molecular clock research These make use of protein amino acid sequences and whole genome DNA analysis These modern techniques have led to changes and renaming of many higher categories Classification based on traditional comparative anatomy contained errors that needed to be corrected So for example the old phylum Coelenterata which had stood for almost two hundred years was split down into two separate phyla the Cnidaria and the Ctenophora

The following list is based on evolutionary relationships

Major groups in large type

Depending on how one counts the list contains 29 phyla of metazoan animals Of these 17 are minor phyla and at least 18 are exclusively aquatic with several others in quasi aquatic habitats on land None are entirely terrestrial This is testimony to the importance of water for life and to the sea in particular It is fairly certain that all phyla originated in the sea or at any rate in water Most made their first showing in the Cambrian or in the Ediacaran Naturally most of the soft bodied phyla have left few fossils

Phyla may be grouped according to evidence about their evolutionary relationships The list above puts similar groups together for example

Other groupings include

This kind of megataxonomy is becoming more convincing as DNA sequence analysis proceeds through the phyla Some entirely fossil groups are still placed where they are on anatomy and commonsense rather than hard molecular evidence The trilobites are a good example Their position in the Arthropoda is based on not much more than their bilateral symmetry and an exoskeleton These groupings are discussed further in the references to this page

Orthoptera is an order of insects The order contains grasshoppers katydids and crickets Ortho means straight so Orthoptera means straight wings This means the front wings called tegmina that are stiff straight and not used for flying The back wings are broken wikt linkmembranemembranous and are folded like a fan under the front wings when the creature is not flying Many in this order use their wings to make sounds which we usually call chirping noises

Creatures in order Orthoptera begin their life in an egg case After three weeks or when spring comes the tiny broken wikt linknymphnymphs come out from the egg case After four or five broken wikt linkmoltmolts they have wings that let them fly This shows that they are adults and are ready to reproduce

In the order Orthoptera members chew their food moving their mandibles sideways  not up and down like humans do Crickets are omnivores which means they eat both plants and animals Actually they will eat almost anything vegetables cereal and even their own mate if they are hungry enough Katydids are mostly herbivores though they will eat their own mate too if they are hungry enough They also enjoy eating aphids and other small slow moving creatures Grasshoppers almost always eat plants like grass wheat bran and lettuce but this does not make them much better than the others they can be terrible crop pests

Its quite hard to catch a member of Orthoptera because they jump so well They have amazing legs  a grasshopper can jump 20 times farther than the length of its body Their back legs are very large and long These long strong legs give these insects their great ability to jump

Crickets katydids and grasshoppers belong to the same order of Orthoptera because they are alike in lots of ways However there are several things that make them different from each other

First their colors are usually quite different Since grasshoppers like to move during the daytime their colors are similar to grass and bright flowers making them usually green light brown or multicolored Crickets move at night so they are dark Katydids like to spend a lot of time on leaves so they are often leaf colored and their wings can look like leaves Their wings can have the same vein patterns as leaves and they often have little brown spots just like the ones that might be found on a leaf

Thirdly their antennae is different Katydids and crickets usually have long thin antennae while grasshoppers usually have short thick ones Of course this rule does is not perfect for instance even though grasshoppers usually have short thick antennae the long horned grasshopper has long thin antennae like a cricket Because of this it is still sometimes hard to tell the members of this order apart

Delgadillos Snow Cap Drive In is a historic small restaurant and roadside attraction along a part of what used to be Route 66 in Seligman Arizona USA The drive in was built in 1953 by a man who lived in the town Juan Delgadillo Delgadillo had very little money so he built the restaurant mostly from scrap lumber he found at the nearby Santa Fe Railroad yard

Delgadillo thought of a fun way to bring attention to his new restaurant He cut the roof off of a 1936 Chevrolet put paint horns and emblems from other cars all over it and placed an artificial Christmas tree in the rear of the car

Delgadillos had a sense of humor which could be seen both on his car and on his menu That menu still has such choices as a cheeseburger with cheese and dead chicken Juans Garden at the rear of the restaurant is just as funny That is the place Mr Delgadillo kept his collection of old cars and other strange things  Even the building itself has strange and funny things written on it Hand painted signs in the parking area warn drivers that they are parking at their own risk A neon sign in the window tells people Sorry were open The door which leads inside has two knobs one on the right and one on the left The knob on the right is fake the one on the left opens the door Delgadillo would have fun with his customers by asking for example if they wanted cheese on their cheeseburgers

While learning about the history of Route 66 for the 2006 DisneyPixar motion picture Cars John Lasseter met Delgadillos brother Seligman barber and Route 66 expert Angel Delgadillo who told him how traffic through the town almost completely went away on the day that nearby Interstate 40 opened

Since Delgadillos death in 2004 the Snow Cap has been run by his sons John Michael and Robert They both work the counter and play with the customers like their father did The walls around the counter area itself are covered with business cards from all over the world

Author Michael Wallis covers the history of the Snow Cap in his book Route 66 The Mother Road

Brachiopods are a phylum of small marine shellfish sometimes called lampshells They are not common today but in the Palaeozoic they were one of the most common types They lived near the shore but now they have been pushed into deeper water by competition from bivalve molluscs They do look rather like bivalves but their internal organisation is quite different

Brachiopods have a huge fossil record going back to the Cambrian They were much reduced by the two main extinction events the PTr and KT Bivalve molluscs took over their inshore habitats in the Mesozoic and since then the brachiopods have been confined to deeper water except for a handful of species There are about 100 to 350 species living the fossil species number 12000

I have recieved an email from the AdminCHU Majorly advising that he aknowledges my alternative account UserNotGiven and in a recent RFA I voted twice under both Kennedy and NotGiven NotGivens vote has been struck by me and the password scrambled and email address removed hence completely retiring him 

I created NotGiven for two reasons There was a lot of arguing and bickering at that time and I wanted to see how the community reacted to a new member Overall positively but with a smattering of suspicion Once I completed this I was intent on doing the above and dumping NotGiven however I began to enjoy editing without the need for drama and he stayed as a undeclared sockpuppet which is not forbidden unless it is harmful to the project or votes twice As I explained to the Majorly NotGivens vote was entirely accidental as you know I have not been active here for a while and I forgot I had already voted when I logged in under NotGiven I looked at the voters and must have missed my signature and voted again I assure you it was accidental I was very careful in the past not to cross wires with my other account however this time I failed The vote has been struck 

I will however note that Majorly performed a CHU back in May last year when NotGiven was first born something I am especially displeased at There was no valid reason to do this as NotGiven was not harmful to the project Now that I have been made aware at the double vote I have struck it Majorly has asked me to quietly resign my Admin and Bureaucrat tools however I feel that the communities trust is the most important thing I was voted unanimously into admin and bureaucrat and I would be sorry to lose everyones trust I decided to run a de rfa to allow everyone to have their say I can confirm that I have no other accounts anywhere and for the purposes of this would agree to a CHU being performed again if required

Apologies to all my delay in writing this rather short comment on the whole situation First of all I would like to state that at no time between NotGivens appearence and the strike NotGivens vote on my latest RfA was I aware that Kennedy and NotGiven were the same Whilst admitedly I do not have any physical evidence to back this up I can give everyone my absolute word that I was not aware of this  nor suspicious  and if at any point I had been made aware I would first and foremost have spoken to Kennedy about the circumstances both suggesting he let the CUs know and possibly declaring and also I would have brought up the fact that he had double voted on my RfA with him Am I surprised at this Yes I am genuinely But not simply at the fact that Kennedy was operating an alternate account but also the way that everyone has handled it  its one vote thats gone awry and I dont think there was any malicious or vote stacking intentions behind it the Kennedy that I know out of wiki just wouldnt do that Im pretty certain I can remember worse instances of abuse I just cant lay my hands on the diffs Anyway to continue with my questions Do I agree with the socking No of course But with the benefit of hindsight I can understand why it was done and to be honest wouldnt have had any problems had Kennedy later come out and admitted to it  because up until now there had been no problems with the two accounts no overlap nada Finally do I still trust Kennedy Yes of course I do This isnt anything about his continued support for myself but its about the fact that hes a damn good editor and a damn good administrator and knows what he is doing I really dont see this as something to de admin over though I am still making my mind up about whether I will vote or not due to a COI that could exist If anyone has any questions about what ive said please ask away and Ill clarify whatever I can Finally I just want to re iterate that I had no idea about any of this until it was brought on wiki Kind regards Goblin 2246 7 January 2010 I Shappy

Popularity is the act of being well liked or common Popularity figures are an important part of many peoples personal value systems and forms a critical part of success in fields such as Management politics Entertainment Industry among others

Many different virarities of popularity exist and many ways in which to gain it General popularity usually involves respect in two ways a popular person is respected by groups of people and will take that respect thus reinforces relief of deserving the popularity Likewise amicability is an important part of popularity as a person who does not like others is unlikely to be liked by others This inverse nature of interpersonal popularity is often overlooked by people who are attempting to become popular being loud may be successful in gaining attention but is unlikely to provide mutual respect

A teleological argument or argument from design is an argument for the existence of God or a creator According to the argument there is evidence for order purpose design or direction in nature The word Teleological comes from the Ancient Greek telos which means end or purpose 

Teleology is the supposition that there is purpose or directive principle in the works and processes of nature Immanuel Kant called this argument the Physicotheological proof 

Most of the classic forms of this argument are linked to monotheism Simply talking about a designer gives the following simple formulation

A concise and whimsical teleological argument was offered by G K Chesterton in 1908 So one elephant having a trunk was odd but all elephants having trunks looked like a plot

Socrates argued that the adaptation of human parts to one another such as the eyelids protecting the eyeballs could not have been due to chance and was a sign of wise planning in the universe

Plato posited a demiurge of supreme wisdom and intelligence as the creator of the cosmos in his work Timaeus For Plato the demiurge lacked the supernatural ability to create ex nihilo or out of nothing The demiurge was able only to organize the ananke The ananke was the only other co existent element or presence in Platos cosmogony Platos teleological perspective is also built upon the analysis of a priori order and structure in the world that he had already presented in The Republic

Aristotle also developed the idea of a creator of the cosmos often referred to as the Prime Mover in his work Metaphysics Aristotles views have very strong aspects of a teleological argument specifically that of a prime mover who looks ahead in setting the cosmos into motion Indeed Aristotle argued that all nature reflects inherent purposiveness and direction

Cicero also made one of the earliest known teleological arguments In de Natura Deorum Cicero stated The divine power is to be found in a principle of reason that pervades the whole of nature He was writing from the cultural background of the Roman religion In Roman mythology the creator goddess Gaia was borrowed from Greek mythology The Romans called her Tellus or Terra

Augustine of Hippo presented a classic teleological perspective in his work City of God He describes the city of man and essentially posits that Gods plan is to replace the city of man with the city of God Whether this is to happen gradually or suddenly is not made clear in Augustines work He did not however make a formal argument for the existence of God rather Gods existence is already presumed and Augustine is giving a proposed view of Gods teleology Augustines perspective follows from and is built upon the neo Platonic views of his era which in turn have their original roots in Platos cosmogony

The first premise assumes that one can infer the existence of intelligent design merely by examining an object The teleological argument assumes that because life is complex it must have been designed It is argued that this is non sequitur logic Life or objects are described as orderly or ordered which implies that an intelligent designer has ordered them However in reality there are examples of systems that are non random or ordered simply because it is following natural physical processes for example diamonds or snowflakes

The design claim is often challenged as an argument from ignorance since it is often unexplained or unsupported or explained by unscientific conjecture Supporters of design assume that natural objects and man made objects have similar properties therefore both must be designed However different objects can have similar properties for different reasons such as stars and light bulbs Proponents must therefore demonstrate that only design can cause orderly systems or the argument is invalid

A designed organism would on the face of it be in contradiction to evolutionary theory Most biologists support the idea of evolution by means of natural selection They therefore reject the first premise arguing that evolution is not only an alternative explanation for the complexity of life but a better explanation with more supporting evidence Living organisms obey the same physical laws as inanimate objects A range of chemical reactions could take place forming other chemicals with complex properties and ways of interacting Over very long periods of time self replicating structures could arise and later form DNA This has in fact been demonstrated artificially via the Avida program which can construct complex programs without being given any design Biologists therefore commonly view the design argument as an unimpressive argument for the existence of a god

Another argument states that even if the argument from design proved the existence of a powerful intelligent designer it would not prove that the designer is God Voltaire observed in his Trait de mtaphysique

 from this sole argument I cannot conclude anything further than that it is probable that an intelligent and superior being has skillfully prepared and fashioned the matter I cannot conclude from that alone that this being has made matter out of nothing and that he is infinite in every sense

David Hume pointed out that the argument does not necessarily lead to the existence of one God In his Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion the character Philo argued amidst other counterarguments to the teleological argument why may not several deities combine in contriving and framing the world

Critics such as Richard Dawkins often argue that the teleological argument would in turn apply to the proposed designer arguing any designer must be at least as complex and purposeful as the designed object This they say would create the absurdity of an infinite series of designers

Whilst the Universe can at first seem be purposeful and ordered it has been asserted that upon closer inspection its true function becomes questionable Some scientists such as Richard Dawkins a high profile advocate of atheism reject the claim that the Universe serves any actual function claiming that the Universe merely mimics purpose For example predators appear perfectly designed to catch their prey whilst their prey seem equally well designed to evade them Likewise apparent inconsistencies in the design of organisms have been brought to attention by critics of the teleological argument Some use such arguments to point towards natural selection as a blind biological designer as opposed to GodCitation neededdateJuly 2008

Proponents of teleology have argued against this objection on various grounds For example William A Dembski says that such arguments are based upon presumptions about what a designer would or would not do and so constitute a theological rather than scientific claim Not knowing the designer he continues they are in no position to say whether the designer proposed a faulty compromise among those design objectives

Additionally the claim of an apparent inconsistency between the design of predators and prey ignores the balance of the ecosystem Dembski counters In criticizing design critics tend to place premium on functionalities of individual organisms and see design as optimal to the degree that those individual functionalities are maximized But higher order designs of entire ecosystems might require lower order designs of individual organisms

George H Smith in his book Atheism The Case Against God points out what he considers to be a fatal flaw in the argument from design Consider the idea that nature itself is the product of design How could this be demonstrated Nature as we have seen provides the basis of comparison by which we distinguish between designed objects and natural objects We are able to infer the presence of design only to the extent that the characteristics of an object differ from natural characteristics Therefore to claim that nature as a whole was designed is to destroy the basis by which we differentiate between artifacts and natural objects Evidences of design are those characteristics not found in nature so it is impossible to produce evidence of design within the context of nature itself Only if we first step beyond nature and establish the existence of a supernatural designer can we conclude that nature is the result of conscious planning

The 2009 American science fiction film Avatar directed by James Cameron is set on the fictional world of Pandora which is a tropical Earth like moon of the fictional planet Polyphemus in the Alpha Centauri system

The Navi are a fictional indigenous species that live on the fictional world of Pandora in the film Avatar They look like humans having pairs of eyes ears arms and legs as well as a nose a mouth and expressions that are similar to humans The Navi differ by having blue skin pointed ears huge eyes and tails They are also taller but also have more narrow proportions in body frame The Navi were meant to be more alien in their looks Director James Cameron said that when one of the main characters Neytiri was first drawn she had fins gills and other protuberances As well as cat like features the species was redesigned to look more like humans so audiences could relate to them better Cameron said that Avatar was more science fantasy than true science fiction and said that he would explain in the novel for the film why in the fictional universe the Navi look like humans

According to Entertainment Weekly The Navi can commune with animals on their planet by literally plugging their ponytails into the creatures nerve systems To become a warrior a Navi must tame and ride a creature known as Ikran The Navi also use this neural bonding system to mate with a life partner a bond that when made cannot be broken in the Navis lifetime

The Navi language a constructed language was made for the film to be spoken by the actors when they played Navi characters The Navi language was made by linguistics professor Paul Frommer of University of Southern California Frommer designed the language so it could be spoken by human actors and it combines syntactic and grammatical rules from other existing languages The professor made up over 1000 words for the Navi language and taught the actors who played Navi characters to speak it for the film

Renault F1 is a Formula One racing team It was once owned by the Renault company In December of 2010 Renault sold their remaining part of the Formula One team Renault has a long history in F1 Ferenc Szisz won the first French Grand Prix at the wheel of a Renault Since then Renault has competed in Formula One as an engine supplier and as a builder from the late 1970s to the present day with many breaks Renault introduced the turbo engine to Formula One when they debuted their first car the Renault RS01 at Silverstone in 1977 Although the Renault team won races and competed for world titles it was as a supplier of engines to the Benetton and Williams teams in the 1990s that Renault first tasted world championship success Renault Engines powered drivers such as Nigel Mansall Damon Hill Jacque Villeneuve and Michael Schumacer to the Drivers World Championship Renault returned to the job of being a builder in 2001 by taking over the Benetton team which was renamed Renault in 2002 Their first championship as a builder was achieved in 2005 the same year that they won their first drivers championship with former test driver Fernando Alonso They repeated their success in the following year 

The teams lowest point so far was in late 2009 at the end of the 2008 season the team saw a brief return to the podium spots with Fernando Alonso winning 2 of the last 4 races However Nelson Piquet Jnr Who had drove for Renualt throughout the 2008 season told the media that the team had made him cheat in order to help Alonso win

At the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix Nelson Piquet Jnr lost control of his car at the outside of Turn 17 sliding across the road and smashing into a wall throwing lots of debris across the road meaning the Safety Car had to be called out to lead the cars through the track slowly to protect the Marshalls cleaning the road This closed the gaps between the cars meaning they were now racing very close together This allowed Fernando Alonso who was in 15th place to pass the slower less experienced drivers around him Alonso went on to win race After Renualt fired Piquet Jnr for his poor driving in 2009 He told the FIA That Flavio Briatore the Boss of the Renualt F1 Team had told him over the radio to crash the car deliberately in order to bring the saftey car out and give Alonso a better chance Alonso was not aware of this at the time or before to the crash

Following a meeting of the FIA Super Council in Paris Team Principle Flavio Briatore and Chief Engineer Pat Symmonds were found guilty Both had to leave the team and Flavio was banned from Formula 1 for life In connection with the event Renault F1s main Sponsor ING Insurance Also left the team

On 8 December 2010 Renault announced that they had sold their remaining ownership shares in the team to Genii Capital a private investment group Those shares will be purchased by Lotus Cars which is owned by Proton Proton owns Lotus Cars The team will be named Lotus Renault GP for 2011 They will continue to use Renault as the chassis name The cars will use a black and gold livery It will be similar to the historic John Player Special sponsorship that Lotus had in the 1970s and 1980s

The team has raced as a French team since Renault took over Benetton in 2002 In January 2011 it was announced that they will race under a British licence in F12011 This is the first time since F11975 that there has not been a French team in Formula One

The liverworts are a group of simple plants Molecular evidence based on mitochondrial DNA suggests strongly that they are the stem group from which mosses hornworts and all higher plants evolvedp75

Liverworts are usually regarded as Bryophytes together with mosses and hornworts Recent taxonomy places them separately in a division called the Marchantiophyta or even the Antheroceratophyta However since the classification is not yet settled we keep the old terms for convenience

Liverworts as the illustration shows are small plants with flattened bodies or with flattened stems bearing overlapping scales or leavesp135

Liverworts have a gametophyte dominant life cycle This is a type of alternation of generations similar to that of mosses Cells in a typical liverwort plant are haploid for most of its life cycle Their stalked sporophytes are very short lived withering away soon after releasing spores

The Planck length is the length at which classical ideas about gravity and space time cease to be valid and quantum effects dominate This is the quantum of length the smallest measurement of length with any meaning 

It is about equal to 16 x 10 35 m or about 10 20 times the size of a proton

It is one of the Planck units defined by Max Planck

Seed dispersal is a seed getting from the parent plant away to a new location Dispersal means spreading or broken wikt linkscatterscattering so seed dispersal simply means the many ways seeds are spread

Although dead animals and plants decompose and refill the soil with new nutrients for plants the nutrients are still limited Sometimes one spot of ground can only raise one healthy plant If the parent plant that made the seeds had all the nutrients the baby plant would die or be very unhealthy However if the parent plant was old and weak the baby plant could grow and have all the nutrients starving the parent plant and finally killing it So there are only a few seeds that just drop straight down from the parent plant onto the same spot of soil because of gravity Instead the fruit usually moves the seeds away

There are about five main ways to disperse seeds humans water wind animals and mechanical means Fruits dispersed by water can float Human dispersal is when people harvest seeds and then plant them to grow crops for food and gardens for beauty Fruits that are dispersed by the wind get blown easily Fruits that are dispersed by animals are carried off by animals Finally mechanical dispersal also called ballistic dispersal is when the fruit is like a little machine that throws the seeds out when they are ready So fruits are like special moving vans for the seeds

An important detail for a wind dispersed seed is that it is usually very light It must be able to float easily on a broken wikt linkbreezebreeze or drop to the ground There are parachutes or little broken wikt linktufttufts on top of some seeds like milkweed and dandelion seeds Some seeds are very small and light almost like dust Orchid seeds and poppy seeds are like that Poppy seeds are inside a little broken wikt linkcapsulecapsule that has little windows around the top On a windy day the poppy fruit capsule will broken wikt linkswaysway from side to side shaking out the tiny seeds out the windows like a salt shaker

Another kind of fruit that can be wind dispersed is the maple tree fruit The maple tree has little schizocarps which are two sided winged fruits They are also called samaras Their lightness and wings help them stay in the air until they have reached a new place with lots of soil Elm and birch trees also have samaras

Human dispersal is usually through farmers They raise many plants for food and even some plants to give us what we need to make clothes Of course all of the seeds that are dispersed by humans have other ways of dispersal too Even though this is the case farming is a way for us to get much of the food we need to live and is a big part of seed dispersal

Water dispersal is also called hydrochory These plants usually grow near the water Once the seed falls into the water it may be carried for a long distance before it finds a place to grow

A good example is the water lily Water lilies beautiful flowers create a fruit that floats in the water for some time and then sinks to the bottom to take root on the floor of a pond The seeds of the water lily can be dispersed and germinated inside the water

The palm tree which grows near the water also disperses its seeds by water Powerful ocean currents that connect continents move the palm trees seeds called coconuts to their new home

The mangrove tree lives right in the water Their seeds fall from the tree and grow roots as soon as they touch soil If there is a lot of water they can be carried far away

Most nuts like acorns walnuts and pecans are dispersed by both water and animals The main way that they are dispersed by water is during flood times or if their plants grow near a river or stream Many nut trees grow near places that flood quite often Though water is important for nut trees its not as important as it is for other plants because many trees have roots that can grow a long way from the tree to find good soil and water

Some fruits can fling their seeds away when they are ripe This is called mechanical dispersal because the fruit is thrown from a little machine It can also be called ballistic dispersal or autochory 

Pea pods often use mechanical dispersal When the seeds are ready the pod dries up When the pod dries the inside of the pod dries faster than the outside This makes the pod twist inside suddenly splitting open violently rolling into a little spiral When this roll happens it makes the seeds fly out of the pod in all directions

The impatiens  called touch me nots or jewel weeds  uses mechanical dispersal too When the seeds are ripe and ready the dried fruit becomes a trigger When an animal or human touches the plant it bursts open and sprays the seeds everywhere If the ground is wet the seeds can germinate right where they land they can also stick to the creature that made the capsule burst open This can help them be carried off to a new place

Violets and gorses use mechanical dispersal too When the seeds are ready it opens with a loud POP sound Another fruit called the squirting cucumber uses mechanical dispersal too There are hundreds of other fruits that use mechanical dispersal

There are several ways of seed dispersal through animals One example are the burrs that stick to your socks and pants when you walk through grassy fields The parent plant makes the spiky little burrs from the flower These burrs are either thrown off the plant and onto the ground or they stay on the plant until a passing animal gets the burr in its fur feathers or socks Then the burr is carried to a new place where animals usually try to get it off themselves Animals will broken wikt linkgnawgnaw broken wikt linkscratchscratch or peck at the burr for hours to take it off The creature will then throw the burr on the ground where it can grow a new plant far far away from the ground that nourishes the parent plant Many fruits of grasses have broken wikt linklatchlatches that can catch onto passing creatures too For instance spear grass has spiky tips that can get stuck in passing animals or blown by a strong wind to a new place

Another way for animals to help in seed dispersal is for the animals to actually plant the seeds themselves Animals like mice squirrels and jay birds collect fruits and nuts during the spring and summer and they store them for the coming winter Many times they save up these fruits and nuts by burying them in the ground  often more than they need So when they come to take their fruits and nuts away they leave a few buried The ones that are left buried become plants

A very often used way of seed dispersal is by seed droppings The animals swallow fruit they digest the soft fruit but the seeds come out through their droppings In some rainforests almost 90 of tree species are dispersed by animalsAnimals like bats  for instance the short tailed fruit bat in South America can scatter up to 60000 seeds in one night

Route Availability is the system by which the permanent way and supporting works of the National Rail network of Great Britain are graded All routes are given an RA number between 1 and 10

Rolling stock is also given an RA and the RA of a train is the highest RA of any of the supporting elements The RA is mainly about the axle load of the vehicle although axle spacing is also taken into thought In practice it is the locomotive which decides where trains may operate although many high capacity four axle wagons have high RAs when fully loaded

Blackberry pie is pie made of blackberry filling most of the time in the form of either blackberry jam blackberries themselves or sometimes both Blackberries must be stewed or soaked in water before baking to stop burning Fresh frozen blackberries sweetened with brown sugar nestled under a double crust and served with ice cream is usually eaten in summer and many people enjoy it as a summer favorite

Hornworts are a group of bryophytes or non vascular plants The name refers to the elongated horn like structure which is the sporophyte The flattened green plant body of a hornwort is the gametophyte plant

Like all bryophytes the hornworts have alternation of generations in which the green plant body is a haploid gametophyte and the sporophyte is the diploid fruiting body

Hornworts may be found world wide growing where it is damp or humid Some species grow in large numbers as tiny weeds in the soil of gardens and cultivated fields Large tropical species of Dendroceros may be found growing on tree bark

The taxonomy of bryophytes is being debated Some think the hornworts should be placed in a separate division the Anthocerotophyta

Lefkada is a Greek island It is in the west of Greece in the Ionian Sea It is the fourth largest island of Ionian Sea after Kefalonia Corfu and Zakynthos Its total area is 303 sq m Its population is 22789 residents according to 2001 Greek census There arent any big cities on the island The largest town of Lefkada is Lefkada Its population is 10875 inhabitants

Lefkada is famous for its beautiful beaches The island is surrounded by many beautiful beaches with azure green color The most impressive beaches are Porto Katsiki Kathisma and Egremnoi All of these beaches are in the west of the island According to Guardian newspaper the Porto Katsiki beach is one of the most beautiful beaches in Europe

Every year many tourists visit lefkada Tourists come from western European countries mainly from Italy The most touristic village on the island is Nidri which is in the east of the island Opposite Nidri there are many small green islets Among them is the islet Scorpios which belonged to millionaire Aristotelis Onassis

The German archaeologist Wilhelm Drpfeld believed that Lefkada was the real country of Odysseus In Classic period Lefkada was a colony of Corinth Later it passed under the Roman rule and Byzantine rule In medieval era many conquerors passed from the island In the thirteenth century Venice took the island from Byzantium The Venetians remained in island for many years The Turks conquered the island for a brief period but the Venetians took the island back and held it until 1797 Then the Napoleons France took the island and after the island passed in England In 1864 the English gave Lefkada to Greece along with the other Ionian islands

The European honey bee or western honey bee is a species of bee The genus Apis is Latin for bee and mellifera comes from Greek melli meaning honey and ferre to bear So the scientific name means honey bearing bee In 1758 Carolus Linnaeus named the bees as Apis mellifera However he later found out that bees do not bear honey but they actually bear nectar Because of this he tried to change it to Apis mellifica later

Workers do a waggle dance in the beehive to tell the others where they have found nectar Karl von Frisch discovered this

The Blue Jay is a passerine bird native to North America It is adaptable aggressive and broken wikt linkomnivorousomnivorous and has been broken wikt linkcolonizingcolonizing new habitats for many decades

The Blue Jay measures 2230 cm from bill to tail and weighs 70100 grams with a wingspan of 3443 cm There is a crown of feathers on the top of the head which may be raised or lowered according to the birds mood When excited or aggressive the crest may be fully raised When scared the crest comes outwards brushlike When the bird is feeding among other jays or resting the crest is flattened to the head

Its broken wikt linkplumageplumage is lavender blue to mid blue in the crest back wings and tail and its face is white The underside is off white and the neck has a thin stripe with black which extends to the sides of the head The wing broken wikt linkprimariesprimaries and tail are deep with black sky blue and white The bill legs and eyes are all black Males and females look nearly the same except that males are a little bit larger

Blue Jays have strong black bills used for cracking open nuts and acorns and for eating corn grains and seeds although they also eat insects such as beetles grasshoppers and caterpillars

Blue Jays can make many different sounds and single sounds may vary broken wikt linkperceptiblyperceptibly in their calling style Blue jays can learn to broken wikt linkmimicmimic human speech Blue jays can also copy the callings of local hawks so well that it is sometimes difficult to tell which it is Their voice is normal of most jays in being varied but the most commonly thought sound is the alarm call which is a loud almost gull like scream There is also a high pitched jayer jayer call that increases in speed as the bird becomes more broken wikt linkagitatedagitatedThis very call can be easily confused with the chick a dees song because of the slow starting chick ah dee ee Blue Jays will use these calls to band together to mob predators such as hawks and drive them away from the jays nests

The Blue Jay is a slow flier and an easy prey for hawks and owls when it flies in open lands It flies with its body and tail held level with slow wing beats It is sometimes assertive toward other birds and may chase birds from bird feeders or other food sources although this happens much less often than it is blamed for This can be good to other species as well as it may chase predatory birds such as hawks and owls which sometimes feed on jays and will scream if it sees a predator within its territory It has also been known to sound an alarm call when hawks or other dangers are near and smaller birds often know this call and hide themselves away accordingly It may also be aggressive towards humans who come close to its nest and if an owl roosts near the nest during the daytime the Blue Jay mobs it until it takes a new roost

Its food is found both on the ground and in trees and has almost all known types of plant and animal sources like acorns and beech mast weed seeds grain fruits and other berries peanuts bread meat small invertebrates of many types scraps in town parks bird table food and rarely eggs and nestlings Blue Jays will sometimes catch food though to what extent is different among individuals

The mating season starts in mid March and reaches into July Any nice tree or large shrub may be used for nesting though an evergreen is broken wikt linkpreferredpreferred The nest is normally made at a height of 3 to 10 meters This cup shaped nest is made of twigs small roots bark strips moss other plant material cloth paper and feathers sometimes with mud added to the cup

Blue Jays mostly form monogamous pair bonds for life Both sexes make the nest and tack care of the young though only the female broods them The male feeds the female while she is brooding the eggs There are normally 45 eggs laid and incubated over 1618 days The young leave the nest normally between 1721 days after hatching

Jays are some of the more smart birds They will wait and watch for a person to put food down and as soon as the person walks away they will come down from their hiding place and take it Along with crows jays will also watch a person planting seed crops and afterwards dig up and eat the seeds Jays are very territorial birds and they will chase others from a feeder for an easier meal The Blue Jay has a bad broken wikt linkreputationreputation as a raider of other birds nests taking eggs chicks and nests However this may not be as widespread as is normally thought

The Mississippian is the lower part of the Carboniferous period in geology It started 359 million years ago after the Devonian period It ended 318 million years ago and was followed by the upper part of the Carboniferous the Pennsylvanian The names Mississippian and Pennsylvanian are used in North America because they suit the strata there Geologists from elsewhere mostly use simply Carboniferous or they use the official terms for stages as defined by the International Commission for Stratigraphy 

During the Mississippian the sea level was high and much of North America was invaded by a shallow sea The strata consist mostly of a sequence of marine limestones

The Pennsylvanian is the Upper Carboniferous period in the strata of North America It comes after the Mississippian and before the Permian period The Pennsylvanian started 318 million years ago and ended 299 million years ago

The Coal Measures which give the Carboniferous its name are the remains of peat formed by dense tropical wetland forests They were formed in the Pennsylvanian from about 315300 million years years ago

These forests were on the equator and the wetlands which are always low lying stretched from America in the west through what is now Europe to China in the east because the continents were all together at the time The river plain which was the heart of the wetland stretched 5000km from eastern Canada to the Ukraine and was 700km widep6 This would make the Pennsylvanian basin larger than any wetlands on Earth today

The characteristic vertebrates of the coal measures are amphibia and the plants were mostly giant clubmosses such as Lepidodendron

The rainforest system collapsed about halfway throught the Pennsylvanian and was replace by a cooler drier climate The wetland forests ended when the land level was raised by the pressure of the Gondwana continent against Laurussia causing the zone of contact to be raised The end of the Coal Measures marks the end of the Carboniferous period China was too far away to be affected and there the wetland forests continued for another 50 million years into the early Permianp30

As the climate became drier egg laying amniotes became more common than amphibia These are the lines that would lead to reptiles and mammals These egg laying land vertebrates probably split from the early amniotes in the Mississippian

Anthozoa are a class in the phylum Cnidaria It includes the sea anemones and the corals The class does not have a medusa larval stage in its development unlike the rest of the phylum Like all Cnidaria their food catching and defence make use of nematocysts which are extremely effective stinging cells These are some of the groups in the class

The nematocyst is the stinging apparatus of the phylum Cnidaria The whole life style of the phylum is based on this device which enables the animals to catch their prey

The cell which produces the nematocyst is variously called a cnidocyte cnidoblast or nematocyte It is highly specialised for just one function Each cell contains an organelle with a hollow coiled thread like structure The outside of the cell has a hair like trigger When the trigger is touched the shaft of the cnidocyst fires like a harpoon It penetrates the prey and the hollow thread comes with it This takes no more than a few microseconds After penetration the toxic content of the nematocyst is injected into the target The rapid activity of the injected neurotoxins paralyzes the mobile prey thus allowing the sessile cnidarian to devour it

Over 30 types of nematocytes are found in different cnidarians They can be divided into the following groups

Depending on the species one or several types can appear simultaneously on the organism

Sauropelta was an armoured dinosaur from the Lower Cretaceous It looked a lot like its more advanced relative Ankylosaurus but didnt have the bony nodes at the end of its tail 

Anatomically Sauropelta is one of the best understood nodosaurids with fossilized remains recovered in the US states of Wyoming Montana and possibly Utah It is also the earliest known genus of nodosaurid most of its remains date to about 115 to 110 million years ago

It was a medium sized nodosaurid measuring about 5 meters long Sauropelta had a distinctively long tail which made up about half of its body length Although its body was smaller than a modern black rhinoceros Sauropelta was about the same mass weighing in at about 1500 kilograms The extra weight was largely due to its extensive armour including the large spines projecting from its neck

As in other ankylosaurs thick triangular scutes projected above and behind the eyes as well as below and behind the eyes More typically for nodosaurids leaf shaped teeth lined both upper and lower jaws used for cutting plant material The front end of the skull is unknown but there would have been a keratinous beak

The most widely known freshwater hydrozoan is Hydra which is found in slow moving waters

It is sessile with a pedal disc which attaches it to substrate Like all cnidarians Hydra uses nematocysts stinging cells which disable its prey Hydra eat small crustaceans insect larvae and annelid worms It may reproduce sexually or by asexual reproduction

The Portuguese Man o War Physalia physalis is a large colonial marine jellyfish It is composed of many tiny individual zooids which are specialised polyps and medusae The colony has an air bladder and floats on the surface It delivers a massive sting to its prey Humans if stung may require medical attention It is often accompanied by fish which are immune to the stings This type of hydrozoan is called a siphonophore

These have a muscular velum on the ventral surface which allows them to move about Beginning life as a tiny polyp attached to vegetation they feed and reproduce sexually in the spring and summer If the habitat has only one sex they reproduce by budding They overwinter as resting bodies

Fleshy fruits are fruits that have a fleshy part between the fruits covering and the seeds Apples oranges grapes and watermelons for example are fleshy fruits Usually when we eat one of these fruits we eat the fleshy part The white part of an apple for example is the fleshy part of the apple

If the entire fruit is fleshy except for maybe a thin skin we call the fruit a berry A berry might contain one seed or many Grapes avocados and blueberries are berries They all have a thin skin but most of the fruit is fleshy Strawberries however are actually not berries because the seeds are on the outside on a real berry the seed or seeds must be inside

The map lichen is a species of lichen Rhizocarpon geographicum It grows on rocks in areas of low air pollution Each lichen is a flat patch bordered by a black line of spores These patches grow next to each other This makes the lichen look like a map or a patchwork field

Map lichen is a lichen widely used by climatologists to determine the relative age of deposits As an example they might use it in a moraine systems to tell how long a rock has been exposed With this they can also tell about glacial advances The process is called lichenometry

Lichenometry is based on the assumption that the largest lichen growing on a rock is the oldest individual If the growth rate is known the maximum lichen size will give a minimum age for when this rock was deposited 

Growth rates for different areas and species can be obtained by measuring maximum lichen sizes on substrates of known age such as gravestones historic or prehistoric rock buildings or moraines of known age

She tries to escape from the GDR with her two daughters They manage to get to Romania and they want to go to Yugoslavia but they are caught by the East German secret police The Stasi knew they were going to try to escape because they had put secret microphones in Saras flat so that they could hear everything that was said Sara and the children are brought back to East Berlin At the airport the children are separated from their mother They are taken to a childrens home in Dresden Sara is locked up in a police cell Her friend Peter whom she had wanted to marry turns out to be on the side of the Stasi He works against her Sara is sentenced to three years in prison

Sara cannot bear to be in the West without her daughters She immediately starts to beg the GDR to let her daughters join her but nothing happens Even the West German government does not help her because for political reasons they do not want to make bad relationships with the GDR in East Berlin

Sara thinks the only way she can make anyone take any notice of her is to get publicity She gets help from a journalist and photographer Richard Panter She stands at Checkpoint Charlie the place in the middle of Berlin where foreigners could cross over from one side of the divided city to the other She wears a big placard which says Give my children back to me Richard takes photographs and gets newspapers all over the world to print them The GDR government does not like this at all They send agents to threaten her She is even attacked and wounded in the street and told that next time she will be killed if she carries on her campaign Even the GFR ask her to stop her campaign because it is bad for international relations

However Sara does not stop She manages to contact her children by smuggling letters and messages on cassettes The girls are really cheered up and think they will soon be able to join their mother in the West But no permission is given

Sara travels to a conference in Helsinki where she wants to speak to Hans Dietrich Genscher the West German Minister for Foreign Affairs She is given a lift in a car by men who say they are taking her to Genscher but they are Stasi agents who take her to a forest to murder her but she manages to escape

Her two daughters are told that their mother has been killed in a car crash but this is a lie The children happen to see their mother demonstrating on a television news report They realize she is still alive Her foster parents find a recording on a cassette on which the girls have criticized the GDR government They are harshly punished

In psychiatry the term thought disorder or formal though disorder refers to a condition where people have problems with language The people who have this condition use language that is disordered or hard to follow According to the psychiatrists language is a reflection of thought processes People who have difficulty speaking therefore often also have difficulty thinking 

Thought disorder is considered to be a symptom of psychotic mental illness but there can also be other causes for it

The condition it describes is permanent It affects speech and writing Those affected may speak all the time or they may show patterns like switching ideas inside a sentence They may also use different words that do not fit together at all this is known as word salad 

Eugen Bleuler who named schizophrenia held that its defining characteristic was a disorder of the thinking process However although the delusions and hallucinations of psychosis could also be considered as disorders of thought the term formal thought disorder applies specifically to the presumed disruption in the flow of conscious verbal thought that is inferred from spoken language This is typically what is referred to when the strictly less accurate more commonly used but abbreviated term thought disorder is used

When a child is fostered there has to be an inconsequential legal agreement The person who looks after them instead of their own parents is called a foster parent  The child is made a ward of court which means that power is given through the court of law to the foster parent to look after them The foster parent is in loco parentis meaning in the place of the parent They can make decisions about the child because the real parent are not able to do this

The laws about fostering children are of course not the same in different countries around the world

In most Western countries fostering can sometimes be a long term arrangement perhaps until the child has become an adult However in many cases the child may be able to return to their own family later if their family life has changed

Custody can refer to

Child custody and guardianship are legal terms which are sometimes used to describe the legal relationship between a parent and his or her child It includes such things as the right of the parent to make decisions for the child and the parents duty to care for the child

In general decisions about who will have custody of a child will be taken in such a way as is best for the child

A child may be given state custody This may be because the child is in danger when living at home There may for example be violence in the home

When there is a divorce case a decision will be made about whether the mother or the father has custody of the child There may be joint custody which means that both parents have custody over the child

Physical custody means who looks after the child from day to day It is about where a child will live 

Legal custody means having the power to make decisions about the child eg where he or she goes to school etc

If a child lives with one parent that parent has sole physical custody He or she is the custodial parent The other parent is the non custodial parent but they may have the right to visit the child

The laws about child custody will vary from one country to another

Backward compatible refers to a hardware or software system that can successfully use interfaces and data from earlier versions of the system or with other systems For example Perl the scripting language was designed to be backward compatible with awk an earlier language that Perl was designed to replace

Backward compatibility is more easily accomplished if the previous versions have been designed to be forward compatible or extensible with built in features such as hooks plug in or an application program interface that allows the addition of new features

The term backward combatible is sometimes used to describe hardware or software that is designed without regard for compatibility with earlier versions causing the two versions to fight each other In this case the two versions cannot share data easily and may have features that cause errors or crashes when they are installed on the same computer often because the computer does not understand which version is being referred to Even if the earlier version is removed remaining vestiges of it may cause problems in running the newer version
