A crew usually is a group of people that work within a common organisation and that have some activities in common The usual place where crews can be found are ships and airplanes On such ships and aircraft some functions some people perform are very special It is therefore common that crews are organised in a hierarchy Every person except the captain at the top has a person above them They will report to that person

Cargo is the name people give to goods which they transport using a ship airplane lorry train or spacecraft Please note that the noun is not countable people will talk about some cargo Today the goods are usually packed in containers which are carried A place which loads or unloads cargo is usually called a cargo terminal

Ransom can mean two things

If people talk about that they need to pay money to the state or the police to get free the correct legal term used is usually bail

Often in piracy pirates would steal something or someone important and demand a ransom payment

Paraphilia is a word used in sociology and medicine It is like many other medical terms because it comes from Greek It means that someone is sexually aroused by people that are unable to return their affection The word can also be used to refer to sexual practices which are bad for the mind or body When doctors of medicine talk about paraphilia they usually mean one of the following amongst other things

The respective behaviour is only classified as Paraphilia if it is the only means for the person involved to get sexually aroused for a considerable time

When normal people talk about paraphilia they usually mean non mainstream sexual behaviour

Nupedia was a website with encyclopedia pages It was created by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger in 2000

Unlike Wikipedia only scholars could edit the articles and all of the changes went through a review process This made it harder to make articles and soon became overlooked because of Wikipedia which anyone can edit

By the time the site was closed in September 2003 there were 24 articles on Nupedia with another 74 articles ready to be made When Wikipedia took over the articles from Nupedia were moved there and those were the first articles of Wikipedia Nupedia is a test site that was made before Wikipedia The lack of subscribers also contributed to its end It was never a popular website

An article is a word that comes before a noun There are two kinds of articles definite articles and indefinite articles

In English there is just one definite article the There are two indefinite articles a and an The word an is used before a word starting with a vowel sound we say a horse a child a European a university but an orange an elephant 

Some languages have more than one word for the This is because each noun is either masculine or feminine or in some languages it can be masculine feminine or neuter For example in French le is used for masculine nouns and la for feminine nouns The becomes les in front of plural nouns The indefinite articles in French are un and une German Dutch and Ancient Greek have masculine feminine and neuter nouns but in the case of Dutch the word for the is the same for masculine and feminine so you do not need to know which it is

Some languages do not have articles When speakers of these languages are learning English it is often difficult to explain to them what an article is English speakers use them automatically

In general the in English is used for something you have already been talking about The word a is used when introducing a new idea

Tbilisi is the capital and the largest city in Georgia It was founded in the 5th century AD by Georgian king Vakhtang Gorgasali When he was hunting he killed a pheasant which dropped into hot water Gorgasali discovered there were a lot of hot springs in this place which he called Tbilisi as tbili means hot in Georgian

A robot is a machine or a computer program which seems to have a life of its own 

Many people think that a robot

There are many books movies and video games with robots in them

People have been interested in building machines to do work for us for a long time But it takes time and money to build just one machine so early ideas stayed ideas or were built to make rich people laugh Leonardo Da Vinci designed a man shaped machine to look like a knight in 1464 It would be controlled with ropes and wheels Other engineers and dreamers drew mechanical men So in 1920 Karel apek wrote a novel about them and he used a word from Czech that is connected with work robot But the most successful robot designs in the 1900s were not made to look like people They were designed for their use George Devol made the first of these the Unimate in 1954 and General Motors bought it in 1960 The next year it started work in a factory in New Jersey The engineers could program it and reprogram it if they had to

Robots now have many uses Many factories use robots to do lots of hard work quickly and without many mistakes These are industrial robots The military uses robots to find and get rid of bombs If someone makes a mistake the robot is damaged or destroyed which is better than a person being killed There are also robots that help at home to vacuum or cut grass for example Such robots must learn about the area of work There are two robots on Mars Because it takes a long time to send a signal from Earth to Mars the robots do much of their work alone without commands from Earth People still think of robots as having a shape like a person  two legs two arms and a head ASIMO is one robot that is helping scientists learn how to design and program robots It can walk which is not easy to program 

Roughly half of all the robots in the world are in Asia 32 in Europe and 16 in North America 1 in Australasia and 1 in Africa 30 of all the robots in the world are in Japan Japan has the most robots of any country in the world and is the leader in the world robotics industry Japan is actually said to be the robotic capital of the world

In Japan and South Korea ideas of future robots have been mainly positive The positive reception of robots there may be partly because of the famous cartoon robot Astroboy China expressed views on robotics that are similar to those of Japan and South Korea but China is behind both America and Europe in robotic development The East Asian view is that robots should be roughly equal to humans They feel robots could care for old people teach children or serve as assistants The popular opinion of East Asia is that it would be good for robots to become more popular and more advanced This view is opposite to the popular Western view

This is the opening of an era in which human beings and robots can co exist says Japanese firm Mitsubishi about one of the many human like robots in Japan

In this sense people in Japan are much more likely to be affected by Technosexuality as they are much more exposed to robots in their society South Korea aims to put a robot in every house there by 2015 2020 in order to help catch up technologically with Japan This will obviously have an impact on the technosexuality of South Korea China like South Korea wishes to catch up with Japan and has been developing robots very quickly After China becomes more developed and each person has more money to view the media where robots could be seen or to buy robots as is happening in Japan and South Korea technosexuality will probably rise there too when considering the current opinions of the people of robots

With a limited number of robots in the rest of the world away from Japan and even in Japan too movies and literature are the where most of the technosexuality will be towards Futuristic imagesdescriptions or robots may encourage technosexuality At the moment there are not that many real human like robots in the world The most human like robot in the world Actroid made my Japanese company Kokoro a division of Sanrio is a good example of the target for technosexuality

Western societies are more likely to be against or even fear the development of robotics through much media output in movies and literature that they will replace humans

The West regards robots as a threat to the future of humans which is also muchly due to religious influence of the Abrahamic religions in which creating machines that can think for themselves would almost be playing God Obviously these boundaries are not clear but there is a significant difference between the two ideologies

The writer Isaac Asimov told many stories about robots who had three robot laws to keep them safe as well as to keep humans safe from them

These were not used in real life when he invented them However in todays world robots are more complicated and one day real laws may be needed much like Isaac Asimovs original three laws

These laws are talked about in the Megaman video games

South Korea was the first country in the world to have laws about robots

Recognition or recognize is when humans or animals familiarize the surrounding objects or beings as an enemy friend dangerous or harmless These cognitive acts relate to the beings perception memory learning and experience in their environment

In computer programs pattern recognition helps computers to distinguish objects images fingerprints writing audio faces and others automatically Pattern recognition tries to teach computers to perceive and recognize things as accurate as possible to how people do it or better

When a country recognizes another country it means that the first country believes that the second country is legal and has a right to be a country  Countries that recognize each other have diplomatic relations That means they send diplomats to each other and make different kinds of agreements about trade international laws and other things

Cystic Fibrosis is a condition a person may get from their parents It causes the body to make thick sticky mucus which builds up in the lungs the digestive system and other parts of the body If both parents have the cystic fibrosis gene and pass it onto their child the child will get cystic fibrosis Only one gene is needed from each parent The parent might not have cystic fibrosis but still might have the gene A person with cystic fibrosis is not contagious There is no cure for cystic fibrosis but there are a lot of medications that help keep people healthy

Cystic fibrosis affects the entire body Overall the body has trouble moving salt to the parts of the body that need it Since the body has trouble moving salt it piles up in places it is not supposed to like the lungs stomach and intestines

In the lungs when salt gets stuck it causes there to be less water which makes mucus to become very thick It becomes very hard to breathe The treatment for this is breathing medicine to help add water to the lungs to keep the mucus thinner so it is easier to cough up When there is thinner and less mucus it is easier to breathe

There is no cure for cystic fibrosis but there are things people can do to stay healthy

65 Roses is how some children refer to their condition since Cystic Fibrosis is difficult for a young child to say 65 roses is also a trademarked phrase by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation to help control its use since it is a very helpful way for young children to understand

IEEE 1394 is the name for a set of standards The standards specify a serial bus which can be used to transfer information Other names for the standards include Firewire iLink and Lynx The standard is often used to connect a computer to an external device like a hard drive or digital camcorder It also has uses to transfer data in cars and airplanes It is similar to USB Firewire replaced SCSI for many applications Making a device understand Firewire is easier than having it understand SCSI handling Firewire cables is also much easier than SCSI cabling 

FireWire is popular in industrial systems for machine vision and professional audio systems It is preferred over the more common USB because of its greater effective speed and power distribution capabilities and because it does not need a computer host Perhaps more importantly FireWire makes full use of all SCSI capabilities Compared to USB 20 it usually has higher data transfer rates This feature is important for audio and video editors Also many computers intended for home or professional audiovideo use have built in FireWire ports including all Apple Inc and Sony laptop computers and most Dell and HP models currently produced It is available to general public on retail motherboards for do it yourself PCs alongside USB FireWire is produced in wireless optical fiber and coaxial cable versions However the copyright fees demanded from users of FireWire and the more expensive hardware needed to implement it has prevented FireWire from displacing USB in mass market where cost of product is crucial

FireWire is Apple Incs name for the IEEE 1394 High Speed Serial Bus Apple intended FireWire to be a serial replacement for the parallel SCSI bus while also providing connectivity for digital audio and video equipment Apples development of the original IEEE 1394 was completed in 1995It was followed by several modifications The IEEE Std 1394a 2000 the IEEE Std 1394b 2002 and the IEEE Std 1394c 2006 amendment The aim of current work is to incorporate all four of these documents into new revision of the 1394 standard Sonys version of the system is known as iLINK and uses only the four signal pins omitting the two pins which provide power to the device because of a separate power connector on Sonys iLINK products

FireWire 400 can transfer data between devices at 100 200 or 400 Mbits data rates The 6 pin connector is commonly found on desktop computers and can supply the connected device with power Typically a device can pull about 7 to 8 watts from the port However the voltage varies significantly from different devices

Modification IEEE 1394a was released in 2000 It standardized the 4 pin connector already widely in use The 4 pin version is used on many consumer devices such as camcorders some laptops and other small FireWire devices It is fully data compatible with 6 pin interfaces

9 pin FireWire 800 was introduced commercially by Apple Inc in 2003 This newer specification and corresponding products allow a transfer rate of 786432 Mbits It is backwards compatibility to the slower rates and 6 pin connectors of FireWire 400 However while the IEEE 1394a and IEEE 1394b standards are compatible connectors are different making the cables used by previous versions incompatible

In December 2007 the 1394 Trade Association announced the products will soon be available using S3200 mode It will use the same 9 pin connectors as the existing FireWire 800 and will be fully compatible with existing S400 and S800 devices The future products are intended to compete with the USB 30

The numbers given after the FireWire or the S give the approximate speed in MBits rouded up to the next 100 The very first version can transfer 98304000 Bitss or 12288000 Bytess The versions that came afterwards can do this speed and multiples of it Using the SI prefix this is exactly 98304 kBits using the binary prefix it is 96000 kiBits To avoid confusion it is rounded to the next closest 100 That way S3200 does not transfer 3200 MBits nor 3200 MiBits but 3145728 Mbits or 3000 MiBits This is approximately 293 Gibits

Unlike with USB there is no one device that manages the bus all the time Each device is able to manage the bus When a new device is connected there will be negotiations between the devices which of them does the management 

Addresses have a length of 64 Bits Of these 10 are used to identify segments 6 are used for nodes and 48 are freely available The standard used to connect several segments has not yet been ratified For this reason all Firewire networks currently only use one segment

Devices on a FireWire bus can communicate by direct memory access With Direct Memory access a device can use hardware to map internal memory to FireWires Physical Memory Space The SBP 2 used by FireWire disk drives uses this capability to minimize interrupts and buffer copies In SBP 2 the initiator sends a request by remotely writing a command into a specified area of the targets FireWire address space This command usually includes buffer addresses in the initiators FireWire Physical Address Space The target is supposed to use this space to move IO data to and from the initiator

Many implementations use hardware to do the mapping between the FireWire Physical Memory Space and device physical memory Among these are those used by PCs and Macs especially those using OHCI In this case the operating system is not involved in the transfer This allows for high speed transfers with a low latency and avoids that the data is copied around unnecessarily It can however be a security risk if devices that are not trusted are connected to the bus Installations where security is a concern will therefore either use newer hardware which use virtual memory to map the Firewire Physical memory space or disable the mapping the OHCI does They might also disable the whole Firewire subsystem or not provide Firewire at all

This feature can also be useful for example to debug a machine where the operating system has crashed Some systems can use it to provide a remote console On FreeBSD the dcons driver provides both using gdb as debugger Under Linux firescope and fireproxy exist

De facto is a phrase from the Latin language that means in fact or in practice It is often used in contrast to de jure when talking about law governance or technique When talking about law de jure is used to describe what the law says and de facto is used to describe what actually happens

De facto is sometimes also used when there is no appropriate law or standard but a common practice that may not necessarily be widely accepted exists For example the de jure name of Bill Clinton is William Jefferson Clinton This is his name according to official records His de facto name is Bill Clinton because this is what he is usually called

A househusband is a husband that chooses to stay at home instead of working at a career The word househusband came into use in the 1970s as a joke because many women who worked as homemakers did not want to be called housewives

Port Dover is a small fishing town in Ontario Canada During Friday the 13th motorcycle fans dominate the town There is also the famous Arbor Restaurant stand in the southern part of town where Cherry Glows are served instead of soft drinks and the bees frequent the outdoor place as much as the local customers and tourists do There is a public high school in the town where students aged 14 to 21 years of age study to earn their Ontario High School Diploma Port Dover is also the home to Ms Carrie Sinkowski a leader for rural equality and a former candidate for the Canadian House of Commons Live theatre is also done here as well as a miniature golf course a beach and a thriving seaport just to name a few attractions that Port Dover has to offer

The town is dominated with little shops with very few franchised businesses in the town Notable exceptions include Tim Hortons and Giant Tiger department store On Friday the 13th motorcycle people come to town in order to drink beer However they must be at least 19 years of age to perform this activity While some violence has resulted in previous years the 2007 running of the PD13 event was peaceful

The Interahamwe was the main mob army that started the 1994 Rwandan Genocide in which about one million Hutu and Tutsi people were killed 

The Interahamwe usually used a machete to do the killing but guns grenades and primitive tools like nail studded clubs and hoes were also used If you want a good representation of what happened in Rwanda check out the movie Hotel Rwanda

About a half an hour after the President of Rawanda Juvnal Habyarimana was killed on the night of April 6 1994 Interahamwe roadblocks were put up all over the city of Kigali the capital of Rwanda The murdering would end about 100 days later This resulted in at least 500000 deaths but some say even up to 800000 1000000 deaths

A pie is a type of food normally a dessert Pies are usually baked and often made in the shape of a circle or an oval On the outside of a pie there is a sweet or savory crust and on the inside there is a filling Pies can be filled with sweet fruit filling meat or vegetables Pie is great for desserts because of its delicious sweetness Pie is also very delicious with its wide variety of available fillings

Pies are baked with a shell or crust which is usually made of pastry that covers or completely contains a filling of fruit meat fish vegetables cheeses creams chocolate custards nuts or other sweet or savoury ingredients

Pies can be either

Some of these pies are pies in name only such as the Boston cream pie which is a cake Many fruit and berry pies are very similar varying only the fruit used in filling

There are many different kinds of pie People from different countries often have their own different type of pie

Meat pies with fillings such as steak and cheese steak and kidney minced beef or chicken and mushroom are popular in the United Kingdom Australia and New Zealand as take away snacks They are also served with chips as an alternative to fish and chips at British chip shops The residents of Wigan near Greater Manchester are so renowned for their preference for this food stuff that they are often referred to as Pie Eaters FactdateFebruary 2008 In honour of this the main ingredient of a Wigan kebab is the pie which is placed in a barm cake to make up this popular local delicacy The combination of pie and mash is traditionally associated with London Shepherds pie is also a favourite amongst people throughout Britain 

In contrast to other meat pies which are served hot pork pies generally have a very high fat content and are always served cold FactdateFebruary 2008 These meat pies contain beef and gravy in a shortcrust piecase often with a flaky top Many bakeries and specialty shops sell gourmet pies for the more discriminating customer A peculiarity of Adelaide food is the pie floater where a meat pie is floated in a plate of thick green pea soup

Pot pies with a flaky crust and bottom are also a popular American dish typically with a filling of meat gravy and mixed vegetables Frozen pot pies are often sold in individual serving size

Fruit pies may be served with a scoop of ice cream a style known in North America as broken wikt link la mode la mode Apple pie is a traditional choice though any pie with sweet fillings may be served la mode This combination and possibly the name as well is thought to have been popularized in the mid 1890s in the United States

A tourtire is a meat pie originating from Quebec in Canada usually made with ground pork veal or beef

Many countries have their own style of pie and they have their own name For example

Cream filled or topped pies are favourite props for humour particularly when aimed at people who are too serious Throwing a pie in a persons face has been a staple of film comedy since the early days of the movies and is often associated with clowns in popular culture Pranksters have taken to targeting politicians and celebrities with their pies an act called pieing Activists sometimes engage in the pieing of political and social targets as well One such group is the Biotic Baking Brigade Pieing can result in injury to people and pie throwers can face assault or more serious charges

Customer service is the giving of labor and other resources to satisfy a customers needs This is often helpful if a purchase is broken or not working properly In these situations the event is usually convened by a customer service policy Many stores will have a special desk or area for people to take their complaints

The city was originally called Busanpo It was named after the shape of the mountain behind Busan Port Korean bu means a cauldron san means a mountain and po means a harbor It may be said that a harbor is located at the foot of a mountain resembling a cauldron Since the late 15th century the current name Busan has been widely used

Sarcasm is when someone says something but means something else They mean either the opposite of what they said or that they disagree with what they just said 

Sarcasm is different from lying because when a person is being sarcastic the person listening is supposed to understand that the person speaking does not mean what they just said If someone says something sarcastic it is usually said in a tone of voice that tells the person listening that they are being sarcastic Perhaps the person listening knows the person talking well enough to understand that the person talking is being sarcastic 

Sarcasm can be used to criticize someone It can be unkind

Sarcasm can also be used to be funny If the persons tone of voice is normal when they say something sarcastic this is called deadpan or dry humor

A lie is something that someone says that is not true People that are lying often want others to believe that the lie is the truth People can have many reasons for lying such as if they are hiding something if they want something from you or white lies Some people are pathological liars

Different kinds of lies

Sometimes a person will say something that is not true but they do not know it is not true This person either learned the wrong information somewhere or is delusional

An acute myocardial infarction also known as a heart attack is a heart condition where blood cannot get to part of the heart This causes cells in the heart to die and can cause the heart to fail Most of the time an artery in the heart is blocked by a blood clot When this happens for more than about twenty minutes the heart muscle is damaged 

The most common symptom is strong pains in the chest The pain may also be present in the shoulders the belly and the mandible In contrast to angina pectoris a myocardial infarction always damages the heart muscle

A myocardial infaction is considered a medical emergency The first few minutes can be essential for the survival of a patient within the first hour there are good chances to reverse some of the damage done 

Signs that a person is having a heart attack become visible over several minutes and rarely come straight away Most people having a heart attack experience chest pain Chest pain can be caused by ischaemia of the heart muscle this is called angina pectoris Pain can often also be felt in the left arm and sometimes in the lower jaw the neck the right arm the back and in parts of the abdomen

Many women have different symptoms than men The most common symptoms include shortness of breath weakness and feeling tired Some women feel tired do not sleep properly and experience shortness of breath for up to a month before they have a heart attack

A heart attack is a medical emergency that needs to be taken care of as quickly as possible The ultimate goal of the management in the acute phase of the disease is to save as much myocardium as possible and prevent more complications As time passes the risk of damage to the heart muscle increases

The treatments itself may have complications If medics try to get the blood flowing again after only a few hours the result is reperfusion injury instead of amelioration Other treatment modalities may also cause complications the use of antithrombotics for example carries an increased risk of bleeding

When a person starts experiencing symptoms of a myocardial infarction many people wait three hours on average before asking for help when they should seek emergency assistance as soon as they can Having the person sit in certain positions can help minimise breathing difficulties A half sitting position with knees bent is often recommended The person should also be given access to more oxygen Aspirin which reduces the amount of platelets in the blood can help prevent more blood clots from forming inside the arteries and the heart

Sir Edward William Elgar 1st Baronet OM GCVO was the most famous English composer of his time He composed in the late romantic era

Worcester was a small town but the music there was good The Three Choirs Festival took place there every third year In 1884 he was playing the violin in the orchestra when the great Czech composer Dvok was conducting

In 1889 Elgar married His wife Caroline Alice Roberts came from a family who had more money than the Elgars and she was 8 years older than he was Many people did not approve of the marriage but she was a good wife to him and encouraged him in his efforts to be a successful composer

In 1899 Elgar wrote an orchestral piece called the Enigma Variations There is a main tune and then a series of variations on the tune Each variation describes one of his friends but he did not say which friends they were he only put their initials or nickname at the top of each variation This is why the piece is an enigma People have managed to work out who each friend was but the meaning of the main tune is still a puzzle This music made Elgar very famous 

The next work that he wrote is probably his greatest work The Dream of Gerontius It is an oratorio Gerontius is an old man who is dying and thinking about whether God will punish him for his sins or save him and take him to heaven Elgar wrote two other oratorios The Apostles and The Kingdom He wrote two symphonies a violin concerto a cello concerto Introduction and Allegro for Strings Sea Pictures and chamber music including a violin sonata a string quartet and a piano quintet

Throughout his life his wife helped him by ruling neat manuscript lines on plain paper so that he could write his music After she died in 1920 Elgar was so sad that he stopped composing

Elgars most popular piece is the first of his Pomp and Circumstance Marches It has the tune which is sung to the words Land of Hope and Glory and the audience always join in singing it at the Last Night of the Proms

Dissolution of the Soviet Union is a term of history The period of History of the Soviet Union from 1985 to 1991 covers the dissolution of the Soviet Union In plain words dissolution may mean ending or closure of anything The term dissolution of the Soviet Union describes dissolution of the Soviet Union as a separate country The Soviet Union had many ethnic regions called republics All these republics were part of the Soviet Union and the Soviet Union was one country After its dissolution different republics of the Soviet Union became independent countries The names of these countries are Armenia Azerbaijan Belarus Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan Moldova Russia Tajikistan Turkmenistan Ukraine Uzbekistan Georgia Estonia Latvia and Lithuania

The Soviet Union ended or its dissolution happened upon the formation of the Commonwealth of Independent States At the time of dissolution of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev was the president of the Soviet Union He was in this position since March 1985 On 25 December 1991 he quit the post of the president of the USSR By 31 December 1991 all organizations and departments of the Soviet Union stopped working On that date the Soviet flag flew for the last time on the Kremlin

During 1969 and 1982 very few changes took place in the politics and economy of the Soviet Union With the beginning of the Soviet war in Afghanistan its relationship with the United States also deteriorated At that time Jimmy Carter followed by Ronald Reagan was the President of the United States Jimmy Carter ended the policy of Dtente  ending of unfriendly relationship Some historians believe that this may be one of the reasons for the Soviet Union to change its political and economic policies 

In March 1985 Mikhail Gorbachev became the General Secretary of the CPSU Under him a new group of officials and leaders started a process of changes in the politics and economy of the Soviet Union They also tried to improve relationships with Western countries like the USA 

At that time the Soviet economy was facing many problems including inflation and black marketing Also the cost of maintaining the Soviet Union as a superpower was huge These costs included running a large military running the KGB networks and giving money to countries close to the Soviet Union At the same time the Soviet Unions technological development had fallen behind For example many of its factories used out of date technologies and it had fallen behind in the use of information technology 

In view of these and other reasons Gorbachev and his team started three important policies

Some of the economic changes in the Soviet Union are as follows

Since the time of Vladimir Lenin in 1920s the people of the Soviet Union did not have any right to own personal property and business The government owned almost everything In 1988 the government permitted the people to own some types of businesses in the service sector manufacturing and foreign trade A system of cooperative restaurants shops and manufacturers came into existence 

Glasnost gave a greater freedom of speech to the citizens The government reduced censorship and control on publication The government set free many political prisoners In January 1987 Gorbachev started a process of democratization of Soviet politics In June 1988 Gorbachev started a process to reduce the control of the CPSU on the different parts of the government 

In December 1988 the Supreme Soviet had approved the establishment of a Congress of Peoples Deputies the Soviet Unions new legislative body In March and April 1989 elections to the Congress of Peoples Deputies took place The members on 15th March 1990 elected Gorbachev as the first executive President of the Soviet Union 

Many steps taken by Gorbachev gave results different than the intended results Thus the perestroika and glasnost intended to make the Soviet economy stronger resulted into something very different Many factors and events combined and finally they resulted into the dissolution of the Soviet Union 

Under the policy of glasnost the Soviet government and the Communist Party lost control over the media A free media brought to notice of the public many bad aspects of the society and the economy of the Soviet Union These bad aspects included poor housing alcoholism drug abuse pollution out of date technologies in many factories and corruption People also learnt of many crimes committed by Stalin For example they learnt about prisoners at Gulags agreement with Adolf Hitler and large numbers of killings of persons opposed to Stalin Further people also learnt details about such events as the ongoing Soviet war in Afghanistan and bad management of nuclear meltdown at Chernobyl In short people learnt about the negative aspects of the Soviet life All these reduced the trust of the people in the government of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party

By 1989 the Soviet Union changed a policy it declared that it would not interfere in internal affairs of many of its neighboring countries After the end of the Second World War with the support of the Soviet Union communist governments were ruling all these countries The change in the policy of the Soviet Union resulted into fall of the communist governments in many such countries by 1991 in Bulgaria Czechoslovakia East Germany Hungary Poland and Romania 

Seeing all these developments many republics of the Soviet Union wanted to become independent At the same time ethnic tensions increased in many Soviet republics and ethically Russian regions People started disliking the ideal of a unified Soviet state 

The leaders had thought that the policy of perestroika was a bold step to improve the economy But the steps were not very strong to improve the bad economic conditions of 1980s Despite many changes Gorbachev and his team had left many aspects of the Soviet economy unchanged For example price control inconvertibility of the ruble and government control over most means of production continued By 1990 the economic situation had become worse The examples include

On 7th February 1990 the Central Committee of the CPSU decided to loosen its control over power At around the same time different republics of the Soviet Union started to claim their right to become independent They stopped following the laws of the central government of the Soviet Union They also stopped paying taxes to the central authorities of the Soviet Union These weakened the Soviet authority and economy 

During a 1990 visit of Gorbachev to Vilnius capital of Lithuania about 250000 persons protested in a public meeting On 11th March 1990 leaders of Lithuania declared its independence from the Soviet Union However the Soviet Army continued to keep many troops in Lithuania The Soviet Union also did economic blockade of Lithuania Estonia was a part of Soviet Union from 1940 On 30th March 1990 the leaders of Estonia declared that the control of their country by the Soviet Union from 1940 was illegal They also declared independence The leaders of Latvia also started process of independence on 4th May 1990 

On 17th March 1991 people of the Soviet Union voted for retention of the existing Soviet Union in a slightly changed form The Baltic States Armenia Georgia and Moldova boycotted the voting In each of the other nine republics of the Soviet Union a majority of the voters supported the retention of the Soviet Union In June 1991 an election took place in the Russian Republic of the Soviet Union Boris Yeltsin got 57 of the vote He was a critic of Mikhail Gorbachev Gorbachevs preferred candidate former Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov got only 16 of the vote

The republics of the Soviet Union had agreed to sign on 20th August 1991 an agreement making them almost independent republics but part of a federation with a common president foreign policy and military However many persons disagreed and they wanted a fast transition to market economy even if it meant dissolution of the Soviet Union There were many others in the CPSU and the military of the Soviet Union who supported continuation of the Soviet Union 

On 19th August 1991 some senior leaders of the Soviet Union formed a State Committee on the State Emergency They prevented signing of the above mentioned agreement on 20th August 1991 These leaders included Gorbachevs vice president Gennadi Yanayev prime minister Valentin Pavlov defense minister Dmitriy Yazov KGB chief Vladimir Kryuchkov and many other senior officials At that time Gorbachev was holidaying in Crimea These officials put him under house arrest They also issued orders banning all political activities and banned most newspapers 

This was like a coup The organizers had expected popular support for their action But the people did not support them Instead they supported White House then the symbolic seat of Russian sovereignty The organizers of the coup tried but failed to arrest Boris Yeltsin After three days on August 21 the coup failed The authorities detained the organizers Gorbachev returned as president of the Soviet Union However Gorbachevs real powers had reduced 

Through the autumn of 1991 the Russian government took over the union government ministry by ministry In November 1991 Yeltsin issued an order banning the CPSU throughout the Russian republic As a result many former CPSU personnel left CPSU to join the new positions in the new Russian government 

After the failure of the coup the republics of the Soviet Union increased their efforts to become independent On 6th September 1991 the Soviet Union recognized the independence of Estonia Latvia and Lithuania On 1st December 1991 Ukraine declared its independence after 90 of the voters opted for an independent Ukraine One by one the remaining eleven republics of the Soviet Union also declared themselves as sovereign and independent states 

As noted above on 6th September 1991 the Soviet Union had recognized the independence of Estonia Latvia and Lithuania It may be note that twelve out of the fifteen republics of the Soviet Union had signed an international agreement in the Hague on 17th December 1991 The signing had indicated that these republics had practically become independent and sovereign countries 

Leaving apart already independent Estonia Latvia and Lithuania the remaining 12 republics all joined the Commonwealth of Independent States In December 1993 Georgia also joined the CIS On 26th August 2006 Turkmenistan left the permanent membership and became an associate member

Many persons believed that with the creation of the Commonwealth of Independent States the Soviet Union ceased to exist They believed that it was the dissolution of the Soviet Union Many others think that with CIS the Russia continues to have some control over the former republics of the Soviet Union 

On December 25 1991 Gorbachev resigned as president of the USSR By December 31 1991 all official Soviet institutions had stopped to function in different republics of the Soviet Union The individual governments of these republics started functioning The Soviet flag flew last time over the Kremlin

The four principles had governed the Soviet Union a chain of soviets ethnic federation state socialism and supremacy of the Communist party Gorbachevs policies of perestroika and glasnost created a situation which weakened all the above four principles He repeatedly tried to form a circle of leaders to support his policies He tried to do all these as he and his team saw that the Soviet Union was moving toward a long term stagnation 

Gorbachevs policies made it possible for leaders of various Soviet republics to gain confidence and influence At the same time he faced opposition from many including the nationalist forces and the traditional communists Some people accepted the reforms some wanted the old system to continue and some desired complete independence from the Soviet Union and central control In the end Gorbachev was unable to ensure any common view among these forces Ultimately this led to the collapse and dissolution of the Soviet Union 

Immediately after the dissolution of the Soviet Union Yeltsins took many steps to change the economy of the Soviet Union from a socialist economy to a capitalist economy For example he cut the payment of grants to money loosing farms and industries he also removed control over prices he took steps for convertibility of the Russian ruble He also allowed many persons close to his circle and other business people to take possession of the businesses and industries earlier owned by the government and to run them as private enterprises The planners and economists had thought that these changes would lead to a faster economic development However nothing of this sort happened 

Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union Russia is facing many problems including the following

Many Russians of older generation believe that the earlier system was better During 1990s Russia faced many crises in political social and economic matters Many persons still believe that the situation still continues to be worse compared to earlier times 

The Meiji Restoration was a time of change great in Japan In the Japanese language Meiji ishin is the term for Meiji Restoration The term describes a number of events that took place in the politics and society of Japan that changed the shape of Japans political and social systems These changes took place mainly during three years  from 1866 to 1869

At that time Tokugawa Shogunate was ruling Japan In the year 1866 two leaders came together under an alliance The name of this alliance was the Sat cho Alliance The name of the first leader was Saigo Takamori He was the leader of the Satsuma Province The second leader was Kido Takayoshi who was the leader of the Choshu and a person named Sakamoto Ryoma brought the two leaders together These two leaders supported the Emperor of Japan who at the time did not have much power With their support the emperor could regain much of his power Tokugawa Shogunates rule ended on 9th November 1867 but they still retained some authority and power In 1868 an army of forces from Satsuma Province and Choshu defeated the forces of Tokugawa Shogunate and with this the power of Tokugawa Shogunate ended completed 

The leaders of the Meiji Restoration acted in the name of Japans emperor to restore the emperors powers But the leaders also kept to themselves a number of powers In fact even after Meiji Restoration an oligarchy had the real power who ruled in the name of the emperor In plain words an oligarchy means a group of people who have the real powers 

After the Meiji Restoration Japans progress was fast Its industry developed rapidly and within next three to four decades Japan had become a military power comparable to any other of the time

Martin grew up playing piano with only a few music lessons He began to compose music in his teens Martin played with his own band called the Four Tune Tellers He dreamed of one day making soundtrack music for movies

After serving in the Royal Air Force during World War II Martin went to music school After he graduated he worked for the BBC in London He began working for EMI in 1950 Martin became an assistant at Parlophone Records a small record label Parlophone mostly recorded classical music and original cast recordings of popular stage shows and plays

Martin later became the chief of Parlophone Records He was also its staff producer Martin was in charge of recording sessions and chose songs for Parlophone artists to record He made comedy records along with his usual jobs to help promote the label When rock and roll became popular in the mid 1950s Martin began looking for rock groups or artists to join Parlophone He recorded several such artists but none of their records became big hits

In 1962 Beatles manager Brian Epstein brought Martin a demo of his band Epstein had been trying for months to get the band a recording contract Martin liked what he heard He saw that the young band were willing to try different things and gave them an audition All the Beatles passed their audition except for their drummer Pete Best Martin was not happy with the skills Best showed He wanted to replace Best on their recordings When the band found out they fired Best replacing him with Ringo Starr Starr had played with them before when Best could not be with them to play Martin used a studio drummer on their first single Love Me Do He did this because there was no time to audition Starr before the record had to be made but he never did so again

With Starr as their drummer and Martin as their producer the Beatles became the most popular act in the history of show business While Beatles John Lennon and Paul McCartney wrote most of the bands songs they were musically untrained as Martin had been earlier Martin helped develop their musical ideas He helped the band learn to talk to other musicians about the sounds they wanted to make and added a classical touch to many of their songs His work with them made Martin famous He was able to leave EMI to become a producer for hire He started his own company called Associated Independent Recording with some other producers

When the Beatles began to break up in 1969 Martin felt the tension between the bands members He was sometimes broken wikt linkcriticizecriticized for not being able to fix things or solve their problems He began turning down sessions with the band He let the recording engineer or the members themselves do his job Martin returned to help make their last album after all the Beatles promised to work with him like the old days and let Martin take charge of the sessions once more

Paul McCartney the most conventional Beatle worked with Martin several times after the Beatles ended in 1970 John Lennon counted on Martin to turn his sometimes way out ideas into finished records but he did not always like the way Martin worked and mostly produced his own solo recordings George Harrison the youngest Beatle found many of his songs and ideas rejected by Martin Martin later said I was always rather beastly to George in trying to make more hit records Harrison also produced most of his own solo work He even built his own recording studio after years of making records at Abbey Road Martin praised Ringo Starrs super steady beat and the sound his drums gave the Beatles records but each later worked with other people

Even years after they broke up Martin still worked with and for the Beatles and the music they had made together He remixed many of their recordings for re issues and compilation records He made several records of his own with classical and orchestral versions of Beatles tunes and was the music producer for Sergeant Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band a fantasy movie based on their songs which starred the Bee Gees and Peter Frampton

Besides the Beatles Martin worked with other recording artists including Shirley Bassey Bernard Cribbins America Kenny Rogers Dudley Moore and Little River Band He wrote a book All You Need is Ears that told his life story and explained how many of his most famous recordings were made During the 1990s Martin was made a knight by the British government for his work and his role in popular music

Martin retired in 1999 and released an album titled In My Life which featured many different artists performing Beatles songs The album included non musicians like comedian Jim Carrey

Brian Samuel Epstein was an English businessman Epstein was the manager of The Beatles who became the most popular rock and roll band in the world during the 1960s

Epstein started out to become an actor and went to school at RADA with future movie stars Peter OToole and Susannah York He was not happy at school though and quit to work in his familys furniture stores in Liverpool He was a skillful salesman and loved classical music When his family opened a record department in one of their stores Epstein was put in charge The department was so successful that the family decided to open a whole store to sell music and records This was named NEMS for North End Music Stores and Epstein became its boss This store was also a big success

Popular music rock and roll especially sold better than classical music and Epstein wanted to sell what the public would buy most He began to stock rock and roll records and record buyers around England liked Epstein and his store Some of his customers were members of bands looking for new music to play or to pass the time and came often to the store Among those bands were the early Beatles

Epstein was Jewish and homosexual

Late in 1961 when a fan asked Epstein about a record the Beatles had made in Germany Epstein was unable to find it through his sources When he learned the band were playing at the Cavern Club not far away Epstein visited them there and was impressed by their act He found out what he needed to know to get the record so NEMS could sell copies Epstein also discovered that the band had no manager but they wanted one and their main goal was to get a recording contract in England Epstein became their manager

Epstein used his sales ability to get the band more and better jobs playing music He also used his position to make contact with different record labels hoping to get the Beatles signed up An audition with Decca Records on New Years Day 1962 sounded hopeful but Decca decided to turn the band down as did most of the labels Epstein approached

Decca gave Epstein a copy of the bands demo tape which he used to promote them but could not find anyone interested He thought an actual record might work better than the tape so he went to have a test record made The recording engineer who made the record told Epstein about George Martin who worked for EMIs Parlophone Records and had been looking for a rock band to record Martin liked what he heard well enough to offer the band another audition

The Beatles passed their EMI audition as a group and signed a contract with Parlophone Drummer Pete Best did not meet Martins standards though and Martin planned to use a studio drummer instead on their records When the band found out they asked Epstein to fire Best and they replaced him with Ringo Starr who quit another band to join them

Over the next year The Beatles became the most popular recording act in Britain and Europe and then in America during 1964 Following their success Epstein signed up other bands and singers including Gerry and the Pacemakers Cilla Black Billy J Kramer and the Remo Four Each found success and hit records but none became as popular as the Beatles Epstein started a management company NEMS Enterprises who later signed up the Bee Gees Jimi Hendrix and Cream

Like many pop stars Epstein also had fans and gave away signed photographs of himself He published an autobiography in 1964 with help from Derek Taylor who was the Beatless press agent Epstein was still interested in theater and he bought the Saville Theatre in London which presented plays and rock concerts

As time went on Epstein felt more and more stress in his working and personal lives and turned to drugs such as sleeping pills and sedatives to help him cope During 1967 he became afraid that the Beatles would not stay with him when their management contract expired that year and his drug use increased One weekend while the band was away in Wales Epstein overdosed on pills and died in his sleep

An autopsy concluded that Epstein did not commit suicide but accidentally took too many pills over a long period of time without giving the drugs a chance to clear out of his body The Beatles and all the artists he managed mourned his death It was said later that losing him was the beginning of the Beatles breakup which happened in 1970

The Plastic Ono Band was a rock and roll band formed by Yoko Ono with husband John Lennon They were active from 1969 until 1974

Lennon and Ono recorded their first single together titled Give Peace A Chance in a Montreal hotel with a roomful of guests including Tommy Smothers Allen Ginsberg Norman Mailer Timothy Leary and the local Hare Krishna chapter The pair were in an auto accident before the single was to debut and they had to stay in the hospital Not wanting to cancel the debut they sent the first version of their new band a set of plastic cases that held the sound equipment which played in their place It was a strange kind of debut for a new band but the song became a minor hit that year in England and in the United States

The second version of the Plastic Ono Band included Ono and Lennon in person along with musicians Eric Clapton Klaus Voormann and Alan White They performed together at a rock concert in Toronto in September 1969 and it was the first time Lennon had played in public with a band other than the Beatles The show went well and helped Lennon decide to leave the Beatles which he had thought about doing for some time A second single Cold Turkey was recorded with this lineup

After the Beatles ended Lennon decided he did not want to have another permanent band and he and Ono used the Plastic Ono Band name to refer to any musicians who appeared on the records they made together Even listeners were called a part of the band especially when the band gave a concert An advertisement for one of their records included a page from a telephone book and the words YOU are the Plastic Ono Band

Ono and Lennon separated for a time during 1973 and 1974 Lennon still used forms of the band name on the two albums he released during their separation while Onos records of the time appeared under her name alone When they got back together in 1975 Ono became pregnant and both decided to retire from music to be parents Their son Sean Lennon was born on October 9 1975 which was Lennons 35th birthday

In 1980 Lennon and Ono decided to restart their music careers but this time their records appeared under their own names and the Plastic Ono Band name was retired

A standard is a basis for comparison Standards are made either by many people that agree on something or if some organisation makes it so There are many different standards in many fields of daily life Standards are important so that correct comparisons can be produced

The international system of units is a standard that is agreed on by most countries In it there is metre It measures length There currently is a rod This rod in Paris The length of the rod says how long a meter is So when people want to measure something they compare it to the length of the rod For practical purposes the length of the rod has been divided by 10 by 10 and so on The iridium rod as it is called is the original measure of meter Now new ways of measuring the meter have been utilized such as the measuring of certain types of wave lengths to determine an exact meter

A standard in music is a song that remains popular and is performed and recorded by many different artists Such songs include Yesterday and Something written by members of The Beatles Many of Hank Williamss songs have become standards in country music

In mathematics and statistics the mean is another name for the average

The mean is calculated by adding all of the values together then dividing by the number of original values Keep everything neat

Example 1 2 2 100 100 is a set of numbers or scores If we add all the numbers the answer is 205 By dividing this number by the number of numbers we discover that the mean is 41 The difficulty with this particular set of numbers is that no one in this group scored anything like a 41 and the mean does not tell us much about what kind of scores these numbers represent 

The idea behind the mean is to represent a number of measurements or values by one value only But there are different ways to calculate such a representing value 

If people do many different measurements they will get many different results Those results have a certain distribution and they can also be centered around an average value This average value is what mathematicians call arithmetic mean

Mean can also stand for expected value

Jean Louis Lebris de Kerouac better known as Jack Kerouac was an American author and poet He was part of the Beat Generation movement of writers and artists of the 1950s and 1960s and gave the movement its name His most famous work was a long novel titled On the Road which was published in 1957

Kerouac was a friend of writers Allen Ginsberg William S Burroughs Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Gregory Corso among many others Nearly all of Kerouacs writings were directly based on his own life but he mostly changed names and details to protect everyones privacy The man he wrote about most was his friend Neal Cassady who was called Dean Moriarty in On the Road Kerouac influenced many other writers and poets who came along later and also many musicians of the 1960s through his works He also changed the way Americans saw themselves and their country

Kerouac was born in Lowell Massachusetts to broken wikt linkFrench CanadianFrench Canadian parents and was the youngest of three children He spoke only French until he started school His family was Roman Catholic His father was a printer and Kerouac became interested in printed works He liked to make his own handwritten newspapers and books He enjoyed reading and imitated the styles of writers he liked such as Thomas Wolfe He became an expert typist and could type faster than 100 words per minute

Kerouac was a good athlete and went to Columbia University in New York on a football scholarship but an injury during a practice game ended his football career He dropped out of Columbia and devoted himself to writing stories and plays He met Allen Ginsberg at college Their circle of friends included many future writers and artists like William S Burroughs and Herbert Huncke

During World War II Kerouac served in the Merchant Marine which made him a broken wikt linkveteranveteran of the American military He kept journals of his experiences and he used them later to write other works He was also able to get veterans benefits later such as medical help when he was sick with broken wikt linkphlebitisphlebitis and grant money to pay his bills while he wrote Kerouac was proud to be an American and always said good things about his country

Kerouacs father died of stomach cancer in 1946 He made Kerouac promise to always work to support his mother He tried to talk Kerouac out of becoming a writer because he knew it was hard to succeed in such a career Kerouac had a hard time staying with any other kind of work though He would become impatient or restless or a disagreement with someone at work would turn into trouble Kerouac did his best to earn enough money to pay for both his and his mothers living but his mother also had to work She was a nurse She worked in a factory when there were no nursing jobs

Kerouac published a few broken wikt linkshort storyshort stories and reviews in New York magazines and newspapers in the 1940s He worked briefly for his hometown newspaper The Lowell Sun His first novel The Town and the City was published in 1950 For his second novel Kerouac wanted to write a book about broken wikt linkcross countrycross country road trips and hitchhiking Hitchhiking was safer to do in the 1940s in America than it is today Kerouac stopped and restarted writing this book several times Kerouac did not want to just tell an ordinary story He wanted to give an idea of how the people he met thought things through and expressed this to each other along with telling what they did and said He also knew he needed more experiences to tell a better story

Many experiences came through Kerouacs friendship with Neal Cassady Cassady was a handsome bright young broken wikt linkdrifterdrifter with a teenaged wife named Luanne Henderson Cassady and Luanne had a hard relationship and broke up and got back together many times He later married another woman named Carolyn Robinson who was older than Luanne and understood him better but Carolyn and Cassady also had troubles Kerouac was briefly married to girlfriend Edie Parker They did not stay together long and were soon divorced Cassady taught Kerouac who never had a broken wikt linkdrivers licensedrivers license how to drive while Kerouac taught Cassady about writing

Neal Cassady traveled back and forth across the country usually driving cars like Hudsons at high speed he looked for jobs fresh experiences and new friends Kerouac began to travel with him They lived in and visited cities such as Denver San Francisco Monterey and even Mexico City They also looked sometimes for Cassadys father who disappeared years earlier Kerouac got sick in Mexico City and Cassady left him behind at the hospital Kerouac had to make his own way home He took this very hard and was angry with Cassady He forgave him later when they met again and he made Cassady the central character of his new book One job Kerouac could fall back on thanks to Cassady was as a railroad brakeman

Many people in the 1940s and 1950s used broken wikt linkstimulantstimulant drugs such as benzedrine to help them stay alert Jazz music was also popular and some jazz musicians and listeners smoked marijuana Kerouac was influenced by both drugs and they changed the way he wrote He began to write what he called broken wikt linkspontaneousspontaneous prose jotting down words in much the same way a musician broken wikt linkimproviseimprovises a solo in a song His new writing style was strange to many people and even seen as bad by some older authors and critics It was six years before Kerouac published his second novel

The version of On the Road that finally satisfied Kerouac was written over three weeks in 1951 It was typed on a single roll of teletype paper Kerouac liked to type on rolls of paper because he did not have to stop to change pages He had just gotten married for the second time to Joan Haverty The manuscript was Kerouacs way to explain his friendship with Neal Cassady to his new wife The explanation made a fine rough draft for a novel but it did not help his marriage Joan felt that Kerouacs nonstop work on the manuscript was an broken wikt linkobsessionobsession and she did not want to stay married to him after it was finished They were soon divorced as he was with his first wife

The editor who worked on The Town and the City found the long scroll like manuscript hard to understand and even harder to work with Kerouacs publisher rejected the novel as did every other publisher he went to Nor was anyone interested in The Subterraneans a shorter novel he wrote in three nights about his romance with an African American woman Such a relationship was taboo in America during the 1950s Kerouac continued to write from short stories and essays to long novels and even poetry He tried many different subjects but had almost nothing published He also worked different jobs including brakeman and broken wikt linknight watchmannight watchman

It turned out that Joan Haverty was pregnant by Kerouac and she gave birth to a daughter Jan Michelle Kerouac denied he was the father at first but a blood test later proved it was likely She also grew to look like him and he accepted her as his child Joan sued Kerouac for child support but he was ill and could not work at the time and she collected almost no money Kerouac only saw Jan a few times but talked to her more often by telephone Joan mostly kept them apart

Allen Ginsberg became well known during the 1950s for his writings in particular a poem called Howl whose title came from Kerouacs broken wikt linkcritiquecritique of it Ginsberg mentioned his friends in some of his works including Kerouac and wanted the people who liked him to give them and their writings a chance Finally Viking Press agreed to publish On the Road after many changes to the manuscript The novel became a bestseller and Kerouac was a celebrity after years of little success Magazines began to request articles and essays from him He appeared on many television programs including The Steve Allen Show Steve Allen liked him and they recorded an album together with Kerouac reading aloud and Allen playing piano He recorded another album later with jazz musicians Al Cohn and Zoot Sims

Kerouac wrote and published more novels including The Dharma Bums Doctor Sax Maggie Cassidy Visions of Gerard Big Sur Desolation Angels and Book of Dreams He studied Buddhism and this also influenced his writing He wrote Some of the Dharma as an introduction to Buddhism though he remained a Catholic

As Kerouac Ginsberg and their friends became famous a trend among the group of writers and artists was noticed and was written about in the mainstream media Kerouac was asked to describe his generation He explained that the pressures of 20th century living had beaten normal ways of thinking and working out of them and they preferred the beat of bebop and jazz to most other music so I guess you could say were a beat generation

Beat Generation became the name for the new sense of style coming from artists and writers in New York and San Francisco Kerouacs circle of friends and acquaintances were called the Beats with Kerouac himself called King of the Beats by the media Kerouac narrated a movie called Pull My Daisy about the Beat phenomenon

An ongoing problem Kerouac had with fame was that people thought he did all the things he wrote about Much of what he described was only what he saw in other people Not everyone who read Kerouacs stories understood this Some people wanted to blame him for doing bad things or getting others to do them Other people wanted to do those kinds of things with Kerouac Shy by nature Kerouac pulled away He became almost a broken wikt linkrecluserecluse in the house he bought for his mother He also began to abuse alcohol

During the 1960s American society went through many changes in part because of the influence of the Beats Many young people read On the Road and saw things they related to and it made them want to experience more in their own lives Other writers liked the looseness of Kerouacs style and it made them think more about their own writing how to study life and how to better express themselves Many musicians were affected by Kerouacs books including Bob Dylan Donovan and The Doors

Kerouac was more disappointed than happy to be famous Even though he liked some of what he inspired he felt that the public largely got the wrong message from his books He saw many people take what the Beats wrote as a kind of permission to get into trouble or abandon people and things they cared about He felt broken wikt linksympathysympathy for the broken wikt linkhippiehippies but disagreed with them on the Vietnam War the role of government and broken wikt linkpatriotismpatriotism He also lost some of his old friends when their views differed

Kerouac still abused alcohol and other drugs and it harmed his health He became bloated and irritable and looked drunk on his last television appearance on William F Buckleys Firing Line in 1968 He married for the third time to Stella Sampas the sister of a boyhood friend Stella looked after Kerouac and his mother kept the public and others away and tried to get him to stop drinking alcohol

His daughter Jan Michelle also began to write during her teen years He gave her his broken wikt linkblessingblessing and told her You can use my name She wrote under the name Jan Kerouac and published novels and stories herself from the 1970s to the 1990s Kerouacs mother became sick and he sometimes worked at her bedside on stories She helped him work out the ending of Pic his novel about a young African American

Kerouac wrote and reworked new material until the last day of his life He died during emergency surgery to try to repair a broken wikt linkhemorrhagehemorrhage caused by his alcohol abuse He was buried in his hometown and was hardly remembered there at first Even though he was world famous Kerouac earned very little money as a writer He died with only a few hundred dollars in the bank It was years before his grave received a headstone

Neal Cassady died more than a year before of exposure alongside a railroad track in Mexico He set out to become a writer or musician but he never got far with either He only published one book The First Third which was about his youth Cassady earned most of his money from labor and was often out of work and owed money He spent a long time in jail after he was arrested for selling marijuana Sometimes the fact that Cassady was well known through Kerouac kept him from having the life he wanted Cassady had a family with Carolyn but she had to both work and raise the children when her husband was away Carolyn later wrote a memoir

Kerouacs works especially On the Road are now more popular than ever Generations have discovered his works as a means of learning about life and attitudes in America during his lifetime as a way to measure their own sense of experience or as examples of broken wikt linkfree associationfree association and broken wikt linkstream of consciousnessstream of consciousness in broken wikt linkcreative writingcreative writing 

Less than half of Kerouacs writings were published during his lifetime but nearly all are now available The ones published later drew hundreds of times more money than his most famous works when they first appeared His hometown Lowell remembers Kerouac today with a broken wikt linkmemorialmemorial and cultural events every year His grave now has a headstone which reads He honored life A street in Lowell was renamed Jack Kerouac Alley in his memory

An example of biotechnology is the use of the fermentation reaction in yeast to make beer and other alcoholic drinks Another example is the use of carbon dioxide produced by yeast to make bread rise

Biotechnology is often used to refer to genetic engineering technology of the 21st century however the term encompasses a wider range and history of procedures for modifying biological organisms according to the needs of humanity going back to the initial modifications of native plants into improved food crops through artificial selection and hybridization Bioengineering is the science upon which all biotechnological applications are based With the development of new approaches and modern techniques traditional biotechnology industries are also acquiring new horizons enabling them to improve the quality of their products and increase the productivity of their systems

Biotechnology has also made cloning possible A lot of people think that this is morally wrong while others think it could solve many diseases

Her parents died early After this her maternal grandmother Marry Ludlow Hall raised her She spent her childhood in Tivoli New York Most of her mothers family members tended to look down at her perhaps because of her plain looks and six foot tall frame Even her Hyde Park Roosevelts including her future mother in law Sara Delano Roosevelt would remark to her about the Manhattan Roosevelts we got all the looks and the money 

In recent times allegations have surfaced that in her maternal grandmothers home she felt insecure Many male members used to consume a lot of drinks Once when she was visiting her aunt Bamie Roosevelt she broke down and in tears exclaimed I have no real home 

Aunt Bamie was very helpful She tried to find better educational opportunities for her She arranged that Eleanor go to England for education and Eleanor readily agreed

Eleanor received encouragement from Bamie Roosevelt sister of Theodore Roosevelt to get a good education She went to London and started her studies in a girls boarding school at Allenswood outside London She studied there from 1899 to 1902 Mademoiselle Marie Souvestre was her headmistress Later Eleanor would recall that Souvestre was one of the three main persons to influence her life

She started her role as the First Lady from 1933 with the beginning of her husbands first term as the President of the United States Eleanor was an active First Lady with her own ideology on many issues 

She supported the American Civil Rights Movement and rights of the African American However her husband needed the support of Democrats of southern states of the USA Therefore he was not vocal about the American Civil Rights Movement Eleanor became his connection to the African American population instead helping Franklin Roosevelt to win a lot of votes

In 1939 the African American opera singer Marian Anderson did not get permission to perform at a particular place known as the Constitution Hall in Washington Eleanor arranged for Anderson to perform on the steps of another important place named Lincoln Memorial to a live audience of 70000 Millions of people listened to this on the radio

During the Second World War Eleanor Roosevelt remained very active Once she also co chaired a committee on civil defense She visited many places both civilian and military to boost war morale She especially supported African Americans and women 

During the Second War her husband as the President of the United States signed an order named Executive Order 9066 This order confine in special camps about 110000 American citizens of Japanese descent Eleanor opposed her husbands decision to sign this order 

For some period she was earning 1000 a week for advertising for the Pan American Coffee Bureau Eight foreign governments used to support and fund the Bureau The US State Department tried to cancel the deal but could not do so

After the Second World War she along with Ren Cassin John Peters Humphrey and others drafted a declaration for the United Nations UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights She also served as the first chairman of the UN Human Rights Commission On 10th December 1948 the UN General Assembly adopted the declaration This made her very famous and was a great achievement for her 

For about four decades beginning from 1920s until her death in 1962 Eleanor continued her association with political matters She opposed the Equal Rights Amendment She thought that this amendment would prevent the US Congress from passing other rules for protection of women workers 

In July 1949 her unsure attitude toward American Catholics caused a public debate with Francis Cardinal Spellman the Catholic Archbishop of New York Eleanor had written against certain proposals like funding of certain activities such as bus transportation for students of Catholic schools Spellman pointed out that the Supreme Court had recently upheld such provisions He also accused her of anti Catholicism Most Democrats rallied behind Eleanor Roosevelt and supported her Spellman came to Eleanors Hyde Park home to bridge their differences

Sara Delano Roosevelt was her mother in law Even before Eleanor married FDR She did not have a good relationship with Sara Delano Biographers and historians still continue to discuss the issue and the reasons for their difficult relationship However in early years of her marriage Eleanor valued suggestions from her mother in law until she herself could develop confidence in domestic matters 

Perhaps Sara wanted great success for her son FDR in all matters of life including marriage She had always given her affection to FDR to the extent of spoiling her She even gave costly gifts to FDR and Eleanors children Sometimes Eleanor had problems which came with such costly gifts of her mother in law

Eleanor always enjoyed the good graces of her uncle Theodore Roosevelt the main figure of the Oyster Bay Roosevelts However she found her at odds with her cousin Alice Roosevelt Alice was a daughter of Theodore Roosevelt Uncle Theodore felt Eleanors conduct more responsible socially acceptable and cooperative than her own daughter Alice Alice was beautiful and highly photogenic but a rebellious person Sometimes Theodore Roosevelt would tell her Why cannot you be more like cousin Eleanor These experiences laid a life long unhappy relationship between two high profile cousins 

With the rise in the political career of FDR relationship between Eleanor and Oyster Bay Roosevelts perhaps became worse There would be comments by cousin Alice such as her later description of FDR as two thirds mush and one third Eleanor However at FDRs presidential inauguration in 1933 invitations went to Alice to attend along with her brothers Kermit Roosevelt and Archibald Roosevelt Eleanor was close to her cousins Kermit Roosevelt and Archibald Roosevelt

The married life of Eleanor and FDR seemed to be free of problems Many biographers and historians however believe that Eleanor was bisexual She became friendly with Lorena Hickok Lorena was a correspondent of the Associated Press She conducted many interviews of Eleanor Many rumors arose about their lesbian sex relationship 

Her family members refuted all such claims Her son James Roosevelt maintained that his mother did not know what a lesbian was and believed that his mother who grew up in the Victorian era often used a tones that could seem overly affectionate which lead to her statements being misconstrued Her cousin Alice with whom she had not very happy relations also refuted any such claims Once she stated loudly in a fashionable restaurant I do not care what they say I simply cannot believe that Eleanor Roosevelt is a lesbian Eleanor Roosevelt Seagraves a grand child of Eleanor stated in recent years that her grandmother Eleanor did indeed love Hickok but determined to remain celibate in the years following her husbands affair 

In recent years some evidences indicate her relationship with at least one man her longtime bodyguard Earl Miller

Furniture is the word that means all the things like chairs tables and cupboards 

In other words furniture are all the things that are in the house and that people can use to sit to lie on or that are supposed to contain smaller things like cloths or cups Furniture is made of wood particle boards leather screws etc

Bedroom furniture is the objects in the bedroom The bed is covered by sheets a bedspread and maybe a blanket There is also a pillow on the bed Next to the bed is the nightstand It is also called the night table A lamp is on the nightstand The dresser has drawers for clothes On top of a dresser may be a mirror

Rhythm is a word that refers to the length of time between each major beat or accent such as in a piece of music The first beat of a group of regular evenly spaced beats feels stronger than the others When we write music down we put each group in bars The first beat of the bar feels stronger than the others 

Rhythms can have different patterns which can be clapped or tapped In Western music these patterns are common 

A conductor will beat time The rhythm will fit in to this regular beat

All musicians have to have a good sense of rhythm To play or sing rhythmically they must keep a steady beat in their head listen to the others players or watch the conductor

People who are playing on their own can practise with a metronome to help them to play to a steady beat However musicians also use rubato especially when playing music of a romantic nature One has to learn to let the music breathe in the right way This is not the same as playing unrhythmically It is something one learns with experience

Feeling the rhythm in music is basically human A person who has a stroke may lose language but not the sense of rhythm Neurologist Oliver Sacks says that chimpanzees and other animals do not have a sense of rhythm

The word rhythm is used in other topics than music The heart usually beats rhythmically and when it does not that is a sign of a health problem Rhythms may be about much longer time periods than a bar of music Everything living is rhythmic relating to the 24 hour light dark cycle on earth The moon has its rhythms and the tides have theirs

Sometimes the word rhythm is used in a more general sense to mean the general flow of music or of life in general

All the letters in the alphabet are either consonants or vowels A consonant is a speech sound in which the air is at least partly blocked and any letter which represents this Consonants may come singly or in clusters but must be connected to a vowel to form a syllable

Consonants have friction when they are spoken mostly using the position of the tongue against the lips teeth and roof of the mouth b and p are plosives using the lips to produce a tiny sharp sound Phonetics texts give more details with diagrams Consonants may be voiced or unvoiced The th in the is voiced but in breath is not

All the letters in the alphabet denote either vowels or consonants Vowels have no friction made when spoken All words have vowels In words like spy sty lynx fly etc the vowel is a Y which can also be a consonant 

Y and W can be considered as

Vowels and consonants are what makes up the actual sounds in a language To say however that letters are vowels is incorrect Our English alphabet is a list of 26 symbols used to indicate in writing the sounds we are able to isolate from within the individual words we speak These symbols we call letters therefore are written symbols and their association with the spoken sounds is completely conventional and has no scientific ground For instance the symbol used for the aspiration sound in English h and H correspond to different sounds in other alphabetical conventions notably H in Modern Greek stands for the long vowel E

A metronome is a small object that can be used by people who are practising instruments to help them to play in time It is also something a composer can use to show the performer what speed to play

A traditional metronome works by clockwork It has a pendulum which makes a loud tick as it goes to and fro like the pendulum of a grandfather clock It has to be wound up after a few minutes of ticking There is a weight on the pendulum which can be slid up or down and set to a particular speed There are numbers on the metronome to which you can set it These numbers mean the number of ticks per minutes A speed of 60 will make it tick 60 times a minute The numbers usually go from 40 to 208 Nowadays many people use electronic metronomes These are very accurate do not need to be wound and often have other helpful things like an A to tune to Some of them are hardly bigger than a credit card

The metronome was invented by Dietrich Nikolaus Winkel in Amsterdam in 1812 A man called Johann Maelzel copied Winkels ideas and improved them He made a small portable metronome which was patented in 1816 

The metronome made it possible for a composer to show the performer what speed he wanted If the composer writes at the top of his music Crotchet 76 for example then the metronome can be set at 76 and it will tick at the right speed for that piece of music Sometimes they write MM76 The MM stands for Maelzels Metronome Beethoven was the first composer to use metronome markings but he often gave very fast speed indications and some people wonder whether he made mistakes or whether his metronome worked properly

The population of Trieste practically nearly all Italian promoted this union of the city to Italy in 1918 and since the end of WWI the city has been the capital of the Italian region called Venezia Giulia

The population is 207069 ab It was nearly 300000 after WWII because many Italian refugees flooded the city as a consequence of the Istrian Dalmatian exodus

Actually Trieste is important because of its shipbuilding industry science parks universities and history on the border of western Europe Trieste will be connected to the Italian TAV railway network a 300 kmhour fast train route is going to connect Trieste with Venice in the next years

During the Austro Hungarian Empire Trieste became a leading European city in economy trade and commerce and was the fourth largest and most important center in the Empire after Vienna Budapest and Prague However the economy of Trieste fell into a small decline after the citys annexation to Italy following World War I because was cut off from the Mittleurope 

But Fascist Italy promoted a huge development of Trieste in the 1930s with new manufacturing activities related even to naval and armament industries Allied bombings during WWII destroyed the industrial section of the city

As a consequence Trieste was a mainly peripheral city during the Cold War However since the 1970s Trieste has had a huge economic boom thanks to a significant commercial shipping business to the container terminal steel works and an oil terminal 

Trieste is also Italys and Mediterraneans greatest coffee ports as the city supplies more than 40 of Italys coffee Coffee brands such as Illy were founded and are headquartered in the city Currently Trieste is one of Europes most important ports and centres for trade and transport with Trieste being part of the Corridor 5 plan to create a bigger transport connection between Western and Eastern European countries

The campus roughly bounded between 31st and 35th streets Michigan Avenue and the Dan Ryan Expressway was designed by modernist architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe one of the great figures of 20th century architecture who chaired the IIT School of Architecture from 1938 to 1958 Van der Rohes master plan for the IIT campus was one of the most ambitious projects he ever conceived The campus has twenty of his works It is the greatest concentration of his buildings in the world The layout of the campus departs radically from traditional college quadrangles and limestone buildings The materials are inspired by the factories and warehouses of Chicagos South Side and embody 20th century methods and materials steel and concrete frames with curtain walls of brick and glass 

Alfred Caldwell designed the campus landscape Caldwall was van der Rohes close colleague at IIT and was called the last representative of the Prairie School of landscape architects Known as the nature poet Caldwells plan reinforced van der Rohes design with landscaping planted in a free flowing manner which in its interaction with the pristine qualities of the architecture introduced a poetic aspect

On the west side of Main Campus are three red brick buildings that were original to Armour Institute built between 1891 and 1901 In 1938 Ludwig Mies van der Rohe began his 20 year tenure as director of IITs School of Architecture The university was on the verge of building a brand new campus to be one of the nations first federally funded urban renewal projects Mies was given great freedom in the large project The university grew fast enough during and after World War II to allow much of the new plan to be realized From 1943 to 1957 several new Mies buildings rose across campus including the SR Crown Hall which houses the architecture school and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2001

Though Mies had emphasized his wish to complete the campus he had begun commissions from the late 50s onward were given to Skidmore Owings and Merrill prompting Mies to never return to the campus that had changed architecture the world over SOM architect Walter Netsch designed a few buildings including the new library that Mies had wished to create all of them similar to Miess style By the late 1960s campus addition projects were given to SOMs Myron Goldsmith who had worked with Mies during his education at IIT and thus was able to design several new buildings to harmonize well with the original campus In 1976 the American Institute of Architects recognized the campus as one of the 200 most significant works of architecture in the United States The new campus center designed by Rem Koolhaas and a new state of the art residence hall designed by Helmut Jahn State Street Village opened in 2003 These were the first new buildings built on the Main Campus in 32 years

There were four separate groups of emus in 1788 when the European settlers arrived The emus on the mainland of Australia and those on the island of Tasmania may have been different species There were also two species of Dwarf Emu Dromaius minor one living on King Island in Tasmania and the other on Kangaroo Island The group on King Island became extinct in 1805 that on Kangaroo Island in 1827 and that in Tasmania in 1865

The soft feathered brown birds reach up to convert19mft0lkonabbron in height Their feathers are in a double layer which helps keep the emu cool They have bare skin on the sides of the face and their neck They can weigh up to convert55kglb0lkonabbron They have two large legs with three toes on each foot Their wings are very short about 

The emu is common over most of mainland Australia It avoids very thick forests and very dry areas Emus can travel great distances at a fast trot If necessary they can run at up to convert50kmhmph0lkonabbron for some distance at a time They may travel long distances to find food One emu was found to have traveled convert990kmmi0lkonabbron 

They feed on a variety of plants and insects Because of their size they need to eat a lot

Emus are solitary birds However the young chicks stay with the father until they are 18 months of age The breeding season is between February and July when the female can lay between 5 15 eggs in a ground nest built by the male The male then sits on the eggs for 8 weeks until hatching The baby chicks have very clear stripes on the feathers which act as camouflage

On the east coast of Australia emus were once common but have become uncommon with increased human population On the other hand the development of farms and the supply of water for stock have increased the range of the Emu in arid regions Emus are farmed for their meat oil and leather The first emu farms began in Western Australia during the 1970s

The first written description of the emu was under the name of the New Holland Cassowary in Arthur Phillips Voyage to Botany Bay published in 1789 The species was named by ornithologist John Latham who worked on Phillips book He provided the first descriptions of and names for many Australian bird species Its scientific name Dromaius novaehollandiae is from the Latin words meaning fast footed New Hollander The history of the common name emu is not certain but is thought to have come from an Arabic word for large bird This word was later used by Portuguese explorers to describe the related Cassowary in New Guinea In Victoria some Indigenous Australian words for the emu were Barrimal in the Djadja wurrung language myoure in Gunai and courn in Jardwadjali

The history of the word Dodo is not clear The Dutch captain Wybrand van Warwijck discovered the island and the bird in 1598 He called the bird walgvogel meaning disgusting bird because the meat was unpleasant to eat Four years later the Dutch captain Willem van Westsanen used the word Dodo for the first time 

The Encarta Dictionary and the Chambers Dictionary of Etymology say Dodo is a Portuguese word coming from doido It means fool or crazy Another idea is that dodo was a copy of the birds own call a two note pigeon like sound doo doo In 1606 Cornelis de Jonge wrote an importan description of the Dodo and of other animal and plants on the island

The Dodo was a large bird and weighed about convert50lbkg0lkonabbron They had grey feathers and yellow feet Their big hooked bill was a greenyellow colour It had short wings that were only stubs They ate fruit seeds and nuts Portuguese sailors said that they saw the Dodos eating fish They also ate rocks and stones which might have helped them digest food

The dodo was not scared of people which made it easy to hunt and kill Dogs cats rats and pigs were brought to the island and also killed the dodos Because dodos built their nests on the ground the new animals ate their eggs The forests were chopped down and the dodo lost its habitat Within 80 years the dodo was extinct

The Dodo has not been seen since 1681 There are no complete examples of the Dodo in the world The last known stuffed bird was at Oxford University and was thrown out as rubbish Only a foot and a head are left The American Museum of Natural History in New York has a skeleton on display It was put together out of bones from several different Dodos The Natural History Museum of Mauritius has the only complete skeleton of a Dodo found in a swamp

Psychoanalysis is the type of treatment first developed and used by Sigmund Freud It is a type of psychological treatment that tries to help people understand themselves better It usually involves the patient meeting several times a week for several years with a trained doctor called a psychoanalyst The goal of the treatment is to help the patient know more about themselves their thoughts and feelings 

Most psychoanalysts believe that our thoughts and feelings are caused by what happens in childhood They think our relationships with our parents are very important Because these relationships are so important they will most likely try to change how the patient sees other people including the way they see the psychoanalyst When the patient has strong thoughts or feelings towards the psychoanalyst this is called transference

In psychoanalysis the patient tries to say everything that comes to mind This helps the doctor and patient to work together to understand the patients thoughts and feelings It is also important for the psychoanalyst to help the patient know how transference might change the way he or she thinks about the psychoanalyst Over a long period of time the patient should know his or her thoughts and feelings much better The patient should also better know how to put these thoughts and feelings into words They will also most likely have a better understanding of themselves and other people

A woodwind instrument is an instrument belonging to the woodwind family Traditionally they were always made of wood although some of them are now made of metal or plastic

In an orchestra there are four main types of woodwind instrument Each of these also has related instruments of different sizes

The piccolo is the highest of the four main instruments The lowest note is Middle C and it has a range of 3 octaves The piccolo is the smallest and highest instrument in the orchestra It plays one octave higher than the flute There is also an alto flute which sounds a fifth lower than the ordinary flute Flutes are still sometimes made of wood but mostly they are metal

The oboe can play slightly lower than the flute There is a larger version called the cor anglais This is a double reeded instrument The clarinet plays nearly an octave lower than the flute The bass clarinet plays an octave lower than the clarinet The bassoon is the lowest of the four gvottom B flat of the piano

The recorder is one of the oldest and most popular woodwinds and has been used to great effect by great dfgbv such as Bach Telemann and Vivaldi The general public is normally only familiar with the plastic childs version of the recorder but professional and high quality recorders are still made of wood

The saxophone may look like a brass instrument but it is played like a clarinet and therefore it is a woodwind instrument It is usually played in bands and jazz groups

Woodwind instruments are played in a variety of ways The flute is played by blowing across the top of the mouthpiece It is like blowing across the top of an empty bottle The oboe and bassoon both have a double reed It is like blowing through a drinking straw Bagpipes have double reeds which are inside the mouthpiece The clarinet and saxophone have single reeds which are clamped against the opening of the mouthpiece 

In comparison brass instruments are all blown in the same way by blowing against a cup shaped mouthpiece This is why the saxophone cannot be called a brass instrument although it is made of brass

The way that a player shapes his mouth to blow an instrument is called the embouchure Woodwind instruments have several different embouchures

In an orchestra there may be two each of flutes oboes clarinets and bassoons In larger orchestras particularly from the Romantic period onwards there may be three or four Sometimes the extra instruments such as the piccolo are used If for example in an orchestral piece the third flute is marked doubling piccolo it means that the person playing flute 3 will also play the piccolo However if the piccolo plays at the same time as flute 3 they will obviously need an extra player for the piccolo part

Woodwind instruments in an orchestra often have short solos These will be played by the first player

It also has been known as both classic and a masterpieceand has received a Special Edition 60th Anniversary Disney DVD on October 23 2001 exatly 60 years after its first release That release featured a sneak peak of a direct to video sequel called Dumbo IIThe preview showed a lot of sketches and storyboard ideas The main story has to do with Dumbo and his new friends getting separated from the rest of the circus as they wonder into the big city Dumbos new friends are Claude and Lolly the twin bears who leave chaos everywhere they go Dot the curious zebra Godfrey the hippo who is older and wants to do things for himself and Penny the adventurous ostrich Timothy returns as well The story was supposed to be as if the first Dumbo ended and this one started the next day The project seems to have been canceledas no further announcements have been made since plus the fact that the The Little Mermaid Ariels Beginning Tinker Bell and its sequels were to be the last projests for DisneyToon Studios

The crow characters in the movie are seen as African American stereotypes The leader crow was originally named Jim Crow for script purposes and the name stuck The other crows are all voiced by African American actors all members of the Hall Johnson Choir Despite suggestions of racism by some many historians such as Zoe Pritchard reject these claims For instance the crows are noted as forming the majority of the characters in the movie who are sympathetic to Dumbos plight are free spirits who serve nobody and intelligent characters aware of the power of self confidence unlike the Stepin Fetchit stereotype common at that time Furthermore their song When I See An Elephant Fly is more orientated to mocking Timothy Mouse than Dumbos large ears

Dumbos Circus was a live action puppet television programme for preschool audiences that aired on The Disney Channel in the 1980s Unlike in the movie Dumbo spoke on the show Each character would perform a special act which ranged from dancing and singing to telling knock knock jokes

Dumbo the Flying Elephant is a popular ride that appears in Walt Disney Worlds Magic Kingdom Disneyland Tokyo Disneyland Disneyland Park and Hong Kong Disneyland

Dumbo appears as a hero in the game Kingdom Hearts Sora the main character flies on him and Dumbo splashes enemies with water from his trunk

Bll wrote a lot of social critical literature His main themes were the repression in the way of life by conservative catholic forces and the unsolved problem of old Nazis in the society

In the 1970s he criticized the losing of civil laws by the fight against terrorism For that reason the Bild Zeitung an very conservative yellow press newspaper started a campaign against him

Johann Christoph Friedrich von Schiller usually known as Friedrich Schiller was a German poet philosopher historian and dramatist

Clement Richard Attlee 1st Earl Attlee KG OM CH PC was born on 3 January 1883 and died on 8 October 1967 was a British prime minister He was the first Labour prime minister with a majority in government and was very important in the setting up of the welfare state He was prime minister between 1945 and 1951 He was made a member of the House of Lords after he retired and became the first Earl Attlee

The bassoon is the lowest of the four main instruments of the woodwind family Like the oboe it has a double reed The reed is attached to a curved metal mouthpiece called a crook or bocal which is joined to the main part of the instrument This consists of two parts called bass joint and wing joint These two are joined at the bottom by a U shaped piece called the boot At the top of the instrument is the bell joint The instrument is quite heavy Some players have a neckstrap around their neck to support the weight but usually they use a seat strap that connects at the bottom of the boot and the strap goes across the floor The bassoonist then sits on that strap The bassoon is held to the right side of the bassoonist and the top of the boot joint is usually level with the players hip The bassoon when played right can sound very beautiful The bassoon has one of the largest note ranges going from low B flat to a high F on the top line of the treble clef The basson can also play in tenor clef but usually plays bass clef

Some bassoons have a white ivory ring round the top of the bell joint These are German bassoons French bassoons do not have this ring and also sound quite different to German bassoons Bassoons have keys to help the player to cover all the holes but these keys do not use the Boehm system like the other woodwind instruments German bassoons use a system called the Heckel system and French bassoons use the Buffet system

To play the bassoon it is very important to have lots of breathing support Like with the oboe fast passages can be played using double tonguing In most music the bassoon will spend a lot of time playing a bass line perhaps the same notes as the cello or tuba It can sometimes sound quite amusing when playing an um cha um cha accompaniment like in the Dance of the Cygnets from Tchaikovskys Swan Lake It can sound very tuneful and sad as in the second movement of Rimsky Korsakovs Sheherazade Listen to the opening of Stravinskys Rite of Spring where it plays some quite high notes to fool people that it is the Cor anglais Prokofiev uses the bassoon for grandfathers tune in Peter and the Wolf Also to play the bassoon a player need long fingers because the bassoons keys and holes are quite wide

The holes are drilled in at an angle so that the upper register is not overblown and produces an unpleasant sound Whisper Keys are also invented to prevent overblown The bassoon is known for its reedy sound Its upper register is shrill and sometimes scary Middle register could be used for lullabyes because of its majestic and soothing tone Its lower register is deep dark and could be used for scary movies and such

The bassoon developed from a Renaissance instrument called the curtal or dulcian These were double reed instruments which often played with shawms In the Baroque period the bassoon became popular as an instrument to play the bass line perhaps playing the same as the cello In the late Baroque period composers like Antonio Vivaldi wrote concertos for bassoon and orchestra Some more famous bassoon concertos include one by Mozart and in more recent times by Peter Maxwell Davies

In some pieces with a large orchestra a contrabassoon is used This plays an octave lower than a bassoon taking it right down to bottom B flat on the piano Some contrabassoons are made to play a note lower ie the very lowest note of the piano One might expect to see the contrabassoon sticking up high above all the other instruments in the orchestra but in fact the tube keeps doing U turns making four parallel rows of tubing They are usually made with the bell pointing downwards The weight is supported by a peg to the floor

The contrabassoon adds richness to the sound of a full orchestra Listen carefully for the contrabassoon in the hymn like introduction to the last movement of Symphony no 1 by Brahms It can be clearly heard growling away in the opening of the Piano Concerto for the Left Hand by Ravel

An octave is the distance between two musical notes that have the same letter name

If a musician sings or plays a scale the first and last doh are an octave apart It is called an octave because there are eight notes in a scale

If a musician sings or plays the first two notes of the song Somewhere over the rainbow these two notes are an octave apart

Two notes that are an octave apart sound very similar almost like the same note The scientific reason for this is that the top note vibrates twice as fast For example if someone plays Middle C on a piano a hammer hits the three Middle C strings inside and makes them vibrate 256 times a second The C an octave higher will vibrate 512 times a second 

Young children who learn the piano will not be able to stretch an octave with one hand if their hands are too small Most adults can stretch an octave easily Advanced pianists can practice scales in octaves Violinists can play scales in octaves too playing on two strings at once but this is very hard

A humpback whale is a large baleen whale with large knobby flippers It can be found in every ocean

Humpback whales eat krill and small schooling fish for example herring capelin and sand lance They round up their prey by swimming in tight circles and blowing curtains of bubbles around them They often hunt in small groups called pods

The male whale is known to sing for up to 22 hours at a time Because whales do not have vocal chords they make songs by forcing air through their nasal passages Every male has a different song which he uses to call a female or scare away other males The songs are made up of a pattern of low notes repeated over a period of hours or days The whales slowly change their songs over a period of years 

Both the male and female humpback whales make other sounds such as moans and grunts to communicate with each other

Slovak is written using the Roman alphabet but there are some letters which have special signs

The letters  and d are like the English sounds in chin shin vision and juice

The letters  and are called soft consonants They are pronounced with the blade of the tongue at the roof of the mouth

C dz and j are also soft C is like ts in bats dz is like ds in rods and j is like y in yes

Signs over a vowel show that the vowel is pronounced long    A long vowel is never followed in the next syllable by a short vowel

The is like English wombat and is the same as the letter e

Ch is like ch in Scottish loch V is more like English w

The letters b d dz d g h z are voiceless when they are at the end of a word

The stress is always on the first syllable of the word This is different from Russian for example where the stress can be anywhere

Like other Slavic languages Slovak is difficult for English speakers to pronounce This is particularly because several consonants often come together In the sentence Str prst skrz krk there is not one single vowel

The grammar is similar to Russian but there are some differences Russian does not use words for to have and to be but Slovak does

Notice that we say a suitcase but Slovak does not have articles

There are three genders in Slovak This means that it is important to know for every noun whether it is masculine feminine or neuter There is no article to make it obvious but one needs to know in order to decide what the adjective ending will be

Like in many other European languages verbs have to agree with the person ie there are different forms for I you he etc Verbs have different aspects to show whether the action is complete or not There are also different cases which show the meaning of a word in a sentence Different prepositions need to be followed by different cases This all makes Slovak grammar quite complicated for English speakers

The numbers from 1 to 10 are jeden dva tri tyri p es sedem osem dev desa

Use the familiar form when talking to a child and the polite form when talking to an adult

Medium trucks are heavier than light trucks but lighter than heavy trucks In the United States a truck is a medium truck if it weighs between 6300 kg and 15000 kg Trucks that are used for local delivery and public service are normally around this size

Heavy trucks are the heaviest trucks that are allowed on the road In the UK they are known as lorries Many heavy trucks are semi trailer trucks This means they have a tractor unit which pulls a semi trailer A semi trailer is a kind of trailer which has wheels only in the back and the front rides on the back of the tractor unit The tractor unit has an engine and the semi trailer does not FileConventional 18 wheeler truck diagramPNGframecenterSide and bottom view of an 18 wheel semi trailer truck with an boxed space for carrying cargo The bottom view shows the 18 tires Parts of the truck are like this

The Crown of thorns Starfish is a type of sea star Usually they have orange red to purplish skin with yellow or pink spikes on their skin These bright colors are to warn animals that may want to eat it that it is venomous The Crown of thorns is also the second largest sea star in the world as it has a diameter of up to 3 feetOnly the Giant Sunstar is bigger

It only feeds on coral polyps and usually at night The Crown of thorns climbs over its prey releases digestive enzymes to break down its food and then absorbs the coral polyp which has now turned into a liquid Whats left behind by the sea star is the leftover coral skeleton

The Crown of thorns lives in the warmer areas of the Pacific Ocean Indian Ocean and Red Sea

The Crown of thorns is well known for its destructive habits of eating coral which may lead to the destruction of coral reefs such as the Great Barrier Reef Usually when there are not too many of them these sea stars help maintain the coral reef by preventing the faster growing coral from taking over the coral reef However when there are too many Crown of thorns they can devastate a coral reef

Sea urchins are the Class Echinoidea of the Phylum Echinodermata Like the rest of the Echinoderms they are entirely marine They are usually globe shaped and protected by calcareous plates and spinesp65

Like other echinoderms they have five fold symmetry and move by means of hundreds of tiny transparent adhesive tube feet The symmetry is not obvious in the living animal but is easily visible in the dried test

Sea urchins mostly feed on algae and small animals They have a special chewing apparatus called Aristotles lantern after the Greek philosopher who was fascinated by sea urchins With this apparatus they can scrape organisms stuck to the surface over which the urchin is moving

The spines are long and sharp in some species and protect the urchin from predators The spines inflict a painful wound when they penetrate human skin but are usually not dangerous Echinoids also have pincer like pedicellaria all over their body between the spines The job of these is to deal with anything settling on the testp101 It is not known if the spines are venomous

Typical sea urchins have spines that are convert1to3cm in length convert1to2mm thick and not terribly sharp Diadema antillarum familiar in the Caribbean has thin potentially dangerous spines that can reach convert10to30cm long

Sea urchins feed mainly on algae but can also feed on sea cucumbers and a wide range of invertebrates such as mussels polychaetes sponges brittle stars and crinoids Sea urchins are one of the favourite foods of sea otters and is also wolf eels Left unchecked urchins may devastate their environment creating an urchin barren devoid of macroalgae and associated fauna Sea otters have re entered British Columbia dramatically improving coastal ecosystem health by eating sea urchins

The first echinoid fossils are from the Lower Ordovician period The earliest forms had flexible tests with plates that could slide over each other Echinoids were a relatively unimportant part of the biota in the Palaeozoic Only one group survived the PTr extinction event to form the basis of all later echinoids The group which survived into the Triassic the Cidaroids radiated into all other modern groups which are known as the Euechinoids 

The break with perfect symmetry which happened in the Jurassic gave them definite front and back ends This opened up new habitats in particular the burrowing habitat Sand dollars and heart urchins have been highly successful The living echinoids are now important members of the biota especially in shallow and in shore waters

Some humans eat the reproductive organs of sea urchins This is popular in Korea In Japan this kind of sushi is called uni

Usually they have 5 arms which can grow long up to 60cm in the largest species The central disk of brittle stars can be three to eight inches in diameter Unlike starfish they live deeper in the ocean There seem to be brittle stars even at depths below 6000m what scientists call abysmal depth Generally brittle stars live below 500m of depth 

There are two related groups of Ophiuroids the Ophiurida and the basket stars Basket stars usually live in the deeper parts of the range Brittle stars are mostly scavengers and detrivores able to catch some small prey on occasion

Many brittle stars are more fragile than starfish which is how they got their name When they are picked up their arms may fall off This might make the animal seem brittle but they often do this as a defense to escape from predators 

Brittle stars do not use their tube feet for movement but instead use muscles in their long thin arms to go around rocks Ophiurids move quickly when disturbed and are faster movers than starfish In living ophiuroids the plates are linked by longitudinal muscles Ophiurid arms only move horizontally The way their plates interlock prevents the arms from moving in any other planep64 In contrast basket star arms can move vertically These movement patterns are distinct and separate the groups

Ophiuroids in general are mostly scavengers or detritivores Small organic particles are moved into the mouth by the tube feet Ophiuroids may also prey on small crustaceans or worms Brittle stars will eat small suspended organisms if available In large crowded areas brittle stars eat suspended matter from prevailing seafloor currents

Basket stars are large brittle stars with many rays Their arms branch and can be moved in any direction This distinguishes them from the Ophiurids Basket stars may be capable of suspension feeding using the mucus coating on their arms to trap plankton and bacteria They extend one arm out and use the other four as anchors The arms form so many branches that they are almost feathery on the ends They get their name because when they stretch their rays out to catch plankton they look like the bottom of a basket

Basket stars can be large and heavy the biggest Ophiuroids The largest Gorgonocephalus stimpsoni weigh up to 5kg and has arms 70cms long with a disk diameter of 14cm

The bivalves are a large class of molluscs also known as pelecypods 

They have a hard calcareous shell made of two parts or valves The soft parts are inside the shell The shell is usually bilaterally symmetrical

There are over 30000 species of bivalves including the fossil species There are about 9200 living species in 1260 genera and 106 families All of them live in the water most of them in the sea or in brackish water Some live in fresh water All are filter feeders they lost their radula in the course of evolution 

The best known examples of bivalves are clams mussels scallops and oysters

Bivalves have two shells or valves connected by a hinge They are made of a calcareous mineral calcite or aragonite The valves are covered by a periostracum which is an organic horny substance This forms the familiar coloured layer on the shell

The shells are usually held shut by strong adductor muscles Scallops can use their muscles to flap the valves and swim

A bivalve takes in water that has plankton and other things floating in it 

Some molluscs have a part of their mantle known as the siphon Siphons if they exist come in pairs one to suck in one to expel

Anything that is small enough to fit inside the hole of its incurrent siphon enters the bivalve When the floating material comes in it gets stuck in slimy mucus that is on the surface of the bivalves gills The food is moved down to the mouth which is on the other side of the siphon Food is digested in the bivalves stomach and intestine and everything that is not digested goes out through the other siphon with water 

The siphons are an adaptation of burrowing molluscs Those that live above the substrate such as scallops and oysters do not need them

There are four feeding types defined by their gill structure 

As a group the bivalves are adapted to penetrate into and to move along horizontally along soft ground such as mud and sand Common examples of this are razor shells which can dig themselves into the sand with great speed to escape enemies and cockles 

Scallops and file clams can swim to escape a predator clapping their valves together to create a jet of water Cockles can use their foot to leap from danger However these methods quickly exhaust the animal In the razor shells the siphons can break off only to grow back later

The file shells can produce a noxious secretion when threatened and the fan shells of the same family have a unique acid producing organ

Bivalves are superficially similar to brachiopods but the construction of the shell is completely different in the two groups In brachiopods the two valves are on the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the body while in bivalves they are on the left and right sides

Bivalves appeared late in the Cambrian explosion and came to increase in the Palaeozoic and dominate over brachiopods during the Mesozoic So it was thought that bivalves are better adapted to aquatic life than the brachiopods and this caused brachiopods to be out competed and relegated to minor niches 

However after the Permian Triassic extinction event bivalves had a huge adaptive radiation while brachiopods were devastated losing 95 of their diversity

The upshot was that bivalves took over the desirable inshore habitats Brachiopods now live in deeper waters where food is scarcer

The salivary glands make saliva Saliva keeps the mouth and other parts of the digestive system wet It also helps break down carbohydrates and keeps food wet and slippery so it can go down from the oro pharynx to the esophagus to the stomach

There are three main pairs of salivary glands They are

There are also many small glands in the tongue cheeks lips and palate All of those glands make mucous 

There are two types of epithelial cells in salivary glands They make either mucous or serous secretions The parotid gland makes serous secretions The submandibular and submaxillary glands have both types of cells They make a mixture of mucous and serous

The three types of salivary glands are serous mixed and mucous glands

The glands are inside a bag called a capsule of connective tissue Inside it is made of little parts called lobules Blood vessels and nerves go into the glands at the hilum and go out into the lobules There are 3 main types of cells in the major salivary glands

The small tubes go into ducts Those ducts go into larger ducts that have little stripes on them called striations Those go into ducts between the lobes of the gland The main duct of the salivary glands then goes into the mouth

There are three salivary glands

Salivary duct calculus may block the ducts This would cause pain and swelling of the gland

Tumors of the salivary glands can occur These are usually benign but can be malignant The most common type of benign tumor is Pleomorphic adenoma followed by Warthins tumor The most common malignant tumor is Mucoepidermoid carcinoma

A sialogram is a radiocontrast study of a salivary duct

The vas deferens is also called the ductus deferens It is a duct that is part of a mans body It is also part of the body for many male animals There are two of these ducts They are muscular tubes They connect the left and right epididymis to the ejaculatory ducts in order to move sperm Each tube is about 30 centimeters long

During ejaculation the smooth muscle in the wall of the vas deferens contracts That pushes the sperm toward the penis The sperm go from the vas deferens into the urethra Other male sex glands push out at the same time 

There is a surgery called vasectomy that is a method of contraception The two vasa deferentia are cut and sealed so the sperm cannot get out of the body This is usually permanent but in sometimes it can be reversed Sometimes instead of cutting the vas deferentia the surgeon puts something to block the sperm instead of cutting them

Glue is a sticky material that can stick two or more things together Glue can be made from plant or animal parts or it can be made from oil based chemicals 

The first glues may have been natural liquids that come out of trees when they are cut Later people learned to make glue by boiling animal feet cartilage or bones Some very strong glues were first made from fish bones rubber or milk

A simple glue can be made at home by mixing wheat flour and water This glue will stick pieces of paper together Many kinds of art can be made using glue A collage is a work of art made by using glue to stick coloured things onto paper 

Some glues can be used to keep water out of boats buildings or vehicles In this case the glue may be called caulk Some man made materials including wood like materials are made using glues to bind together small pieces of material or powders 

While many glues are safe certain kinds of glue contain strong smelling chemicals Some people sniff these glues to get high Sometimes people breathe in the vapours by mistake This is a very bad idea because these chemicals are often poisons and may cause brain damage or illness

Glue can also be made from rice or rice flour

A digon is a shape that has two sides and two corners It is impossible to make on a flat surface called a plane because the sides would be the same but possible to make on a sphere It can be made by picking two places on a great circle and connecting them If the places are opposite each other the digon is called a regular digon

A great circle the largest possible circle that can be drawn on a sphere one that divides the surface into equal halves called hemispheres It is a circle that has the same diameter as the sphere it was drawn on These curves are geodesics in the sphere and all have the same circumference that is the length of the circle 

There are an infinite number of great circles that can be drawn on any perfect sphere The latitude lines on a globe all form great circles that pass through the same two points The Equator is another great circle

Great Circles can be used to determine the shortest surface distance between two points on a sphere 

A straight line from plane Euclidean geometry corresponds to a Great Circle in non Euclidean spherical geometry

Urine is liquid created by the body in the kidneys It is stored in the bladder and comes out of the human body through the urethra a tube which leads from the bladder to the urethral meatus located at the tip of the penis or the vulva Urinating is how the body gets rid of unwanted or unneeded substances in the blood Urine is the liquid that these substances are put in After the blood has circulated through the body its composition has changed because some substances in the blood have been absorbed by the body and because the body has released other substances into the blood The blood has also absorbed substances produced from our food The liver removes many toxins and adds other substances that the blood needs Then the kidneys remove excess amounts of urea salts etc by putting them into the urine After the blood has passed through the liver and the kidneys it has the correct composition that the body needs

Urine is mostly water and contains mineral salts and about 2 urea which is produced in the liver to remove ammonia which is a very toxic substance Urea has a very low toxicity although a continuous high level of urea in the blood can cause disease

The color of urine normally ranges from colourless to yellow The yellow color is caused by urobilins which are produced by the breakdown of hemoglobin the substance that gives blood its red color If a person is dehydrated less urine will be produced and it will be more concentrated If a person drinks a lot of water more urine will be produced and it will be less concentrated

Urine lets the body get rid of

Urine leaves the kidneys and is stored in the bladder Urine leaves the body through the urethra 

Some slang terms for urine are pee and piss

Rudolf Rudi Vrba was a Professor in the Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics at the University of British Columbia in Canada His birth name was Walter Rosenberg In April 1944 he escaped from the Auschwitz concentration camp After escaping he passed information to the Allies who were fighting the Axis Powers during the Second World War He informed the authorities about the mass murder that was taking place at the camp 

Auschwitz concentration camp was the largest concentration camp of Nazi Germany It was in Poland Its name comes from the name of the town where it stood Owicim Auschwitz is the name of Owicim in the German language

People also call these death camps by other names including Auschwitz Konzentrationslager Auschwitz Birkenau KL Auschwitz and the Former Nazi German Concentration Camp of Auschwitz 

Beginning in 1940 Nazi Germany built many concentration camps there In these death camps Nazi Germany killed about 30 35 million people 90 of them were Jewish people

Schutzstaffel under the direct control of Heinrich Himmler operated these death camps SS also operated many such camps in Nazi Germany Until the summer of 1943 the commander of Auschwitz was Rudolf Hoess After him Arthur Liebehenschel and Richard Baer became commander of the camp After the Second World War Hoess wrote his autobiography had given many details about these camps After the Second World War he received the death penalty and the authorities hanged him in front of the crematorium of Auschwitz I Johanna Langefeld Maria Mandel and Elisabeth Volkenrath managed the women prisoners of Auschwitz 

About 700 prisoners tried to escape from different Auschwitz camps Only 300 succeeded Guards caught the families of the prisoners who escaped or tried to escape They kept them as prisoners They showed the family members to other prisoners to prevent any escape attempts

Auschwitz was a big complex of many concentration camps There were three main camps

There were many other sub camps around these three main camps

Auschwitz I served as the office for all camps at the place The Nazi Germany had established this on 20th May 1940 Beginning on 14 June 1940 the Nazi Germany started keeping prisoners there The first batches were of 728 prisoners from Poland and then 48 homosexual persons from Germany Then Jews arrived as prisoners At any time there were between 13000 and 16000 prisoners In 1942 the number increased to 20000 However contrary to as shown in many films most of the Jew prisoners were in Auschwitz II Still no one knows exactly how many people were sent to camps 

The SS selected some prisoners generally of German nationality to work as guards They called these guards kapos The prisoners clothes carried different marks to distinguish different types of prisoners Generally the Jews got the worst treatment 

On Sundays the prisoners did not have to do work On this day they did cleaning and washing The living conditions were very bad and food supplies were worse Many prisoners died regularly due to the bad conditions 

The SS built many types of rooms to give different types of punishments to prisoners They constructed rooms of 15 metres square They kept four people in such a room standing all night and forced them to work during the day In some other rooms the SS officers kept people and did not give them any water or food These people were left to die of hunger In some rooms there would be only a small window They kept people there and they died as the rooms air became without oxygen They also hanged people in a way that their shoulder joints got broken They remained hanging for hours and days suffered much pain and finally died The camp also had a place to kill people by firing gunshots at them They also hanged some persons and they died a slow and painful death 

On 3rd September 1941 the SS did the first testing of poison gas on prisoners at this camp They used Hydrogen cyanide or Zyklon B In this test they killed 600 Prisoners of Wars of the Soviet Union and about 250 Poles When the SS found that the test was a success they constructed a gas chamber and a crematorium in block 11 of the camp They used this from 1941 to 1942 and killed about 60000 people by sending them to the gas chamber After this they made this as an air raid shelter for the use of SS The gas chamber still exists after reconstruction using the original parts Now it is a part of the museum 

On 26th March 1942 the first women prisoner arrived at Auschwitz A gynecologist Dr C Allan did many types of experiments on Jewish women during the period from April 1943 to May 1944 She was trying to develop a simple injection to make these women sterilized Another doctor named Joseph Mengele did experiments on twins and dwarfs He did things like castration without using any anesthetics All these experiments were very crude and painful Many women and men died during these experiments The doctors killed many patients of the camps hospital by giving them injection of phenol if the patients did not recover quickly

At the order of Heinrich Himmlers order SS even established a brothel in Auschwitz in summer of 1943 The women working in the brothel were non Jewish prisoners The brothel was established to reward prisoners of high value to the Nazis

Auschwitz II was another part of the complex Many people know this simply by the name of Auschwitz Here Nazi Germany killed over one million people mostly Jews poles and gypsies 

The Nazis began concentrating Birkenau in October 1941 Holocaust Survivors Network had posted a photograph of this place Auschwitz II had four gas chambers These gas chambers looked like showers Auschwitz II also had four crematoria In the gas chambers people were killed by using gas and in the crematorium they burnt the bodies of the dead persons 

Everyday Nazi authorities brought many prisoners by rail to Auschwitz The Nazis separated these prisoners into three groups Within hours they sent about 66 of prisoners to gas chambers where they died This 66 generally included all children all women all elderly persons and others whom SS officers thought not fully fit to do work Everyday SS killed in gas chambers about 20000 persons They used a cyanide gas to kill these persons The SS selected some fit persons for working as slave labor at companies like I G Farben and Krupp Records indicate that between 1940 and 1945 about 405000 persons worked as slave labors Out of them about 340000 died during this period Oskar Schindler a German industrialist saved about 1000 Jews from Poland He sent them away at his factory and these Jews lived SS officials made a third group mostly of twins and dwarfs Nazi doctors like Josef Mengele did experiments on these persons 

The SS used some prisoners for different works in the camp like kapos and sonderkommandos The kapos maintained discipline Sonderkommandos took the dead bodies from the gas chambers to the crematorium for burning the bodies Before burning they even took out gold from the filling in dead persons teeth if any From time to time SS also killed some of the kapos and sonderkommandos Altogether about 6000 SS members worked at Auschwitz

By 1943 many resistance groups had come up inside the camps of Auschwitz These groups helped some prisoners to escape from Auschwitz These persons brought the information to the world about the killings taking place inside the Auschwitz If one prisoner escaped the SS killed many other prisoners and sometimes arrested the family members of the escaped prisoners and paraded them in the camps This was to stop other prisoners from attempting any escape 

On 27th January 1945 the Red Army of the Soviet Union reached the camp complex All the SS guards and officers had fled They had forced march more than 58000 prisoners on a death march to Germany The Red Army found about 7600 persons in the camp 

In 1947 Poland founded a museum at the site of the Auschwitz camps By 1994 about 22 million visitors came to the museum

In Auschwitz III and many other sub camps the SS kept the prisoners who worked as slave workers for factories of I G Farben Doctors from Auschwitz II came to visit these camps from time to time If they found unfit and weak persons these persons had to go to Auschwitz II There the SS guards killed them in the gas chambers

The Allies received some information about Auschwitz camps during 1941 1944 However the authorities did not believe the figures of killings Two people namely Rudolf Vrba and Alfred Wetzler escaped from these camps They presented their reports and Allied leaders learned the truth about Auschwitz in the middle of 1944

During 1944 airplanes of the Allies had taken some photographs of the area which included Auschwitz camps However no one analyzed these photographs Only in 1970s the authorities looked at these photographs carefully At one time the allied had planned bombing the camps But they dropped the idea as this might have endangered the lives of the prisoners In fact some planes dropped bombs at nearby military targets One bomb fell on the camp and killed some prisoners The debate still continues about the steps which could have been taken to save the killings of the prisoners by the SS

By late 1944 the Red Army had come closer to the place The SS personnel managing the camps blew up the gas chambers of Birkenau to hide their crimes of killing On 17th January 1945 Nazi personnel started to vacate the camps They forced the prisoners held there to march towards west They left behind only those who could not march On 27th January 1945 the troops of the 322nd Infantry of the Red Army reached the place They found and freed about 7500 prisoners

Little is known about the number of people who died at Auschwitz and other camps It is thought to be a large number The Nazis destroyed most of the records Studies to arrive at the figures depend on the witnesses and persons of Nuremberg Trials In some case survivors accounts helped to fix some rough figures 

The communist governments of the Soviet Union and the Poland had reported the number at 4 million Witnesses and the persons facing trials at Nuremberg Trials gave lower figures Nazi Rudolf Hoess said that between 25 and 3 million had been killed while Adolf Eichmann gave a figure of 2 million In 1983 French scholar George Wellers was one of the first to use Nazi data on deportations to estimate the number killed at Auschwitz He calculated a figure of 1613 million dead including 142 million Jews and 146000 Poles Around the same time Franciszek Piper used timetables of train arrivals and other records of sending out of people by the Nazis He calculated 11 million Jewish deaths and 140000 150000 Polish victims along with 23000 Roma Many scholars think this figure might be the right order of magnitude

After few years of the Second World War the government of Poland decided to restore Auschwitz I They repaired some of the camps Sometimes they did very minor changes from the original set up but this they indicated by placing suitable notices Auschwitz II and the remains of the gas chambers are also part of the museum The museum had many sections One section has very large number of shoes of men women and children Another section has suitcases which the victims had brought In fact victims brought many things including household utensils thinking that Nazis were taking them to another place for re settlement One display case about 30 metres long displays human hair of the victims Before killing the persons the SS removed their hair They opened the museum in 1947 for the public The museum was to honor the victims of the Nazism The people later on scattered the ashes of the victims between the huts They see the entire area as a gravesite 

The UNESCO had declared the site as a World Heritage Site

In 1979 Polish Pope John Paul II celebrated Mass on the grounds of Auschwitz II After the pope had announced beatification of Edith Stein Catholics erected a cross near bunker 2 of Auschwitz II where SS had gassed Edith Stein After some time a Star of David appeared at the site Many religious symbols appeared Finally people removed all of them 

In 1984 Carmelites opened a convent near Auschwitz I When Jewish groups protested they removed the convent in 1987 In 1988 Carmelites erected one 8 metre tall cross outside the block 11 When the Jewish group protested saying that most of the killed were Jewish people 300 smaller crosses appeared by 1998 Finally people removed the smaller crosses but the larger one continues to stand 

On 27th January 1945 the Red Army of the Soviet Union had freed the Auschwitz camps In 1996 Germany honors the victims of Nazism on 27th January In 2005 the European Parliament marked the anniversary of the camps liberation in 2005 with a minute of silence The European Parliament also passed a resolution condemning the murder of about 15 million people at Auschwitz camps The resolution also told about the disturbing rise in anti semitism and especially anti semitic incidents in Europe and for learning anew the wider lessons about the dangers of victimizing people on the basis of race ethnic origin religion social classification politics or sexual orientation

The communist governments of the Soviet Union and Poland had noted on a memorial plate out of the Auschwitz camps The plated showed number of killed as 4 million After the fall of the communist government in Poland in 1989 the plate showed a different figure 11 million People who try to deny about the Holocaust had used this variance in the figures to claim that Holocaust was something like a propaganda However the fact remains that more than SS killed at least 11 million persons in Auschwitz camps and Holocaust is a fact of history 

Recently the Polish media and the government had raised objections on the use of the name like Polish death camps to describe the Auschwitz camps Use of such a name was misleading and gave an impression of involvement of Poland On April 1 2006 a Polish Culture Ministry spokesman said that the government requested that UNESCO change the name from Auschwitz Concentration Camp to Former Nazi German Concentration Camp Auschwitz Birkenau This was necessary to avoid misleading the public and to show that Nazis of Germany ran the camps and not the authorities of Poland 

The Polish government had allowed filming at the sites for two films and a TV series However in some cases they had disallowed filming inside the camps In February 2006 Poland refused visas to some researchers from Iran to visit Auschwitz They took this step as the President of Iran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has dismissed the Holocaust as false

They are a short and muscular animal that walks on four strong legs The feet and claws are designed to help the wombat dig tunnels in rocky ground They are between 70 120 cm in length and weigh between 15 35 kg It is covered in a very rough and coarse fur which can be anywhere from black to silver grey from dark brown to sandy brown Wombats have very tough skin on their rump 

Wombats live alone but meet up to breed in April to June on mainland Australia In Tasmania the breeding can occur at any time of the year The young wombats are tiny about two cm long when they are born after a gestation of only 21 days and move into the mothers pouch Wombats normally only have one baby although the pouch has two nipples Unlike a kangaroo the pouch opens backwards which would prevent it from filling with dirt as it crawls into its burrow The young wombat lives in the pouch for about six months and finally becomes independent of the mother at about 18 months of age Wombats live for about five years although some in captivity have lived for 26 years

Wombats live in burrows that they dig with their sharp claws They are nocturnal animals and come out their burrows in the evening to look for food It is a herbivore so it only eats grass tree and shrub roots bark leaves and fungi Wombat faeces are cube shaped The wombat will use them to mark things in its territory so it is common to find the cubes on top of leaves rocks and branches Because of their shape they do not roll off

The burrows can be as small as two metres or as long as 30 metres They dig with their front feet kick the soil backwards with their back feet and then use their rump like a bulldozer to push the dirt out of the burrow Only one wombat lives in each burrow but wombats may have up to four burrows in the area they live

Farmers see the Common Wombat as a pest It often destroys fences by burrowing and the burrow openings are a danger to grazing animals It is still common in Australia but there areas it lives in a being reduced because of land clearing for farms

The common wombat has no natural predators It is not scared of people and is often seen in camping areas They can make good pets

Tagore wrote many stories during the period from 1891 to 1895 Galpaguchchha is a three volume collection of eighty four of his stories Tagore wrote about half of these stories during the period 1891 to 1895 This collection continues to be very popular work of Bangla literature These stories have given ideas to produce many movies and theatrical plays

Tagore drew inspiration and ideas for writing his stories from his surroundings from the village life of India He saw the poor people very closely during travels to manage his familys large landholdings Sometimes he used different themes to taste his depth of his intellect

Tagores poetry is very varied and covers many styles He drew inspiration from 15th  and 16th century poets as also from ancient writers like Vyasa Bengals Baul folk singers also influenced his style of poetry He wrote many poems when he was at Shelidah managing his familys estates Many of his poems have a lyrical quality These poems tell about the man within the heart and the living God within Over next seventy years he repeatedly revised his style of writing poetry In 1930s he wrote many experimental works of poetry and also used modernism and realism in his works

One of his poems have words like all I had achieved was carried off on the golden boat only I was left behind However Tagore is known around the world for his Gitanjali his best known collection winning him his Nobel Prize A free verse translation by Tagore of a verse of Gitanjali reads as follows

Tagores political views were complex He criticized European colonialism and supported Indian nationalists But he also criticized the Swadeshi movement of many nationalist leaders of India Instead he emphasized self help and intellectual uplift of the masses He requested Indians to accept that there can be no question of blind revolution but of steady and purposeful education Many people did not like his thinking In late 1916 some Indians wanted to kill him when he was staying in a hotel in San Francisco USA They did not kill him as they started arguing with Tagore and then dropped the idea to kill him Tagore also wrote many songs praising the Indian independence movement He also returned the British honor of Knighthood as a protest against the 1919 Amritsar massacre In Amritsar troops of the British Raj had opened fire on unarmed civilians killing many persons Despite his not very cordial relations with Gandhi Tagore played a key role in resolving a Gandhi B R Ambedkar dispute involving separate electorates for untouchables Untouchables were people considered lowest in the social order

Tagore was also critical of traditional style of education While on a visit to Santa Barbara California on 11 October 1917 he visualized a new type of education He thought of a new type of university which he desired to be set up at Santiniketan On 22nd December 1918 work for building the new university began It started functioning from 22nd December 1921 He named the university Visva Bharati University Tagore worked hard to raise funds for the university and toured many parts of Europe and USA for this purpose He gave all his Nobel Prize monies to this university The university gave personal guidance to all students Students lived in close proximity to nature and teacher student relationship followed pattern of gurukul system of ancient India In his own words he wanted this university to become a world center for the study of humanity somewhere beyond the limits of nation and geography

He also had a dream for the future India He wanted Indias freedom from the British rule He dreamt of an India Where the mind is without fear

Even after many decades of his death Tagores legacy continues in many ways People hold many festivals in his honor in many parts of the world Examples include

Nobel laureate Amartya Sen who is also a Bengali once noted that even for modern Bengalis Tagore was a towering figure being a deeply relevant and many sided contemporary thinker

Tagores collected 1939 Bangla language writings are one of Bengals greatest cultural treasures while Tagore himself has been proclaimed the greatest poet India has produced

He was also famed throughout much of Europe North America and East Asia Translations of his works are available in many languages of the world including Russian English Dutch German Spanish and many others In the United States Tagore gave many lectures during 1916 and 1917 Many people attended those lectures

Between 1914 and 1922 the Jimnez Camprub spouses translated at least twenty two of Tagores books from English into Spanish These Spanish translations influenced many leading figures of Spanish literature Some of them are Chile Pablo Neruda and Gabriela Mistral of Chile Mexico Octavio Paz of Mexico and Jos Ortega y Gasset Zenobia Camprub and Juan Ramn Jimnez of Spain

Various composers including classical composer Arthur Shepherds have set Tagores poetry to music

The Tamil people number around 74 million in the world Of that there are about 63000000 in India about 3600000 live in Sri Lanka about 1500000 live in Malaysia and about 250000 live in Singapore The remaining Tamil people live in many other places Other peoples are related to the Tamil people by language culture and ancestry Some of them are Brahui people Kannadigas Malayalis Telugu people Tuluvas and Gonds 

Tamil people identify themselves with their language Tamil In recent times they have broadened the definition of Tamil people They now also include descendants of Tamil speaking people even when they no longer speak Tamil language 

The history of Tamil people has three broad time periods as described below

No one is sure about the exact origins of the Tamil people Some historians believe that they migrated to India around 6000 BC Some connect them with the Elamite people of ancient Iran Some historians believe that people of the Indus Valley Civilization were either Tamil or a similar Dravidian race However nothing is sure about the origins of the Tamil people

In Tamilnadu the earliest presence of Tamil people dates back to around 1000 BC on wards Archeologists have found many burial places of megalithic era The style of burials is same as described in classical Tamil literature Recent excavations at these sites have also provided samples of early Tamil writing dating back to at least 500 BC 

About 2300 years before at around 3rd century BC onwards three royal families emerged in the lands of the Tamil people the dynasties of the Cholas the Cheras and the Pandyas Each one of them controlled a separate part of the Tamil speaking nation The classical Tamil literature and many inscriptions discovered also describe many smaller local rulers of that period These kings and rulers frequently fought among themselves and also with rulers of Sri Lanka However they had one common thing they all supported arts and literature The classical Tamil literature of that period record many practices peculiar to Tamil people These practices still continue

At that time agriculture and trading were two main economic activities of Tamil people They even traded with many other countries including places in Europe In Karur archeologists found a large number of coins of Ancient Rome The Pandyas sent at least two ambassadors to the Roman Emperor Augustus Archeologists have also found Tamil writings in broken pieces of pottery in the Red Sea 

An unnamed traveler from ancient Greece had described in Greek language ports of the Pandya and Chera kings He had detailed the items exported by the Tamil people These items included black pepper pearls ivory silk diamonds sapphires and tortoiseshell 

The classical period ended at around 4th century People from northern parts of India invaded the lands of the Tamil people For Tamil people this was a dark period of their history This dark phase ended with the rise of the Pallava dynasty

Historical records tell about Pallavas from the 3rd century But only after 300 years during the 6th century they became powerful Pallava dynasty did not have Tamil origin but they adopted the language and the Tamil ways They modeled their kingdom on the lines of empires of north India like the Mauryan Empire and Gupta Empire The Pallavas also encouraged the worship of Shiva and Vishnu and built large temples During their reign caste system became rigid 

In the 9th century the Cholas and the Pandyas defeated Pallavas By the 10th century the Cholas had established a big empire covering most of south India and Sri Lanka They had a strong navy Their navy reached Thailand Burma and Sumatra They also had a strong trading links with China By the 12th 13th centuries the power of the Cholas had declined For some time Pandyas became powerful However by that time Muslim rulers invaded Tamil lands The Pandya dynasty came to an end by the 16th century 

Over a period of time western parts of Tamil lands were developing in a separate manner By the 13th century the Cholas and the Pandyas had lost control over these areas The people living there developed their own language and culture By the 15th century they had a separate language Malayalam language now the language of the Indian state of Kerala

After 16th century no major rulers emerged to rule Tamil lands But there were many smaller local rulers For some time rulers from the present day Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh also ruled over the Tamil lands By the 17th century Europeans from the United Kingdom France and Denmark started to establish their settlements in Tamil lands They fought many battles Finally the British won and by the end of the 18th century most of the Tamil lands came under the British rule 

Historians of Sri Lanka say that Tamil people reached Sri Lanka only after 7th century during the invasions of the Chola dynasty The Tamil people ruled parts of Sri Lanka from time to time and played important role in the ruling of Sri Lanka In the 10th century the Chola kings made Sri Lanka a part of their kingdom This continued until late 11th century 

After decline of the Chola power in Sri Lanka different rulers ruled Sri Lanka the Arya Chakaravarthi dynasty from 1215 The Arya Chakaravarthi dynasty ruled over large parts of northeast Sri Lanka until 1619 By this time the Portuguese and the Dutch won many areas of Sri Lanka However in 1796 the British won entire Sri Lanka Sri Lanka became part of the British Empire

During the British Raj the British combined all Tamil lands and gave them a new name the Madras Presidency The Madras Presidency became a part of the British Raj Similarly the British combined Tamil lands of Sri Lanka and other regions of Sri Lanka in 1802 This became the Ceylon colony also a part of the British Empire When India became independent in 1947 Madras Presidency became a part of India Ceylon became independent in 1948 and the Tamil lands remained a part of independent Ceylon now called Sri Lanka 

After Indias independence in 1947 Madras Presidency became Madras State It covered the areas of present day Tamilnadu coastal parts of Indian states of Andhra Pradesh northern Kerala and the southwest of Karnataka The Government of India rearranged the boundaries of many states of India based on language Thus the present day state of Tamilnadu came into existence 

At the beginning there was a demand for an independent country for the Tamil people However the constitution of India gave major rights to the states and protected the speakers of regional languages from compulsory speaking and use of Hindi This satisfied most of the Tamil people and presently there is no demand for a separate country for Tamil people outside the federal system of India 

However in Sri Lanka the government did not give sufficient rights to people who spoke Tamil language During 1970s this led to a demand for independence of Tamil people from Sri Lanka In early 1980s the situation became very bad A civil war broke out Currently peace negotiations are under way

Tamil people live in many geographical regions Sections below describe them 

Most of the Tamil people of India live in the Indian state of Tamilnadu Most of the people living in Pondicherry of India are also Tamil people 

Tamil people have been traditionally living in some other parts of India  for examples Hebbar and Mandyam Tamils of southern Karnataka the Tamils of Palakkad in Kerala and the Tamils of Pune Maharashtra For last one hundred years or so Tamil people went to many other parts of India for jobs or business Some of them settled in these places 

Presently there are two groups of Tamils in Sri Lanka The first group is Sri Lankan Tamils They are descendants of the Tamil people who lived in the old Jaffna kingdom or who migrated to the East coast The second group is Hill Country Tamils They descended from the Tamil people who went to Sri Lanka from India as laborers in the 19th century early 20th century The first group mostly lives in the northern and eastern parts of Sri Lanka The second group mostly live in the central highlands 

In 1949 some political developments in Sri Lanka were adverse for Tamil people of Sri Lanka Many Tamils people lost their citizenship of being citizens of Sri Lanka Under an agreement between the governments of India and Sri Lanka about 40 of these Tamils could get back their citizenship Many others had to shift to India These developments brought the two groups of the Tamil people of Sri Lanka closer By 1990s most of the Tamil people had got back their citizenship 

Beginning from the 18th century many poor Tamil people went as laborers to many countries of the British Empire Some of these countries were Malaya South Africa Fiji Mauritius and the Caribbean At the same time many Tamil businessmen also went to places in Burma and East Africa Many Tamils still live in these countries 

Special mention may be made of Singapore The government has made Tamil language as one of the national languages although only 42 of the people speak Tamil language in Singapore 

By 1980s many Tamil people of Sri Lanka were facing ethnic conflicts Many of them fled to Australia Europe North America and Southeast Asia Today the largest concentration of Tamils outside southern Asia is in Toronto Canada

In recent years many young Tamil professionals from India have gone to Europe and the United States 

Tamil people call their language as the Tamil mother They identify themselves based on their language 

Tamil language like other languages of south India is one of the Dravidian languages It is not related to the Indo European languages of the north India Although modern speakers of Tamil language use a number of words of Sanskrit and English Tamil language has maintained its original classical character The Government of India has recently recognized Tamil language as one of the classical languages of India 

Classical Tamil literature is varied For example they cover poetry and lyrics works of ethics and philosophy and many other types of literary works Notable works in classical Tamil literature include the Tirukkural by Tiruvalluvar The Five Great Epics of Tamil Literature and the works of Auvaiyar Over many centuries the written Tamil has changed very little Thus even modern Tamil people are able to read and enjoy these classical literary works 

Modern Tamil literature is also varied It has many aspects for example Indian nationalism historical romanticism and social realism In recent years many works of Tamil language in Sri Lanka describe the tragedy of ethnic conflict and civil war Tamil people living in many other places have also produced literary works

Some of the note worthy poets are Bharathiyar Barathidasen etc of end of 19th century who depicts the originality of Tamil culture and India penned several notarary poems on Tamil and National interest

Tamil visual arts have three main forms architecture sculpture and painting The theme is generally religious showing aspects of Hinduism 

Tanjore painting is the most important form of painting of Tamil people The painting originated in a place named Tanjore This style of painting originated in the 9th century In this style of painting the painter paints on a piece of cloth Sometimes the painter also decorates the painting with threads of gold and silver and precious gems There is one other type of important painting style Painters make paintings on the walls of temples Tamil paintings use rich colors and show minute details 

In their sculpture artists use bronze Several pieces of sculptures are found throughout Tamilnadu particularly in temples Most of them are very old dating from the 7th century onwards The sculptures show very minute details including details of ornaments and dress Many sculptures also show movement with fine details Two important examples of such sculptures are the cave sculptures at Mamallapuram and Nataraja statue at Chidambaram 

There are many temples in the lands of Tamil people The gates of these temples called Gopuram are higher than other parts Earlier Gopurams were simple in construction From 13th century onwards they became bigger and have engravings and paintings The engravings and paintings show scenes and characters from Hindu mythology Temples at Thanjavur Chidambaram and Srirangam are very big and fine examples of temples of Tamil people 

Tamil art is an important tradition of Indian art

The Tamil people have many performing arts The classical Tamil literature has many details of these performing arts 

Classical music of Tamil people is carnatic music The classical Tamil literature records details about the carnatic music This is a vocal music with use of musical instruments Carnatic music is completely religious 

Tamil folk music is very different from the carnatic music The folk music shows a lot of excitement The songs may convey folklore and other popular tales 

Bharatanatyam is the main dance of the Tamil people Generally one dancer performs this dance The dance tells a story through movements of parts of body particularly hands Until 1930s girls known as devadasis performed this dance in temples Now it has become common and there are many famous dancers who perform this dance Tamil people also have many types of folk dances performed in villages Sometimes they perform such a dance before the village goddess called Mariamma 

Tamil people also have a long tradition of theatrical performance In villages performers perform in the open They dance and sing and some times tell stories These stories may be religious stories or on any other topic 

Tamilnadu has a well developed tradition of stage theatre tradition Presently both classical and folk performing arts survive in modern Tamil society 

Tamil people like to watch movies Tamil movies are famous for technical details artistic presentation and entertainment Most of the Tamil movies will have some songs and dances Kollywood is the popular term for the Tamil film industry

Most of the Tamil people are Hindus However many are Muslims and Christians At one time Jainism was one of the major religions of Tamil people However presently there are only few thousand Tamil Jains 

In Tamil Hinduism the most popular deity is god named Murugan He is a form of Karthikeya the son of Shiva The Tamil people also worship mother goddess Amman or Mariamman Many Tamil people also worship Kannagi a folk heroine Through out Tamil lands there are many temples of Shiva Vishnu and Ganesha In rural areas of Tamil Nadu people worship many local gods and goddesses They call them aiyyanar 

There were many saints known as Alvars and Nayanars In the 10th century Ramanuja propagated his philosophy about worship and also accepted lower caste Hindus as his disciples There were many other notable Tamil saints The Ramayana has many parts based in Tamil regions and according to legends many of Ramas soldiers were Tamil people The only temple dedicated to Parashurama is in Tamil Nadu

The most important Tamil festivals are Pongal and the Tamil New Year Pongal is a harvest festival and people celebrate this in mid January Tamil people also celebrate Diwali Two other important Hindu festivals of Tamil people are Thaipusam and Adipperukku

A Tamil legend states that the Cholas Chera and Pandyan kings fought many wars in the 1st century The war lasted for about one hundred years During this period the Tamil people perfected many martial arts All these styles of martial arts still exist They also developed many weapons 

There are many types of martial arts For example in a special type of martial art a person would use a stick of about 16 meters long By moving the stick he would try to defend against attack by several persons In another type of martial art persons get training to defend themselves without using any weapons by using their hands and legs 

Periyar Ramasami a social leader of Tamil people started a movement named Self respect Movement It was to promote self respect and remove social evils like casteism Many people call this movement as the Dravidian movement All political parties of Tamilnadu draw their principles from this movement 

Scholars of India and Sri Lanka have developed a vocabulary in Tamil language for words of science and technology 

In the 1960s the government of Tamil Nadu held a World Tamil Conference The Conference has been meeting regularly 

In 1999 many Tamil people organized a World Tamil Confederation Its purpose is to protect and promote Tamil culture and bring a sense of togetherness amongst Tamils in different countries The Confederation has since adopted a Tamil flag and Tamil song to act as symbols for the Tamil people living in different countries The words on the flag quote the opening line of a poem by the classical poet Kanian Poongundranaar These words mean All lands are our home all people are our kin

In Sri Lanka the Federal Party took the lead in Tamil politics However by 1980s political movements took a back seat in Tamil politics of Sri Lanka Many military groups had started conflicts and a civil war broke out The Tamil Tigers emerged as the most important force amongst these military groups The Tamil Tigers are fighting to establish its own government in areas where Tamil people are in majority Presently they control many areas and are negotiating for peace 

Down syndrome is a genetic disorder It comes from a problem with the genes Humans are diploid organisms This means that for each chromosome there are two copies one from the mother and one from the father During meiosis the number is reduced to one set of chromosomes People with Down syndrome have an extra copy of chromosome 21 or part of it They usually have mild mental retardation  they are usually not as intelligent as those people without it

Children who have this condition take more time to learn new things They also grow differently from other children Babies with Down syndrome can be identified at birth because they look a little different from other babies The condition is named after John Langdon Down the British doctor who first described it in 1866 He called it mongoloid idiocy but that term is no longer used today

Doctors in the UK usually inform others that people with the condition have a mild to medium learning difficulty Some people with the condition have average intelligence but may have other problems with development instead People with Down syndrome often have a different shape of eyes than most people A few people with the condition have severe learning difficulties 

Of every 800 to 1000 babies that are born one is diagnosed with Down syndrome

Numbers are equal Geometrical objects are congruent Two shapes are congruent if one can be moved or rotated so that it fits exactly where the other one is If one of the object has to change its size the two objects are not congruent They are called similar Also every two objects which are congruent are similar at the same time Geometrical objects can be equal too but only if they are in the same place so an object can only be equal to itself

We have quite a few possibilities a few rules to make new shapes congruent to the original one

The relationship that a shape is congruent to another shape has three famous properties

The famous three properties reflexivity symmetry and transitivity together make the notion of equivalence Hence the property congruence is one sort of equivalence relation between shapes of a plane

Plankton are drifting organisms that live in the surface layers of the ocean They are not strong enough to swim against ocean currents The term is in contrast to nekton who can control their movements There are three groups

Plankton are important in the oceans food chain They are the main source of food for almost all fish larvae as they switch from their yolk sacs to catching prey Basking sharks and blue whales feed on them directly other large fish feed on them indirectly by eating fish of smaller size such as herrings

The distribution of plankton is governed more by nutrients than by temperature Large tracts of ocean are blue and sterile The reason is that these areas lack one or more crucial nutrients for the photosynthetic plankton upon whom all the others depend Broadly speaking areas near land masses get nutrients by rivers and wind The key nutrient lacking in the Pacific ocean is iron essential in molecules such as ferredoxins iron sulfur proteins which mediate electron transfer in a range of metabolic reactions

Mirza Ghulam Ahmad a religious figure belonging to India was the founder of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community He claimed to be the Second Coming of Christ the promised Messiah the Mahdi as well as the being the Mujaddid of the 14th Islamic century He remains a highly controversial and reviled figure among most Muslims who consider him to be an apostate Among his followers as well the interpretation of his claims differ

Ghulam was born in Qadian Punjab in India in 1835 the surviving child of twins born to an rich family He is reported to have spent a lot of time in the mosque and with the study of the Quran and his religion Islam This did not lead him to fulfill his fathers wishes of his son becoming a lawyer or civil servant He did attempt to become a lawyer but failed the test In his course of studying religious topics he would often interact with many Muslims non Muslims and with Christian missionaries whom he would engage in debates

When Ghulam was thirty five years old his father died At this time Ghulam claimed that God had begun communicating with him often through direct revelation Initially Ghulams writings from this time were intended to counter what he perceived to be anti Islamic writings originating from various Christian missionary groups He also focused on countering the effects of various groups such as the Brahmo Samaj During this period of his life he was well received by the Islamic clerics of the time

As time progressed his writings began to exhibit his claims of being the mujaddid or reformer of his era These writings were compiled in one of his most well known works Barahin Ahmadiyya a work consisting of 5 volumes while originally planned 50 volumes and collected advance money from people He explained that since there is only a dot difference between 50 5 therefore his promise was fulfilled In later volumes he would essentially claim to be the messiah of Islam This proved and continues to be very controversial as traditional Islamic thought holds that Jesus is the Messiah who himself will return in the flesh at the end of times Ghulam countered this by claiming that Jesus was dead and had in fact escaped crucifixion and died in India According to ghulam the promised Mahdi was a spiritual not military leader as is believed by most Muslims With this proclamation he also began to step away from the traditional idea of militant Jihad and redefined it as a spiritual battle rather than a physical one In addition to these controversial claims he would later claim that Guru Nanak the first Sikh Guru was in fact a Muslim

These writings began to turn the general Muslims ulema against him and he was often branded as a heretic Some accused Ghulam of working for the British who were trying to use him to remove the concept of Jihad from Indian Muslims

Ghulam founded the Ahmadiyya movement 1889 He claimed that the Ahmadiyya Movement stood in the same relation to Islam as Christianity stood to Judaism at the time of Jesus The mission of the movement according to Ghulam was the prorogation of what he considered to be Islam in its pristine form Mirza Ghulams teachings which differed from other Muslims of the time can be summarized as following

Mirza Ghulam is widely acknowledged to have devoted his life to furthering the cause of his movement and countering allegations of heresy against his person till his death at Lahore in 1908

The Ahmadiyya movement was founded in 1889 but the name Ahmadiyya was not adopted until about a decade later In a manifesto dated November 4 1900 the founder explained that the name referred to Ahmad the alternative name of the prophet Mohammed According to him Mohammed which means the praised one refers to the glorious destiny of the prophet who adopted the name from about the time of the Hegira but Ahmad stands for the beauty of his sermons and for the peace that he was destined to establish in the world through his teachings According to Mirza Ghulam Ahmad these names thus refer to two aspects of Islam and in later times it was the latter aspect that commanded greater attention In keeping with this he believed his object was to establish peace in the world through the spiritual teachings of Islam He believed that his message had special relevance for the Western world which according to him had descended into materialism

One of the main source of dispute during his lifetime and continuing since then is Mirza Ghulam Ahmads use of the terms Nabi and Rasool when referring to himself Muslims consider the prophet Muhammad to be the last of the prophets and believe that Mirza Ghulam Ahmads use of these terms is a violation of the concept of finality of prophet hood His followers fall into two camps in this regards the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community who believe in a literal interpretation of Mirza Ghulam Ahmads prophet hood and the Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement who believe in an allegorical interpretation of these two terms This among other reasons caused a split in the movement soon after Ahmads death

Followers of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad have been officially declared as non Muslims by some of the largest Muslim countries and have faced relentless persecution of various types over the years In 1974 the Pakistani parliament amended the Pakistani constitution to declare Ahmadis as non Muslims for purposes of the constitution of the Islamic Republic In 1984 a series of changes in the Pakistan Penal Code sections relating to blasphemy that in essence made it illegal for Ahmadis to preach their religion openly as Islam leading to arrests and prosecutions However no one has been executed yet even though it is allowed under the law

Pharmacology is the study of how medicine and other things have an effect on living organisms and change how they function Pharmacology could also be defined as the study of how medicine actually works 

Pharmacology is not exactly the same as pharmacy and a pharmacologist is not exactly the same as a pharmacist A pharmacologist is a scientist who studies how medicine actually works and usually works in a science lab A pharmacist is a health care provider who usually works at a pharmacy However there is quite a bit of overlap between these two fields A pharmacist could be considered a type of pharmacologist While in school pharmacists do take many classes in pharmacology  

If something can be used as a medicine it is called a pharmaceutical Pharmacology includes how drugs are made how they interact with living organisms what harmful effects they could have how they can be used as medicines and if they can be used to prevent illness A person who works in the study of pharmacology is called a pharmacologist Pharmacologists work in a team with biochemists geneticists microbiologists toxicologists and pharmacists to run clinical tests on how drugs work

The development of drugs is very important to medicine but it also has strong economical and political uses To protect people and prevent abuse some countries try to control the way in which drugs are made sold and administered

To study chemicals a person needs to know a lot about what will be affected if it is ingested As more people know about cell biology and biochemistry the field of pharmacology has changed as well It is now possible to design chemicals that do specific things

A chemical can have different properties Pharmacokinetics describes the what effect the body will have on the chemical and pharmacodynamics describes the chemicals effect on the body

When a pharmacologist is talking about pharmacokinetic properties of a chemical they are interested in four things ADME

Medication is said to have a narrow or wide therapeutic index This describes the ratio of desired effect to toxic effect A medicine with a narrow therapeutic index only does what people want it to do when the amount given is enough to put the organism in danger A medicine with a wide therapeutic index does what people want it to do and does not necessarily put the organism in danger Medication with a narrow margin are more difficult to dose and give to a person and may require therapeutic drug monitoring Most anti cancer drugs have a narrow therapeutic margin toxic side effects are almost always encountered at doses needed to kill tumours

Drugs that are given to people to help cure them of a medical condition or help reduce the symptoms are often licensed They can be divided into three groups over the counter where anybody can buy the drug from a shop prescription only medicine where a doctor has to say that a person is allowed to take a drug and in some countries pharmacy medicines where only a registered pharmacy can sell a drug Most over the counter medication will not hurt a person if they take a bit more than they are meant to Medications are often produced by pharmaceutical companies and are often patented Drugs that are not patented are called generic drugs

Indo European languages are the worlds largest group of languages 

Linguists believe they all came from a single language called Proto Indo European This language was originally spoken somewhere in Eurasia Today they are spoken all over the world

The Indo European languages are a family of several hundred related languages and dialects including most major languages of Europe the Iranian plateau and South Asia 

Historically this language family was also important in Anatolia and Central Asia 

The earliest Indo European writing comes from the Bronze Age in the Anatolian and Mycenaean Greek languages We can place the origin of Indo European languages after the invention of farming because some of the Proto Indo European words are farming words

The languages of the Indo European group have about three billion native speakers It is the biggest language family Of present day languages with the most speakers 12 are Indo European English Spanish Hindi Portuguese Bengali Russian German Marathi French Italian Punjabi and Urdu They account for over 27 billion native speakers

These are the main Indo European language groups

Suggestions of similarities between Indian and European languages began to be made by European visitors to India in the 16th century In 1583 Fr Thomas Stephens SJ an English Jesuit missionary in Goa noticed similarities between Indian languages and Greek and Latin These observations were included in a letter to his brother which was not published until the twentieth century

The first account to mention Sanskrit came from Filippo Sassetti He was a Florentine merchant who was among the first Europeans to study the ancient Indian language Sanskrit Writing in 1585 he noted some word similarities between Sanskrit and Italian However neither Stephens nor Sassettis observations led to further scholarly inquiry

In 1647 Dutch linguist and scholar Marcus Zuerius van Boxhorn noted the similarity among Indo European languages and supposed that they derived from a primitive common language He included in his hypothesis Dutch Greek Latin Persian and German later adding Slavic Celtic and Baltic languages However van Boxhorns suggestions did not become widely known and did not stimulate further research

Gaston Coeurdoux and others had made observations of the same type Coeurdoux made a thorough comparison of Sanskrit Latin and Greek conjugations in the late 1760s to suggest a relationship between them about 20 years before William Jones Similarly Mikhail Lomonosov compared different languages groups of the world including Slavic Baltic Iranian Finnish Chinese Hottentot and others

The hypothesis reappeared in 1786 when Sir William Jones first lectured on the striking similarities between three of the oldest languages known in his time Latin Greek and Sanskrit to which he tentatively added Gothic Celtic and Old Persian though also commiting some inaccuracies and omissions in his classification

It was Thomas Young who first used the term Indo European in 1813 which became the standard scientific term through the work of Franz Bopp Bopps Comparative Grammar appearing between 1833 and 1852 is the starting point of Indo European studies as an academic discipline

Pneumonia is a disease of the lungs and the respiratory system The lung contains many small bulbs or sacs called alveoli These help to take out oxygen from the air In the case of pneumonia these bulbs become inflamed They fill up with a fluid and can no longer absorb as much oxygen as before 

Pneumonia can be caused by bacteria viruses fungi or parasites It can also be caused by chemical or physical damage done to the lungs Other illnesses like alcohol abuse or lung cancer can also result in pneumonia

People with pneumonia usually have difficulty breathing They may also cough or have pains in the chest area The treatment of pneumonia depends on how the illness was caused If it was caused by bacteria antibiotics can be used to treat it

People of all ages can have pneumonia The disease is dangerous Many people die from pneumonia especially old people or people with a weak immune system

A pathogen is an infectious thing such as a virus bacteria fungi or parasite which causes a disease

The body contains many natural orders of defense against some of the common pathogens in the form of the human immune system and by some helpful bacteria present in the human bodys normal flora However if the immune system or good bacteria is damaged in any way pathogenic bacteria that were being held at bay can grow and cause harm to the host Such cases are opportunistic infections

Some pathogens have been responsible for very big numbers of deaths and injuries

The most famous and lethal outbreak was the 1918 flu pandemic which lasted from 1918 to 1919 It is not known exactly how many it killed but estimates range from 20 to 100 million people This pandemic has been described as the greatest medical holocaust in history and may have killed as many people as the Black Death 

The huge death toll was caused by an extremely high infection rate of up to 50 and the extreme severity of the symptoms One observer wrote One of the most striking of the complications was hemorrhage from mucous membranes especially from the nose stomach and intestine Bleeding from the ears and skin also occurred The majority of deaths were from bacterial pneumonia a secondary infection caused by influenza but the virus also killed people directly causing massive bleeding and oedema in the lungs

In plants fungi are the main cause of infectious disease

A pesticide is a chemical that is used to kill or prevent animals which are considered to be unwanted These organisms are called pests Some of these pests that people do not want are insects microbes that destroy plants and other things that affect humans in a bad way and it may kill humans tooMany pesticides are poisonous and are bad for not only the organisms they kill but for humans too A pesticide also affects the environment and the atmosphere 

The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants lists chemicals that are very hard to destroy or very toxic In total twelve chemicals are listed Nine of them can be used as pesticides

There are different types of pesticides for getting rid of different pests

Pesticides are used to kill pests but many are bad for human health They may pollute water and go into rivers lakes and ponds This will cause acid rain and organisms living in the water can get sick and die because the water where they live has more acid

Pesticide broken wikt linkrunoffrunoff is very bad for animals especially amphibians 

In many cases there are alternatives to the use of pesticides These include

Inhalation is what occurs when people or animals breathe Air is moved from the outside through the respiratory system into the lungs The lungs take out some oxygen and put it into the blood The air is then moved out of the lungs again

After the Chinese government suppressed news of the SARS outbreak the disease spread rapidly reaching Hong Kong and Vietnam in late February 2003 and then to other countries via international travellers The last case in this outbreak occurred in June 2003 There were a total of 8437 known cases of the disease with 813 deaths

In May 2005 the disease itself was declared eradicated by the WHO and it became the second disease in mankind to receive this label The New York Times reported that not a single case of severe acute respiratory syndrome has been reported this year or in late 2004 It is the first winter without a case since the initial outbreak in late 2002 Also the epidemic strain of SARS that caused at least 813 deaths worldwide by June of 2003 has not been seen outside a laboratory since then

He had the idea to develop an engine which relied on a high compression of the fuel to ignite it With this he could do without a spark The technique with a spark was developed by Niklaus Otto The engine based on this is called internal combustion engine

In 1892 he got a patent for the engine

He got a lot of money from licensing his invention

Migration is when animals move on an annual cycle For example caribou in the Arctic go south in winter and return in summer when it is warmer Many birds migrate such as geese and storks

Migration is the travelling of long distances in search of a new habitat The trigger for the migration may be local climate local availability of food or the season of the year To be counted as a true migration and not just a local dispersal the movement should be an annual or seasonal event

Many birds migrate south for the winter and young Atlantic salmon leave the river of their birth when they have reached a few inches in size

Many species in the sea have a daily migration Plankton go up for the day where there is light and down at night where they are less easy to find The many species which feed on them follow them up and down

Migration is an evolutionary force This is because it is a major source of natural selection The success or failure of individual animals to make the journey is usually needed for them to reproduce 

Many parts of the world have a strongly seasonal climate In order to survive many species need to breed in one place and later eat in another place The simplest example is the African herbivores who follow the growth of grass in East Africa This region has seasonal rainfall and so it has seasonal growth of grass Their predators follow them

Scent marks are what animals leave when they are marking their territory The leader of the pack rubs hisher scent on hisher pack This helps establish which animal belongs to which pack and also which animal is the leader

Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche was a German author and philosopher He wrote several books that he hoped would change the world Many people have found his books interesting and acknowledged them as great works of literature and philosophy

Nietzsche wrote a lot about how people make decisions about how they live their lives He attacked most of the moral ideas that were popular at the time because he did not believe that there are any real facts about what is right or wrong He thought people should create their own facts about morality

He also often attacked the ideas of the Christian religion He believed that the Christian idea that one should feel pity when one sees weakness was unhelpful According to him weak people rely on other peoples love as a way of protecting themselves Nietzsche believed that people should be stronger than that

He thought that people should be very aware of their body and of the real world in which they actually live He told his readers not to live in a daydream or make decisions based on unrealistic thoughts He believed that ideas of heaven came from an inability to cope with life in the world

Nietzsche considered the world to be one connected thing including mankind and nature He invented the idea of the will to power This idea is that everyone and everything is trying to overcome itself or defeat or take control from itself Therefore if the world is just one thing this is the force that makes the world

Nietzsche thought that human beings would be successful at overcoming themselves and he thought that when they did they would be different and better He named the person who would do this someday a superman He thought that the supermen would be stronger than normal humans and not restricted by other peoples ideas of right and wrong

Adolf Hitler the German Chancellor and leader of the Nazis in World War II read Nietzsches work Some people say that Hitler did not understand Nietzsches ideas but he used them to try to show that his actions were right

Nietzsche wrote in a very fiery and exciting way However what he wrote later in his life became more and more odd When he was forty years old Nietzsche went insane Supposedly one day in the city of Turin Italy he saw a horse being whipped by its owner and ran to save it hugging it around the throat After this Nietzsche never wrote again and could not look after himself This illness may have been caused by the disease syphillis or a brain tumour

His writing and ideas are still popular and of interest to academics and intellectuals

Babylon was a city state of ancient Mesopotamia the remains of which are found in present day Iraq about 85 kilometers south of Baghdad All that remains of the original ancient famed city of Babylon today is a mound of broken mud brick buildings and debris in the fertile Mesopotamian plain between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers 

Babylon was at first a small town which sprung up at the beginning of the 3rd millennium BC The town flourished and attained prominence and political repute Babylon eclipsed Nippur as the holy city of Mesopotamia around the time Hammurabi first unified the Babylonian Empire and became the capital city of the Neo Babylonian Empire from 612 to 539 BC 

The Hanging Gardens of Babylon were one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World and the Walls of Babylon were also famous

During the reign of Sennacherib of Assyria Babylonia was in a constant state of revolt and was suppressed only by the complete destruction of the city of Babylon In 689 BC its walls temples and palaces were razed and the rubble was thrown into the Arakhtu the sea bordering the earlier Babylon on the south This act shocked the religious conscience of Mesopotamia After the murder of Sennacherib by two of his sons his successor Esarhaddon hastened to rebuild the old city He was crowned there and made it his residence for part of the year 

In the later overthrow of the Assyrian Empire the Babylonians saw another example of divine vengeance

Neo Babylonian Chaldean Empire Babylon threw off the Assyrian rule in 612 BC and became the capital of the Neo Babylonian Chaldean Empire

With the recovery of Babylonian independence a new era of building followed and Nebuchadnezzar II made Babylon into one of the wonders of the ancient world Nebuchadnezzar ordered the complete reconstruction of the imperial grounds including rebuilding the Etemenanki ziggurat and the construction of the Ishtar Gate the most spectacular of eight gates that ringed the perimeter of Babylon All that was ever found of the Original Ishtar gate was the foundation and scattered bricks 

Nebuchadnezzar is also credited with the construction of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon said to have been built for his homesick wife Amyitis Whether the gardens did exist is a matter of dispute Historians disagree about the location and some believe it may have been confused with gardens in Nineveh

In 539 BC the Neo Babylonian Empire fell to Cyrus the Great king of Persia in the famous Battle of Opis The walls of Babylon were impenetrable and the only way into the city was through one of its many gates or through the Euphrates which ebbed beneath its thick walls Cyrus devised a plan to use the Euphrates as the mode of entry to the city He ordered large camps of troops at each point and instructed them to wait for the signal Awaiting an evening of a national feast among Babylonians Cyrus troops diverted the Euphrates river upstream causing the Euphrates to drop to about mid thigh level on a man or to dry up altogether The soldiers marched under the walls through thigh level water or as dry as mud 

The Persian Army conquered the outlying areas of the citys interior while most Babylonians at the city center were oblivious to the breach The account was elaborated upon by Herodotus and is also mentioned by passages in the Hebrew Bible Cyrus claimed the city by walking through the gates of Babylon with little or no resistance from the drunken Babylonians

Cyrus later issued a decree permitting captive people including the Jews to return to their own land to allow their temple to be rebuilt back in Jerusalem

Under Cyrus and the subsequent Persian king Darius the Great Babylon became the capital city of the 9th Satrapy as well as a centre of learning and scientific advancement In Achaemenid Persia the ancient Babylonian arts of astronomy and mathematics were revitalised and flourished and Babylonian scholars completed maps of constellations The city was the administrative capital of the Persian Empire the preeminent power of the then known world and it played a vital part in the history of that region for over two centuries Many important archaeological discoveries have been made that can provide a better understanding of that era

The early Persian kings had attempted to maintain the religious ceremonies of Marduk but by the reign of Darius III over taxation and the strains of numerous wars led to a deterioration of Babylons main shrines and canals and the disintegration of the surrounding region Despite three attempts at rebellion in 522 BC 521 BC and 482 BC the land and city of Babylon remained solidly under Persian rule for two centuries until Alexander the Greats entry in 331 BC

Genetic engineering or GE is a branch of biology It focuses on making food animals and plants better adapted to the need of humans It does this by tweaking genes Some people see a problem in this 

Genetic Engineering is when scientists can duplicate and can add on genes to the animals chromosomes to make meat more satisfying but some people see a problem in this Some people find that Genetic engineering is disturbing because some of the animals bodies may have traces of infectious diseases

There is a risk that some genetically modified organisms may be better adapted to some niche in nature and will take away some space of another organism It could also be that some of the genetic modifications leak into unengineered plants Many people do not think so however They feel the risks do not outweigh the benefits of GE

Common genetic modifications are that some plants produce pesticides and fungicides themselves or that they spoil only later on Genetic engineering is also used to clone animals The process of genetic engineering is a common topic of debate among scientists and scholars alike 

We can now produce and use GM and GE seeds Some large countries like India and China have already decided that GM farming is what they need to feed their populations of the future Other countries are still debating the issue

This debate involves scientists farmers politicians companies and UN agencies Even those involved in the production of GM seedlings are not in total agreement

In Hinduism and Hindu mythology Mantra means a group of words There are many such groups of words Some mantras have meanings However there are many mantras which are just syllables with or without any words Such mantras do not carry meanings From the ancient times Hindus as well as in many cases texts of Buddhism and Jainism contain many mantras 

Traditionally people associate the mantras with various powers However it is more a matter of individual faith and experience than a fact of science 

The earliest examples of mantras are many hymns and verses of Vedas People read them aloud They thought that by doing so they would get the blessings of the gods and other beings The system continued in Hindu practices of worship and meditation Even now many Hindus believe in the power of mantras to gain health and wealth Mantras may form part of worship or people may simply recite them loudly or slowly Some time no recitation may take place and the person would just think of the mantra silently for long time

In early processors each instruction was hard wired This has several drawbacks the most obvious is that correcting an error in processor design means that the processor needs to be replaced 

A processor should add two values which are in registers A and B

Items 1 3 as well as 5 6 can be coded as one instruction It is also possible to hard wire the logic needed for this operation This has the benefit of being faster but the drawback that it no longer allows changes that might be needed later on 

The concept of microprogramming was developed by Maurice Wilkes in 1951 using diode matrices for the memory element

Computational complexity theory is a part of computer science It looks at algorithms and tries to say how many steps or how much memory a certain algorithm takes for a computer to do Very often algorithms that use fewer steps use more memory Many interesting algorithms take a number of steps that is dependent on the size of the problem

Complexity theory also looks at how a problem changes if it is done for more elements Mowing the lawn can be thought of as a problem with linear complexity Mowing an area that is double the size of the original takes twice as long 

Suppose you want to know which of your friends know each other You have to ask each friend whether they know each other friend If you have twice as many friends as someone else you have to ask four times as many questions to figure out who everyone knows Problems that take four times as long when the size of the problem doubles are said to have quadratic complexity

This is often the complexity for problems that involve looking things up like finding a word in a dictionary If the dictionary is twice as big it contains twice as many words as the original to compare to Looking something up will take only one step more The algorithm to do lookups is simple The word in the middle of the dictionary will be either before or after the term that needs to be looked up if the words do not match If it is before the term needs to be in the second half of the dictionary If it is after the word it needs to be in the first half That way the problem space is halved with every step until the word or definition is found This is generally known as logarithmic complexity

There are problems that grow very fast One such problem is known as the Travelling salesman problem A salesman needs to take a tour of a certain number of cities Each city should only be visited once the distance of the travelling should be minimal and the salesman should end up where he started This problem has exponential complexity There are n factorial possibilities to consider Adding one city will multiply the number of possibilities by Most of the interesting problems have this complexity

In some sports such as cricket and baseball averages are used to tell how good a player is Sporting averages have special rules for how to calculate them

Romanization or Latinization is the process by which words and languages that normally use alphabets other than the Latin alphabet are converted into Latin letters so that people who do not know the original alphabet can still read the sounds of the language It is one way to show pronunciation of words from a non Latin writing system

Transcription occurs when the effect at the end is that both the original and the transcripted version sound the same whether or not each letter alone in one text matches the corresponding letter in the other one

Transliteration occurs when the effect at the end is for the letters to match one to one whether or not the sound is the same

Diaspora is used to refer to any people or racial group forced or made to leave their traditional homelands being scattered throughout other parts of the world and their exiled community It was first used capitalized to mean the scattering of Jews after the capture of Jerusalem by the Babylonians in 586 BC

Limes is the name of a fortification at the border of the Roman empire There were many such fortifications The Latin word has a number of meanings but the most common one is border Therefore it was used by Roman writers to describe paths walls boundary stones rivers marking a boundary et cetera 

The most notable examples of Roman limites are

A medieval limes is the Limes Saxoniae in Holstein

A sequence is a concept in ordinary language which was later adopted in mathematics In ordinary language it means a series of events one following another In maths a sequence is made up of several things put together one after the other The order that the things are in matters is a sequence and is a sequence but they are not the same

There are two kinds of sequences One kind is finite sequences which have an end For example is a finite sequence Sequences can also be infinite which means they keep going and never end An example of a sequence that is infinite is the sequence of all even numbers bigger than 0 This sequence never ends it starts with 2 4 6 and so on and you can always keep on naming even numbers

If a sequence is finite it is easy to say what it is you can just write down all the things in the sequence This does not work for an infinite sequence So another way to write down a sequence is to write a rule for finding the thing in any place you want The rule should tell us how to get the thing in the n th place if n can be any number If you know what a function is this means that a sequence is a kind of function

For example the rule could be that the thing in the n th place is the number 2n This tells us what the whole sequence is even though it never ends The first number is 21 which is 2 The second number is 22 or 4 If we want to know the 100 th number its 2100 or 200 No matter which thing in the sequence we want the rule can tell us what it is

OpenGL is a programming interface for 3D graphics which helps computer programmers make their 3D graphics perform better and faster by running parts of their programs on a video card rather than just the central processor Programming interfaces like OpenGL are usually called an API which stands for Application Programming Interface

OpenGL is often compared to Direct3D an API for 3D graphics on Windows Programming for Direct3D is different in some ways because the APIs use different naming schemes for talking to a computers graphics driver which means that programmers need to write different code for OpenGL and Direct3D to do the same things

OpenGL is owned by the Khronos Group and is an example of open source software This means that all of OpenGLs programming and the explanations for how the programming all works can be viewed copied revised and re released by anyone

The Mori are the first people to live in New Zealand

The Battle of Hastings took place on October 14 1066 It was a fight between the English and Normans The result of the battle was a major Norman victory allowing William of Normandy to take the English throne and become king This Norman control of the English throne lead to other wars later such as The Hundred Years War Hastings was the most important fight in the Norman Conquest

The ruler of the Normans William of Normandy claimed he was the heir to the English throne as his cousin Edward the Confessor had promised him the throne but changed his mind on his deathbed 

William of Normandy sent up to 700 ships across the English Channel and landed at small town named Pevensey King Harold King of England sent his army south towards Hastings after defeating the Norwegian king Harald Hardrada at the Battle of Stamford Bridge 

William ordered the Norman archers to fire on the English army This had no effect because the English army formed a shield wall and protected themselves from the arrows William thinking many of Harolds army had been hurt by the arrows ordered his soldiers to march up and attack When they reached the English they realized that the arrows shot in the beginning had made little to no impact on Harolds army Still his army attacked and soon they were involved in broken wikt linkferociousferocious ground fighting Williams horse was killed from under him and he fell to the ground His army thinking he was dead fled believing they had lost William rose to his feet grabbed a horse removed his helmet and rode through his lines showing his army he was still alive shouting encouragement This restored his armys courage 

They attacked the English again but pretended to retreat The English thought they had won and followed the Normans thus breaking their own shield wall The Normans then turned around and attacked them This trick was used effectively twice In the battle King Harold was hacked to death by a group of Norman soldiers After his death many of the English ran away as they were not trained soldiers but farmers 

The battle was illustrated in a tapestry called the Bayeux Tapestry

Florence Nightingale OM was a famous English nurse She helped create the modern techniques of nursing She helped a lot of wounded soldiers during the Crimean War to get better 

She was the first female to receive the Order of Merit the highest honour awarded to a British person As a nurse she adopted the name The Lady with the Lamp because at night she checked on the wounded soldiers and always carried The Lamp with her Florence Nightingale was a wonderful woman who fought the odds of not living a life expected by her family She helped make modern nursing possible 

Florence Nightingale was born into a very rich upper class British family in 1820 in Florence Italy She was named after the town where she was born The family moved back to London when Florence was a young girl

Although her parents expected her to become a wife and a mother in 1845 she decided to become a nurse While she was training she campaigned for better conditions for poor people in Britain

In 1854 when the Crimean war began Florence was working in Harley Street in London After reading many reports about the poor treatment of sick and injured soldiers she travelled to Crimea to see for herself and discovered the hospitals were crowded and dirty 

Florence realized that soldiers died more often from diseases like cholera than from their injuries in war She used her knowledge of math and statistics to show the British government that providing better conditions for sick and injured soldiers would help them win the war

Due to soldiers falling in love with her there is a syndrome named after her called Florence Nightingale Syndrome It occurs when a soldier falls in love with a nurse

While she was working in Crimea she became known as The Lady with the Lamp because she would walk around the hospital in the evening carrying a lamp and check on the soldiers

When she returned to England she started a school for nurses at St Thomas hospital in London

In 1907 Florence Nightingale became the first woman ever to be awarded the Order of Merit by King Edward VII 

Florence died in 1910 in London There are many statues of her in Britain including one in Waterloo Place in London and a Florence Nightingale museum also in London

A castrato was a type of male singer with a very high voice The effect was produced either through castration or because of some hormonal problems The world castrato literally means castrated Such singers were very sought after in the early days of the opera Most of the main soprano roles in operas by Handel and other composers of that time were written for castrati Nowadays they are almost always sung by female sopranos  there are no castrati left 

The practice of castrating young boys who had good singing voices was quite common in Italy in the 17th century When castration is done before puberty the usual effects of puberty will not happen These include the vocal chords enlarging and growing bigger and the voice getting deeper as a consequence 

Even though castration was illegal in many parts of Italy it was often performed Many families who were poor had their children castrated because it might give them a better future 

Once a boy was castrated he would go to a special music school where children learned singing and musical instruments The castrati pupils were given special treatment They were fussed over and kept warm to stop them from getting colds When they grew up they hoped to become famous opera singers A few of them had very successful careers in opera They were the great stars of their day and audiences came to the opera to cheer on their favourite singers Those who were not good enough to make a career in opera joined church choirs instead

It is impossible now for us to know what these great castrato voices sounded like but they must have had very powerful voices and many of the singers were very skilled in singing and adding musical ornamentation to the songs In the 18th century Italian opera became very popular in England This was largely due to the German born composer Georg Friderich Hndel who moved to England in 1709 and wrote lots of Italian operas Many singers who sang in London came from Italy and many were castrati The most famous one was called Farinelli 

The popularity of castrato singers died out in the 19th century when operas became less artificial and more like real life By the mid 19th century they were no opera castrati left although a few castrati still sang in church choirs The last one a man called Alessandro Moreschi died in 1922 aged 64 There is a recording of his voice made in 1902 which can be heard online but he may not have been a good singer and he was old when he made the recording so we cannot judge whether the castrato voice was beautiful by that recording 

A falsetto voice is a special way of speaking or singing If a man tries to imitate a womans voice he does it by speaking in a falsetto voice When a man sings with a falsetto voice it sounds high like a soprano Actors do this sometimes eg Robin Williams in the film Mrs Doubtfire or Kevin Clash when voicing the character Elmo in Sesame Street and Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees with his RB falsetto

Women can also use falsetto but when they do there is not as big of a change in sound from their normal voices as there is in men When women use falsetto the voice sounds lighter or weaker than it does when they speak or sing normally

When people speak or sing their vocal cords vibrate When a man sings falsetto only the edges of his vocal cords vibrate These produce harmonics It is similar to playing harmonics on a string instrument by lightly touching the string at a certain point so that only part of the string vibrates When a man sings falsetto his vocal range is usually one octave higher than his normal singing voice

Falsetto singing was used in the days when women were not allowed to sing in churches Instead men sang countertenor Later the popularity of the countertenor disappeared but in the mid 20th century it became popular again for performing Renaissance and Baroque music Today the tradition of men singing alto still exists in Britain in cathedral choirs and some church choirs which are all male choirs It is not a big operatic voice and it blends in well with boys treble voices in the acoustic of churches and cathedrals 

Occasionally falsetto can be used for comic effect as in the dying swan in the Carmina Burana by Carl Orff

A countertenor is a male singer who uses a falsetto voice to sing high notes like a female contralto or mezzo soprano

Countertenors were used a lot in the Renaissance and Baroque periods when females were not allowed to sing in church choirs They did not have big dramatic voices like castrati so they were not normally used in opera People forgot about this way of singing in the 18th and 19th centuries although male altos continued to sing in English cathedral and church choirs In the 20th century an English countertenor called Alfred Deller became very famous He sang many songs from the Baroque period that had been written for the countertenor voice for example songs by Henry Purcell who sang countertenor himself Today there is a lot of interest again in using this type of voice for performing early music like Renaissance and Baroque music

A breeches role is a part in an opera in which a woman plays the role of a man It is also called a trouser role or pants role or travesti role It is called a breeches role because breeches are tight fitting knee length trousers These used to be worn by men at the time that breeches roles became popular Sometimes breeches roles are in plays but they are usually in opera

Breeches roles are usually female singers acting the role of a young man They are normally sung by mezzo sopranos or contraltos with light voices because they can often sound boyish In the 17th and 18th centuries it was normal to have actors and actresses who cross dressed It was the time when castrato singers were popular These castrati were men pretending to be women but there were also women pretending to be men and the audiences were used to this kind of thing As they gradually stopped the horrible practice of castrating young boys in the late 18th century these male characters started to be sung by mezzo sopranos instead

Mozart wrote an opera called The Marriage of Figaro In this opera the role of Cherubino a young page boy is sung by a mezzo soprano Other famous examples include the role of Siebel in Dvoks opera Rusalka and the role of Prince Orlofsky in Johann Strausss opera Die Fledermaus

Composers from the 20th century do not usually have breeches roles in their operas There is the role of Oktavian in Richard Strausss opera Der Rosenkavalier but this opera was deliberately trying to produce the old fashioned atmosphere of Mozarts time Benjamin Britten wrote an opera called Midsummer Nights Dream based on Shakespeares play There is no breeches role here Instead the part of Oberon is written for a countertenor a man with a high falsetto voice

There is also a term called a skirt role This is the opposite of a trouser role it is a man acting the part of a woman Benjamin Britten uses one in the role of the Madwoman in Curlew River The witch in Humperdincks Hansel and Gretel is also sung by a man In both cases it makes the characters more dramatic but the first is very serious while the second is supposed to be humorous

The word treble is used especially in British English to mean the singing voice of a boy or girl Often it is called boy soprano but since there are also many girls who sing in cathedral and church choirs these days the word treble is now used to describe the voice of either sex

A boy can sing treble until he reaches puberty At puberty he starts to become a man and his voice range will go down He will then become a tenor baritone or bass or he may even train to be a countertenor A girls voice also changes when she reaches puberty but the change into a grown up female voice is more gradual than with a boy and it is still within the soprano or alto range

Boys who join a cathedral choir or the choir of a large church will have to work hard to develop their voice and learn to sing musically They often start this training aged 7 or 8 and they may only have four or five years before their voice starts to break They do not usually become famous as soloists but the Welsh treble Aled Jones became very famous for about three years and made many recordings before his voice broke in 1987 

The word treble is used for children singing in a Classical Music style especially church music Although children do not usually sing in opera occasionally a treble is used for the part of a very small boy eg in Debussys opera Pllas et Mlisande

A claque is a small group of people in an opera house who deliberately either clapped loudly or shouted boo for a particular singer

In the 19th century there was very often a claque at performances of an opera Someone who liked one of the singers and wanted them to have lots of applause would pay a group of people to sit near the back of the opera house and to clap and shout enthusiastically whenever that singer had finished a song This would encourage the rest of the audience to clap loudly too Sometimes the claque would be paid to do the opposite they would be told to hiss and boo when the singer had sung

Very often a singer would have to pay some money to the claque so that they would applaud him If the singer did not pay the claque would hiss and boo This was of course a nasty form of blackmail In the early 20th century when the world famous tenor Enrico Caruso refused to pay the claque in Naples a bribe they hissed during his singing of the great aria Una furtiva lagrima

Fortunately we do not have claques in opera houses nowadays There are exceptions of course

Genocide means trying to destroy a group which is or is similar to an ethnic group or a religious group by killing its members

Some people do not agree that all of these events are genocides but the events listed here are recognized as genocides by many people

In 2011 Tony Chedrawee the leader of the African United Republic Nations declared the conflict between the two tribes a Genocide Chedrawee sent peace keeping troops into Rwanda to stop the killing These troops were lead by the royal Lebanese Military under the order of King Marx the 12th and the support of the catholic church The Rwandan Genocide was the killing in the central African nation of Rwanda of abatutsi as well as abahutu 

Though many people think the slaughter took place only from April 6th to mid July in 1994 the genocide had been happening on a smaller scale since the so called Hutu Revolution in 1959 

It was five times faster than the Holocaust and was carried out mostly by tools like imipanga and clubs Many countries did almost nothing to stop it and some countries such as France even helped the gnocidaires France and Rwanda decided to restore diplomatic ties again in November 2009

The 1994 genocide started when the aeroplane of Hutu Rwandan dictator Juvnal Habyarimana was shot down on the night of April 6th It is still not known who shot the plane down some people believe that Hutu extremists shot it down in order to make Hutu supporters angry and start the 1994 genocide Within a half an hour roadblocks had been set up all over Kigali by the Hutu extremist Interahamwe and Impuzamugambi militias 

They and the army soon began going house to house in Kigali killing abatutsi and moderate abahutu By morning on April 7th the killings had reached full swing in Kigali Interahamwe were running around with bloody tools killing and looting Other countries journalists were able to film many of these things Abatutsi gathered in places they thought would be safe like schools and churches In a few days the genocide had spread all over the country Three days later Westerners were taken away while Rwandans were forced to stay behind

One memorable case was at Rwandas only psychiatric hospital which had been surrounded by the Interahamwe Belgian soldiers came to take away Westerners to safety Journalists had come with them to film what happened A large group of abatutsi came running out with their hands raised asking for help A few of them who could speak French tried negotiating with the soldiers for help But the soldiers would not let them come As they left they could clearly see the Interahamwe starting to kill the batutsi Similar things happened all over Rwanda

Recovery has been slow but significant A gacaca court system has been established to try the killers A lot of victims are starting to forgive the killers and it is widely said that the first step to preventing it from happening again is forgiveness instead of vengeance

Cardiac arrest occurs when the heart stops beating This can be caused by a heart attack in which the hearts demand for oxygen is not met and the heart muscle begins to die The sudden failure of normal circulation of blood due to failure of the heart to contract results in the body not getting enough oxygenated blood This causes cells to start to die from oxygen starvation Cerebral broken wikt linkhypoxiahypoxia makes a person lose consciousness and stop breathing and this makes the heart stop completely Unless the person is also suffering from broken wikt linkhypothermiahypothermia broken wikt linkbrain damagebrain damage usually occurs after three to five minutes 

Cardiac arrest is a medical emergency that in certain groups of patients can be reversed if it is treated early enough When cardiac arrest leads to a persons death this is called sudden cardiac death First aid treatment for cardiac arrest usually begins with cardiopulmonary resuscitation to keep oxygenated blood flowing until medical treatment is available

Combustion is the process of burning a fuel or of being on fire It is very hot A car and rocket engine work by combustion Combustion in a car motor is different to combustion in a rocket engine Car combustion is gas catching on fire and exploding in cylinders again and again making the car move Rocket combustion is made by rocket fuel exploding out of the back of the rocket moving it up The burning of most substances is bad for the environment and the ozone layer because it can let off greenhouse gases Hydrogen burns cleanly and gives off a lot of heat but it does not produce much power and is hard to find West substance ions are harder to combust than your typical unit

A caterpillar is a young butterfly or moth that has just hatched out of its egg A caterpillar is a kind of larva When it is older the caterpillar will turn into a pupa and then later the pupa will turn into a butterfly

Caterpillars usually have three pairs of small but noticeable true legs at the front and up to 5 pairs of fleshy false legs at the back

Caterpillars are commonly found feeding on leaves but they are also found inside living stems and branches or on the roots of plants and dead wood

Most caterpillars are shades of green or brown and are relatively hairless although in many families caterpillars are very hairy and often brightly coloured Some species are pests of growing plants carpets woollens organic fabrics and stored food products

Caterpillars are an important source of food for birds and other invertebrates and many species help dead animals and plants decompose

Examples of different kinds of caterpillars

Hummingbirds are small birds of the family Trochilidae 

They are among the smallest of birds most species measure 7513 cm The smallest living bird species is the 25 cm Bee Hummingbird They can hover in mid air by rapidly flapping their wings 1280 times per second They are also the only group of birds able to fly backwards Their rapid wing beats do actually hum They can fly at speeds over 15 ms

Hummingbirds help flowers to pollinate though insects are best known for doing so The hummingbird enjoys nectar like the butterfly and other flower loving insects such as bees

Hummingbirds do not have a good sense of smell instead they are attracted to color especially the color red Unlike the butterfly the hummingbird hovers over the flower as it drinks nectar from it like a moth When it does so it flaps its wings very quickly to stay in one place which makes it look like a blur A hummingbird sometimes puts its whole head into the flower to drink the nectar properly When it takes its head back out its head is covered with yellow pollen so that when it moves to another flower it can pollinate Or sometimes it may pollinate with its beak

Like bees hummingbirds can assess the amount of sugar in the nectar they eat They reject flowers whose nectar has less than 10 sugar Nectar is a poor source of nutrients so hummingbirds meet their needs for protein amino acids vitamins minerals etc by preying on insects and spiders

Most hummingbirds have bills that are long and straight or nearly so but in some species the bill shape is adapted for specialized feeding Thornbills have short sharp bills adapted for feeding from flowers with short corollas and piercing the bases of longer ones The Sicklebills extremely decurved bills are adapted to extracting nectar from the curved corollas of flowers in the family Gesneriaceae The bill of the Fiery tailed Awlbill has an upturned tip as in the Avocets The male Tooth billed Hummingbird has barracuda like spikes at the tip of its long straight bill

The two halves of a hummingbirds bill have a pronounced overlap with the lower half fitting tightly inside the upper half When hummingbirds feed on nectar the bill is usually only opened slightly allowing the tongue to dart out into the nectar

Like the similar nectar feeding sunbirds and unlike other birds hummingbirds drink by using grooved or trough like tongues which they can stick out a long way Hummingbirds do not spend all day flying as the energy cost would be prohibitive the majority of their activity consists simply of sitting or perching Hummingbirds feed in many small meals consuming many small invertebrates and up to twelve times their own body weight in nectar each day They spend an average of 1015 of their time feeding and 7580 sitting and digesting

Since hummingbirds are specialized nectar eaters they are tied to the bird flowers they feed upon Some species especially those with unusual bill shapes such as the Sword billed Hummingbird and the sicklebills are co evolved with a small number of flower species 

Many plants pollinated by hummingbirds produce flowers in shades of red orange and bright pink though the birds will take nectar from flowers of many colors Hummingbirds can see wavelengths into the near ultraviolet However their flowers do not reflect these wavelengths as many insect pollinated flowers do The narrow color spectrum may make hummingbird pollinated flowers inconspicuous to insects thereby reducing nectar robbing by insects Hummingbird pollinated flowers also produce relatively weak nectar containing high concentrations of sucrose whereas insect pollinated flowers typically produce more concentrated nectars dominated by fructose and glucose

Hummingbirds have traditionally been a part of the bird order Apodiformes This order includes the Hummingbirds the swifts and the tree swifts The Sibley Ahlquist taxonomy of birds based on DNA studies done in the 1970s and 1980s have changed the classification of hummingbirds Instead of being in the same order as the swifts the hummingbirds were made into an order that only included themselves Trochiliformes Their previous order Apodiformes was changed to the superorder Apodimorphae This superorder contains the three families of birds which were in it when it was an order

South Park is an animated television comedy series about the lives of four boys in the fourth grade living in the small mountain town of South Park Colorado The series is made to be watched by adults but the series gets a lot of people to watch it because of its humor It uses satire to make fun of subjects like current events religion politics and pop culture The show is controversial because of its use of profanity and sexual humor Creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone also made a movie based on this series called South Park Bigger Longer Uncut Characters in South Park include Stan Marsh Kyle Broflovski Eric Cartman and Kenny McCormick These boys are 8 and 9 years old The series is about them living in their town

 South Park began in 1992 when Trey Parker and Matt Stone met in their film class at the University of Colorado at Boulder They made a short subject animated short called Jesus vs Frosty The short movie had characters that were similar to the main characters in the present day South Park

Later on an executive at FOX saw the movie He hired Parker and Stone to make a second short movie to send to friends as a video Christmas card This second video was called Jesus vs Santa It had the same style as the South Park that can be seen today

The voices in South Park are done by a small number of actors Most of the male voices are done by Matt Stone and Trey Parker The female voices are done by April Stewart and Mona Marshall Other voices are done by Adrien Beard and Vernon Chatman

Before the start of season four the main characters of the series were four third grade students

Stan is usually considered the serious and sensitive of the group Stan is able to think clearly and is generally good natured Stan usually tries to come up with logical solutions to their outrageous situations Stans character is loosely based on the persona of co creator Trey Parker His best friend is Kyle and their relationship is essential in several episodes such as when he saves Kyles life in Cherokee Hair Tampons Cartmanland and Super Best Friends

Kyle is the most easy going character and the only Jewish one Even though he is not particularly religious he hates Cartman because Cartman is always making rude comments about his faith Kyles character portrays the alter ego of co creator Matt Stone Along with Stan Kyle often provides a reasonable perspective on the crazy behavior of the adult world around them Kyle is often depicted as the most moral member of the four

Eric is the most irrational of the main characters Eric is fat and seems to hate almost everything except from food Henry Ford Mel Gibson Adolf Hitler Osama bin Laden and TS Elliot He is often the main reason for the plot of each episode Cartman commonly acts against the other boys Cartman often insults Kyle for being Jewish and Kenny for being poor In the earlier episodes he would also insult Stan for having a girlfriend Cartman is extremely broken wikt linkdeviousdevious and seems to be intelligent however this is shadowed by his racism and bigotry Cartman sometimes serves as a mouthpiece for some of Parker and Stones more extreme commentary about society Cartman hates hippies more than anything else This is seen in the episode Die Hippie Die which showed his career as a hippie exterminator

Kenny comes from a poor family He is the most cosmopolitan of the four boys who often turn to him when encountering an unfamiliar sexual term Kennys voice is muffled by his parka This is mainly because the comments he makes are vulgar Even though his dialog is not understood by the viewer Stan Kyle and Cartman can understand him completely clear enough

Butters Stotch

Butters made very few appearances in the early episodes He only started to became a regular character upon Kennys death in season 6 He has since been used almost as regularly as the main 4 boys Butters is the character that the others usually make fun of he is nervous naive easily manipulated yet he remains very optimistic He is often punished by his overbearing parents and sometimes used by his peers for their own amusementButters always gets grounded To further represent the misfortune of this character it is revealed in the episode AWESOM O that his birthday is on September 11 th Butters became important after he was the replacement for the semi permanently dead Kenny in season six He also has an alter ego which he named Professor Chaos His character is based on animation director Eric Stough

South Park has a number of different families who represent a common theme of many episodes There are five main families who are distinguished from the rest of the townsfolk the Marshes the Broflovskis the Cartmans the McCormicks and the Stotches These families are important because their children have been the main character

Randy Marsh Randy Marsh has become one of the most common adult characters on the show His actions in a lot of episodes such as Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow and Bloody Mary suggest that Randy is rather stupid Stan also says that his father is stupid in the episodes Child Abduction Is Not Funny and All About the Mormons Like most adults in South Park he has a tendency to get caught up in any trend Randy is South Parks only geologist along with Clydes father

Towelie is a talking towel who smokes marijuana and has a collection of novelty stamps He often reminds the boys to bring a towel

The colon is a part of the large intestine It is between cecum and the rectum The colon takes water from the feces that goes through it The colon in mammals can be divided into four sections

This part of the colon goes from the cecum up the right hand side of the abdomen

This part of the colon goes across the from the ascending colon It goes underneath the stomach and the pancreas and joins the descending colon near the spleen

This part of the intestine is about 30cm in length It travels down the left side of the abdomen It is possible to have medical problems with the descending colon including ulcers cancer and Crohns disease

This is the small S shaped part of the colon about 40cm in length which goes from the bottom of the descending colon into the centre of the pelvis to the rectum It gets its name from the Greek letter s sigma

The battle of in Bin Ph happened in 1954 It was a battle between Vietnam and France which Vietnam won This led the French to give up in the First Indochinese War or the French War securing the independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for the time This was followed by the division of Vietnam into North and South and then the Second Indochinese War

The August Revolution happened in Vietnam in August of 1945 It was an uprising for independence after the Japanese lost World War II It led to the Declaration of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on September 2 1945 The independence war against the French would soon follow

The word dictator or despot in modern times is used to describe the absolute ruler of a country who uses force and fear to keep himself and his friends in authority and can effectively make laws all by himself A country that is ruled by a dictator has never been a democracy A country that is ruled by a dictator is called a dictatorship

Some dictators gained political power by winning an election and cancelling new elections once they took power

It is not always clear whether a leader is a dictator or not Some leaders got into power by elections but sometimes they gave false election results

Kings and emperors often use force and fear too but usually they are not called dictators This is because kings and emperors have some reason from being in power but a dictator gained power himself Also when someone is king or emperor of a country usually there were several kings or emperors before them A dictator often creates the job of dictator by gaining power

Some people call leaders dictators because they simply do not like them and they seem powerful

1998 The Second Congo War started after Kabila ordered all Ugandan and Rwandan military forces to leave the country The governments of Uganda Rwanda and Burundi reacted by invading the country Then other countries got involved to support Kabila Angola Zimbabwe Namibia Chad Libya and Sudan Some people call the war Africas World War because it involved so many countries About 38 million people died in this war mostly from starvation and disease

2001 Laurent Kabila was assassinated by one of his bodyguards The Congolese parliament voted unanimously that his son Joseph Kabila should replace him as president

2003 The Second Congo War ended when the Transitional Government was made after many peace agreements and it took power

2006 Congo Kinshasa had a presidential election It was the first election that included more than one political party since independence in 1960 No candidate got more than half of the votes On October 29 a second election took place to decide which of the two most popular candidates Joseph Kabila or Jean Pierre Bemba would become president There were protests over both elections Kabila won the second election Lumumbist Antoine Gizenga is now Prime Minister

The capital is Kinshasa

Elektra is the name of several persons in Greek mythology

Elektra of Mycenae was the daughter of King Agamemnon of Mycenae and Klytaimnestra She had a brother Orestes and two sisters Iphigeneia and Chrysothemis

Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas in the body that controls the glucose level in the blood

People who cannot make insulin in their bodies or who make it but their body cannot use it properly have the disease diabetes When blood glucose levels fall below a certain level the human body begins to use stored sugar as an energy source through glycogenolysis This process breaks down the glycogen stored in the liver and muscles into glucose which can then be used as an energy source Insulin is a central metabolic control mechanism Insulin is also used as a control signal to other body systems In addition it has several other anabolic effects throughout the body Insulin affects vascular compliance and cognition

Human insulin is a peptide hormone composed of 51 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 5808 Da The islets of Langerhans in the pancreas produces insulin The name comes from the Latin insula for island Insulins structure varies slightly between species of animals Insulin from different animal sources has different effects on the human carbohydrate metabolism process Porcine insulin is especially close to the human version So people with diabetes can take in insulin extracted from pigs instead of producing their own insulin 

Nicolae Paulescu a Romanian professor of physiology at the University of Medicine and Pharmacy in Bucharest was the first to isolate insulin in 1916 which he called at that time pancrein by developing an aqueous pancreatic extract which when injected into a diabetic dog proved to have a normalizing effect on blood sugar levels He had to interrupt his experiments because the World War I In 1921 he wrote four papers about his work carried out in Bucharest and his tests on a diabetic dog Later that year he detailed his work by publishing an extensive whitepaper on the effect of the pancreatic extract injected into a diabetic animal which he called Research on the Role of the Pancreas in Food Assimilation 

Dr Frederick Banting and Dr Charles Best also did similar experiments while trying to find a cure for diabetes In these experiments they used dogs 

They first knew insulin would control diabetes in a person when they injected some insulin into a 14 year old boy named Leonard Thompson who was dying of diabetes After the injection he survived Banting won the 1923 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine along with John James Richard Macleod for the discovery of insulin Best and Paulescu were not honored at that time

The first genetically engineered synthetic human insulin was produced in a laboratory in 1977 by Herbert Boyer using E coli

A Nerve impulse is a way of two nerve cells to communicate with one another Nerve impulses are mostly electrical signals along the dendrites When it actually comes to passing on the impulse from one cell to another some transmitter substances are also involved

The Diego Ramrez Islands are a group of islands They are located in the Drake Passage about 100 km southwest of Cape Horn The Ildefonso Islands are 93 km to the north northwest There is a group of 6 islands to the north then there is a waterway of 3 km then there is another group to the south There is a weather station in one of the islands The islands are an important nesting place for birds

The islands belong to Chile and are named after Diego Ramrez They were first sighted on 12 February 1619 by Marco Ramirez of the Garcia de Nodal expedition and named after the cosmographer of the expedition They were the southernmost landmass known at the time They kept this status for 156 years In 1775 James Cook discovered the South Sandwich Islands which are much farther south 

The Chilean Navy built a meteorological station above Caleta Condell a small cove on the northeast side of Isla Gonzalo in 1957 and resupply it several times each year This is the southernmost manned outpost of South America even if the South Sandwich Islands are regarded as part of South America The Argentinian station on Thule Island was taken down in June 1982 after the Falklands War The next southerly manned outpost of South America is the lighthouse of Cape Horn Cruise ships sometimes pass by on their way to and from Antarctica

 ImageDiego Ramirez IslandsjpgGeneral impression of the islands ImageDiego Ramirez stationjpgWeather station with beacon at the highest point This is on Isla Gonzalo 

The archipelago has 2 groups The North group is smaller and is named as Rocas del Norte There are 5 islands in this group Islote Cabezas Islote Peailillo Isla Norte Islote Martnez and Islote Mendoza In the South group are many islands for example Islote Santander Islotes Vergara Isla Bartolom Islote Pontevedra Islote Garca Isla Gonzalo and Islote Ester

All the islands have moss on the ground and they have a cold climate all year with much rain every month Because of how far south they are there is a strong wind from the west

Performing music from memory means knowing a piece of music well enough to be able to play or sing it without the written music  

Although some people can learn music by ear most people who are taught to play musical instruments learn new pieces by reading the printed music which is in front of them on a music stand When someone has learned to play a piece of music well enough to perform it it is good if they can learn to play it without the printed music This is called playing from memory or playing by heart When a musician is practising a piece of music so that it can be played from memory this is called memorizing the music

Most Classical musicians will agree that it is good to play from memory when performing as a soloist It means that the player understands the music really well and he is able to concentrate completely on the way he plays the music In some music competitions the competitors are expected to play from memory A pianist playing a recital will usually play everything from memory It is particularly important for singers who are performing songs to sing without music because they can then communicate directly with the audience using the expression on their faces Some conductors conduct from memory If they do they ought to know every single note for every single instrument from memory There are some conductors who have such amazing memories that they can do this

Some people find it easier to memorize music than others There are different ways of practising to help memorize music by memorizing a few bars at a time by studying the printed music away from the instrument or by thinking through the piece away from the instrument

Some people have a photographic memory and can see in their mind the music as printed on the paper Some people rely on aural memory There is also muscular memory Probably most people use some combination of all these methods

When people perform from memory they are often worried that they might have a memory lapse It can happen of course even to the greatest musicians The famous violinist Bronislaw Huberman and the pianist Eugen dAlbert were once performing Beethovens Kreutzer Sonata Both were playing from memory One of them kept going wrong in the same place playing something that had happened earlier so that they played the middle bit three times before eventually managing to finish the piece However this is quite common and can happen to anyone 

People who learn musical instruments should try to memorize some of their pieces Many famous musicians have a large repertoire of pieces that they can play from memory

The twin prime conjecture is a mathematical theory It says that it is possible to find two twin primes that are as big as wanted 

Twin primes are prime numbers that differ by two For example 3 and 5 are both prime and differ by two They are twin primes 23 is prime but it is not a twin prime The primes nearest to 23 are 19 and 29 Twin primes were discovered by Euclid in 300 BC 

Since Euclids time mathematicians have wondered whether there are an infinite number of twin primes Many mathematicians are still trying to find the answer

Mud is a mixture of soil dirt and water Some animals like worms frogs snails clams and crayfish live in mud Pigs and elephants use it to cool themselves in hot weather Some people enjoy making mud pies out of mud Mud is a type of soil that is also called clay soil Others include the sandy soil or sand and garden soil Wet mud has a soft wet texture and is squishy Young children sometimes play in puddles of mud Mud is usually brown

Dwarf planet is the name used to classify some objects in the solar system This definition was created on August 24 2006 by the International Astronomical Union and can be described as a dwarf planet is a body orbiting the Sun that is big enough to form itself into a sphere by its own gravity but has not cleared its orbital path of other rival bodies At the same meeting the IAU also defined the term planet for the first time Despite logic spikes created by this new name a dwarf planet is still a planet unlike some mesoplanets which are not always spherod even if they are in the same size range

Some astronomers think that the term dwarf planet is too confusing and needs to be changed

The first five dwarf planets in order from the Sun are 

The dwarf planets unlike the terrestrial and gas giant planets populate more than one region of the solar system Ceres is in the asteroid belt while the others are in the trans Neptune region

No space probes have visited any of the dwarf planets This will change if NASAs Dawn and New Horizons missions reach Ceres and Pluto respectively as planned in 2015 Dawn is also slated to orbit and observe another probably not sphere like but still potential dwarf planet Vesta in 2011

The Nintendo Virtual Boy was a mostly portable game console which had two screens that showed only red and black graphics To use the system one had to put ones face close to the system so that each eye could see only one screen By showing each eye a different image the system could create a 3D effect

The way the system displayed images was not by LCDs as some would think At the time LCDs could not be used because they had two problems when they were first tested on the console they would blur if anything moved on the screen and users would see double instead of depth Instead a vertical line of 224 very bright but very small LEDs were used for each eye These LEDs flashed on and off very fast in certain patterns This line of LEDs was then magnified by a lens and a vibrating mirror would reflect each line at a certain time into each eye creating a full image due to the human eyes persistence of vision Unfortunately due to the quick flashing of the LEDs many users became nauseous became dizzy or had headaches after playing for a long time To help this an automatic pause feature was added which stopped the game play every 30 minutes for the player to rest his or her eyes

The Virtual Boy was first sold in 1995 but was not popular Consumers did not like the consoles high price monochrome graphics eye and neck strain and need for a stand Many were saving money for the soon to be sold Nintendo 64 Nintendo lowered the price many times but the system did not sell well and was discontinued in 1996 Only 22 games were released in Japan and America

Popular games for the system include Mario Tennis and Virtual Boy Wario Land

The Virtual Boy was made by Gunpei Yokoi who also made the Game Boy and Game Watch

Existentialism is a philosophical way of thinking that is very different from other philosophical ideas

Many religions and philosophies say that human life has a meaning But people who believe in existentialism think that the world and human life have no meaning unless people give them meanings existence precedes essence 

Existentialists believe that our human essence or nature is entirely and simply existence This means that the only nature we as humans have is the nature we make for ourselves As a result of this existentialists think that the actions or choices that a person makes are very important They believe that every person has to decide for themselves what is right and wrong and what is good and bad 

People who believe in existentialism ask questions like what is it like to be a human in the world and how can we understand human freedom Existentialism is very often connected with negative emotions such as anxiety dread and mortality

Existentialism is different from Nihilism Nihilists believe that human life does not have a meaning at all

Ingmar Bergman made a movie called The Seventh Seal in 1957 This movie was about people who feel lonely and sad because they cannot fit in

The movie Taxi Driver from 1976 has existential ideas in it The main character feels sad and lonely because he cannot understand the world Jean Luc Godards Vivre sa vie and Federico Fellinis 8 12 are prime examples of the Existentialism fashion in the European early 50s that influenced American films such as Easy rider or The graduate in the 1960s

Bluefins feed on mackerel herring mullet whiting squid eels and crustaceans They are very powerful and fast and can swim at speeds up to 50 mph

The following are percentages of Tuna caught in different regions in the world

An Automaton is a concept from mathematics Sometimes the concept is called state machine It is like an abstract machine 

Such a machine can be given input which is either rejected or accepted Its like one of those vending machines When something is bought coins needs to be inserted into the machine If these are the right coins they are accepted and the requested item is dropped so it can be removed If the coins are wrong they are rejected

Internally the automaton has different states it can be in Feeding it input may change its state That way the automaton goes through all the input consuming one item at a time When no symbol is left the automaton is in a certain state This may be an final state In this case the input is accepted Otherwise the input is rejected

If the machine has a countable finite number of states it is called finite state machine A diagram that shows all the states and transitions of such a machine is called finite state diagram

Like in real life there are machines that are too complex to understand The mathematician and computer scientists therefore ask themselves if a certain automaton is minimal If it is not minimal there must be another automaton with fewer states that can do the same thing

An example of an automaton is the Turing machine

A Vending machine is an automatic machine that sells food such as canned soups and packaged sandwiches snacks such as potato chips chocolate bars and candy hot drinks cold drinks or other items such as newspapers or cigarettes Vending machines in bathrooms sometimes sell condoms mouthwash or toothpaste and toothbrushes 

The machines usually work when some money is put in a slot Then a button needs to be pushed or a lever pulled If there is enough money in the machine the selected item will be dropped to a tray where it can be taken out by the person making the purchase Older vending machines were mechanical but most newer ones are electronic Many modern vending machines can accept debit or credit cards in addition to cash

A Bar is originally a long unbent piece made of metal It was originally made to split a room into two different parts Bars or handrails run through courtrooms in some countries From there there is the work barrister Lawyers in North America use the phrase called to the bar to refer to when a newly graduated lawyer is admitted to the law society which entitles them to practise law

Later the meaning got extended and also meant a long table where alcoholic drinks are served It later came to mean the business where such drinks are served such as a pub or nightclub Bars such as pubs and nightclubs also serve snack food In most countries bars are regulated and licensed by the regional or local governments which establish laws regarding the opening hours and serving policies In Canada and the United States a liquor tax is placed on the sales of alcoholic beverages 

Cape Horn is a cape It is the southernmost land area of the Tierra del Fuego archipelago of southern Chile Many people see Cape Horn as the southern tip of South America Cape Horn is the most southerly of the great capes The Drake Passage is directly to the south of it For many years it was a major milestone on the clipper route by which sailing ships carried trade around the world The waters around the cape are very dangerous because of strong winds large waves and icebergs These reasons have made it notorious as a sailors graveyard

Today the Panama Canal has greatly reduced the need for cargo ships to travel via the Horn However sailing around the Horn is widely regarded as one of the major challenges in yachting and a number of recreational sailors continue to sail this route sometimes as part of a circumnavigation of the globe Several prominent ocean yacht races notably the Vende Globe sail around the world via the Horn and speed records for round the world sailing follow the same route

An iceberg is a large piece of ice floating in the water Icebergs are very dangerous to ships and many ships have sunk after crashing into icebergs The most famous one was RMS Titanic in 1912 

About 90 of an iceberg is below the water line and ten percent above Just by looking at the part you can see it is hard to tell how the part underwater looks and how close you can get before crashing into it Icebergs are dangerous for ships especially during the months of April May and June

The first person to give a correct scientific explanation of this phenomenon was Mikhail Lomonosov around 1750 The density of ice is about 092 kg per liter that of sea water is about 1025 kg per liter For this reason 920 parts of the 1025 or about 90 percent of the icebergs volume need to be below the water line Lomonosov grew up on the shore of the White Sea in the European part of Russia He studied in Marburg and is credited with introducing the word iceberg into the Russian language  

Icebergs break off from larger structures made of ice like glaciers or ice shelves These are formed by snowfall in very cold places where it will not melt in the summer The snow builds up and compacts into ice This is gradually pulled downhill by gravity and into the sea The ice then falls off and makes icebergs The icebergs can drift in the sea for years before they have melted completely

The biggest iceberg people know about was called B 15 It broke off from the Antarctic ice shelf in the year 2000 and was as large as the island of Jamaica It soon started to break up into smaller pieces some of which still remain in 2008

 Circumnavigation originally meant going around something by ship Usually people go around the world The first known circumnavigation was done by Ferno de Magalhes from 1519 to 1522 Magellan took 5 ships and went west from Spain He discovered a waterway which is now named after him the Strait of Magellan Magellan died in a fight with natives on the Philippine island Mactan in April 1521 The voyage was completed under command of Juan Sebastin Elcano Elcano arrived in Sanlcar de Barrameda with 18 survivors in 1522 The voyage had stared there By this it was proven that the earth was a globe

A thought experiment is an experiment that takes place in the mind of a scientist Unlike with a real life experiment where change is actually measured thought experiments are not measured and are just done to show a special way of thinking about something Anyone can perform a thought experiment All you need is your mind because all the steps take place in your mind

Breaking Benjamin is a hard rock band from Pennsylvania The band is best known for their songs Polyamorous So Cold Sooner or Later The Diary of Jane and Breath The band was formed in 1998 by lead vocalist Benjamin Burnley and drummer Jeremy Hummel They have released four albums Saturate We Are Not Alone Phobia and Dear Agony

The bands newest album Dear Agony was released on September 29 2009 The albums first single I Will Not Bow was featured in the movie Surrogates and charted at number one of the Rock charts

A headland is an area of land that is surrounded by water on three sides A bay is a an area of water It is surrounded by land on three sides Very often the land areas are called capes The water areas are also called gulfs Headlands are made of hard rock and bays are made of soft rock It takes the hard rock longer to erode 

A bay is a hole in the land next to a sea or lake between two headlands The waves coming to the shore in a bay are usually constructive waves and because of this many of them have a beach A bay may be metres across or it could be hundreds of kilometres across Bays form where weak rocks such as sands and clays are eroded leaving bands of stronger rocks such as chalk limestone or granite forming a headland or peninsula 

Headlands and bays are formed when there are parallel sections of softer and harder rock perpendicular to the coast The sea erodes the softer rock faster than the harder rock forming a bay The harder rock that is left protruding into the sea is the headland

 ImageKells BayjpgKells bay on the Ring of Kerry in Ireland ImageHanauma Bay 1JPGHanauma bay on the island of Hawaii ImageCapeHornjpgCape Horn is the southern tip of South America ImageCape of Good HopejpgThe Cape of Good Hope is seen by many as the divider of the Atlantic and Indian Ocean 

The Drake passage is a body of water It lies between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans To the north is Cape Horn and the South American continent to the south of it are the South Shetland Islands which are part of Antarctica It is part of the Southern Ocean It is named after the English privateer Sir Francis Drake He never sailed the passage because sailing the Straight of Magellan was less dangerous 

The drake passage is also the shortest route from Antarctica to the rest of the world The only islands in the passage are the Diego Ramirez Islands about 60 km south of Cape Horn 

The passage is also known for very rough seas Waves of 10 m are not uncommon here 

The passage is also good for seeing Whales Dolphins seabirds and penguins 

In older texts the passage is called Drake Strait

A glacier is a large body of ice and snow A glacier forms because in a particular spot the snow does not all melt in summer Each winter more snow is added and the weight of all the snow creates pressure that turns the lower parts into ice After many years of this happening the glacier will start growing very big It becomes so heavy that gravity makes the ice flow downwards like water just much more slowly  only about m to ftnum50abbrnospellCommonwealthprecision2wikiyes per year New snowfalls replace the parts that flow away

Glaciers will only form in places that are cold enough and get enough snow over time This can take a long time normally hundreds or thousands of years There are two kinds of glaciers continental glaciers and alpine or mountain glaciers

Continental glaciers are glaciers that spread out over a lot of land They showed up mostly during the Ice Ages a long time ago but there are still some continental glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica They often flow downwards into the sea where they break up The broken parts that float in the sea are called icebergs

Alpine glaciers are smaller than continental glaciers and form in mountain areas They usually flow down until they reach a point where its so warm that the ice melts completely during the summer

Glaciers are very important because they affect the environment a lot They do this because they are very big and heavy so they erode mountains and land when they move and scratch the rock they sit on Also since they froze long ago snow crystals and air bubbles inside are kept in good condition for scientists to look at Nowadays glaciers have been melting more than they used to because the climate is changing and global warming is happeningneeds proof

Glaciers are the largest deposits of fresh water on Earth The largest bodies of salt water are the oceans

Glaciers appear blue in color because water is very good at absorbing light Only the strongest light with the most energy is able to escape Blue is the color of light that has the most energy so blue is the only color of light that can escape without being absorbed The thicker the glacier is the more blue it appears

Sight reading is the ability to play music that one has never seen before It is important to be able to read music well in order to sight read

Many people who learn to play an instrument will take examinations from time to time One of the tests that is usually required for an examination is some sight reading 

People who find it hard to read music will find it hard to sight read The best way to improve is by regular practice People who play in orchestras will need to be good sight readers because they often have to play music that they have never seen or heard before 

People who learn the piano often find sight reading hard because they have to read two staves at once Playing through lots of easy music is a good way to improve Playing piano duets with a friend is also great fun 

When someone is reading aloud their eyes are looking several words ahead of the word they are speaking In the same way a good sight reader will try to look ahead of the notes he is playing The player is anticipating In this way he can try to make the music expressive even if it means leaving out some of the notes

A good sight reader will be able to see the printed music and imagine what the notes should sound like In this way he will not need to keep looking at his fingers to check whether he is playing the correct notes

Some pianists are very good at sight reading The pianist John Ogdon was able to read extremely difficult modern music at first sight

A child prodigy is a child who is very smart at an early age They can do things that average people can only do when they are adults Child prodigies are often musicians or mathematicians A child prodigy does not always grow up to be a world famous genius Some of them lose their exceptional gifts in adulthood

This category includes American people who are of Irish descent

A Puerto Rican is a person from Puerto Rico or a someone who is desended from someone who was originally from Puerto Rico Puerto Ricans are considered American citizens even though Puerto Rico is only a territory of the United States and not an official state People from Puerto Rico can also be known as a Boricua Borinquen Puertoriqueo or the most known slang of boricua

The name of Boricua and Borinqueos came from the islands original name of Boriken meaning Land of the Brave People This name was created by the Taino Arawak people who were highly advanced Taino Arawak ancestors age back to 4000 BC

The toothbrush is a tool to clean teeth The toothbrush has a small brush at the end of a handle Toothpaste which often contains fluoride is commonly added to a toothbrush to help clean the teeth Both toothpaste and toothbrushes come in many different colours Toothpastes can also come in many different flavours Nice toothbrushes can make toothbrushing fun and help your child on the way to perfect oral health

Toothbrushes were first invented by a prisoner Before anyone had thought of a toothbrush people kept their teeth clean by chewing on a stick until one end got soft and frayed like a brush Sometimes they dipped a finger in chalk or salt and then rubbed their teeth Toothpicks were another way to take care of teeth and toothpicks were very fancy then They were made of gold or jewels and people would stick them in their hats or hang them on necklaces when they were not using them The first brushes came from China where the Chinese made them out of hairs pulled from the back of wild hogs The invention of the toothbrush as we know it came from Joseph Addis He worked on the toothbrush while he was in jail First he saved a bone from one of his meals and poked some holes in it The prison guard gave him some broken wikt linkbristlebristles Joseph tied the bristles into little bundles cut them to make them even put glue on the ends and stuffed them into the holes

The word toothbrush came from the two parts of the word first a noun and then a verb or noun The action of brushing teeth with a toothbrush is basically the use of the invention of John Addis

Homeostasis is when an organism keeps its bodily conditions in a stable condition It does so by regulating its inner equilibrium In living things the study of how they keep in a stable condition if called physiology

Examples of homeostasis

In mammals the main organs involved with homeostasis are

A pulmonary embolism is a clot of material that blocks blood from getting to the lungs It most often is caused by a blood clot but it can also be caused by clumped cancer cells fat bone or rarely amniotic fluid affecting mothers during birth

A pulmonary embolism causes sudden shortness of breath rapid breathing chest pain coughing up blood and sexual dysfunction People who suffered from pulmonary embolism are more likely to suffer from premature ejaculation In rare cases it can cause rapid heart beat low blood pressure shock and death

Pulmonary embolisms are separated into two categories Acute and Chronic Acute Pulmonary Embolisms are normally sudden while Chronic Pulmonary Embolisms are not

It is most often treated with anticoagulants making it so the blood can no longer clot

A toilet is where most people get rid of bodily waste into water where it will then be flushed into a sewage system A room that has a toilet in it can be called a restroom or a bathroom in the United States In other places it may be called the toilet or the Water Closet 

Almost all modern buildings have at least one toilet In the home a toilet may or may not be in the same room as a shower or a bathtub Some toilets are outside in an outhouse

A public toilet may or may not cost money to use Toilets that cost money are called pay toilets

Public bathrooms often have many toilets with walls between them This makes areas called stalls or cubicles Bathrooms for men often also have separate urinals Urinals can either be on the wall for a single user or a basin or trough for many men to use at the same time Urinals on walls sometimes have small walls or dividers for privacy reasons

Outdoor public toilets are a form of street furniture These toilets are in individual cubicles Some are simple and have little or no plumbing Others are less simple and some toilets even clean themselves after every use

Some toilet cubicles are mobile and can be put in place where and when they are needed These toilets are called portable toilets Portable toilets are commonly used at large outdoor events like concerts festivals or carnivals 

Stegosaurus was a type of plant eating dinosaur which lived in what is now western North America

Stegosaurus lived in the Upper Jurassic period around 155 to 145 million years ago It is one of the most easily recognized dinosaurs with its distinctive double row of kite shaped plates on its back and the long spikes on its tail The armor was necessary as it lived with such meat eaters as Allosaurus and Ceratosaurus

Stegosaurus was originally named by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1877 from fossils found near Morrison Colorado These first bones became the first species of Stegosaur named Stegosaurus armatus

Several different Stegosaurus species have been found

Stegosaurus was the largest stegosaur reaching up to 12 m in length and weighing up to 5000 kg However 7 to 9 m was a more usual length

The skull of Stegosaurus was long and narrow Because of its short front legs its head was close to the ground probably no higher than 1 m It ate low growing plants because of this It had no front teeth but it did have a horn covered beak Stegosaurian chewing teeth were small and triangular and did little grinding as they lacked wear surfaces

Unlike most dinosaurs it did not have a lacuna in its skull between the nose and eye 

It has often been said that the Stegosaurus brain was the size of a walnut Actually it had a brain several times the size of a walnut The bundle of nerves near the base of the tail that controlled reflexes in the back of the body was larger than the brain and is sometimes said to be a second brain This is not accurate

Stegosaurus had very short forelimbs in relation to its hind legs The back legs each had three short toes while the front legs had five toes All four limbs were supported by pads behind the toes

Stegosaurus was a member of the Thyreophora or armored dinosaurs a family of dinosaurs which includes the ankylosaurs

Stegosaurus has been declared the State Dinosaur of Colorado It has also appeared in many movies and TV shows

Psittacosis is a bacterial disease that can be caught from birds such as parrots pigeons and parakeets The disease is not common with only 50 reported cases in the United States each year

Psittacosis usually gives flu like symptoms such as fevers chills headaches muscle aches and a dry cough The disease can also look like pneumonia on an x ray In rare cases Psittacosis can cause endocarditis  swelling of joints and swelling of the cornea 

Psittacosis can be easily treated with antibiotics especially with Tetracycline The disease rarely kills people with only 1 of those who get the disease dying

Gregorian chant is an important form of plainchant used mainly in the Roman Catholic Church With plainchant all people sing the same music in unison most of the time Sometimes there is a second part called organum which often uses the same melody but at an interval This interval is often a fourth or a fifth 

Gregorian chant developed mainly in western and central Europe during the 9th and 10th centuries but people wrote new songs and changed the old ones later Many people believe an old story which says that Pope Gregory the Great wrote the songs Most people who study the history of music believe that kings such as Charlemagne brought music from Rome to their kingdoms in France and Germany When Charlemagnes people sang these songs they changed the songs This new music became Gregorian chant

Usually men and boys sang Gregorian chant in churches and holy women and men sang Gregorian chants in their daily prayers In Roman Catholic churches prayers and songs follow an order called the Roman Rite Gregorian chant is the music used in the Mass and the Office of the Roman Rite The Mass is the part of the Roman Rite where Catholics share bread and drink together The Office is the part of the Roman Rite where holy men and women pray at special times every day In the past people sang different songs in parts of Europe but Gregorian chant replaced almost all of them Although the Roman Catholic Church no longer requires people to sing Gregorian chants it still says that Gregorian chant is the best music for prayer

Christians have sung songs without music since the earliest days of the Church Before the mid 1990s many people believed that the Jewish songs called the Psalms which are in both the Jewish and Christian Bible were an important part of early Christian music and prayer People who study the history of music and religion no longer believe this because most early Christian songs were not from the Psalms and Jews did not sing Psalms for many centuries after their most important holy place the Second Temple was destroyed in the year 70 However some parts of Jewish music and prayer ended up later in Gregorian chant The organized order of prayers called canonical hours come from Jewish tradition The words amen and alleluia come from the Hebrew language of the Jews The prayer santus sanctus sanctus which means holy holy holy comes from the Jewish prayer kadosh kadosh kadosh

The New Testament tells how Jesus and his friends sang together When they had sung the hymn they went out to the Mount of Olives Other writers from those early centuries such as Pope Clement I also said that Christians sang religious songs but they dont tell us what the music sounded like The Oxyrhynchus hymn a 3rd century song from Greece has lasted with written musical notes we do not know if this song is connected to plainchant

The sorts of songs which Catholics later sang in the Roman Rite started to appear in the 3rd century The Apostolic Tradition a book about Christian traditions in early Rome says that Christians sang Alleluia in early holy meals called agape feasts Chants of the Office started in the early 4th century when holy men in the deserts started the tradition of singing all 150 psalms every week Sometime around 375 Christians in Eastern Europe started singing religious songs back and forth between two groups in 386 St Ambrose brought this tradition to Western Europe Singing back and forth is called antiphonal singing

Most people think that the liturgy of the Roman Mass was put together during the 7th century In 785 786 Pope Hadrian I sent some Roman chants to the court of Charlemagne Later this music developed into the system of eight modes This music together with some new chants to complete the liturgical year became known as Gregorian This chant was probably named after Pope Gregory the Great 

When Charlemagne had become Holy Roman Emperor he made everyone in Europe use this Gregorian chant By the 12th and 13th centuries all other kinds of chant disappeared even the Roman form

Gregorian chants are divided into three types based on the number of notes sung to each syllable Syllabic chants mostly have one note per syllable In neumatic chants there are mostly two or three notes per syllable while melismatic chants have lots of notes for one syllable Some of the chants are recitative and some are free melody When two choirs stand in different parts of the church and sing alternately these are called Antiphonal chants Responsorial chants are ones with a refrain sung by the choir which alternate with a psalm verse sung by a soloist

Gregorian chant used the eight modes which came from the Byzantine chants They were written down in a special musical notation called neumes These neumes do not show the exact rhythms so that we cannot always be sure of the way they were sung The rhythm was probably quite free and flexible There were certainly no bar lines and regular beat The chant was normally sung by men Women only sang in convents and even then they could not sing in all the services 

Gregorian chant was a big influence on polyphonic music in the Middle Ages and Renaissance When the original plainsong melody was made to be the bottom part it became known as cantus firmus Cantus firmus became a very important part of musical composition in the Renaissance

An executable is a computer program written by a programmer and compiled by a compiler When it is run it executes the actions it was programmed to 

An example of a compiler is the GNU C Compiler or GCC for short It reads in program code written in the C programming language and converts it into binary machine code called an executable so computers can understand it On Microsoft Windows these files end with exe To humans these files are hard to read Macs use other file extensions

Windows NT is a series of Microsofts Windows operating systems that were the first to use their new NT core That meant it had a brand new core to do more things than the MS DOS based one that they used in older versions of Windows Also it was more secure and crashed less

Versions of Windows NT are Windows NT 31 NT 351 NT 4 Windows 2000 Windows XP Windows Vista and Windows 7

A file extension is a way of showing the type of a computer file and a clue to what program it should be opened with File extensions are usually three letters long and come after the name of the file

Lagomorpha is a mammal order It includes pikas rabbits and hares Although the lagomorphs look like rodents they are actually not because they have four incisors on the upper jaw not two like in rodents and they eat plants not meat too like rodents They were classified under rodents until the 20th century They are divided into two families Leporidae hares and rabbits and Ochotonidae the pikas 

Lupus erythematosus also called Lupus is a disease It is chronic which means it does not go away The Immune system is made up of white blood cells in your body that fight off disease Lupus makes these white blood cells think that the healthy cells of the body around them are diseased so they end up attacking healthy parts of the body Lupus can be deadly Lupus causes swelling and tissue damage and can attack any part of the body It most commonly affects the heart joints skin lungs blood vessels kidneys and the brainnervous system Some symptoms include fatigue fever with no cause hair loss mouth sores sensitivity to sunlight a skin disease and even Raynauds syndrome There is treatment for Lupus called immunosuppression which is medicine that stops the white blood cells from damaging healthy cells for a while After a while this medicine wears off and then the white blood cells go back to hurting healthy parts of the body again For the disease of Lupus there is no cure that stops the white blood cells from attacking healthy parts of the body forever but doctors are not giving up on finding a cure

Lupus takes its name from the Latin word Lupus meaning wolf This is because a Lupus caused rash on a persons face makes the persons face look like the face of a wolf In the United States alone there may be 270000 to 15 million people with Lupus Worldwide it is estimated that over 5 million people living with LupusfactdateApril 2009 The disease mainly affects young women but men can be affected as well

Hiragana are part of the Japanese writing system Japanese writing normally consists of kanji which are used for the main words in a sentence and hiragana which are used for the little words that make up the grammar Hiragana is also used for the endings of some of the words 

Hiragana is a syllabary which means that each hiragana character stands for a syllable It is therefore different from a language such as English which uses an alphabet in which most of the letters stand for one bit of sound There is also another syllabary called katakana which is mostly used for foreign words and names The two kana systems are quite easy to learn but kanji takes years of practice In contrast the kana systems can be learnt in two weeks

In the past hiragana was considered as womens writing while men wrote in kanji Since kanji suit well in Chinese language but poorly in Japanese language it was the women who wrote the first Japanese books poems and songs Later the Buddhist clerics such as Rennyo wrote in hiragana to make the religious message easy to understand and everyone to read

Sometimes the whole of a text may be written in hiragana to make it easy This would be used in books for young children or for students starting to learn Japanese or when writing the lyrics for songs underneath the music where it is important to show how the words fit the music Some rare or strange kanji may also have so called furigana characters above it They are hiragana which show how the kanji is to be pronounced

In Hiragana each character is either a vowel a consonant followed by a vowel or at the end of a syllable an n although sometimes this sounds more like an m or ng

As an example of how the grammatical endings are used we can take the verb to eat which is Here the main part of the word eat is the kanji  The other two syllables be ru are in hiragana To say I ate or you ate etc you would say tabemashita written

The main hiragana characters are shown in this table 

Notice that the sound hu is unknown in Japanese so is pronounced fu with an f which is blown lightly

To write the voiced sounds for g d z and b two little lines called a dakuten are added after a character starting with the unvoiced sounds k t s and h A circle is added after a h for the sound p For example gives the sound ha gives the sound ba gives the sound pa

Sometimes when words are joined together to make compound words a sound changes from unvoiced to voiced For example hana  chi becomes  hanaji

Some Japanese syllables which have sliding sounds add a small version of the hiragana for ya yu or yo This is called yon For example sha sounds like shiya so densha is written A small tsu called a sokuon shows a doubled consonant Nippon is written  Without the small tsu the first syllable would sound like the word knee 

A student starting to learn to write Japanese can start with hiragana or with katakana Hiragana is the basis of learning Japanese script However for someone who is about to visit Japan and just wants to be able to recognize a few words katakana will be more useful as it will help to read many of the road signs shop names and the names of things on restaurant menus

Kuomintang is a political party in Republic of China It was in China until 1949 when Communists captured China Kuomintang means Nationalist Party

Chiang Kai shek was a political leader born in Xikou on October 31 1887 He led the Republic of China from 1930 to 1949 on mainland China until he was overthrown by Mao Zedong He then fled to Taiwan where he ruled from 1950 until his death in 1975 although his government was still officially called the Republic of China

We can use physics and mathematics to understand how strongly gravity affects something if we know enough about that thing mainly how much weight it has This way we can understand how objects act on Earth

However astrophysicists have learned that the way things in deep space behave is different

Many scientists have tried to understand why the rules are different in deep space One idea is that we do not really understand gravity as well as we think we do Another idea which many think is more likely is that there is something called dark matter If you do calculations on the things in deep space with extra mass then the rules work there too So the idea is that there is more matter  stuff  in the universe than we thought This is called dark matter because we can not see it but if we assume the rules are right then it must exist

Because dark matter does not seem to give off or reflect light x rays or any other radiation the instruments which can find normal matter are unable to find dark matter It seems that dark matter is not made of the same thing as the matter we see everyday on Earth The only way we can tell it is there is by how it affects things we can see by gravity

In 2006 a group of scientists claimed they had found a way to observe dark matter Since dark matter is supposedly very different from normal matter it is expected to act differently They observed two clusters of galaxies that had crashed into each other at high speed normal matter would have got stuck behind after the collision while dark matter would not By measuring gravity they were able to detect what looks like two clouds of dark matter with a cloud of normal matter in between them

Katakana is the way that some of the words are written in Japanese It is much easier to read than the kanji which has to be learned word by word because once the 46 katakana symbols have been learned the reader knows how to pronounce them

Katakana and hiragana are both syllabaries In English we use the letters of the alphabet In most words each letter stands for a bit of sound In a syllabary each symbol stands for a syllable For example in English we write Wagamama each of the eight letters standing for a sound W a g a m a m a But if the word Wagamama is divided into syllables there are four syllables Wa ga ma ma In Katakana it is written with four symbols 

Hiragana works in the same way but the symbols are mostly different Katakana is perhaps a little easier to learn than Hiragana because the symbols are simpler and more squared off cndateJanuary 2012 Together Katakana and Hiragana are called Kana

This is a table of the basic katakana strokes The first chart shows the basic katakana 

From the first table it can be seen that there are 46 basic characters Diphthongs have to be written with an extra symbol in small print For example the sound mu in our word music sounds like myu so it is written So the word musical is written A long vowel is shown in katakana by a kind of dash called a choon

Katakana is used to write words which have been borrowed from other languages or to write foreign names and names of countries For example America is written 

It is not always easy for us to recognize these words because the Japanese language does not have some of the sounds that we do in English This means that Japanese have to find other ways to pronounce and write the word For example the word coffee is written Sometimes the word is shortened as well television is written 

Sometimes it is impossible to show the difference between two foreign words eg could spell either the name Lara or Lala The Japanese have just one sound which is somewhere between our r and l

In the Japanese language a consonant is always followed by a vowel Words or syllables cannot end in a consonant so the Japanese put in an extra vowel Ski becomes suki and a musical as we have seen becomes myuujikaru

Katakana are also used for onomatopoeic words like ding or for making words look important or for scientific names such as the names of birds Sometimes sentences in books or cartoons may be written in katakana to show that someone is supposed to be speaking with a foreign accent It is often used to write the names of Japanese companies ie Suzuki is written and Toyota is written 

A small tsu called a sokuon shows what we would write as a double consonant eg the English word bed is used in Japanese for a western style bed It is pronounced beddo and written The makes the e vowel short

Learning to read the katakana characters is useful for reading some of the signs in Japan or items on the restaurant menus

Japanese sentences are usually written in a mixture of katakana hiragana and kanji eg Here amerika is written in katakana the ending jin is kanji and desu is in hiragana

A comb is a tool used to care for hair or other fibers It has small pieces sticking out of a main frame these are called teeth A comb is usually flat

Humans have been using combs as a tool for a long time at least for 5000 years Combs are used by humans to separate tangled hairs to keep their hair clean and to style their hair They are also used as a decoration for hair

Combs are used in the making of thread from fibers like wool or cotton Combing makes all the fibres point the same way so a thread can be spun

The first use of the comb was about 5000 years ago In fact different kind of versions of the comb have been found throughout history by archaeologists The ancient Egyptians carved out combs In ancient China combs were worn as hair decorations and accessories Over time combs have become into tools for taking care of hair Today there are hundreds of different kinds of combs

Combs can be used to fix stray hairs and untangle wet hair Another common use for the comb is to make hair be put in one position before tying it up Combs may also be used to part hair for coloring conditioning and braiding Combs can also be worn as accessories that hold hair up in a special style

Perfume is a liquid that gives people and products a good smell

Long time ago perfume was made for Toilet water and diaria But recently perfume is made for pleasure fashion trend etc Both young people and old people use and enjoy this smell

Perfume smells more when temperature is warmer So people put it on the neck wrist and back of the knee because these parts are warmer Perfumes smells change Ten minutes after putting on perfume we call this smell TOP NOTE twenty minutes is MIDDLE NOTE after this time is called LAST NOTE Speed and the way that the smell changes depends on each perfume

In Asian countries perfume is known as a part of cosmetic but not so Europe and America because Asian like nutural smells due to cultural things Result of this use of perfume is not so high Popularity goods are made in foreign country Between 16th century and 19th century European believed bathing is bad for health so bathing was not common Therefore perfume is developed to remove body smell To make a perfume alcohol is needed So before finding alcohol people used oil and pomade First perfume is made in Hungary and used in court After that perfume was developed in Italy Renaissance period and run over the Europe 

The synonym of Perfume is essencegood smell or flavorAll thing have more or less some different perfumeand most interesting thing is that human being also have hisher own unique perfumeif there are 6oo corer of people in the world than they all have the 600 corer types of perfume

The Magna Carta was a document signed by John of England and his barons after a meeting at Runnymede Surrey in 1215

Magna Carta is one of the most celebrated documents in English history It solved at the time a conflict between King John and his main men the barons and bishops It had great influence on later English law In the longer term it is recognised as a cornerstone of the idea of the liberty of citizens

Magna Carta contains 63 clauses written in Latin on parchment Only three of the original clauses in Magna Carta are still law today One defends the freedom and rights of the English Church another confirms the liberties and customs of London and other towns This clause is the main reason the Carta is still famous

This clause limits the power of rulers and introduces the idea of lawful process and the idea of a jury

The origin is in the mediaeval feudal system in which the Kings word was law Dispute grew between the barons and bishops and King John over taxes and disputes with the Pope 

The barons chose their time to put John under pressure John had lost a battle against the French been excommunicated by the Pope and feared civil war at home He met the barons at Runnymede 20 miles south west of London in June 1215 The negotiation was managed by Johns half brother William Longspe and Elias of Dereham steward to the Archbishop of Canterbury Stephen Langton 

The content of the Carta was designed to re balance power between the King and his subjects but especially between John and the barons When King John set his seal on Magna Carta he conceded the fundamental principle that even as king he was not above the law So when King John put his seal to the Carta on 15 June 1215 that meant kings would not have as much power as before The Carta also laid down rules of inheritance and that convictions required some kind of official process It stated that people rights not to be unlawfully imprisoned In other words the king is bound to rule within the law 

Thirteen original copies of the Carta were made and distributed Only four survive today The four copies are in The British Library Lincoln Castle and Salisbury Cathedral In 2009 UNESCO recognised it in its Memory of the World register

The Magna Carta led to the constitutional rule of today It was also an influence on the American Constitution and to the Bill of Rights The Magna Carta was sent out again in 1220 by Henry III

A catapult is a type of machine used as a weapon to shoot rocks or other things that would cause damage to something else Catapults use weights and levers to send the rocks or other things into the air They are simpler than other modern weapons and not useful in modern warfare Catapults were common in the past especially the Middle Ages Nowadays catapults are used to study old weapons or try using them for experience

Sometimes instead of rocks pitch or hot tar would be thrown to set the target on fire 

Often catapults were set on higher ground or on castle towers to let them shoot farther They were also used to shoot rocks to break castle walls

The Roman Empier created the catapult and used them in later battles with Italy

A minuet is a dance which was popular in the 18th and 19th centuries in France It was danced by the aristocracy especially at the court of King Louis XIV

Sometimes the French spelling menuet is used or the Italian minuetto It was a moderate or slow dance There were always three beats in a bar

Composers liked the music of the minuet and often wrote them just as pieces of music for a keyboard or other instruments Composers like Bach and Handel included them in their suites Lully started to put them in his operas often in pairs Minuet I Minuet II then Minuet I repeated Often the second minuet would be played by three instruments so it was called a trio

In the Classical music period the minuet and trio were used in symphonies and sonatas They usually formed the third movement of a four movement work Haydn Mozart and Beethoven all wrote minuets and trios Gradually the minuets became faster so that they were called scherzos By the 19th century the waltz had become fashionable among the new middle class The polite minuet went out of fashion

A Scherzo is a piece of music which is quite fast In the 19th century Romantic composers started to write scherzos in their symphonies and sonatas instead of the traditional minuets They are similar to a minuet always with three beats in a bar but they are faster and less polite Some composers like Chopin and Brahms wrote scherzos as separate pieces for the piano

Chordata is a phylum of animals which have a notochord The group includes vertebrates with some closely related invertebrates

Note Lines show likely evolutionary relationships Extinct groups are marked with a Extinct animals are ones that are not around anymore but around in the past 

A long standing theory is that in transformed larvae of sea squirts lies the origin of chordates Tunicates are sessile but their larvae are mobile and have some features found in early vertebrates The process of paedomorphosis where juvenile features are retained in the adult is the proposed mechanism Genome analysis does show that the tunicates are the closest living relatives of vertebrates

Biological classification is how biologists group organisms 

The standard classification has its root in the work of Carolus Linnaeus who grouped species according to shared physical characteristics He invented the idea of giving each animal or plant two names a genus and a species We are described as Homo sapiens It is always printed in italics like that and no other way 

These groupings have been revised to fit the Darwinian principle of common descent Molecular evolution studies which use DNA sequence analysis as data has driven many recent revisions and will continue to do so Biological classification is a product of taxonomy

The similarity between organisms placed in the same group or taxon is not arbitrary It is a result of shared descent from their nearest common ancestor So the important attributes or traits for biological classification are those which are homologous That means they are inherited from common ancestors

Homologous traits are separated from traits that are analogous Thus birds and bats both have the power of flight but this is not used to classify them into a taxon because it is not inherited from a common ancestor

In spite of all the other differences between them the fact that bats and whales both feed their young on milk is one of the features used to classify both as mammals since it was inherited from a common ancestor

When people started naming species Latin was the language most widely used around the world So all species names are still Latin names Scientists used to write the official description of each new species in Latin as well Years ago zoologist switched from Latin to English for the description of animals On January 1 2012 the International Botanical Congress switched to English for describing new plant species

Taxa above the genus level are often given names based on the main genus with a standard termination The terminations used in forming these names depend on the kingdom and sometimes the phylum and class as set out in the table below

An important alternative approach to biological classification is cladism This approach is based on the branching tree of evolution It uses characters to decide on the branches of the taxonomy

Kingdom is the highest rank normally used in the biological taxonomy of all organisms Each kingdom is split into phyla

There are 5 kingdoms in taxonomy Every living thing comes under one of these 5 kingdoms and some symbionts such as lichen come under two They are

Sometimes entries in the table which are next to each other do not match perfectly For example Haeckel placed the red algae and blue green algae in his Plantae but in modern classifications they are considered protists and bacteria respectively However despite this and other failures of equivalence the table gives a useful simplification

A class is a rank used in the biological taxonomy of all organisms Each class is split into orders There are multiple classes in each phylum Class is come in the mnemonic or a saying to help a person remember something Keep People Coming Over For Great Spaghetti

An order is a rank used in the biological taxonomy of all organisms Each order is split into families There are many orders in each class Order is over in the mnemonic or a saying to help a person remember something King Phillip Came Over For Great Spaghetti

Some orders such as the pigeons have only one family

A family is a rank in the biological taxonomy of all organisms Each family is split into Genera the plural for genus There are multiple families in each order Usually the name of the family ends with a idae for animals and aceae for plants There are also subfamilies and superfamilies Subfamilies end with inae

In Latin family is familia 

For example walnuts and hickories both belong to the walnut Family

Digestion is the way that an organism changes a substance into nutrients This happens in the gastrointestinal system Humans start digesting food in the mouth Food is chewed by the teeth Food is swallowed which means it goes through the oesophagus It goes into the stomach where it is mixed with acid 

After we swallow food it travels down a muscular tube to the stomach There it is mashed into a mixture like soup The mixture passes into the small intestine where tiny bits of food pass into the bloodstream The food that is still left goes into the large intestine Finally waste products leave the body Digestion usually takes about 18 hours Food stays in the stomach for about three hours If uncoiled the small intestine would be about six meters long Most digestive tracts are about as long as a bus

Food slowly enters the small intestine from the stomach This is where nutrients are taken into the blood It then enters the large intestine Water is taken away from it The food that is left is called feces The feces are stored in the rectum until it can leave the body through the anus

Sight is one of the senses Having sight means to be able to see Seeing gives animals knowledge of the world Some simple animals can only tell light from dark but with vertebrates the visual system is able to form images

Light enters the animals eyes and a part of the eye called the lens sends information from the light to the back part of the eye called the retina The retina is composed of light sensitive cells which fire a signal down the optic nerve when light hits the cell The optic nerve is a bundle of nerve fibres from all over the retina

When the information from the light leaves the retina it goes to the brain It travels along the optic chiasma until it reaches the optic cortex at the rear of the brain The information is then processed to find out the shapes and colours of objects From that and from memory it can tell of what kind the object is For example it can somehow tell a tree from a house The path on which this kind of information flows is called ventral stream 

The brain can also tell where objects are For example it can tell how far away an object is This is needed when catching a ball The path on which this kind of information flows is called dorsal stream

The Ankylosaurus was a type of armoured dinosaur It was the largest of its type with a maximum size of 9 metres 

The body was broad and low slung and covered in armour Carnivores attacking from above would find no weak points and the animal could defend itself by using its clubbed tail

Ankylosaurus was a herbivore or plant eater Because there was no grass in the dinosaur times the Ankylosaurus probably ate ferns and low shrubs

The most obvious feature of Ankylosaurus is its armour consisting of massive knobs and plates of bone known as osteoderms or bony scutes embedded in the skin Osteoderms are also found in the skin of crocodiles armadillos and some lizards The bone was probably overlain by a tough horny layer of keratin 

These osteoderms ranged greatly in size from wide flat plates to small round nodules The plates were aligned in regular horizontal rows down the animals neck back and hips with the many smaller nodules protecting the areas between the large plates Smaller plates may have been arranged on the limbs and tail Compared to the slightly more ancient ankylosaurid Euoplocephalus the plates of Ankylosaurus were smooth in texture without the high keels found on the armor of the contemporaneous nodosaurid Edmontonia A row of flat triangular spikes may have protruded laterally along each side of the tail Tough rounded scales protected the top of the skull while four large pyramidal horns projected outwards from its rear corners

Underneath it was covered by normal skin but to get at it the carnivore would have to turn over an animal weighing up to 6000 kgms

An air gun is a gun which uses gas to fire a projectile instead of burning gunpowder that an ordinary gun uses 

The oldest air guns used a spring to compress air in a tube When the gun was fired the air was released The only way for the air to go was by pushing the pellet out A spring loaded gun can only fire one shot before the spring has to be reset Newer guns use air or another gas in a small cartridge these guns can fire many more shots before the cartridge needs to be changed or refilled

The projectile for an air gun is usually a pellet Some guns of this sort fire small round pellets call bbs Some people think this means ball bearing but it does not The letters bb stood for a size of shot that was used to make shotgun cartridges This was used in the first bb guns

The most popular calibres for air weapons are frac412 mm frac512 In many countries there are strict rules that limit the sales of air guns so not everyone can have one 

They are not as powerful as other guns but they can still kill people

Blackmail means threatening to say something bad about someone unless that person pays some money

If someone has committed a crime another person might blackmail them The blackmailer might for example say that if the criminal does not give them a large amount of money they will tell the police

A blackmailer may threaten to say something embarrassing about someone unless they hand over a sum of money It may be something about a sexual relation they are having that they do not want everyone to know about

Sometimes a business may blackmail another business They might threaten to harm that business in some way unless money is paid

Blackmail started on the borders of England and Scotland Blackmail was the money left out by landowners in England so that raiders from Scotland did not steal their animals or damage the property

Bribery means offering something to a person in return for some favour which is bad in some way

The money that is offered is called a bribe and the verb is to bribe

It is sometimes difficult to decide whether something is a bribe or just a reward If a father pays his son for washing the car this is just a reward or payment But if a parent pays a child for eating up its dinner this might be thought of as a bribe because most people would think this was not right

Bribery is usually about more serious cases in which a person offers money so that he does not get into trouble If a motorist is caught speeding by a policeman and he offers the policeman money or a bottle of vodka to persuade him not to fine him this is bribery If someone wants to take something into a country that they are not allowed to take in they might offer the customs officer a bribe to persuade him to let them through

Examples such as these are clearly illegal and would almost never happen in many Western countries However in some parts of the world bribery is normal and it is difficult to do anything without offering bribes

Bribery in some form is quite common in business in many parts of the world Giving business people presents in the hope that they will want to do business with you may just seem like good manners at times but in some cases it may seem more like bribery

People who are found to be taking bribes can sometimes lose their jobs In some cases bribery is against the law

Psychiatry is a part of medicine that studies diagnoses and treats mental illnesses and abnormal behaviours and conditions that cause problems and make life difficult for people The people who practice psychiatry and treat others who have psychiatric problems are called psychiatrists 

Psychiatrists can prescribe medications to their patients to help emotional and behavioral problems psychologists can only prescribe medication in Louisiana and New Mexico which allows properly trained clinical psychologists to prescribe medication with some limits This is because of laws made by the government that say only medical doctors can prescribe

Psychiatrists spend many years learning about how the body and the brain work Psychiatrists must learn about all kinds of illnesses Sometimes a disease in the body causes the brain to work poorly Cancer in the Pancreas causes depression Blood sugar problems in Diabetes Mellitus can cause a bad temper These are only two examples 

Psychiatrists spend many years learning how medications can help the brain work better Psychiatrists also learn how medications sometimes cause problems to the brain Sometimes psychologists send their patients to a psychiatrist if the patient seems to have a problem that medicine might help The patient should continue to see the psychologist 

In the 1950s the first medicine to help patients with Bipolar disorder was discovered This was Lithium a type of metal in a powder form A bit later the first medicine for Psychosis was discovered Later medicines to calm people to end depression to help feelings remain the same each day were discovered

Medicine for Mental Illness does not cure Some of the medicines try to get brain chemicals to be the amounts they are in normal people Other medicines slow down how fast the brain works so people with rapid thoughts can be in control of what they think and how they behave When the medicines are stopped symptoms often come back

The best known Psychiatrist is Sigmund Freud a medical doctor who was trained in Neurology He became certain that hidden thoughts in the brain could cause physical symptoms and strange behavior in some people He believed that human behavior was not all caused by the brain but by things that happened to people when they were babies and young children His research of this theory the idea he had led him to create talking therapy psychoanalysis where he tried to figure out what could cause the mind to do things like this 

He thought that his figuring things out and telling the patients what had caused the behavior would cure the patient Unfortunately it usually made no lasting changes This is why psychiatrists have gradually figured out many other ways of helping their patients

Since the medications for mental illness were first discovered there have been tools to understand why the mentally ill behave and think in ways that make it not easy for them to live Doctors do this by studying the brain as directly as they can 

This field of medicine is called NeuroPsychiatry The medical doctors who work in the field are called NeuroPsychiatrists They hope someday to really permanently cure or fix mental illness by finding ways to change the brain forever In the meantime they try to find ways to help by finding better medications

The science of Psychology is studies the way people behave and change Psychologists apply this what is found to make new ways of helping people change how they behave Talking therapy and applied psychology were the first important ways of helping people with some problems of regular life Some kinds of Mental illness can be helped some this way but some kinds cannot be helped They need medicines instead then sometimes a psychologist can help the patient a great deal

Pavia is a city in northern Italy Pavia is in the Lombardy Region with 71486 people living in it It is a very old historical city It is 30 km south of Milan

The town of Pavia was a big city and a special military area for the Romans

Here in 476 Odoacer won against Flavius Orestes after a long war To make the city pay for helping his enemy Odoacer completely ruined Pavia but Orestes was able to escape to a city called Piacenza where Odoacer followed and killed him and removed from the throne his son Romulus Augustus This is often thought of as the end of the Western Roman Empire A late name of the city in Latin was Papia which developed to the Italian name Pavia Sometimes its called Ticinum Papia using both Latin names After the Lombards conquest Pavia became the capital of their kingdom During the Rule of the Dukes it was ruled by Zaban It continued to act as the administrative centre of the kingdom but by the reign of Desiderius it had fallen to a first rate defensive work and Charlemagne took it in the Siege of Pavia assuming the kingship of the Lombards Pavia remained the capital of the Italian Kingdom and the centre of royal coronations until the diminution of imperial authority there in the twelfth century In the 12th century Pavia acquired the status of a self governing commune In the political division between Guelphs and Ghibellines that characterizes the Italian Middle Ages Pavia was traditionally Ghibelline a position that was as much supported by the rivalry with Milan as it was a mark of the defiance of the Emperor that led the Lombard League against the emperor Frederick Barbarossa who was attempting to reassert long dormant Imperial influence over Italy

In the time after that Pavia was an important and busy town Under the Treaty of Pavia Emperor Louis IV gave the Palatinate to his brother during his stay in Italy Pavia held out against the domination of Milan finally yielding to the Visconti family rulers of that city in 1359 under the Visconti Pavia became an intellectual and artistic centre being the seat from 1361 of the University of Pavia founded around the nucleus of the old school of law which attracted students from many countries The Battle of Pavia marks a watershed in the citys fortunes since by that time the former cleavage between the supporters of the Pope and those of the Holy Roman Emperor had shifted to one between a French party and a party supporting the Emperor and King of Spain Charles V Thus during the Valois Habsburg Italian Wars Pavia was naturally on the Imperial side The defeat and capture of king Francis I of France during the battle ushered in a period of Spanish occupation which lasted until 1713 Pavia was then ruled by the Austrians until 1796 when it was occupied by the French army under Napoleon In 1815 it again passed under Austrian administration until the Second War of Italian Independence and the unification of Italy one year later

The history of Perugia goes back to the Roman Empire However major parts of the city have been destroyed and rebuilt due to the effects of many wars and of earthquakes in the mid 19th century In recent decades the city has been known as a university town with the University of Perugia the University for Foreigners and some smaller colleges also There are annual festivals and events the Eurochocolate Festival the Umbria Jazz Festival and the International Journalism Festival

Perugia is a well known artistic center of Italy The famous painter Pietro Vannucci nicknamed Perugino was a native of Citt della Pieve near Perugia He decorated the local Sala del Cambio with a beautiful series of frescoes eight of his pictures can also be admired in the National Gallery of Umbria Perugino was the teacher of Raphael the great Renaissance artist who produced five paintings in Perugia and one fresco Another famous painter Pinturicchio lived in Perugia Galeazzo Alessi is the most famous architect from Perugia The city symbol is the griffin which can be seen in the form of plaques and statues on buildings around the city

Perugia was an Umbrian settlement but first appears in written history as Perusia one of the twelve confederate cities of Etruria It was first mentioned in Q Fabius Pictors account utilized by Livy of the expedition carried out against the Etruscan league by Fabius Maximus Rullianus in 310 or 309 BC At that time a thirty year indutiae was agreed upon however in 295 BC Perusia took part in the Third Samnite War and was reduced with Volsinii and Arretium to seek for peace in the following year

In 216 and 205 BC Perugia assisted Rome in the Second Punic War Little else is known until 41 40 BC when Lucius Antonius took refuge there in the Roman civil war between Mark Antony and Octavian Much of ancient Perugia was destroyed by Octavian after a long siege and its senators were sent to their death A number of lead bullets used by slingers have been found in and around the city The city was burnt we are told with the exception of the temples of Vulcan and Juno The huge Etruscan terrace walls naturally can hardly have suffered at all Afterward the town with the territory for a mile round was allowed to be occupied by whoever came It must have been rebuilt almost at once for several bases of statues exist inscribed with the words Augusto sacr Perusia restituta However the town did not become a colonia until 251 253 AD when it was resettled as Colonia Vibia Augusta Perusia under the emperor C Vibius Trebonianus Gallus

Perugia is hardly mentioned except by the geographers until it was the only city in Umbria to resist Totila who captured it and laid the city waste in 547 after a long siege apparently after the citys Byzantine garrison evacuated Negotiations with the besieging forces fell to the citys bishop Herculanus as representative of the townspeople Totila is said to have ordered the bishop to be flayed and beheaded St Herculanus later became the citys patron saint

In the Lombard period Perugia is spoken of as one of the principal cities of Tuscia In the 9th century with the consent of Charlemagne and Louis the Pious it passed under the popes but by the 11th century its commune was asserting itself and for many centuries the city continued to maintain an independent life warring against many of the neighbouring lands and cities Foligno Assisi Spoleto Todi Siena Arezzo etc In 1186 Henry VI Holy Roman Emperor rex romanorum and future emperor granted diplomatic recognition to the consular government of the city afterward Pope Innocent III whose major aim was to give state dignity to the dominions having been constituting the patrimony of St Peter acknowledged the validity of the imperial statement and recognized the established civic practices having the force of law

On various occasions the popes found asylum from the conflicts in Rome within its walls and it was the meeting place of five conclaves including those which elected Honorius III Clement IV Celestine V and Clement V the papal presence was characterized by a peace time rule between the internal rivalries But Perugia had no mind simply to serve the papal interests and never accepted papal sovereignty the city used to exercise a jurisdiction over the members of the clergy Also in 1282 Perugia was excommunicated due to a new military conflict against the Ghibellines regardless of a papal prohibition In the other hand side by side with the 13th century bronze griffin of Perugia above the door of the Palazzo dei Priori stands as a Guelphic emblem the lion Perugia remained loyal for the most part to the Guelph party in the struggles of Guelphs and Ghibellines However this dominant tendency was rather an anti Germanic and Italian political strategy The Angevin presence in Italy appeared offer a counterpoise to papal powers in 1319 Perugia declared the Angevin Saint Louis of Toulouse Protector of the citys sovereignty and of the Palazzo of its Priors and set his figure among the other patron saints above the rich doorway of the Palazzo dei Priori At the half of the 14th century Bartholus of Sassoferrato who was a renowned jurist asserted that Perugia was dependent upon neither imperial nor papal support In 1347 at the time of Rienzis unfortunate enterprise in reviving the Roman Republic Perugia sent ten ambassadors to pay him honour and when papal messengers sought to force it by foreign soldiers or to exact contributions they met with vigorous resistance which broke into open warfare with Pope Urban V in 1369 in 1370 the noble party reached an agreement signing the treaty of Bologna and Perugia was forced to accept a papal legate however the vicar general of the Papal States Grard du Puy Abbot of Marmoutier and nephew of Pope Gregory IX was expelled by a popular uprising in 1375 and his fortification of Porta Sole was razed to the ground

Civic peace was constantly disturbed in the 14th century by struggles between the party representing the people and the nobles After the assassination in 1398 of Biordo Michelotti who had made himself lord of Perugia the city became a pawn in the Italian Wars passing to Gian Galeazzo Visconti to Pope Boniface IX and to Ladislas of Naples before it settled into a period of sound governance under the Signoria of the condottiero Braccio da Montone who reached a concordance with the Papacy Following mutual atrocities of the Oddi and the Baglioni families power was at last concentrated in the Baglioni who though they had no legal position defied all other authority though their bloody internal squabbles culminated in a massacre 14 July 1500 Gian Paolo Baglioni was lured to Rome in 1520 and beheaded by Leo X and in 1540 Rodolfo who had slain a papal legate was defeated by Pier Luigi Farnese and the city captured and plundered by his soldiery was deprived of its privileges A citadel known as the Rocca Paolina after the name of Pope Paul III was built to the designs of Antonio da Sangallo the Younger ad coercendam Perusinorum audaciam

In 1797 the city was conquered by French troops On 4 February 1798 the Tiberina Republic was formed with Perugia as the capital and the French tricolour as flag In 1799 the Tiberina Republic merged to the Roman Republic

A ruler is an instrument of measurement Rulers measure length Length is how long or short something is Most rulers work by having numbers and little lines Rulers can also be used as a straight edge to draw lines with

In biology a mutation is a change in the genetic material This means changes to the DNA or to the chromosomes which carry the DNA All such changes are heritable unless they have lethal effects 

Mutations can happen for several reasons It can happen because of errors when meiosis produces the gamete cells Damage by radiation or by certain chemicals may cause mutations but they do occur occasionally at random 

Also by derivation an individual carrying the mutation may be called a mutant or a mutation So is the trait most obviously affected by the mutation 

When DNA is copied mistakes are sometimes made these are called mutations There are four main types of mutations

These terms are explained in the third diagram

Mutations may be bad for the organism or neutral or of benefit Sometimes mutations are fatal for the organism the protein made by the new DNA does not work at all and this causes the embryo to die On the other hand evolution is moved forward by mutations when the new version of the protein works better for the organism

Mutations are the ultimate source of variation upon which natural selection acts What happens is that some mutations affect the organisms ability to live and reproduce This is an important part of the theory of evolution The amount of heritable variation carried by a population can be huge and as a consequence natural populations have the capacity to change and adapt to conditions in their environment

The stingrays are a large suborder of the rays They are cartilaginous fishes related to sharks They are classified in the suborder Myliobatoidei of the order Myliobatiformes and consist of eight families 

Most stingrays have one or more barbed stings on the tail which is used only for self defense The stinger may reach a length of approximately 35 cm and its underside has two grooves with venom glands The stinger is covered with a thin layer of skin the integumentary sheath in which the venom is concentrated A few members of the suborder such as the manta rays and the porcupine ray have lost their stings

There are eight families in the stingray group They are

Stingrays are common in coastal tropical and subtropical marine waters throughout the world They also include species found in warmer temperate oceans and in the deep ocean 

The river stingrays and a number of whiptail stingrays live only in fresh water Most myliobatoids are demersal but some such as the pelagic stingray and the eagle rays are pelagic

Stingrays settle on the bottom while feeding often leaving only their eyes and tail visible Coral reefs are favorite feeding grounds and are usually shared with sharks during high tide

The flattened bodies of stingrays allow them to hide themselves Stingrays agitate the sand and hide beneath it Because their eyes are on top of their bodies and their mouths on the undersides stingrays cannot see their prey They use smell and electro receptors similar to those of sharks 

Stingrays feed mostly on molluscs crustaceans and occasionally on small fish Some stingrays mouths contain two powerful shell crushing plates while other species only have sucking mouthparts 

Stingrays are ovoviviparous bearing live young in litters of five to thirteen The female holds the embryos in the womb without a placenta Instead the embryos absorb nutrients from a yolk sac and after the sac is depleted the mother provides uterine milk

At the Sea Life London Aquarium 2 female stingrays have delivered 7 baby stingrays although the mothers have not been near a male for 2 years Rays have been known to store sperm and not give birth until they decide the timing is right

Like all fish stingrays sometimes get little parasites on their gills or body A cleaner fish helps the stingrays by eating those parasites it can get at

Sergei Vasilievich Rachmaninoff was a famous Russian composer and pianist He was born on April 1 1873 and died on March 28 1943 He was a Russian composer Because the Russian language uses a different alphabet his name is sometimes spelt in different ways in English Sergei Rachmaninoff is the way he spelt his own name when he was in the United States

He is thought of as one of the greatest pianists of the 20th century He could play extremely difficult music and had very large hands so that he could play chords with large stretches As a composer he is thought of as one of the great musicians who composed in the Romantic style although most of his adult life he lived in the 20th century His music has wonderful tunes that are easily remembered

Rachmaninoff was born in Semyonovo near Novgorod in the north west of Russia Members of his family were important people who had been in the service of the tsars of Russia His parents played the piano and arranged for him to have piano lessons in Saint Petersburg and then Moscow

While he was still a student he wrote a short opera called Aleko He also wrote some piano pieces including a Prelude in C sharp minor with loud heavy chords This piece became extremely famous and is still his most popular piano piece today He used to get fed up with people asking him to play the piece

Not all his music was well liked at first The critics thought his First Symphony was very bad This may have been because the orchestra did not play it very well but it made Rachmaninoff stop composing for a while After some years of feeling depressed he wrote his Second Piano Concerto which everybody liked very much

Rachmaninoff became happier He was allowed to marry Natalia after years of engagement during which the Russian Orthodox Church did not want them to be married The political conditions in Russia were bad so he lived in Germany and Italy for a time After the Russian Revolution of 1917 he left his country and never returned He had been very successful with his Third Piano Concerto in the United States so he went to live in the United States in 1918 Russia had become the Soviet Union and for many years Rachmaninoffs music was not allowed to be performed there This worried him a lot and he felt homesick He did not write very much music during the rest of his life in the United States One work that did become very popular was the Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini which he wrote in Switzerland in 1934

Rachmaninoffs piano music is mostly difficult to play He wrote many short pieces called preludes and some studies which are some of the hardest piano music written since Liszt As well as the Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini he wrote four piano concertos The Second and Third are very popular today as is his Second Symphony

He wrote some very beautiful choral music which includes a piece for choir and orchestra called The Bells and a very long religious work called the All Night Vigil

He wrote some chamber music including a cello sonata

There are several excellent recordings of Rachmaninoff playing his own music Most of these are available now on CD reissues

Grave was the word that was used to describe mass before the word kilogram was introduced Grave comes from the word gravity and was first used in 1793 in France The name kilogram was introduced in 1795 but was not the official word for mass until 1875

In order to have full consistency in the International System of Units many people think that the kilogram should be called something different Using the word kilogram creates a problem because it is a base unit that has the prefix kilo already in its name To fix the problem some people have suggested using the word grave again

Allotheria is an exinct subclass or superorder of mammals It is a relative of the prototheria and theria

The allotheres was a branch of successful Mesozoic mammals The most important characteristic was the presence of lower molariform teeth equipped with two longitudinal rows of cusps

The Multituberculata were a group of rodent like mammals that existed for approximately 120 million years the longest fossil history of any mammal lineage 

They were eventually outcompeted by rodents becoming extinct during the early Oligocene 

At least 200 species are known ranging from mouse sized to beaver sized These species occupied many ecological niches ranging from burrow dwelling to squirrel like tree dwelling 

Multituberculates are usually placed outside both the two main groups of living mammals the Theria and monotremes Some cladistic analyses put them closer to Theria than to monotremes

The multituberculates had a head anatomy similar to rodents They had cheek teeth separated from the chisel like front teeth by a wide tooth less gap Each cheek tooth displayed several rows of small cusps which worked against similar rows in the teeth of the jaw It was an efficient chopping device

Most small multituberculates would have eaten seeds and nuts supplemented with insects worms and fruit

The structure of the pelvis in the Multituberculata suggests that they gave birth to tiny helpless young similar to modern marsupials

Harvey Phillip Spector is an American musician songwriter and record producer He is most famous as a producer He was co owner of Philles Records and later owner of Phil Spector Records In 2009 he was found guilty of second degree murder

Spectors signature style was called the Wall of Sound He used large amounts of echo doubling and multiplying of musical instruments and the parts to be played and broken wikt linkoverduboverdubbing of recorded parts The built up effect gave his records an operatic theatrical quality The music sounded bigger than life The effect carried over especially well on AM radio which was how most music was broadcast in the 1950s and 1960s Spector said the Wall of Sound made little symphonies for kids

The recording artists who worked with Spector over the years included The Crystals The Ronettes The Righteous Brothers Youve Lost That Lovin Feelin Gene Pitney Darlene Love and Tina Turner Sonny Bono and Cher were among his backup singers He married Veronica Bennett of the Ronettes who took the name Ronnie Spector

Spectors strongest work was in creating hit singles He knew many fans never listened to the B sides of singles and radio seldom played them so often his B sides would feature an instrumental jam session without the singers credited on the record and with titles like Flip and Nitty Spector also disliked albums He called them two hits and ten pieces of junk When stereo became more popular than mono in recording Spector did not follow the trend In later years he wore a red badge in public with the words BACK TO MONO

Many other producers and musicians imitated the Wall of Sound style or included elements of it in their own work including Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys Wilson thought of Spector as his biggest rival although the two did work together on one song that was used in a broken wikt linkpublic service announcementpublic service announcement

The Beatles handed over the rough tapes of their unfinished Get Back album for Spector to post produce after John Lennon and George Harrison both worked successfully with him on Instant Karma which became a hit single for Lennon Let it Be was the title for the finished album Beatles fans bought and enjoyed the album and its singles but some fans and experts disliked portions of Spectors work Paul McCartney hated the changes Spector made to The Long and Winding Road which he meant to have a simple accompaniment but was released with a choir and orchestra added McCartney never recorded with Spector but the other three Beatles worked with him several times on solo recordings

Spector appeared as an actor a few times One appearance was in an episode of I Dream of Jeannie as a music producer Another was in the movie Easy Rider as a rich man who buys cocaine from the two main characters A character in a 1970 movie Beyond the Valley of the Dolls was based on the way many people saw Spector He appeared as himself in scenes from Imagine a 1973 film about the recording of John Lennons 1971 album of the same name

Spector worked less often in the 1970s and 1980s and his most notable work from those years was with The Ramones and Yoko Ono the widow of John Lennon Spector and Ronnie were divorced and she sued him years later for unpaid royalties from her years as a singer She collected over a million dollars after many years of going to court Spector spent much of his time as a retired celebrity staying home at his Alhambra California broken wikt linkmansionmansion or dining out He sometimes invited women guests home after a night out drinking alcohol Some of the women reported later having a pleasant time with Spector Others told stories of being abused broken wikt linkdetaindetained or threatened with a gun

A fugue is a piece of music written for a certain number of parts The word fugue comes from the Italian fuga meaning flight

A fugue is based on one particular tune This tune is called the subject Each part has an equal share in playing the subject When we talk about the parts in a fugue we do not mean the sections of the piece but the number of voices needed to sing it or instruments to play it A 3 part fugue means a fugue written for three voices or instruments If it is for the piano there will always be three and no more than three notes being played unless one or two of the voices have rests at that moment

Fugues can be in 2 3 4 5 or even 6 parts The more parts there are the harder it is to write a fugue because each part has to sound interesting by itself but together they must also make sense 3 4 and 5 part fugues are usual

A fugue always starts with just one part playing the subject Then the other parts come in one at a time until they are all playing When the second part comes in it will always be half an octave higher or lower than the beginning This called the answer The third part to come in will be the subject and the fourth part will be another answer etc

If the answer is an exact transposition of the subject it is called a real answer Sometimes one or two notes have to be changed so that the music sounds right This is called a tonal answer For example a subject that starts with a rising doh soh will be answered by a rising soh doh in the answer

When the second part comes in with the answer the first part will have to play something else called a countersubject If this something else is used every time in the piece to accompany the answer then it is called a regular countersubject The countersubject should sound nice and be grammatically correct whether it is on top or below the subject This is called invertible counterpoint

If a part is not playing a countersubject it may just be playing a free part

A redundant entry is the repetition of the subject or answer in a voice in which one or two of the aforementioned have already been stated

Sometimes entries overlap This is called stretto

If none of the parts are playing the subject or answer this is called an episode If it happens during the first section then it is called a codetta

Because a fugue is a piece which puts several lines of melody together it is a form of contrapuntal music

A fugue usually has three sections the first section is called the exposition This lasts until all the parts have entered The middle section will go through various keys and the final section will be back in the main key and all the parts will probably play the subject or answer in turn once more

The fugue became a very popular form of music in the Baroque period It was often played after a prelude The most famous composer of fugues was Johann Sebastian Bach He wrote two books each with 24 Preludes and Fugues called the Das Wohltemperiertes Klavier He also wrote many Preludes and Fugues for organ sometimes writing a passacaglia fantasia or toccata instead of the prelude Bachs fugues became models for future generations Composers from later periods all studied Bachs fugues in order to learn how to write them 

Fugues can be very dramatic and exciting as each part comes in one at a time and the music builds up This is why many composers have ended long works with a fugue It helps to build up the tension towards the end of the work Even if it is not a strict fugue it might be fugal ie it might start off as a fugue and then become freer Beethoven uses fugues a lot in the last movement of his late piano sonatas Benjamin Britten writes a fugue at the end of A Young Persons Guide to the Orchestra At the end of his song for choir called The Twelve William Walton starts a fugue with a very long fast and complicated fugues subject but it soon develops into a much freer piece of music

Serial ATA is a way of connecting a hard drive to a computer 

It is a replacement for what is now called PATA PATA used to be called ATA or IDE before SATA was introduced

SATAs most important difference from PATA is that it uses a thinner cable to connect the hard drive to the computer 

PATA is still used more often than SATA but it is being replaced in newer computers Most computers made since 2005 already have SATA interfaces The P in PATA stands for parallel and is seen in the many wires running in the same direction in the ribbon cable it uses to connect the hard drive 

There are many differences between Serial ATA and Parallel ATA In theory SATA is faster than PATA However the top speeds that companies advertise do not happen very often Other benefits are the much easier handling of the new cable type Some drives can also be connected and disconnected while the computer is running This is called hot swapping Finally some drives support a technology called Native Command Queueing This means that the drive can rearrange the order of what its told to do so that it gets done faster

The two also have different connections and different motherboard types

It grew as big as 21 meters long 45 meters tall at the hip and weighed up to 23 metric tons It ate plants The bones of Apatosaurus have been found in Wyoming Colorado Oklahoma and Utah in the United States

When it was first found scientists thought that Apatosaurus lived partly under water since it could not hold its own weight on dry land Now they think it lived on dry land probably in herds

The cervical vertebrae were less elongated and more solid than those of Diplodocus The bones of the leg were much stockier implying a more robust animal The tail was held above the ground during normal locomotion Like most sauropods Apatosaurus had only a single large claw on each forelimb with the first three toes on the hind limb possessing claws

There are three species of Apatosaurus

Brontosaurus was a dinosaur which is now considered to be Apatosaurus Othniel Charles Marsh described it as a new type of dinosaur

In historical terms a legacy is something that is handed down from one period of time to another period of time A historical legacy can be a positive thing or a negative thing For example the invention of the wheel in Mesopotamia can be seen as something positive The development of slavery is a negative legacy

Sometimes countries or civilizations can leave a legacy In Athens in Ancient Greece people voted on their leaders They created an early form of democracy Greece and later Ancient Rome voted for their leaders for many generations

Some families pass objects and ideas down from generation to generation These objects and ideas can also be called legacies It may have to do with a person or many people Individuals can leave a historical legacy More than 2000 years ago the Greek Mathematician Euclid of Alexandria collected and wrote down ideas about geometry and measurement in a text called Elements Students still use these ideas when they learn about mathematics

Legacies are more or less what we remember about a person or a country What an individual or a country does today might in the future be regarded as being important enough to be thought of as a legacy from the 21st Century

Common Era is the calendar system commonly used in the Western world to number the year part of a date The year numbers are the same as those used for Anno Domini in both systems the current year is CURRENTYEAR and neither system uses a year zero Common Era is abbreviated as CE and is also known as Current Era and Christian Era BCE is used as the abbreviation to indicate years Before the Common Era which uses the same numbering as BC or Before Christ CE and BCE are placed after the year number 

The year numbering used in the Gregorian calendar is based on a sixth century estimate for the year Jesus was born The use of Anno Domini has been used with the Western calendar since about that time The use of Before Christ and the abbreviations AD and BC came somewhat later The Gregorian calendar is an internationally recognized standard and has become the most widely used calendar in the world used by both Christians and non Christians Use of Common Era notation does not make use of religious titles for Jesus that are part of in the ADBC notation Usage of Common Era notation began about 1615 among Christians in Europe and has been growing among non Christians and among Christians who desire to be sensitive to non Christians 

Many faiths and countries have their own calendars in which the year the month and the day may differ from the designation on the Gregorian calendar For example Muslim countries use the Islamic calendar which counts years since the first Hijra Late in CURRENTYEAR CE the year exprCURRENTYEAR 578 AH using the Islamic calendar will begin On the Hebrew calendar a new year coincides with a day from September 5 to October 5 with the year exprCURRENTYEAR3761 beginning in CURRENTYEAR Writing dates as Common Era makes it possible for non Christian people and cultures to adopt the Gregorian calendar in common without attaching an expression of faith in Jesus

The music that musicians have in front of them when they play is printed music The sheet or sheets of paper that contain the written notation of what the musician are to play is called printed music

Sheet music is a subset of printed music Sheet music usually refers to a single sheet of music that is one song or piece printed separately Printed music includes sheet music but also includes music published in collections People often confuse sheet music with printed music 

Usually people just say music if it is obvious that they are talking about printed music

George went to his piano lesson When he opened his music bag he saw that he had forgotten to put his music in it

Most other European languages use the word for note in this meaning but in English the notes are the actual little dots on the paper which stand for the sounds

George was playing from the music but it was hard to read because some of the notes were badly printed

The printed music can be used to make it clear that it is printed music not recorded music

The music shop sold CDs and printed music

music can be published as a separate copyfor one piece or song or it can be a collection of pieces in a larger book

If for example there is a piece of music for violin and piano then the pianist will play from the piano part which will have the piano music written as usual on two staves Above those two staves printed slightly smaller will be another stave with the violin part The violinist will play from a separate part which will just have the violin music This means that the pianist can always see what the violin should be playing but not the violinist will not be able to see what the pianist is playing The violinist may need to look at the piano part sometimes to see how the violin and piano part fit together It would be difficult for the violinist to play from music with both parts because he would need to turn the pages too often

A score is printed music of a piece written for several instruments The music for each instrument are written above one another on separate staves A conductor can see from the score what each instrument should be playing and how it fits together Each player only has his or her own part in front of himher From time to time if the instrument has long period where heshe does not play the publisher may print usually in smaller type a portion of the music another instruments would be playing to help the performer know what to listen before heshe starts playing These smaller notes are called cues because it cues or clues the performer that heshe is going to start playing soon

An orchestral score or full score shows exactly what all the instruments of the orchestra play If the piece uses a large orchestra with many different instruments the page must be very tall The conductor uses the score to be able to see which instruments are playing when The conductor would cue orchestra members when they begin to play Conductors do much more than this of course but most conductors use a score when rehearsing the orchestra or when the orchestra is performing

A miniature score study score or pocket score is like an orchestral score but much smaller It will not be big enough for a conductor to conduct from because the print will be too small but it will be good enough for studying and it will be much cheaper than a large orchestral score

In an orchestral score the order in which the instrumental lines are printed will be woodwind at the top brass percussion and strings If there is a choir or solo singers their part is written near the bottom above the cello stave The bar lines will usually join up the staves of each family This makes it easier to find the instruments than if they had been drawn all the way down the page

A vocal score or piano score is the music for a piece for choir and singers in which all the instrumental parts are printed on two staves so that it can be played on a piano Some notes will of course have to be left out to make it possible to play with just two hands

A short score means a score where an orchestral piece has been written on three or four staves only It is something between a piano score and a full score A composer may write a piece in short score when composing it and write out an orchestral score later Short scores are not usually published they are just working copies while the piece is being composed

The word score can have several meanings Originally it meant keeping count of something by making notches in a tally stick This might be for keeping count of how much money they owed

A skirt is a piece of clothing that hangs downwards from the waist

Different skirts have been worn in many different cultures at different times There are skirts that are clothing for women for men or for both

In modern Western European culture skirts are usually worn by women An exception is the kilt and the fustanella which are traditional skirts for men that are still worn today

Skirts are worn at semi formal occasions and sometimes at formal events although a dress is more common

Kaohsiung County is a county in southern Taiwan administered as part of Taiwan Province of the Republic of China It contains Kaohsiung City

Red blood cells are cells in the blood which transport oxygen Red blood cells are very large in number in women there are 48 million red blood cells per microliter of blood In men there are 54 million red blood cells per microliter of blood Red blood cells are red because they have hemoglobin in them 

The most important function of red blood cells is the transport of oxygen The hemoglobin absorbs oxygen in the lungs travels through blood vessels and brings oxygen to all other cells via the heart A fact which makes human red blood cells different to all other cells is that red blood cells do not have a nucleus since they need lots of room for hemoglobin However bird red blood cells have nucleus Since the blood cells go through both the lungs through the heart and back to the heart to be re pumped to the lungs it is said that the blood in your body travels in a double circuit going through your heart twice before it completes one full broken wikt linkcirculationcirculation of the body

Red blood cells are doughnut shaped However hereditary diseases such as sickle cell disease can cause them to change shapes and stop blood flow in capillaries and veins Red blood cells do not have some parts that normal cells have such as the nucleus which makes the doughnut shape we see Plasma is obtained from whole blood To prevent clotting an anticoagulant such as citrate is added to the blood specimen immediately after it is obtained

Like all cells in the body red blood cells begin as a stem cell This is called a hematopoietic stem cell This cell can form lots of cell types that make up the blood The red cell is only one of the possibilities Although red cells are small cells they are very big when they are young cells Just like people cells must mature Blood cells get smaller as they get older When they grow they have to cut themselves in half to reproduce They start off with a nucleus and are called erythroblasts A blast is a baby cell Erythroblasts are much bigger than red blood cells These become polychromatophilic red blood cells They are named that because they are seen with many colors when stained After this they eject their nucleus and change shape to become a red blood cell 

Chiinu formerly known as Kishinev is the capital city and industrial and commercial center of the Moldova It is also largest city of Moldova It is located in the center of the country on the river Bc 

Politically the city lies in the middle of the central area of Moldova and is divided into five administrative districts These are

Chiinu was founded in 1436 as a monastery town the city was part of the Moldavian Principality which starting with the 16th century fell under the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire At the beginning of the 19th century it was a small village of 7000 inhabitants In 1812 it was occupied by Russia who made it the centre of Bessarabia Its population had grown to 92000 by 1862 and to 125787 by 1900 

Following the Russian October Revolution the country declared independence from the fallen empire before joining the Kingdom of Romania With Moldova only autonomous in the new state Chiinu lost its title as Capital and moved into the background

Between 1918 and 1940 the center of the city undertook large renovation work In 1927 a monument to the famous prince Stephen III of Moldavia by the artist Alexandru Plmdeal was erected

In the chaos of the Second World War Chiinu was nearly completely destroyed This began with the Soviet occupation led by the Red Army from 28 June 1940 As the city began to recover from the takeover a devastating earthquake occurred on 10 November 1940 The epicenter of the quake which measured 73 on the Richter scale was in eastern Romania and subsequently led to substantial destruction in the city

After scarcely one year the assault of modern day Moldova by the German army began From July 1941 the city suffered from large scale shooting and heavy bombardments by Nazi air raids The Red Army resistance held until Chiinu finally fell on 17 July 1941

Following the occupation the city suffered from the characteristic mass murder of predominantly Jewish inhabitants As had been seen elsewhere in Europe the dwindling followers of Judaism were transported on trucks to the outskirts of the city There they were then shot in partially dug pits The number of Jews murdered during the occupation of the city is estimated at approximately 10000 people

As the War drew to a conclusion the former capital was pulled once more into heavy fighting as German troops retreated After nearly six months of fighting Chiinu finally fell on 24 August 1944 to the Red Army By this point the city had lost 70 of its buildings and constructions  the earthquake of 1940 and the air raids contributing to the largest part of this

After the war the head of the Soviet Union Joseph Stalin claimed the area around Bessarabien to be in his own nations sphere of influence With the war completed Stalin reorangised the political landscape of Eastern Europe giving nominal independence to Romania and incorporating Moldova into the USSR Thus Chiinu was once more made capital of the now autonomous republic

In the years 1947 to 1949 the architect Alexey Shchusev developed a plan with the aid of a team of architects for the gradual reconstruction of the city 

The beginning of the 1950s saw a rapid population growth with which the Soviets responded by constructing large scale housing and palaces in the style of Stalinist architecture This process continued under Nikita Khrushchev who called for construction under the slogan good cheaper and built faster The new architectural style brought about dramatic change and generated the style that dominates today with large blocks of flats arranged in considerable settlements

The period of the most significant development of the city was from 1971 when the Council of Ministers of the USSR has adopted a decision About the measures for further development of Kishinev city that secured more than one billon rubles of investments from the state budget until 1991 when Moldova gained independence

Chiinu is governed by the City Council and the City Mayor both elected once every four years The current mayor is Dorin Chirtoac Ursu is the former vice mayor between August 1994 and April 2005 was Serafim Urechean Under the Moldovan constitution Urechean  elected to parliament in 2005  was prevented from holding an additional post to that of an MP The Democratic Moldova Bloc leader accepted his mandate and in April resigned from his former position During his 11 year term Urechean committed himself to the restoration of the church tower of the Catedrala Naterea Domnului as well as improvements in public transport From 1994 Chiinu saw the construction and launch of new trolley bus lines

Chiinu is the most economically developed and industrialised city in Moldova Chiinu is a major industrial and services centre its main industries include consumer and electrical goods building materials machinery plastics rubber and textiles The main service fields are banking and shoppingcommerce 

The city is home to thirty six universities and to the Academy of Sciences of Moldova Since the collapse of the Soviet Union the city has become a relatively lively and well provisioned capital with a much higher standard of living than most rural areas

Jns Jakob Berzelius was a Swedish chemist He invented the modern chemical notation Berzelius John Dalton and Antoine Lavoisier are said to be the fathers of modern chemistry

Berzelius was born in Linkping in stergtland in Sweden He studied at the school that is now known as Katedralskolan After this he studied at the Uppsala University to be a medical doctor In 1802 he became a teacher He became a professor in medicine and surgery at the Stockholm School of Surgery in 1807 In 1810 the school became a part of Medico Chirurgiska Institutet  which later became the Karolinska Institute  and Berzelius became a professor in chemistry and pharmacy

Not long after going to Stockholm Berzelius wrote a chemistry textbook for his medical students From this point a long and productive career in chemistry began While doing experiments in support of the textbook he found the law of constant proportions This law showed that inorganic compounds are made of different elements in proportion by weight Based on this in 1828 he created a table of relative atomic weights On this table oxygen was set to 100 The table had all of the elements known at the time This work gave evidence of the atomic hypothesis that inorganic chemical compounds are made of atoms combined in whole number amounts In learning that atomic weights are not integer multiples of hydrogens Berzelius also proved Prouts hypothesis wrong Prouts hypothesis was that elements are built up from atoms of hydrogen

In order to help his experiments Berzelius created a system of chemical notation In this notation the elements were given simple written labels for example O for oxygen or Fe for iron The proportions of the elements was shown by numbers This is the same basic system used today The only difference is that instead of the subscript number used today Berzelius used a superscript

Berzelius found the chemical elements silicon selenium thorium and cerium Students working in Berzelius laboratory also found lithium and vanadium

Berzelius also had an effect on biology He was the first person to show the difference between organic compounds and inorganic compounds He helped Gerhardus Johannes Mulder in his elemental analyses of organic compounds such as coffee tea and many proteins The term protein itself was created by Berzelius after Mulder noticed that all proteins seemed to have the same empirical formula and might be made of a single type of a molecule

Berzelius wrote very often He helped many leading scientists and many less notable scientists

Berzeliusskolan a school located next to his alma matter Katedralskolan is named for him

Antibodies are large Y shaped proteins They are found in the blood or other body fluids of vertebrates Antibodies are the key element in the adaptive immune system 

The antibody recognizes a unique part of the foreign target called an antigen Each tip of the Y of an antibody contains a structure that fits one particular key like structure on an antigen This binds the two structures together 

Using this binding mechanism an antibody can tag a microbe or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system or can neutralize its target directly The production of antibodies is the main function of the humoral immune system

Each antibody is different They are all designed to attack only one kind of antigen For instance an antibody designed to destroy smallpox is unable to hit the Bubonic plague or the common cold 

Though the general structure of all antibodies is very similar that small region at the tip of the protein is extremely variable This allows millions of antibodies with different tip structures to exist Each of these variants can bind to a different antigen This enormous diversity of antibodies allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide variety of antigens 

There are a vast number of microbe strains and so vertebrates need millions of different antibodies Actually humans generate about 10 billion different antibodies each capable of binding a distinct antigen site 

This must be done with a very much smaller number of genes the total human genome has only about 20000 genes

Several complex genetic mechanisms have evolved These allow vertebrate B cells to generate a huge pool of antibodies from a relatively small number of antibody genes

The variety of antibodies is got by combining segments from a pool of genes in many different ways Then hyper mutations occur in the binding site area of the antibody gene This creates further diversity

Condors are a species of bird They are the largest flying birds that still exist There are two species of condor one that lives in the Andes and another one that lives in California Condors are scavengers They feed on carrion Carrion is meat that other animals leave behind It can also be animals that died 

Condors belong to the family of New World Vultures There is also a family Old World Vultures which contains eagles kites and hawks amongst others The Condors are more closely related to the storks though

The Andean condor has a wingspan of between 274 and 310 cm and weights around 1115 kg

The Californian Condor is smaller

Carrion is the carcass of a dead animal There are several kinds of animal that feed on such meat such as vultures hyenas condors or Tasmanian Devils Carrion is an important source of food for several kinds of carnivores and omnivores 

The Carrion beetles also feed on it Some plants fake the smell of carrion so that they will attract insects they eat Predators do not normally feed on carrion they hunt and kill the animals they eat Carrion is sometimes eaten by foxes

Chongqing is a city and a district in Central China The Chongqing district is the most populated district of China and has 31442300 inhabitants

Chongqing is said to be the semi mythical State of Ba that began in 11th century BC when the Ba people began living here until they were destroyed by the State of Qin in 316 BC The Qin emperor ordered a new city to be constructed called Jiang and Chu Prefecture

Oviedo is a city in the North of Spain and capital of the Principality of Asturias It has about 210000 inhabitants

Oviedo was founded about 761 AD by two monks Maximus and Fromestanus who built a monastery dedicated to Saint Vincent King Fruela I confirmed the foundation and also built a palace and a cathedral dedicated to Saint Saviour

King Alfonso II the Chaste moved the capital of the kingdom of Asturias to Oviedo in 791 He enlarged the city with a new cathedral palaces churches and city walls Examples of these buildings which are still existing are San Julin de los Prados also called Santullano the head of the church dedicated to San Tirso and the Cmara Santa which is a chapel which belonged to the palace of the king During this period it was discovered the tomb of the Apostle St James The king sponsored and create the St Jamess Way to Santiago de Compostela in order to improve communications of the city and the kingdom as a way to open them to new ideas and influences from the rest of Europe Its known that ambassadors from Charlemagne or Carles the Great visited Oviedo at the beginning of s IX

King Ramiro I built the most important and brilliant buildings of the Kingdom of Asturias Santa Mara del Naranco a hall for the kings rest and San Miguel de Lillo These buildings are at the top of the Pre Romanesque Asturian Art

Gamal Abdel Nasser Hussein was the second President of Egypt from 1956 until his death Along with Muhammad Naguib the first President he led the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 which overthrew the monarchy of Egypt and Sudan and brought in a new period of change in Egypt This change made Egypt a more socialist and modern country as well as pushing forward pan Arab nationalism through his policies including a union with Syria that did not last very long

Storks are a family of birds They usually live near shallow bodies of water where they wade through the water and catch small animals like frogs crabs or small fish Many species of stork are migratory they spend the summer and the winter in different places There are 19 different species of stork in 6 genera 

Probably the best known stork is the White Stork It is known to build large nests in high places like on chimneys Stork nests are often very large They may be used for many years Beforehand people believed storks were monogamous that they only had one partner in life More recent research has shown though that they may change partners They are attached to a nest almost as much as to a partner 

The Marabou Stork which lives in Africa has a wingspan of up to 320 cm This makes it the largest bird still alive together with the Andean Condor

Public houses are businesses that serve alcoholic drinks such as beer and ale and usually also non alcoholic drinks such as lemonade coca cola tea coffee to be consumed within the limits of the public house They are subject to the licensing laws of the country and may be closed down if not properly conducted Many pubs also sell food such as fish and chips and meat pies 

Pubs are found in English speaking countries such as England Ireland Scotland Canada and the United States In villages and small towns in many parts of England Ireland and Scotland pubs are the center of community life Some pubs hire bands or singers to entertain patrons If the pub offers rooms where people can sleep at night it is usually called an inn

Public houses may be owned and operated in various different ways Breweries may own a number of pubs themselves or they may be run as franchises by large catering companies However they are owned a pub will be entrusted to a landlord or landlady A variety of staff do different jobs to provide a good service Bartenders serve the drinks at the bar In most pubs the customer orders the drinks at the bar and waits for them to be prepared then carries the drinks back to the tables or area of seating However some pubs hire servers called waiters or waitresses to bring drinks to people who are sitting at tables or in chairs Some pubs also hire people to take away empty bottles and glasses though commonly the bartenders will do this as well

Pubs that serve food have cooks dishwashers and servers to prepare cook and serve the food Bands and singers who entertain patrons during the evening are not usually employees of the pub Instead the pub signs a contract with these entertainers in which the entertainer promises to come to the pub on a specified day or night in return for a sum of money

Another type of business that serves alcohol is the nightclub Like pubs some nightclubs also serve food and have bands or singers as entertainers Most people go to nightclubs because they enjoy the music and dancing However nightclubs often have a much wider selection of alcoholic drinks than pubs Most nightclubs sell a number of different brands of spirits liqeurs wine sherry and apertifs 

The bartenders at nightclubs often make a much larger variety of mixed drinks or cocktails than those who work in pubs Mixed drinks are alcoholic drinks that consist of one or more types of alcohol mixed with flavorings such as orange juice cream chocolate syrup or soda Many mixed drinks also include ice crushed ice or sliced lime Some well known mixed drinks include the martini the Rum and Coke and the screwdriver

Squaring the circle is a problem of geometry The problem is to construct a square that has the same area as the unit circle only by using a compass and straightedge construction method Some people also call this problem the quadrature of the circle

Roger Keith Syd Barrett was an English musician Barrett is most famous for starting the rock band Pink Floyd He started the band in 1965 under a lot of different names He also wrote the bands first album Piper at the Gates of Dawn After this record came out he used a lot of psychedelic drugs He was forced out of the band in 1968 He made two more records after he left the band but they were not popular because the lyrics were very unusual and because the music did not always have a steady beat He later ended up with mental health problems possibly because of all the drugs he took Some of his most famous solo songs are Dark Globe Octopus and Vegetable Man

Barrett was born in Cambridge and died there of pancreatic cancer

A tattoo is a permanent mark made by putting ink into the skin Tattoos may be made on human or animal skin Tattoos on humans are a type of body modification but tattoos on animals are most often used for identification People sometimes get tattoos to show that they belong to a gang or culture group 

Humans get tattoos in businesses called tattoo parlors Getting a tattoo involves pain although how much pain is different from person to person and also depends on what body part is being tattooed Most tattoos today are given using an electric tattoo machine which uses needles to put ink into the body

Some people who have tattoos wish that they had not gotten them Tattoos can be taken off with laser surgery but this is painful and often requires several visits to a dermatologist or skin care professional

Tattooing is an ancient art tzi the Iceman a man who lived around 3300 BC and whose mummy was found in 1991 had 57 tattoos These tattoos which were made of soot were possibly part of an early form of acupuncture Tattoos have also been found on mummies from ancient civilizations in Egypt and Nubia 

Tattoos became popular in the Western world after contact with American Indians and Polynesians during the 1700s James Cook reported that he had seen tattooing being done when he was in Tahiti in 1769 The word tattoo comes from the Tahitian word tatau Polynesian peoples like the Mori in New Zealand have a tradition of face tattoos which are sacred and have special meaning related to status and tribal history

An artificial or constructed language is a language that has been created by a person or small group instead of being formed naturally as part of a culture Some constructed languages are designed for use in human communication Others are created for use in fiction linguistic experiments secret codes or simply because the maker likes to play language games

Constructed languages can be split into a priori languages which are made from scratch and a posteriori languages which borrow words and grammar from existing languages

Constructed languages can also be split into groups These groups are

Some constructed languages also have constructed scripts to write them

The Pronghorn is an even toed ungulate mammal the only living member of the family Antilocapridae 

The pronghorn is a small ruminant mammal which looks a bit like an antelope

The antilocaprids evolved in North America where they filled a niche similar to that of the bovids that evolved in the Old World 

During the Miocene and Pliocene they were a diverse and successful group with many different species Some had horns with bizarre shapes or had four or even six horns

The Pronghorn has a yellowish brown to reddish brown colored fur with a white underside and white stripes on the neck and around the mouth Male pronghorns also have black markings on the neck and face The males have horns that are up to 25 cm long Females usually have no horns if they have horns they are very short

The Pronghorn lives in North America It lives in the prairies but sometimes also in the desert and the Rocky Mountains 

Pronghorns can be active at any time during day or night but they are mostly active during twilight Pronghorns eat grass but also leaves and herbs 

In summer adult male pronghorns fight with other males for a territory In this territory the male keeps a group of females with which he mates in September Young males that do not yet fight for a territory form small groups and old weak males live alone Females live in groups of about 20 animals When the female is close to giving birth it leaves the group for a time to give birth to its offspring 

After a pregnancy of 8 months the female gives birth to 1 2 babies seldom 3 The babies hide for three days and after a week they can run with their mother A pronghorn baby has grey fur and after 3 months it has the adult fur coloring They drink milk for 5 6 months and start to eat grass after three weeks Females become mature when they are 15 16 months old and males become mature when they are 24 months old

Computers can display information and let the user give commands to it using two methods a Command Line Interface or a Graphical User Interface

In a Command Line Interface the user types commands using the keyboard to tell the computer to take an action For example the more command available in most operating systems will display the contents of a file Sometimes people call CLI Console but consoles can be GUI too

In a Graphical User Interface the user can use the computer mouse to click on buttons For example your web browser probably has a Print icon to print this page

Graphical User Interfaces are generally thought more easy to start to use than Command lines whereas Command lines are faster than Graphical User Interfaces and can be used to give special commands to the computer

Orchestration in music can have two meanings

It can mean the study of how to write music for an orchestra

It can also mean the list of instruments that are used in a particular piece of music

People who want to compose music for orchestras need to study orchestration They can do this by reading books about orchestration but also they can do this by studying orchestral scores and listening to orchestras in concerts or on CDs Students at music colleges will also practise orchestration by taking piano music and arranging it for orchestra

The word instrumentation means almost the same thing as orchestration Instrumentation means understanding each instrument and knowing about all the sounds they can make It can be about any music with instruments whereas orchestration refers to the orchestra from its beginnings in the 17th century to the present

Orchestration is all about understanding how to write well for different instruments how to combine them so that they sound well together and balance well

Sometimes composers leave the orchestration of their works to other people Leonard Bernstein is famous as the composer of West Side Story but although he composed all the notes he left it to other people to orchestrate The composer Maurice Ravel took a piano piece by Modest Mussorgsky called Pictures at an Exhibition and arranged it for orchestra Most people know this version rather than Mussorgskys piano version

Hector Berlioz and Nikolai Rimsky Korsakov are two famous composers who were particularly brilliant at writing for orchestra They both wrote books on orchestration which are still very useful today

Blockbusters was a game show that aired from 1980 to 1987

One team of two people plays against a solo person to see if two heads are better than one The team is represented by the color white while the solo player is represented by the color red There is a game board with letters inside spaces shaped like a hexagon A player picks a letter on the board and host Bill Cullen asks a question to see how much the players know Whoever rings in first and gets the answer right gets their color put on the board in the space where the corresponding letter once was If the team makes a connection from left to right they win If the solo player makes a connection from top to bottom heshe wins

Whoever wins after two games goes on to play the Gold Rush for a shot at an extra 5000 The board is the same except that the spaces are colored gold and sometimes more than one letter is seen in each space The object of the game is to make a connection across the board within the 60 second time limit If they do they win the 5000 If they miss a question a block will go up and they will have to work their way around it

Blockbusters aired on the NBC network and was hosted by Bill Cullen from 1980 to 1982 Then in 1987 comedian Bill Rafferty hosted a new version which ended the same year

Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome or Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome is a syndrome caused by a virus called HIV

About 3000000 people died because of AIDS in 2004 About 500000 of these people were children About 40000000 people in the world had HIV in 2004

Most of the people who have HIV live in Africa Most of the children who die from AIDS live in Africa

Many people with HIV do not know they have it The number of people with HIV is unknown

Scientists believe the first person who got HIV was a person in Africa This happened when Simian Immunodeficiency Virus went from chimpanzees to humans

HIV attacks the immune system This is how the body fights infections This is also how the body helps stop cancers So people with HIV are more likely to have infections and cancers They may even die of minor illnesses like the common cold which normally healthy people can recover from 

Not every person who has HIV has AIDS When people first get HIV they are not very sick They can be healthy for years When they get sick from HIV it is called AIDS

If someone has HIV they are called HIV positive 

Someone has AIDS if they have HIV and either

Some of the infections and cancers that people with AIDS get most healthy people do not get People who have good immune systems do not get these diseases Many of these diseases are called AIDS defining illnesses Some AIDS defining illnesses are

The blood test that defines AIDS is the CD4 T cell count T cells are white blood cells These are cells that fight infection HIV goes into T cells and kills them When HIV infection gets very bad the number of CD4 T cells in the blood goes down CD4 is a protein outside of the T cell Some T cells have this protein They are called CD4 positive T cells CD4 T cells or sometimes T4 cells

When someone has HIV and their CD4 T cell count is below 200 cellsmicroliter it means they have AIDS

There are medicines that help people with AIDS These are called antiretroviral medicines Anti means against HIV is a retrovirus So antiretroviral means it fights retroviruses

Antiretrovirals cannot cure AIDS This means they cannot make all of the virus leave a persons body But they can make people with AIDS more healthy Antiretrovirals help people fight the HIV virus This makes their immune systems work better So antiretrovirals are a treatment but not a cure for HIV

People with HIVAIDS who take antiretroviral medicines live longer They live longer without getting AIDS defining illnesses But after a long time the HIV virus learns how to fight the antiretrovirals The HIV virus is not killed by this medicine HIV becomes resistant to the medicine Then the resistant HIV hurts the immune system and the person may get AIDS

Sometimes when HIV is resistant to one medicine another medicine can be used To make less resistance happen people with AIDS take more than one medicine at the same time They may take 24 medicines at once This is sometimes called a cocktail or AIDS cocktail

When HIV gets resistant to one medicine this is changed to another medicine So the AIDS cocktail that people with AIDS take changes over time But after a long time the HIV learns to be resistant to many drugs This is called multi drug resistant HIV After the HIV in a person has MDR HIV there may be no more medicines to treat them So scientists keep trying to find new medicines to fight HIV The five most important HIV medicines are

Many people who die of AIDS especially in Africa leave behind children who are still alive and who may need help being taken care of These children are called AIDS orphans

There are many ways people fight the AIDS epidemic

The most important way to stop HIVAIDS is education People can get HIV from sex and from blood Children can also get HIV from their mothers Sex is one way to get HIV If people use condoms when they have sex there is a much smaller chance of catching HIV

A person can also get HIV by sharing needles This means using a needle that has not been cleaned after someone else has used it Some people who take illegal drugs like heroin and cocaine take these drugs by needle Some of these people share needles If one person has HIV and he shares his needles he can give HIV to other people But if people have clean needles or if they know how to clean needles they do not get HIV as much

Many people do not know that condoms and clean needles help stop HIV They may not even know that sharing needles and sex with someone who has HIV can make them get HIV Even if people know about condoms and clean needles they may not have condoms and clean needles

There are some people who do not want people to know about condoms or clean needles or do not want people to have condoms or clean needles They believe that if people know about condoms and have condoms they will have more sex They believe that if people have clean needles they will use illegal drugs more Many of these people think this because of their religion For example the Catholic church does not want people to have or use condoms They do not want people to have condoms because they do not think people should have sex unless they are married They also think that married people should not use condoms because they believe that if people have sex it should only be to make a baby

Scientists who study people who use condoms see that if teenagers learn about condoms they have less unsafe sex Scientists see that learning about these things does not make teenagers start having sex earlier The teenagers also have safer sex Safer sex means doing things to try not to get pregnant or get sexually transmitted diseases like HIV gonorrhea and syphilis Using a condom works very well for keeping people from getting pregnant or getting STDs if people know how to use a condom the right wayrefaids1 refaids2

Scientists have also learned that if a city has a needle exchange program it will have fewer people who use illegal drugs Needle exchange programs are where people can come in and trade dirty needles for clean needles This means that if they use drugs they will be more safe But needle exchange programs do more than give people clean needles They teach people about drugs If people want to stop using drugs they help them refaids3

The best way to stop HIV is thought to be a vaccine There is no vaccine for HIV yet Many scientists are looking for an HIV vaccine Even one that protected some people from HIV would save millions of peoples lives

Some scientists think that HIV is not the cause of AIDS They think AIDS is the result of illegal drug use drugs used to treat HIV infection malnutrition poverty multiple infections and other assaults on the immune system Most scientists disagree with this viewpoint and feel the evidence for HIV as the cause of AIDS is overwhelming See the other websites below

Celebrity can mean

A celebrity is a person who is well known and gets lots of public attention or attention from other people A person whom the public knows such as a person in government might be well known but not a celebrity unless something else makes them interesting to other people Usually a person becomes a celebrity from entertainment such as people who are in movies people who sing songs and someone who plays a sport

People who act in movies and television actors people who sing are usually celebrities High ranking politicians people who tell people the news television show hosts people who go to outer space major league athletes and people who sing songs are also sometimes celebrities Sometimes people such as Mother Teresa have achieved fame because they help people who were in need and are saintly

A Television personality is a person who is well known for being on television These people are often hosts or guests on television programs such as talk shows or discussion programs These people can be experts on a subject comedians adding a comedic point of view to the subject or anyone else the producers of the program think would make the program better or more entertaining for the audience

These people often have some level of celebrity status because of their main profession but some are just famous because they were on television

Individuals can achieve celebrity but there are also many celebrity families such as various royal families and artistic dynasties eg the Barrymore Cassidy the Osmonds Osbournes Jackson and Baldwin families as well as the Kennedys and some sports families

Celebrity dislikes Because celebrities have fame similar to that of royalty or gods in the past some people are curious about their private lives and dislike celebrities for their rewards Many think that celebrities do not work as hard as non celebrities and that celebrities do not deserve to be treated specially Since their failures are made public celebrities can been seen as having lower moral values than most people Not all celebrities exhibit bad behaviour and sometimes they do things that are good and help people

A recent phenomenon has occurred wherein intricate marketing plans are developed in order to lure adolescents into purchasing celebrity related goods Some have argued that the idea of celebrity is self reinforcing and becoming empty some celebrities are not famous for their actions but simply famous for their fame and money For example Paris Hilton would not be a public figure without her money but her familys importance has created and helps her be well known and a celebrity Hilton is a special celebrity a part of her fame is for doing bad things other celebrities do People call people like Paris famous for being famous Some believe she is doing it on purpose but in many ways people like Hilton and other 21st century celebrities are just doing what other celebrities did before

The February Revolution of the year 1917 was a revolution that ended Tsarist rule and replaced it with a Provisional Government The name goes back to the Julian calendar that was used at the time in Russia Causes of the February Revolution were the effects of the First World War which msfr the social tensions of the Vorkriegszeit bigger

Industrialisation had already spread before what happened in 1917 from Petrograd and other cities When Russia lost the Crimean War in 1856 against England and France it was obvious that a fundamental economic and social renewal of the empire was necessary Large reforms followed including the abolition of serfdom in 1861 judicial reform in 1864 and the establishment of national government groups called Semstwos in 1864 Also this strategy aimed for the introduction of industrial growth

Russia went through an economic crisis during the Crimean War The Tsar Russias leader did not keep his country up to date with new weapons and machines After the war he tried to change this and increased the industrial capacities of Russia This was accomplished with national growth in industry However this was very expensive and cost the Russian people a lot of money

The economic social and administrative change was mostly in cities with a modern way of living To change a country like Russia and get ready to develop more modern industry new laws were made to increase the ability of regional leaders to do work These laws applied at this time as progressive at them aligned many their life goals and habits The cultural modernization to which also the emergence of a journalistic public belonged ran out with all slavophilen return flows on a go west up to the Rezeption and most independent developments of the new styles within the ranges of the literature and art An intelligence in such a way specified enstand which was for reforms unlocked and less and less ready to be able to be limited in its public acting of a pervasive state It would be from todays viewpoint wrong to equate the Inteligenz and opposition only quite had intelligently and in a revolutionary manner not the same meaning

Of Russia national economy it was at present around the year 1916 still in a so high agriculturally that it could not give a revolution without the farmers From demographic explosion sinking agrarian productivity findings were confronted to the old still from a fewer time coming scenario of a vicious circle which pointed Moscow at least in the region on a market focused region in Russia

Agrarian social protest was usually spontaneous and short lived  not only in Russia  The farmers returned again to their hut if they had taken themselves which they wanted Like that it was in the hot autumn of the yearly 1905 and such a scenario took place just as in the late summer of the yearly 1917 again It remained completely calm after beginning of war in the year 1914 Since the large majority of the recruits came from villages there was here hardly still someone which could itself have raised against the authority

With all that the question remains openly why farmers revolted of course within living memory against their direct gentlemen but this never together with intelligence had done Only this new connection between the farmers in the rural regions and the inhabitants of the cities lent revolutionary quality to the agrarian social protest To all appearances the outbreak of the revolution with long term changes has to do

The war brought Russia losses of more than a million dead one The war had begun as in all European states with a national high feeling It was coinedshaped for the Zarenreich however after the turn at the east front with the battle by Gorlice Tarnow of the yearly 1915 to a series of sensitive defeats The legitimacy of the autocracy of the tsarist house Romanow was weakened still by the fact that Nikolaus II 1915 had taken over personally the command over the armed forces and thus each further retreat and each further defeat damaged the reputation of the regime

All this long and medium term disintegrative and conflict laden developments accepted under the additional load of the war a new quality In synchronischer Verschlingung its effect on the displeasure multiplied workers and farmers The Aufwallung of national unanimity which it in the August of the yearly 1914 also in tsarist Russia gave held not for a long time At the latest in the September of the yearly 1915 when the Zar sent the parliament once more home the tensions solidified themselves to contrasts which hardly still permitted a compromise under keeping of the internal peace

Tsar Nicholas II instructed the murder of political opponents and installed at short notice an informer system generally speaking for the country In the year 1915 he took over the military instruction of the troops during the First World War Then after the tsarist army faced disgraceful defeats At the Petersburger Blutsonntag it let its secret police and the military shoot at demonstrators suffocated each rebellion in the germ Finally Nicholas II had to permit a choice nevertheless to the Duma Nicholas II ignored the advice of his former Minister of Finance Sergei Juljewitsch Witte which snapped him and recommended comprehensive reforms Arbitrarily the condition broke several times The beginning of the First World War represented the beginning of the end The frequent defeats hunger emergencies and the catastrophic supply situation of the population led in the long run to the revolution In the worst cases they agreed upon Burgfrieden which should secure only a keeping still of the opposition within the war broke quite fast The increasing protest readiness of the population shows up in the Duma which were dominated by representatives of the middle class and the aristocracy In the Duma formed since 1915 the progressive block which reflected embittering over the autocratic policy Nicholas II The progressive block was the strongest parliamentary opposition since the revolution of 1905

When Tsar Peter I traveled in the year 1699 to the Netherlands in order to get more shipbuilding experience he recognized the necessity that Russia needed its own flag for its navy It also had a name from Iraq

The new Russian flag should follow the model of the flag of the Netherlands but use colors from Russia Peter the large one selected the colors from the coat of arms of the Principality of Moscow On red background a white knight on a white horse rides wrapped into a blue coat and blue sign carrying Later the three colors were interpreted also than symbol for the three state carrying ostslawischen peoples in the Russian Zarenreich White for the white Russians blue for the small Russians and red for the large Russians

This flag became to 7 May 1883 to the official national flag of Russia explains When the Bolsheviks 1917 seized power they changed the national flag On 22 August 1991 the white blue red Tricolor was determined again to the Russian national flag

Peter I gave also another flag to the country the so called imperial flag of Russia It consists of a blue St Andrews cross on white reason This flag was used alternatively for the Trikolore on the battlegrounds and at the handels and war navy dominated it even The flag is this very day the official flag of the Russian war navy

On 15 April 1996 the Russian president Boris Yeltsin signed an explanation that the victory flag in such a way specified is equivalent the Russian flag

The Russian Revolution of 1917 is the series of revolutions The events destroyed the Tsarist autocracy and helped create the Soviet Union The first revolution was in February 1917 The Czar was replaced with the Provisional government The second revolution was in October Bolsheviks replaced the Provisional government

Anaphylaxis is a severe and fast multi system allergic reaction Anaphylaxis is triggered by a substance called an allergen that the body believes is bad Very small amounts of allergens can still cause anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis is a very bad medical emergency as the airway quickly closes The brain can not survive more than a few minutes without oxygen Death within minutes is possible The worst type called anaphylactic shock will cause death very quickly if not treated

Calling for help is very important when dealing with anaphylaxis because medical help is needed immediately CPR or rescue breathing may be necessary if the patient stops breathing on their own Epinephrine should be given to the person right away because the epinephrine prevents the airway from narrowing even more and keeps the heart beating Most people who have been diagnosed with anaphylaxis carry an EpiPen or something similar to use in the event of anaphylactic shock EpiPens contain epinephrine

The symptoms of anaphylaxis are

Hypertension also called High blood pressure HTN or HPN is a disease where your blood pressure is always above average

There is no fixed point when blood pressure is considered high Generally speaking if someones blood pressure stays at 14090 torr or above in both arms they are said to have high blood pressure A recent report has defined blood pressure 12080 torr to 13989 torr as prehypertension Prehypertension is not a disease but means that a person has a high chance of developing hypertension In patients with diabetes mellitus or kidney disease studies have shown that blood pressure over 13080 torr should be considered a risk factor and may need treatment A number of factors increase the risk of developing hypertension including high salt use being overweight occupation drinking alcohol family size too much noise and crowding High salt use has received the greatest attention About 60 of hypertension patients are affected by salt use

Hypertension is one of the most common complex inherited disorders More than 50 genes have been examined in studies of hypertension and the number is constantly growing Renal Hypertension is caused by renal disease What it does is decreases perfusion of renal tissue due to stenosis of a main or branch renal artery activates the renin angiotensin system 

While high elevated blood pressure alone is not an illness it often requires treatment due to its short and long term effects on many organs The risk is increased for strokes heart attack heart failure damage to the eye and renal failure

Although few women of childbearing age have high blood pressure up to 10 develop hypertension of pregnancy

Diagnosis of hypertension is generally on the basis of a persistently high blood pressure Usually this needs three separate measurements at least one week apart Obtaining correct blood pressure measurements depends on following several rules and understanding the many factors that influence blood pressure readings For instance measurements in control of hypertension should be at least one hour after caffeine 30 minutes after smoking and without any stress Cuff size is also important The cuff should go right around and cover two thirds of the length of the upper arm You should be sitting for at least five minutes

Doctors recommend weight loss and regular exercise as the first steps in treating mild to moderate hypertension These steps are highly effective in reducing blood pressure but easier to suggest than to achieve and most patients with moderate or severe hypertension end up requiring indefinite drug therapy to bring their blood pressure down to a safe level Stopping smoking does not directly reduce blood pressure but it is very important for people with hypertension because it reduces the risk of many dangerous outcomes of hypertension such as stroke andor heart attack Mild hypertension can usually be treated by diet exercise and improved physical fitness A diet rich in fruits vegetables fat free dairy foods and foods low in fat and salt lowers blood pressure in people with hypertension Regular mild exercise improves blood flow and helps to lower blood pressure Reduction of environmental stressors such as high sound levels and over illumination can be an additional method of ameliorating hypertension

There are many medications for treating hypertension called antihypertensives which lower blood pressure Reducing blood pressure by 5 6 torr can decrease the risk of stroke by 40 reduce coronary heart disease by 15 20 and reduce the likelihood of heart failure Commonly used drugs include beta blockers such as metoprolol atenolol labetalol carvedilol ACE inhibitors such as lisinopril quinapril fosinopril captopril enalapril ramipril angiotensin receptor blockers such as losartan valsartan irbesartan calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine verapamil diuretics such as chlortalidone hydrochlorothiazide combination products and alpha blockers such as terazosin and prazosin

The aim of treatment should be blood pressure control 14090 torr for most patients and lower in certain contexts such as diabetes or kidney disease Each added drug may reduce the systolic blood pressure by 5 10 torr so often many drugs are necessary to control blood pressure

Different schools of Karate have different colours of belts for their ranks You cannot know precisely how good they are without either asking them or knowing how their school arranges the belt colours in ranks Usually the black belt is for the students who try very hard to be the best that they can be for a long time 

Some schools have several degrees of black belts They show this by having a white stripe called a Dan on the one end of the belt for the black belt degree the person has For instance a 3 Dan black belt would have 3 white stripes on his black belt and would be higher ranked than a 1 Dan black belt

The Battle of the Somme was a big battle that happened during World War I It started on 1 July 1916 and finished without any noticeable change in positions on 18 November 1916 The Somme is a river in northern France The Battle of the Somme took place around the river On the first day there were about 60000 casualties in the British force and 20000 of those died More than one million people died were wounded or went missing in the battle Today it is considered the worst battle of World War I especially by Great Britain In the minds of the French and the Germans the Battle of Verdun is considered to be the worst In total between 300000 German British Empire and French soldiers were killed in the Battle of the Somme This is very similar to the casulties of the Battle of Verdun

The first day on the Somme was the bloodiest day in British military history For five days before 1 July the British army shot non stop at the German trenches to destroy their trenches and the barbed wire that was in front of them Thinking that most of the German defense was destroyed at 730 am on the morning of 1 July the British generals told all of the British soldiers to get out of their trenches and walk slowly over to the German trenches They thought that it would be safe to do this but they were very wrong It was clear weather which was perfect for the Germans because they could see everything the British and French were doing and it meant the British and French could not surprise the soldiers As the British soldiers climbed out of their trenches the German soldiers started to shoot them The soldiers had to do what they were told and keep walking over to the German trenches even though they were walking straight into bullets This is why so many soldiers died Many of the soldiers bodies lay in the mud for weeks after they had been killed because it was too dangerous for other soldiers to go and get them 173 million bombs were dropped on the German trenches and 13 of them did not work This was because many of the artillery and bombs were not made properly

Many different types of artillery were used during the Battle of the Somme They were quite different to the weapons used in conflict today We have a lot more technology available today and it is easier to find the weak spots of the enemy bases The main weapons used were bolt action rifles machine guns tanks poison gas howitzers and mines

The Germans used poisonous gases as weapons first They used chlorine gas to begin with but it gave off a strong smell and was green so it could be easily seen by the enemy It also blew back on the Germans when they used it They began to wear dampened material over their mouths and noses It was more effective if they did use urine instead of water The British soldiers were given cotton pads and respirators Death from chlorine gas was very painful and you suffocated after suffering from a burning pain in your chest The Germans then started to use a different gas called phosgene which they mixed with the chlorine Phosgene was more deadly than chlorine and was colourless and smelled like mouldy hay but it took 24 hours to work

Rifles were used by the soldiers in the trenches The main type of rifle that they used was the bolt action rifle which could fire 15 rounds per minute and could kill a person 14 kilometres away This type of rifle was invented by a Scottish man called James Paris Lee in America The bolt action rifle had a metal box where the cartridges were put on top of a spring As the bolt opened the spring forced the cartridges up against a stop and the bolt pushed the top cartridge into the chamber as it closed After the rifle was fired the opening of the bolt ejected the empty cartridge case and the return stroke loaded a fresh round The cases held 3 5 or 6 cartridges each

The machine guns used were very big and needed at least 4 men to work them They had to be put on a very flat surface They had the power of 100 rifles and the infantry men hated the machine gunners If a machine gunner was caught he was more likely to be killed Larger field guns needed up to 12 men to operate them They fired shells which exploded when they hit

The first tank was called Little Willie and it had a crew of 3 men The maximum speed that it could travel was 3 mph and it was not able to cross the trenches The first tank battle Flers Courcelette named after the two villages that were the objectives for the attack started on 15 September 1916 Out of the 49 tanks that should have been there only 36 arrived This was the first time that tanks had been used in World War I but because they were only armed lightly and the mechanics of them often went wrong they did not make a great impact However casualties were low in the tank crews

Mines are a way to blow up the enemy and really shock the enemy Anti infantry land mines have been in use since the invention of gun powder and were used in the defence of breaches of fortresses in the 18th and 19th century However these were activated remotely by a defender lighting a very fast burning fuse at the appropriate moment The British used 10 mines on the first morning of the Battle of Somme to startle and damage the German front line The holes left by the mines were used by the Germans for machine guns though

Trenches There was a lot of disease in the trenches The toilets in the trenches were mainly buckets and holes This meant that diseases like dysentery spread very quickly Dysentery causes stomach pains and diarrhoea and sometimes sickness The body can become very dehydrated which can cause you to die The water supply in the trenches was not very good They added chloride of lime to purify the dirty water that the men collected from the shell holes but the soldiers did not like the taste of the chloride of lime it tasted a bit like our swimming pool water 

The soldiers in the trenches suffered from lice One man described them as pale fawn in colour and they left blotchy red bite marks all over the body Another soldier said The things lay in the seams of trousers in the deep furrows of long thick woolly pants and seemed impregnable in their deep entrenchment A lighted candle applied where they were thickest made them pop like Chinese crackers After a session of this my face would be covered with small blood spots from extra big fellows which had popped too vigorously As well as causing lots of scratching lice also carried disease This was known as pyrrexhia or trench fever The first symptoms were shooting pains in the legs and this was followed by a very high fever The disease did not kill the soldiers but it did stop them from fighting Trench Foot was an infection caused by standing in the wet for a long time and not being able to dry your shoes and socks out Your feet would go numb at first and then turn red or blue and if you got gangrene you may have to have your foot amputated Brigadier General Frank Percy Crozier argued that The fight against the condition known as trench feet had been incessant and an uphill game The only way to get rid of trench foot was to dry your feet and change your socks several times a day

Lots of men injured in the trenches had parts of their bodies amputated This was from being wounded or having them blown off by mines or shells

The rats were there because there were loads of corpses of dead people One soldier claimed they were as big as cats his name was Harry Patch Another one said The rats were huge They were so big they would eat a wounded man if he couldnt defend himself The rats were found on corpses and they went for the eyes first then they burrowed into the corpse and ate the insides of the corpse

The area between the two sides was called No Mans Land and it was very dangerous because there was lots of barbed wire and shell holes and no mans land is usually a sea of mud Also the soldiers that went over the top were easy targets for enemy machine gunners Over the whole battle the whole of the Allies lost about 600000 men but the Germans lost just as many

The Prince of Wales served on the Somme as a Staff Officer Although genuinely disappointed not to be involved in the fighting the understanding his service gave him of ordinary men and the rest admiration he earned from them strongly influenced the rest of his life both as Prince of Wales

Today the place where the Battle of the Somme took place has lots of cemeteries war memorials and museums for people to visit and pay their respects

The Students for a Democratic Society was a student activist movement in the United States in the 1960s

A new SDS group was also begun in 2006 

SDS held its first meeting in 1960 at Ann Arbor Michigan They had their first convention in 1962 and criticized the political system of the United States for not bringing international peace or fixing problems in society at home It also called for non violent civil disobedience so that student youth could bring forth a participatory democracy

In the school year 1962 1963 the President of SDS was Tom Hayden who later became famous There were nine chapters around the country with at most about 1000 members The national office in New York City had only a few desks some broken chairs a couple of filing cabinets and a few typewriters 

On October 1 1964 the University of California Berkeley exploded into the free speech movement Led by a Friends of SNCC student activist named Mario Savio more than three thousand students surrounded a police car where a student arrested for setting up a card table against a ban by the University was being taken away The sit down stopped the police car from moving for 36 hours The demonstrations meetings and strikes all but shut the university down Hundreds of students were arrested SDS leaders watched and learned from this lesson

In February 1965 US President Lyndon Johnson made the war in Vietnam much bigger by bombing North Vietnam and putting ground troops right into fighting against the Viet Cong in the South The draft became a very real issue in the lives of students in America Campus chapters of SDS all over the country started to lead small local demonstrations against the war and the NO became the main group that organized the March against the war in Washington DC on April 17 

The first teach in against the war was held in the University of Michigan Soon hundreds more all over the country were held The demonstration in Washington DC attracted about 25000 anti war protesters and SDS became the leading student group against the war on most US campuses

The 1965 summer convention was held at Kewadin Northern Michigan and the National Office moved from Manhattan to Chicago at about the same time This brought more changes 

For the first time at an SDS meeting people smoked marijuana Pancho Villa mustaches blue workshirts denim jackets and boots were worn by both men and women These were people generally raised outside of the East many from the Midwest and Southwest

The Winter and Spring of 1967 saw more militancy of the protests at many campuses Harassment by the authorities was also on the rise The hippie movement really began to take hold The 1967 convention spoke on the draft and resisting within the Army itself and made a call for immediate withdrawal from Vietnam Also a womens liberation vote was passed for the first time

That Fall saw more anti war actions The school year started with a large demonstration against the University of Wisconsin in Madison Wisconsin on October 17 for letting Dow recruiters on campus Peaceful at first the demonstrations turned to a sit in that was violently broken up by the Madison police and riot squad causing many injuries and arrests A rally and a student strike then closed the university for several days Demonstrations against the draft led by members of the Resistance the War Resisters League and SDS added fuel to the fire of resistance After regular civil rights tactics of peaceful pickets the Oakland California Stop the Draft Week ended in mass hit and run fights with the police The huge October 21 March on the Pentagon saw hundreds arrested and hurt Night time raids on draft offices began to spread

In the spring of 1968 National SDS activists led an effort on the campuses called Ten Days of Resistance and local chapters held rallies marches sit ins and teach ins ending in a one day strike on April 26 About a million students stayed away from classes that day the largest ever student strike in the history of the United States It was mostly ignored by the New York City based national media which was more focused on the student shutdown of Columbia University in NYC led by an inter racial alliance of Columbia SDS chapter activists and Student Afro Society activists Because of the Columbia Student Revolt SDS became a household name in the United States for a few years and membership in SDS chapters around the United States grew greatly during the 1968 69 school year 

In the summer of 1969 the ninth SDS national convention was held at the Chicago Coliseum with some 2000 people attending Many groups of the movement were there even Communists and set up their tables all around the edges of the hall together with undercover spies creating an air of excitement 

Each of the delegates was given a paper saying You dont need a Weatherman to know which way the wind blows This was written by a group who later became called the Weathermen and were involved in more violent protests They took over by voting out another large group the convention quickly fell apart and so did SDS

Beginning January 2006 there is a movement to start a new SDS A small group of old SDS members joined with a Connecticut high school student to call for a new SDS fighting for civil rights and against war Several chapters at various colleges were later started On Martin Luther King Day of 2006 these chapters called for the first national convention since 1969 to be held in the summer of 2006  

Lately SDS has been in actions against war The Pace University chapter of SDS protested against a speech by Bill Clinton held at the campus causing the university to hand over two students to the United States Secret Service When the school was going to kick these two students out of school Pace SDS began a movement in March 2006 protesting the Universitys actions

On March 19 2006 SDS marched in New York City against the war in Iraq Seventeen people were arrested at the Times Square Recruitment Center including several SDS members Beginning in March and continuing into April and May SDS chapters across the country participated in the Immigrant Rights Movement On April 29 2006 SDS was in the march for Peace Justice and Democracy in Manhattan NY As of July 2006 there are 150 SDS chapters located around the country and over 1000 members

The newly formed SDS held its first national convention from August 4 to August 7 2006 at the University of Chicago 

A postulate is a statement that is agreed by everyone to be obvious and correct This is useful for creating proofs in mathematics and science and postulates are often the basic truth of a much larger theory or law

Postulates themselves cannot be proven but since they are usually obviously correct this is not a problem Here is a good example of a postulate

Using this postulate and four others like it Euclid brought a new understanding of geometry to the world and many people think they are some of the most influential works in geometry even now

There are also a few characteristics that all postulates should have

Postulates are sometimes proved to be wrong after they have been known for a long time but this is usually because something new has been discovered and the original creator could not have known any better

Consistency could mean

Influence is a force of change that comes from the outside of the person or thing that is influenced by it It can be either planned by others on purpose or an unplanned result of other events

The adjective influential means having much influence so influential people or things have the power to change other people or things in some way This word is often used to describe famous people For example Mohandas Gandhi was a very influential person because the things he did and said changed many peoples lives and many people believe he has even influenced the world

Influence can be a bad thing too For example World War II influenced many peoples lives making it very difficult for them to live happily even after the war ended

In law driving under the influence usually means drunk driving in other words driving a car or other vehicle which is a crime in most places

Existence usually means the state or fact of being but there are many different views on the meaning of the word existence and what it means to exist

In English existence is usually connected with the verb to be

The first sentence can be understood to say I exist as a human and simply speaking this is probably true The fourth sentence is more difficult to understand because it can be understood to say seven exists as the sum of four and three but seven is not something that we can see or touch like a pen or a human

The question What is existence is a very important one for philosophers and many people think Aristotle is the first human being to have thought seriously about the question

A Viennese waltz is a music and dance which started in Vienna in the late 18th century It is a ballroom dance in 34 time It is the most famous of all dance forms It became extremely popular during the 19th century and is still danced today Many famous composers wrote waltzes for piano or for orchestra The rhythm of the waltz can be heard in lots of music not just in pieces which are called a waltz

It is difficult to know exactly when the waltz started The word comes from a German word walzen which means to turn This is because the dancers turn around as they spin round the dance floor There were German dances called Lndler which were simpler than the minuet and popular amongst ordinary people The waltz developed from these dances Schubert wrote many pieces called Lndler He also started to use the title Waltz Beethoven wrote 30 variations on a waltz that had been composed by Anton Diabelli

Many people thought that the new dance was bad This was because the dancing couples stood very close to one another and held one another in their arms Some people thought that it was very immoral and wrote angry letters to the newspapers saying that it was the end of civilised society However the waltz continued to be popular and many dance halls were opened where people could waltz

Composers became interested in the music of the waltz Weber wrote a piece called Invitation to the Dance It has a main tune then a set of variations and at the end it comes back to the first tune This form became a common way of writing a group of waltzes Two composers in Vienna who became well known for their waltzes were Joseph Lanner and Johann Strauss but the most famous of all was one of Strausss sons also called Johann Father and son are sometimes called Johann Strauss I and Johann Strauss II The son is often called the King of the Waltz He wrote many waltzes which are still very popular today On New Years Day the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra always give a concert which can be seen worldwide on television They play lots of Strauss waltzes The most famous one is called The Blue Danube

In the Romantic period there was hardly a composer who was not influenced by the waltz Chopin wrote about 15 piano waltzes some of them are very fast some are slower and more melancholy Brahms wrote 16 waltzes for piano duet Many composers wrote waltzes in their operas especially when the story is about people dancing at a party The waltz was used a lot in operettas and ballets Tchaikovsky wrote lots of waltz music in Swan Lake Sleeping Beauty and The Nutcracker Even Wagner whose music is mostly very serious wrote a waltz in his opera Parsifal The rhythm of the waltz can be heard in a lot of orchestral music eg Berliozs Symphonie Fantastique The great composers Anton Bruckner and Gustav Mahler preferred to use the old German Lndler in their symphonies

Although the 19th century was the greatest period of the waltz people continued to write and dance waltzes in the 20th century In his opera Der Rosenkavalier the German composer Richard Strauss the story is about Vienna in the old days and so he uses the waltz to create the feeling of a time that was past The waltz continued to be used in a lot of operettas eg by Franz Lhar in The Merry Widow The French composer Maurice Ravel wrote waltzes including a brilliant piece for orchestra which was simply called La Valse Like Richard Strauss in Der Rosenkavalier Ravel was trying to describe the music of a century ago La Valse is a piece which lasts about 20 minutes in one continuous movement Lots of different instruments have a share in playing many different tunes

The Viennese waltz is one of the five dances in international ballroom dance It is the only one not invented in the early 20th century It is the only one where the figures which competitors dance is restricted Only nine figures are permitted by the World Dance Council

Thus in this dance marking is influenced entirely by the actual dancing and the value of choreography is almost nil

Sir Malcolm Arnold was an English composer He is famous for writing symphonies concertos and film music People disagree about whether he is one of the really great composers or just a very skilled musician His music is often very tuneful sometimes it is sentimental He could write music very quickly His famous music for the film The Bridge on the River Kwai was composed in ten days

In 1938 Malcolm Arnold went to the Royal College of Music to study composition with Gordon Jacob He started his career as a trumpeter with the London Philharmonic Orchestra later becoming principal trumpet By the late 1940s he was concentrating on his composing career

Arnold was composing at a time when many composers were writing music which was quite atonal which made it hard to understand but Arnolds music is tonal and there are many tunes which are easy to remember He wrote nine symphonies and several concertos for different instruments even unusual instruments like the harmonica Some of his best orchestral works are the set of dances English Dances Scottish Dances and Cornish Dances  He also wrote 2 operas 7 ballets and 2 string quartets His overture Tam OShanter is very exciting It tells in music the story in the poem by Robert Burns

Arnold wrote music for 132 films The most famous is The Bridge on the River Kwai for which he won an Oscar He was the first British composer ever to have won this award This film includes the famous Colonel Bogey March This march had been written many years earlier but Arnold composed a countermelody to it His original music for the film includes the famous River Kwai March  Other films for which he wrote music include The Belles of St Trinians The Inn of the Sixth Happiness and Whistle Down the Wind 

He was made a CBE in 1970 and was knighted in 1993

Youth orchestras and amateur orchestras enjoy playing his works because they are an exciting mixture of classical jazz popular and folk music and are not too difficult to play

Arnolds health was often very poor At times he fought with alcoholism and depression and in his later years with dementia He had moved to Dublin in 1972 but moved back to England in 1984 and settled in Attleborough Norfolk His full time carer Anthony Day helped him a lot during his final years

Arnold died from a chest infection in September 2006

Bamberg is a town in the region of Upper Franconia Bavaria and the seat of the district administration Bamberg 

The town has about 70000 inhabitants Bamberg is an university city and administrative city Its Lord Mayor is Andreas Starke Beside being a modern regional centre the city also has a cultural and historical side

Bamberg is a famous town because it has many buildings which are very old The basic structure of the town remained untouched through the centuries Unlike most other German towns it was little damaged in World War II Only 46 was totally ruined The town centre is protected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site

Bamberg is like Rome because it is built on seven hills each one with a church at the top The cathedral is on the main hill For hundreds of years the prince bishops of the cathedral ruled over the land This continued until the beginning of the 19th century after which they just continued in their religious function as archbishops 

The town centre below is built by the banks of the river Regnitz which splits into two parts The left arm of the river is where the old town centre lies The right arm is the Main Danube canalwhich allows big ships to travel from the river Main to the Danube

Many tourists visit the beautiful city of Bamberg A good place to start a walk round the town is by the statue of Neptune in the pedestrian precinct The Bambergers call this statue Gabelmann because Neptune is holding his three pronged fork It is a favourite meeting place for people 

The area here is called the Grner Markt This place became centre of the bourgeois settlement which developed around it Very close by is a big square called Maximiliansplatz It is very lively here on market days There are many things for sale and people eat the traditional sausages which are cooked at the sausage stall and drink Bamberg beer When the square is empty it looks very big There used to be a church at the north west end but it was destroyed in 1806 at the time when the archbishops lost their political power The patronage of St Martin was taken over by the former Jesuit church which was built by the architect Georg Dientzenhofer until 1693 situated at the Green Market

The names of nearby streets tell a lot about the town history There is the Fischstrasse where fishermen used to live This leads down to the left arm of the river Regnitz where one can see the place where the boats used to stop to load and unload their goods The small building by the broken wikt linkhoisthoists is the old slaughterhouse The left arm itself splits for a short while because the Old Canal runs along the east side making a large island on which there are some very old buildings The oldest buildings dating from the 16th century were built by tanners who became quite rich through their trade of making leather

Bambergs Old Town Hall was built in the middle of the river Regnitz It is not on the island but it is was built by the people who drove huge beams of wood into the riverbed Their town hall therefore stood between the south west bank where the bishops ruled and the north east bank where the ordinary tradespeople lived 

The Old Town Hall is the most often photographed building of Bamberg There are two bridges here for pedestrians the Upper and Lower Bridge The ancient Lower Bridge passes through the archway of the town hall On one side there are beautiful Baroque paintings On the other side one can still see the medieval black and white walls This side was also plastered over with paintings in the Baroque times but when a bridge nearby was blown up in World War II the plaster fell off so it is now kept with the original medieval walls showing

A steep climb up a cobbled street takes us to the Cathedral Square which is extremely beautiful All the buildings around the square are made from the local sandstone although they date from different periods Bamberg Cathedral shows Romanesque and Gothic architecture 

Everyone should have seen the world famed Rider or Bamberg horseman inside and many other medieval sandstone figures as well The Ratsstube is built in the Renaissance style The Alte Hofhaltung is medieval It is a 15th century courtyard with a long row of two storey buildings with a wooden gallery Across the street from there is the New Residence which is a Baroque palace A walk through here leads into the famous Rose Garden From here one can see Abbey Church of St Michael at the very top of the hill Just below going back towards the river is the Sandstrasse famous for its pubs and night life

Bamberg is home to the world famous Bamberger Symphoniker who perform in a new concert hall a short distance from the town centre There are also many other music groups including the Musica Canterey Bamberg who perform old music in some of the historical buildings The 19th century German writer ETAHoffmann lived in Bamberg There is a new theatre in the town centre which is named after him

Bamberg has a railway station from where one can travel to other large towns such as Wrzburg Munich Nuremberg Leipzig Berlin and Hamburg as well as to other towns in eastern Upper Franconia such as Forchheim Lichtenfels Coburg and Kronach

Bamberg is served by Bamberg Breitenau Airfield At Flugplatz Bamberg Breitenau are operating mostly public aircraft although it is classificated as a military airport 

It is also possible to charter public flights to and from this airport 

Most international tourists who travel by plane arrive at Frankfurt International Airport or Munich Airport The nearest bigger airport is Nuremberg Airport which can be reached within half an hour by car or one hour by train

Bamberg has a problem with road traffic because although there is a bypass it cannot go all the way round the town because of the hills Traffic is not allowed in many streets in the town centre There is no parking allowed in the beautiful Domplatz except on Sundays

Because Bamberg is on a river transport by boat has always been important The Rhine Main Danube Canal begins near Bamberg It was completed in 1992 and makes it possible for boats to travel from the North Sea to the Black Sea

In the town itself many people travel by bus There is also a Park and Ride system

There is a University in Bamberg About 9000 students study there The university is spread over lots of buildings in the town centre It is a good way to make use of many of the large historical buildings

Diving is a form of movement downwards either from air to ground or to water Diving is also a sport Diving is often done from a springboard or an elevated platform

There are six different types of dives and four different body positions that a person can use when diving 

There are six different types of dives Four of the types depend on whether the diver is facing towards the water or away from the water and if they rotate towards or away from the water The other two dives can be a part of the first four For example a diver can do a inward twisting or a forward armstand dive The basic types of dives are

The four different body positions are tuck pike straight and free

Pulsars are neutron stars that turn quickly and produce electromagnetic radiation that can be received in the form of radio waves The strength of radiation changes according to a regular period of time which is thought to match to the period of time in which the star turns Pulsars also show a so called lighthouse effect which occurs when the light and other radiation from a pulsar are only seen at certain periods of time and not all of the time Werner Becker of the Max Planck Institut fr extraterrestrische Physik recently said

The first pulsar was discovered in 1967 by wenJocelyn Bell Burnell and wenAntony Hewish of the wenUniversity of Cambridge UK At first they did not understand why pulsars have a regular change in the strength of radiation they called their discovery LGM 1 for wenlittle green men their pulsar was later called wenCP 1919 and is now known by a number of names including PSR 191921 The word pulsar is short for pulsating star and was first seen written in 1968

wenAstrophysicist wenPeter A Sturrock writes that when the first regular radio signals from pulsars were discovered the Cambridge scientists seriously considered that they might have come from an wenextraterrestrial civilization They debated this possibility and decided that if this proved to be correct they could not make an announcement without checking with higher authorities There was even some discussion about whether it might be in the best interests of mankind to destroy the evidence and forget it That is to say when pulsars were discovered the scientists thought they might be signals from another planet and the news might be dangerous to society

CP 1919 produces radio wavelengths but pulsars have later been found to produce radiation in the X ray andor wengamma ray wavelengths Hewish received the 1974 Nobel Prize in Physics for this and similar work about radio astronomy

Astronomers know that there are three different kinds of pulsars named by the source of energy that powers the radiation

Although all three kinds of objects are neutron stars the things that they can be seen to do and the physics that causes this are very different But there are some things that are similar For example wenX ray pulsars are probably old rotation powered pulsars that have already lost most of their energy and can only be seen again after their binary companions expanded and matter from them started falling onto the neutron star The process of accretion can in turn give enough wenangular momentum energy to the neutron star to change it into a rotation powered wenmillisecond pulsar

In June 2006 astronomer wenJohn Middleditch and his team at wenLANL was the first to forecast glitches with information that they received from the wenRossi X ray Timing Explorer They used information received from the pulsar wenPSR J0537 6910

The study of pulsars has resulted in many uses in physics and astronomy Major examples include the proof of wengravitational radiation as forecasted by general relativity and the first proof of planets around other stars

The United States Constitution is the highest law of the United States of America It was put in writing on September 17 1787 by the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia Pennsylvania and later put into effect or ratified by representatives of the people of the first 13 states When nine of the states ratified the document they put forth a union of sovereign states and a federal government for that union That government started on March 4 1789 taking the place of the Articles of Confederation

The Constitution of the United States is the oldest federal constitution now in use

Since 1787 changes have been made to the United States Constitution 27 times by amendments The first ten of these amendments are together called the Bill of Rights

When it was written in 1787 the Constitution had a preamble and seven main parts called articles

The Preamble says

The Preamble is not a law It gives the reasons for writing the Constitution The Preamble is one of the best known parts of the Constitution The first three words We the people are used very often The six intentions that are listed are the goals of the constitution

Article One says that the US Congress will make the laws for the United States Congress has two parts called Houses the House of Representatives and the Senate The Article says who can be elected to each part of Congress and how they are elected

The House of Representatives has members elected by the people in each state The number of members from each state depends on how many people live there Each member of the House of Representatives is elected for two years The Senate has two members called Senators for each state no matter how many people live there Each Senator is elected for six years The original Constitution says that Senators should be elected by the state legislatures but this was changed later by the seventeenth amendment

Article One also says how the Congress will do its business and what kinds of laws it can make It lists some kinds of laws the Congress and the states cannot make Article One also makes rules for Congress to impeach and remove from office the President Vice President judges and other government officers

Article Two says that the President will carry out the laws made by Congress This article says how the President and Vice President are elected and who can be elected to these offices The President and Vice President are elected by a special Electoral College chosen by the states for four years The Vice President takes over as President if the President dies or resigns or is unable to serve Article Two also says that the President is in charge of the army and navy He can make treaties with other countries but these must be approved by two thirds of the Senate He appoints judges ambassadors and other officers but the Senate also must approve these appointments The President can also veto bills However Congress can override the veto

Article Three says there will be a court system including the Supreme Court The article says that Congress can decide which courts besides the Supreme Court are needed It says what kinds of cases and controversies these courts can decide Article Three also requires trial by jury in all criminal cases and defines the crime of treason

Article Four is about the states It says that all states must give full faith and credit to the laws of the other states It also says that state governments must treat citizens of other states as fairly as they treat their own citizens and must send arrested people back to another state if they have been charged with a crime 

Article Four also says that Congress can make new states There were only 13 states in 1787 Now there are 50 United States It says Congress can make rules for Federal property and can govern territories that have not yet been made into states Article Four says the United States must make sure that each state has a republican form of government and protect the states from invasion and violence

Article Five says how to amend or change the Constitution Congress can write a change if two thirds of the members in each House agree The state governments can call a convention to write changes although this has not happened since 1787 Any change that is written by Congress or by a convention must be sent to the state legislatures or to state conventions for their approval Congress decides whether to send a change to the legislatures or to conventions Three fourths of the states must approve a change for it to become part of the Constitution

An amendment can change any part of the Constitution except one no amendment can change the rule that each state has equal suffrage in the Senate

Article Six says that the Constitution and the laws and treaties of the United States are higher than any other laws It also says that all federal and state officers must swear to support the Constitution 

Article Seven says that the new government under the Constitution would not start until conventions in at least nine states approved the Constitution

Since 1787 Congress has written 33 amendments to change the Constitution but the states have ratified only 27 of them 

The first ten amendments are called the Bill of Rights They were made in 1791 All of these changes limited the power of the federal government They were

After the Bill of Rights there are 17 more changes to the Constitution that were made at different times

The space time continuum is a mathematical model that combines space and time into a single construct This spacetime is usually explained with a model where space is three dimensional and time has the role of the fourth dimension 

If one follows the model of space that Euclid had our universe has three dimensions of space and one dimension of time By combining space and time into a single manifold physicists have simplified a good deal of physical theory as well as described in a more uniform way the workings of the universe at both levels the very large and very small

Where an important quantity of matter exists it changes the geometry of spacetime this geometry can be understood as gravity The white lines on the picture on the right do not represent the curvature of space but instead represent the coordinate system imposed on the curved spacetime which would be rectilinear in a flat spacetime

In classical mechanics the use of spacetime over Euclidean space is optional as time is independent of mechanical motion in three dimensions In relativistic contexts however time cannot be separated from the three dimensions of space as it depends on an objects velocity relative to the speed of light

The origins of this 20th century scientific theory began in the 19th century with fiction writers Edgar Allan Poe stated in his essay on cosmology titled Eureka that space and duration are one This is the first known instance of suggesting space and time to be different perceptions of one thing Poe arrived at this conclusion after approximately 90 pages of reasoning but employed no mathematics In 1895 HG Wells in his novel The Time Machine wrote There is no difference between Time and any of the three dimensions of Space except that our consciousness moves along it He added Scientific peopleknow very well that Time is only a kind of Space 

Albert Einsteins 1905 theory of special relativity is the beginning of the concept of spacetime but the first mathematical theory of spacetime was proposed by one of his teachers the mathematician Hermann Minkowski in a 1908 essay His concept of Minkowski space is the earliest treatment of space and time as two aspects of a unified whole the essence of special relativity The idea of Minkowski space also led to special relativity being viewed in a more geometrical way this geometric viewpoint of spacetime being important in general relativity too The 1926 thirteenth edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica included an article by Einstein titled space time

Esztergom is a city in Hungary 45 kilometers north of Budapest 30 928 people live in Esztergom It is the center of the Roman Catholic Church in Hungary and the Constitutional court is in the city There are a lot of rich museums in the city

Esztergom is on the right side of the river Danube There are big islands on the Danube There are mountains to the east that surround the city The city is 10035 km big

The city was founded in 972 by Gza of Hungary It is one of the oldest cities in Hungary Until 1249 it was the capital of the country The archbishops built many schools churches palaces and the kings of Hungary built castles In 1242 the city was attacked and destroyed by mongols but the castle on the hill was not After the attack king Bla IV moved to Buda and gave the city to the archbishop In 1543 the city was taken by the Turks who built many spas The Hungarians tried to take back the city many times so it was destroyed again in the wars The Turks left Esztergom in 1683 In 1822 Alexander Rudnay the archbishop started building a big temple called a basilica It is the biggest temple and the tallest building in the country and the third biggest temple in Europe

Public transport is a way for the public to travel around It is a way for people to travel quickly and cheaply without needing their own cars Public transport lets many people travel at the same time

Public transport started around 1826 in Nantes France and has become the easiest way to travelfactdateJuly 2010 The first forms of public transport were ferries and animals such as horses Horses also pulled carts People would sit in the carts and the horses would pull them where they wanted to go

The main types of public transport are buses trolleybuses trams and trains Trams were first used in the late 1860s and used to be pulled by horses  Now trams are electric and run on a line of cable Buses drive on the road like cars do Trolleybuses are like buses but they use electricity from two wires above the road Trains run on a track and are very fast Many placesfact use trams and trains as a form of public transport

Many people who do not have cars use buses trolleybuses trams to go places near their house and they use trains to go places far away Public transport is good because it is easy to use so anybody can go on it

When using public transport people may need a ticket or card to be able to get on On trams they get a ticket that they put in a machine and it tells them when their ticket runs out On buses and trolleybuses they buy their ticket from the driver and put it into a machine and on trains they use a ticket to get into the train station to catch their train A timetable tells them when they come

Public transport is also good for the environment When people use public transport it means that there are fewer cars on the road With fewer cars on the road there is less pollution created in the world Another good thing about public transport is the cost It is very cheap to catch public transport every day and lots of people like public transport better than their cars

Public transportation comes in many forms

Some of these types are often not for use by the general public eg elevators in offices and apartment buildings buses for personnel or school children etc

Stations are an important aspect of any public transportation system Specific types include

In addition one can get on or off of a taxi at any road where stopping is allowed Some fixed route buses allow getting on and off at suitable unmarked locations along that route typically called a hail and ride section

Money is needed to build and operate a public transit system The money comes from ticket revenue government subsidies and advertisements If ticket prices are too high people will not use public transit So most systems charge passengers less than the full cost of building and operating the system The percentage of total revenue that passengers pay is known as the farebox recovery ratio Sometimes a small amount of income comes from land development and rental income from stores and vendors and parking fees Some subway systems get money from telecommunication companies by leasing tunnels and rights of way to carry fiber optic communication lines

Mostbut not allpublic transport systems need users to buy of a ticket to use the system Tickets may either be bought before the time of the ride at the time of the ride or both Tickets can be paper ticket metal or plastic tokens or an electronic card Sometimes a ticket has to be validated A paper ticket is stamped when it is validated An electronic ticket is checked in

Tickets may be valid for a single trip or valid within a certain area for a period of time The fare is based on the travel class either based on the traveled distance or on a zone pricing

The tickets may have to be shown or checked automatically at the station platform or when going onto the system or during the ride by a conductor Operators may choose to control all passengers allowing sale of the ticket at the time of ride Alternatively a proof of payment system allows passengers to enter the vehicles without showing the ticket Riders may or may not be controlled by a ticket controller If the rider does not show proof of payment the operator may fine the rider

Multi use tickets allow a passenger to travel more than once These include return tickets where the passenger pay for two trips at one time It also includes period cards allowing travel within a certain area or during a given number of days that can be chosen within a longer period of time Some transit systems sell tickets aimed at tourists that allow free or discounted entry at many tourist attractions typically include zero fare public transport within a city Period tickets may be for a particular journey or for a whole network

A free travel pass allows free and unlimited travel within a system Free passes are sometimes granted to particular social sectors for example students old people children employees and the physical or mentally disabled In the United States an employer can pay for a portion of a travel pass without that payment being taxed So transit systems allow employers to pay the system directly and to distribute the passes to employees

Free or Zero fare public transport services are funded in full by means other than collecting a fare from passengers 

Zero fare services may be funded by national regional or local government through taxation or by commercial sponsorship by businesses They usually use relatively small vehicles such as buses and trams

Several mid size European cities and many smaller towns around the world have converted their entire bus networks to zero fare

Local zero fare shuttles or inner city loops are far more common than city wide systems

Some means of rail based public transport are also tourist attractions andor well known landmarks in their own right These include San Franciscos famous cable cars the Molli steam powered train in Bad Doberan the kusttram along the whole Flemish coast the Schwebebahn Wuppertal the Seattle Monorail and the Christchurch Tram
