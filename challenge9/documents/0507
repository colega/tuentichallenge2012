A trolley is a small vehicle with wheels that can carry things People can push trolleys

There are different kind of trolleys There are shopping trolleys which are used in supermarkets and other large stores with self service In American English these are called shopping carriages or shopping carts Customers can put things they want to buy in the trolley and then pay for everything at the checkout Usually they are then allowed to wheel the trolley with the things they have bought out to their car

Sometimes the customers have to pay a small deposit when collecting a trolley The trolleys are chained together The customer puts in a coin which he can have back again when he parks the trolley back in the trolley chain

Trolleys are used in airports and some large railway stations for passengers to carry their luggage

A trolley can also be a tea trolley This is a small trolley used traditionally in the house for plates cups saucers and sandwiches and cakes for afternoon tea Tea trolleys are also used in hospitals and offices to take cups of tea and coffee to people

In American English trolley can be used to mean a tram This is not to be confused with a trolleybus which is a bus which uses electricity from an overhead cable

When someone says He is off his trolley it means that he is crazy

A mutant is a type of fictional character in a fictional universe created by Marvel Comics In this world mutants can be either heroes or villains A mutant is someone who has different DNA than its parents These mutations often lead to superpowers They may also cause physical changes such as wings blue skin or a tail

Mutants were created in the Marvel Universe in the 1960s with the comic book The X Men It was a way for them to tell stories that dealt with racism Racism hatred and fear of mutants are an important part of their history Two main teams of mutants have been around since the 1960s The X Men and the Brotherhood of Mutants

Sometime a human is born with a certain kind of DNA change This x gene is passed to their children This genetic change may not create any noticeable difference It could pass for generations without anyone knowing about it 

Mutants may be born to human or mutant parents though the odds of a mutant birth are much better for the latter Likewise it is rare but possible for mutant parents to have human children termed baseline by characters within the Marvel Universe Some baseline humans are genetically predisposed towards having mutant descendants such as the Guthrie family Mutant children born to mutant parent will not necessarily have the same power as their parent nor will they necessarily have the same power as any mutant siblings they may have however examples of children with the same power as their parents andor siblings are not uncommon 

There is however a chance that mutants may not even be able to reproduce a child at all The Hayes telepathic mutant doctors were unsure their mutant heritage could even produce a child it did however take them several years to finally have a child Molly Hayes

Marvels mutants are classified by their level of power

The X Men were created in the 1960s during a time of civil unrest in the United States The characters allowed the writer to write stories that showed racism and bigotry without singling out a specific minority

By classifying Mutants as they did they also created different aspects of racism Some mutants are easily recognized by how they look Some have a few physical characteristics that can make them get notices Other mutants blend in so well that it nearly impossible to tell they are a mutant unless they use their powers

In the Marvel universe normal people often hate and fear mutants This is because they think mutants may make normal humans extinct They fear what they do not understand They are jealous of them having superpowers Bigotry and xenophobia are also reasons for hatred of mutants In the Marvel universe anti mutant feeling has led to the separation of mutants from society It has led to mob violence and government sponsored tries to fight mutants

The X Men books have been written as typical superhero comic books They have epic adventures and battles with super villains Yet the idea of mutants as a metaphor for real world minorities who face oppression is shown throughout the series Some examples

The urethra is a tube that connects the bladder to the outside of the body It allows people and animals to remove urine from the body People and animals control urination using the urethral sphincter

The urethra is part of the urinary system in mammals Because humans are mammals they have urethras In male mammals the urethra is also a part of the reproductive system because males use it as a tube for sperm during sex

In human anatomy men have longer urethras then women This means that women have bladder infections more often because their bladders are closer to the outside Because the male urethra is longer and is not straight inserting a catheter is more difficult in men

In women the urethra is 25 4 cm long Its opening to the outside of the body is part of the vulva The female urethra is between the clitoris and the opening to the vagina In men the urethra is about 20 cm long and its opening to the outside of the body is at the end of the penis

The Treaty of Versailles was a treaty to make peace between the five nations France Germany Britain Austria and the United States after World War I The treaty was made in 1919 but German government did not participate in it In fact Germany had the choice between signing it or face the occupation of Germany by Allied troops This was known as a diktat The French made the Treaty unfavorable for the Germans so that Germany would not be able to start a new war Thus Germany had to reduce its armed forces from 6 million to 100000 men and was forced to get rid of its submarines military aircraft and a lot of their artillery such as cannons Their Navy were also forced to limit the amount of battleships they owned to only six Germany also had to give back those French territories it had occupied as well as large territories of its own to Poland for instance and all its colonies A heavy economical burden for Germany was to pay back a great sum for the damage done to the Allied countries mostly France during World War I by German troops This sum was not fixed 132 billion goldmarks had to be paid only as a first part of the German debts They only finished paying off this debt in 2010 This Treaty can be seen as a one sided peace diktat for Germany a treaty which later was used as a reason for Germanys nationalists and Adolf Hitler to try to get the support of the Germans to get rid of the chains of Versailles which finally led to World War II

One of the parts of the treaty was that there would be a League of Nations which decided things after the treaty was signed It could not stop World War II but it was very helpful in the earlier yearsfactdateJuly 2010

Germany had to give back French parts taken by Germany in the Franco Prussian War which Germany had won and was an embarrassment for France The French made Germany take its troops out of the Rhineland which was an important part of land for Germany where many factories and businesses existed If Germany put troops back into the Rhineland the punishment would be France invading Germany

Germany also had to give many parts to Poland a new country made out of old Russian and Austrian parts and the Polish and Lithuanian people who lived in them Poland was a very strong kingdom a few hundred years before but Austria Prussia and Russia had split it between them This made the Polish people unhappy and they were given a country again

Belgium was given Moresnet and Eupen and Malmedy This is the main reason that Belgium now has a German speaking Community

Versailles also split up many large empires on the losing side The US President Woodrow Wilson thought this was a very good idea because many people in Europe wanted to be free from the big empires But it also created problems

Austria Hungary was split into many countries One was Austria Austria was meant to be the homeland of the Austrians who spoke German and mainly ruled Austria Hungary Its capital was Vienna One of the problems of Versailles was that many Germans like Adolf Hitler thought that Austria was meant to be part of Germany and would occupy it later on

The new country of Hungary was also created Like Poland it was a country that was strong on its own centuries before but then it merged into one with Austria which made a very big empire Its capital was Budapest Another country Czechoslovakia was created which was meant to be the homeland of the Czechs and Slovaks The Czech part was made up of the country once called Bohemia and Moravia Its capital was Prague There were many Germans living on its borders which was why Germany would later on think should belong to them

Italy gained parts of Austria

It was agreed in another treaty called the Treaty of Svres that Greece would take parts of Western Turkey and its past most important city Constantinople from Turkey Greece took them at first but a new Turkish army drove the Greeks out killing many Greek people Greece did gain most of the islands in the Aegean Sea from Turkey and parts of Bulgaria

The League of Nations decided that parts of old Turkey were given to France and Great Britain to protect and keep peace in the area Britain ruled Palestine Iraq and Transjordan which would become Israel Iraq and Jordan France ruled Syria and Lebanon

A big problem for Germany was to pay back a giant amount of money for the all of the damage done to the Allied countries mostly France during World War I This made Germany one of the poorest countries in Europe for almost 20 years and caused political fighting in GermanyGermany officially finished paying off its debt on Sunday October 3 2010 The two most important parties the Communists and the Nazis fought for many years

The debt to the Allies was made easier for the Germans during the Great Depression and all debt was cancelled in 1932 Many Germans hated the treaty and some even wanted to fight more after Versailles 

The League of Nations created after Versailles was usually not powerful enough to stop wars either Japan took a part of China called Manchuria and the League was not able to stop it Italy invaded Ethiopia and although the Ethiopian Emperor begged the League to help him it did not Germany Japan and Italy became the Axis powers and by invading many peaceful countries caused World War II The United States and the USSR did not even join the League even though it was the idea of US President Woodrow Wilson in the first place The League was never taken seriously even though it was created to make sure Versailles was respected The treaty failed to keep peace in the end and was a reason for Nazi Germany and Adolf Hitler to win the support of the poorer Germans to get rid of the chains of Versailles leading to World War II

Colonialism occurs when a country takes control of other lands regions or territories outside of its borders by turning those other lands regions or territories into a colony Usually it is a more powerful richer country that takes control of a smaller less powerful region or territory Sometimes the word imperialism is also used to refer to colonialism

In the 1700s and 1800s many of the richer more powerful European countries established colonies in the continents of Africa South America and the Caribbean

Some countries use colonialism to get more land for their people to live in When countries are using colonialism to get more land for their people to live in the country will help settlers move to the new region or territory The local people living in the land or territories were usually moved away by using force and violence from armies To protect these settlers from the local residents who were pushed aside colonial nations often set up a military fort or colonial police system 

Other countries use colonialism to get more land so that they can use the land for farming or to extract resources such as trees coal or metals or creating a local government or military fort 

Other countries use colonialism so that they can get workers from the poorer country to work in factories or farms In the past powerful countries that were colonizing poorer countries or regions often forced the people from the poorer countries to work as slaves 

The Phoenicians the Ancient Greeks expanded their territories by using colonialism Ancient Greece was not a country It was made of many cities Each city was a country of its own with a government in place Some city states were monarchies others elected the people who governed by the people who were citizens of that city and who lived there This is called democracy

Those cities also fought wars against each other and traded goods To get more blow jobs influence or to secure a trade route the city would send people called settlers to a new place These people would then make a new city called a colony The cities had to pay some form of taxes to the old city in exchange for protection for example

If the settlers found a local tribe living in the new territory they would wage war against it to force them to leave The local tribe was usually made into slaves The new colony would exploit the land it found by growing crops or by raising cattle

There are several different types of colonialism Some countries that expanded their territory used Settler colonies Some countries that started out as settler colonies include the United States Canada Australia New Zealand and Argentina In all of these countries people from European countries moved to the new region and forced the local people to move When the local people or tribes had to move it caused a lot of problems

In some regions which were colonized the settlers married the local people and had children with them An example is Mexico where a new people called the mestizos came from the marriages of the settlers and the local tribes In other regions which were colonized the settlers and the local people lived in separate areas without living together or marrying An example of this situation is French Algeria or Southern Rhodesia 

Another type of colonialism is when a powerful country sets up dependencies With a dependency the colonizing country does not send over thousands of settlers to the new territory Indstead the colonizing country sets up administrators that controls the existing local populations or tribes Examples include the British Raj in which the British government controlled India the Dutch East Indies in which the Netherlands controlled parts of the East Indies and the Japanese colonial empire in which Japan controlled Asian territories

With the plantation colony the powerful rich country use the poorer countrys land to grow crops The local people are forced to become slaves and work on the farms Examples of plantation colonies include Barbados Saint Domingue and Jamaica 

Another type of colony is the trading post colony Rich and powerful countries set up trading post colonies so that there would be a territory where trading selling and business could be conducted The rich and powerful countries usually set up military forts or police forces to enforce the rules and laws of the colonizing country Examples of trading colonies include Macau Malacca Deshima and Singapore

The Electric guitar is a type of musical instrument It was made in 1931 by George Beauchamp It is a string instrument usually played with a pick and sometimes with the fingers It uses things called electric pickups which are wire wound magnets that change the vibration of the strings into electric current This electric current is then sent to an amplifier that changed it to sound This electric current can also be changed to produce effects

The main parts of an electric guitar are the neck the pickups the tuners the bridge the input the body the frets the pick guard the volume knobs and the tone knobs There may also be other parts that can change other sounds A normal electric guitar has one neck with 6 strings on it although there are 12 string guitars and guitars with more than one neck

Each line represents a string Tab is always read as if the player were holding the guitar on their lap strings facing up Each number then represents what fret the finger is placed on

D   2      2                                                         

A    2     2

The above diagram would be to play an open E chord picking each string individually and then strumming the chord If the notes are stacked directly above each other it means to strum the chord

Some guitar music is written in both musical note format and tablature The musical notes are written out with the corresponding tablature under each line of notes

Set theory is the study of sets in mathematics Sets are collections of objects We refer to these objects as elements or members of the set

The reason why set theory was made is that collections of objects can cause problems if you work with them without explaining them better It was made by people like Georg Cantor and Bertrand Russell

Set theory begins by giving some examples of things that are sets Then it gives rules in which you can make other sets from the already known sets Collections of objects that are not sets are called classes It is possible to do mathematics using only sets rather than classes so that the problems that classes cause in mathematics do not occur

A binary relation between two sets is the subset relation also called set inclusion If all the members of set mathA are also members of set mathB then mathA is a subset of mathB marking mathA B For example math12 is a subset of math123 but math14 is not From this example it is clear that a set is a subset of itself In cases where one wishes to not to have this the term proper subset is meant not to have this possibility

The selfconsidering object in the set theory was existing too an example numbers 11 21 2 31 2 3 and so on

The three Brythonic languages are Welsh Cornish and Breton Of these Cornish became extinct in the 18th century but people have started speaking it again now Welsh is spoken everywhere throughout Wales but is mainly the first language for people in the western part of Wales in the area some people call the Bro Gymraeg Breton is spoken mainly in west Brittany Breton is the only Celtic language not mainly spoken in the British Isles 

Scottish Gaelic also has a native community of speakers in Canada where it was once very widely spoken and there are Welsh speakers in Patagonia Argentina

Flint or flintstone is a kind of sedimentary rock made of silica 

Bands of flint are found in chalk which is an Upper Cretaceous rock laid down in the continental shelves of a tropical sea

When the chalk is eroded the hard flint nodules survive as pebbles on a shingle beach It may happen that the pebbles later get cemented into another rock such as a puddingstone In this way they make up a sedimentary rock for the second time

Flint is a cryptocrystalline form of the mineral quartz It is a variety of chert It occurs as a line of knobbly masses in chalk and some limestones Inside the nodule flint is usually translucent and can be various colours A thin layer on the outside of the nodules is usually different in colour typically white and rough in texture

Flintstones often have a rough lumpy surface but when they are broken they look like dull grease coloured glass It has been one of the most useful types of stone to humankind

Flint was often used in prehistoric times to make stone tools Flint handaxes were used by early man for about two million years When flintstones are broken they have a sharp edge which could be used as a knife or a scraper 

When two flintstones are hit together they can make a spark For many centuries flint was one of the main ways for people in many countries to make fire People would carry a little box called a tinder box which had some flintstones and tinder The tinder was used to catch the spark and start a fire Tinder could be sawdust cloth grass or bark Flints were used to make a spark to fire a gun A gun that used flint was called a flint lock gun

Flintstones are used in some countries for building In England the flintstones used for building were often knapped which means they were broken to show the inside This made a nicer finish on the building that the dull knobbly stones wouldnt have made

Navigation is how ships or aircraft find their way from one place to another The word navigation came from the word navgatih from the language of Sanskrit The Latin language word navis means ship navigation is literally art of ship mastery The word is also used as a metaphor for finding ones way

One type of navigation was made by the Polynesians and is called Polynesian Navigation They used different things found all around us to find their way from place to place For example

Likewise the Scandinavians developed a skill of following the stars in the night at sea The Scandinavian seafarers Vikings knew that the star called Polaris does not change location and points to the north They knew that the north was where Polaris was They would then know the latitude by measuring the angle between Polaris and the horizon They also used animals especially birds to know if land was nearby and they knew that specific kind of clouds form near land and that waves are different near land than at high seas

As time went by better methods of navigation were invented or discovered Some of which are

Compass was first invented in China It was later invented in France in 12th century

Navigation can also be used to talk about traffic For example The channel will be open to navigation when the bridge has be opened 

Words that mean the same thing as navigation are Sailing Seafaring Pilotage Piloting

Hercules is an animated Disney movie It is based on the Greek legend of Hercules but it is very different than the original story It was more like Superman Rocky and The Karate Kid Unlike most Disney movies it had a very different style due to the fact that the British cartoonist Gerald Scarfe helped make the movie

Crazy Horse was an Oglala Sioux Native American chief There is a huge sculpture being carved of him in South Dakota United States 

When Crazy Horse was first born he was given the name Curly When he was young he had a vision when he was not supposed to and his family did not know where he was His father found him and was very unhappy at what young Curly had done As Crazy Horse grew into a man he was given his fathers name Crazy Horse His father then changed his own name to Worm 

Crazy Horse had good medicine so he was never killed when he went into battle He led his people to the Little Bighorn river in northern Montana to join forces with other Sioux bands like the Hunkpapa and Miniconjou and with other tribes like the Cheyennes and Arapahos There they fought General George Armstrong Custer killing and defeating him and his many horsemen

Eventually Crazy Horse made a tough decision to lead his people the Oglalas to a reservation because they were starving Game was scarce and the bison were nearly gone He had no choice but to leave the Black Hills When he arrived at Fort Robinson he was forced to give up his weapons and horses This made him very unhappy One day even though he was granted time to go on a hunt he was lied to and trying to get away he was stabbed in his liver and died later that night thus ending the Great Sioux War

Once I moved about like the wind Now I surrender to you and that is all Quote by Geronimo Chief of the Apaches 

The Sioux Royal Family the House of Thasunke Witko are descendants of Crazy Horse A queen Queen Wakiyan was elected Queen of the Kingdom of Lakota and of the Oglala Sioux and tried to improve the economy at the Pine Ridge Reservation with creativity and imagination and to bring the Sioux forward into modern timeshowever a conspiracy of jealous chieftains who were both male chauvinists opposed to having a female leader and also a corrupt group of men jealous of their own power and who prefer to preside over the poverty of the Sioux People ruthlessly trumped up false allegations in order to depose this good queen

A trench is a long narrow ditch It is like a valley only on a very much smaller scale It was used in World War I it was supposed to be a short term barrier but many trenches started to be made so soldiers would be safer

The following kinds exist

The trench coat got its name from there 

A trench coat is a type of outdoor clothing Trenchcoats are long coats made from stiff material like heavy duty cotton They were invented for soldiers to wear in The First World War to keep them warm Most trench coats also protect the wearer against rain

In the 1950s trench coats became a popular fashion item In the 1980s and 1990s trench coats were worn by punk rock musicians and gothic rock musicians 

A trumpet is a brass instrument used mainly in Classical music and jazz music The most common type of trumpet is a Bb trumpet meaning that if the player plays a C it will sound like a Bb in concert pitch The trumpet is played by blowing into the mouthpiece and making a buzzing sound There are three keys called valves that the player can press to change the pitch

The trumpet has been around for about 3000 years An early example of a brass instrument like a trumpet is called a shofar which is still used in religious ceremonies Eventually people started making trumpet like instruments with wood and later with brass

Many years ago when the use of instrumental music was growing trumpets became very important Trumpets were long and without valves This meant a player had to control the pitch of the sound with only his mouth which was very difficult Everyone respected trumpet players because trumpets were just so difficult to play

The chromatic trumpet was developed in the late 18th century Later on valves were developed and it became easier to play notes on the trumpet Still trumpet is a difficult instrument to master

Classical music is written for solo trumpet and trumpets are included in orchestras Trumpets play an important part in Jazz music and other various popular genres Sometimes they also play short parts to emphasize sections in rock songs

Some famous classical trumpet players are Adolph Herseth Sergei Nakariakov and Maurice Andre

Some famous jazz trumpet players are Miles Davis Louis Armstrong Arturo Sandoval Wynton Marsalis Dizzy Gillepsie and Maynard Ferguson

A microwave is a kind of high frequency radio wave It is often used to cook food in a microwave oven

We can see waves travelling through water There are many sorts of these waves such as ripples swell tsunamis and even sound waves that we do not see but we hear if our ears are under the water 

Likewise many different types of waves can travel through the air We detect one type with our eyes as colours we detect another type when it lands on our skin as warmth another type is called X rays Other types of these invisible waves are called microwaves 

We cannot see them They can quickly penetrate quite deep into materials that contain water for example most food The energy in these waves makes the water molecules vibrate faster which means the water gets hotter 

Although they can also heat some metals there are materials including many plastics which they pass right through without heating at all Although many plastics used in bowls or cups will melt and get super heated in microwave ovens

A microwave oven is a machine that cooks food using microwaves a type of radio wave The idea was discovered when a scientist who was experimenting with radio waves saw his chocolate bar which he was holding at that time melt He then knew that radio waves could cook food and invented the microwave oven 

Food is placed inside the oven and buttons on the screen are pressed to set how long the food should be cooked A microwave oven is one of the fastest ways of cooking

The microwave oven uses a magnetron This is similar to a radio transmitter It makes very short radio waves which go right into the food to a depth of about 25cm This makes water molecules swing to and fro at about 25 billion times a second This heats up the molecules around it As they heat up the heat goes to the inside of the food This process is called conduction This also happens in a normal oven but the energy goes deeper so that the food cooks much faster In an ordinary oven the energy stays mostly near the surface

Cobalt is a chemical element It has an atomic number of 27 and an atomic mass of about 59 It is a metal

Cobalt is a transition metal It is shiny and conducts electricity It is magnetic It is a hard metal It is moderately reactive Iron is more reactive and copper is less reactive It dissolves slowly in acids This reaction makes hydrogen and a salt of cobalt Cobalt is normally in its 2 oxidation state as an ion Some chemical compounds contain cobalt ions in its 4 oxidation state Cobalt chloride is one of the most common cobalt compounds Many cobalt compounds are blue or pink One of them is black

Cobalt is too reactive to occur pure in the earth It is found in certain minerals It is found with copper and nickel deposits Normally the three metals are bonded to arsenic and sulfur It is found as a byproduct when copper and nickel are produced It is made by reaction with the sludge from copper and nickel processing

Cobalt is used in some types of steel It hardens the steel It is also used to make very strong tough alloys These alloys are known as superalloys Some cobalt compounds are used in the lithium ion battery Cobalt compounds were used as an artificial food coloring until 1971 It was discovered that it has harmful effects It is used to make glass blue It is also used as a catalyst It is also used in some medicines

The human body needs small amounts of cobalt for certain vitamins Cobalt compounds are used to stop cyanide from poisoning the body

Canidae is a family of carnivorous and omnivorous mammals of the order Carnivora Animals that belong to the family Canidae are called canids The family Canidae is divided into two tribes Vulpini and Canini Canids of the tribe Vulpini are called vulpines Canids of the tribe Canini are called canines Some people call all these canids canines but this is wrong

Examples of canids are dogs wolves foxes coyotes and jackals

Nickel is a chemical element It has an atomic number of 28 and an atomic mass of about 59 It has 28 protons It is a transition metal 

Nickel is a silver white metal It is a little golden colored It is easily polished It is magnetic It is not magnetic when heated above convert355CF It is not soft like many other metals It can be stretched into wires easily It is not radioactive

Nickel is not a reactive metal It dissolves slowly in acids It does not rust like iron It makes a thin coating of nickel oxide which stops more corrosion Aluminium does a similar thing 

Nickel is in several oxidation states 2 Nickelis the most common 3 Nickel also is common Nickel in its 2 oxidation state is green Nickel chloride is a common 2 oxidation state compound Nickel oxide is normally dark green but sometimes it is gray This is because some of the nickel is in the 3 oxidation state nickel Nickel compounds are oxidizing agents They also are grayish Nickel compounds can be green blue gray or black FileNickel chloride hexahydrate samplejpgNickel chloride FileNickel sulfate hexahydrate samplejpgNickel sulfate 

Nickel is not normally found as a metal in the ground Sometimes meteorites have nickel and iron metal in them Normally nickel is in minerals Nickel hydroxides sulfides and silicates are common ores Russia makes the most nickel

Nickel was found when a copper colored ore did not make copper metal Later it was found out that the ore was actually a nickel ore Nickel was isolated as a metal in 1751 At first the copper colored nickel ore was the only source Later it was made as a byproduct of cobalt blue making

Nickel is made from sulfide ores They are heated to melt them and concentrate them They are also separated by oils Nickel is made from its sulfide by heating it in air This oxidizes the sulfide to sulfur dioxide leaving liquid nickel behind This nickel is not pure Only about 75 of it is nickel

Nickel can be made purer It can react with carbon monoxide to make nickel carbonyl a gas when warm All the impurities are left behind The nickel carbonyl is blown into nickel pellets where it coats the pellets with pure nickel and puts out carbon monoxide The carbon monoxide is reused 

Another way to make the nickel pure is by dissolving it in an acid Then it is electrolyzed to make nickel at the cathode

Nickel is used in metal alloys Stainless steel contains nickel Nickel is also used in nichrome a name for a nickel chromium alloy Nickel is used in coins such as nickels It is used in magnets Nickel is used in special expensive alloys called superalloys

It is used in rechargeable batteries They are also used to electroplate nickel on items Nickel and some of its compounds are also used as a catalyst 

Nickel can irritate skin That is why nickel jewelry is bad for some people Some nickel salts are carcinogens Nickel is not as toxic as other metals such as lead or mercury but it is still toxic

A fox is a small mammal There are 27 species of fox Foxes are carnivores they hunt and eat live prey mostly rabbits and rodents They may also eat grasshoppers birds eggs and even fruit and berries Sometimes they eat carrion 

Foxes are the smallest members of the family Canidae Canidae are mammals which are related to dogs They are swift and agile runners and live in family groups A female fox is called a vixen Foxes plump bushy tail is easily visible A fox can use its tail for sending signals to its family members Part of the tails function is to store fat for lean times 

Foxes are found throughout all continents inhabiting mostly forest shrub land and desert regions They were not native to Australia but were introduced in some way In the United Kingdom it was a common sport for people to hunt foxes with horses and dogs This is now banned

A food pyramid is a chart that can be used to see how many servings of each food should be eaten each day It is for having good health

Grains give carbohydrates and some vitamins and minerals Vegetables and fruits give a lot of vitamins some minerals and few fats but fruits often have more calories and sugar Dairy products have protein some fat and a lot of calcium an element that helps build strong bones Meat have protein some fat and B vitamins Fats oils and sweets give calories fats and sugars but not a lot of nutrition

Coyote is an animal of the Canidae family The word coyote comes from the Nhuatl word cyotl

The color of the coyotes fur is a grayish brown to yellowish gray on the upper parts while the throat and underside are a more white color The forelegs sides of the head muzzle and feet are reddish brown

Coyotes live only in North America and some areas of Central America They live in the countryside but also in cities too The coyote is found though out North American from California up to as far as Alaska They normally live in dens about 6 feet wide and four feet tall

The coyote is an omnivore and can eat many kinds of food fruits grasses and vegetables in the autumn and winter months along with small mammals for example rabbits mice shrews voles and foxes They also eat birds deer snakes and lizards In the city coyotes find food easily They dig up plants in gardens and eat food out of garbage cans 

Sometimes they join small packs but normally hunt alone Coyotes live in dens They dig a tunnel under the ground and then dig out a larger area at the end of the tunnel where they sleep and have their babies or pups They can have six pups at a time Often a coyote den will have two entrances with one that is hidden Sometimes they dig more than one den so they can move if an enemy finds the den

Coyotes do not have many enemies Wolves used to eat coyotes but there are not many wolves left in North America compared to the number of coyotes The biggest enemy of the coyote is people They do not usually attack people but sometimes eat small pets such as cats

Vole is a small mammal similar to a mouse 

There are about 70 species of voles There are species in Europe Asia North Africa and North America Adult voles depending on the species are 75 to 175 centimetres long 

Depending on the species they eat seeds grass or other plants and insects

Many animals hunt voles for example wolves owls hawks coyotes foxes weasels and cats

An isthmus is a narrow strip of land with water on either side that connects two bigger landmasses For example the Isthmus of Panama connects the continents of The Americas

Rodents are a group of mammals They form the order Rodentia 

They have four incisors that keep growing and must be kept worn down by gnawing this is the origin of the name from the Latin rodere to gnaw and dent tooth

Most rodents are small Examples of commonly known rodents are mice rats chipmunks and squirrels Some other small rodents sometimes kept as pets are Guinea pigs hamsters and gerbils

Examples of larger rodents are porcupines beavers and the largest living rodent the capybara which can grow to between 105 and 135 cm in length and weigh 35 to 65 kg

Almost half of all mammal species are rodents More examples of rodents are voles prairie dogs groundhogs and chinchillas

Rabbits hares and pikas are sometimes called rodents because they also have teeth that keep growing But in 1912 biologists decided to put them in a new separate order Lagomorpha because they have two extra incisors in their upper jaw

Shrews are sometimes called rodents because they look like mice but that is not correct They are in the order Insectivora

Titan is one of Saturns moons Its equatorial diameter is 5150 km and it orbits 1221865 km away from Saturn It was found by Christiaan Huygens on March 25 1655 Titan is the largest moon of Saturn and the second largest of the Solar System Titan is larger than the planet Mercury Titan has the greatest atmosphere of any moon with more than Earth but humans cannot breathe it as its very cold and also poisonous The air is made of nitrogen and methane It is also the only place in the Solar System except Earth that has lakes and lots of liquid on its surface However it is liquid methane not water

Titan was discovered on 25 March 1655 by Christiaan Huygens an astronomer from The Netherlands Earlier in 1610 the astronomer Galileo Galilei had discovered four of Jupiters moons This inspired Huygens he also wanted to discover new moons Because Huygens had also improved the telescopes of the time making them a lot better he thought he might be able to discover a new moon

Christiaan and his brother Constantijn started to build their own telescopes in 1650 Using the first telescope he ever built Christiaan Huygens was able to see Titan At first he called it Luna Saturni which means Saturns moon Through the years lots of other moons have been discovered and today the moon is known as Titan or as Saturn VI The name Titan and all the names of Saturns other moons are from the Greek legends

Titan is the only moon in the Solar System that has a thick atmosphere After the spacecraft Voyager I visited the moon on 12 November 1979 it showed that Titans surface is hidden under an atmosphere that is 900 km thick Before this everyone thought that Titan was the biggest moon in the Solar System Now we know that it is the second biggest after Ganymede one of Jupiters moons

Even though it is smaller Titan is close in size to Ganymede It is also close in size to the slightly smaller Callisto another of Jupiters moons Not only is Titan a big moon it is even bigger than the planet Mercury but it only has half as much mass Because Titan does not have a lot of mass scientist think that Titan is made of matter that is not very heavy specifically frozen water and ammonia Some scientists think that there is a lot of liquid water and ammonia underneath the surface enough to fill an entire ocean These scientists think that there might be a form of life inside this ocean

At its centre Titan has a rocky core that is about 3400 km thick This core is made up of silicates and metals The gravity is a lot weaker than here on earth If you could jump 1m high on the Earth you would be able to jump 7m high on Titan

It takes Titan 15 days and 22 hours to orbit around Saturn This is almost the same time it takes Saturn to rotate or spin around its own axis  one full spin This is known as synchronous rotation which means that the same side of Titan is always pointed to Saturn

The path in which Titan moves its orbit is very close to a circle but not quite We use the word eccentricity to describe the path that a moon or planet travels in An image with an eccentricity of 0 has a path that is a perfect circle If the eccentricity is more than 0 the path is less round Titans eccentricity is 0028 very close to zero

On July 1 2004 the Cassini Huygens probe entered into orbit around Saturn On December 25 2004 the Huygens probe separated from the Cassini probe and started to move towards Titan It landed on Titans surface on January 14 2005 It landed on a dry surface but it confirmed that large bodies of liquid exist on the moon The Cassini probe continued to gain data of Titan and a number of the icy moons It found evidence that the moon Enceladus had water erupting from its geysers Cassini also proved in July 2006 that Titan contained hydrocarbon lakes located near its north pole In March 2007 it discovered a large hydrocarbon lake the size of the Caspian Sea near its north pole The lake of liquid methane has been named Kraken Mare In 2009 Nasa showed a photograph showing the sunlight reflecting off the surface of the lake This was the first ever picture of liquid on another world

Rabat population 627 000 hab is the capital of the Kingdom of Morocco It is also the capital of the Rabat Sal Zemmour Zaer region

The city is on the Atlantic Ocean at the mouth of the river Bou Regreg On the other side of the river is Rabats bedroom community Together the two cities with Temara have a population of 18 million Silting problems have lowered the citys role as a port However Rabat and Sal still maintain somewhat important textile food processing and construction industries Some are from sweatshop labor by major businesses

In addition tourism and being home to all foreign embassies in Morocco help to make Rabat the second most important city in the country after the larger and economically more significant Casablanca

Rabats history began with a settlement known as Chellah on the banks of the Oued Bou Regreg in the third century BC In 40 AD Romans took over Chellah and changed it to the Roman settlement of Sala Colonia Rome held the colony until 250 AD They gave it up to local rulers In 1146 the Almohad ruler Abd al Mumin turned Rabats ribat into a full scale fortress It was used as a starting point for attacks on Spain In 1170 due to its military importance Rabat acquired the title Ribatu l Fath meaning stronghold of victory from which it gets its current name 

Yaqub al Mansur another Almohad Caliph moved the capital of his empire to Rabat He built Rabats city walls the Kasbah of the Udayas and began construction on what would have been the worlds largest mosque However Yaqub died and construction stopped The ruins of the unfinished mosque along with the Hassan Tower still stand today

Yaqubs death a period of decline at first The Almohad empire lost control of its land in Spain and much of its African territory Eventually this led to its total collapse In the 13th century much of Rabats economic power shifted to Fez In 1515 a Moorish explorer El Wassan reported that Rabat had declined so much that only 100 houses remained with people living in them An increase of Moriscos who had been removed from Spain in the early 17th century helped boost Rabats growth

Rabat and neighboring Sal united to form the Republic of Bou Regreg in 1627 The republic was run by Barbary pirates who used the two cities as base ports for starting attacks on shipping The pirates did not have to fight with any central authority until the Alaouite Dynasty united Morocco in 1666 They attempted to establish control over the pirates but failed European and Muslims authorities continued to attempt to control the pirates over many years The Republic of Bou Regreg did not collapse until 1818 Even after the republics collapse pirates continued to use the port of Rabat This led to the attack of the city by Austria in 1829 after an Austrian ship had been lost to a pirate attack

The French invaded Morocco in 1912 and established a protectorate The French administrator of Morocco General Hubert Lyautey decided to move the countrys capital from Fez to Rabat Among other factors citizens had made Fez an unstable place because of their desire to rebel Sultan Moulay Youssef followed the decision of the French and moved his home to Rabat In 1913 Gen Lyautey hired Henri Prost who designed the Ville Nouvelle as an administrative sector When Morocco became independent in 1956 Mohammed V the then King of Morocco chose to have the capital remain at Rabat

After World War II the United States created a military presence in Rabat at the former French air base By the early 1950s Rabat Sal Air Base was a US Air Force based hosting the 17th Air Force and the 5th Air Division These divisions oversaw forward basing for Strategic Air Command B 47 Stratojet aircraft in the country With the destabilization of French government in Morocco and Moroccan independence in 1956 the government of Mohammed V wanted the US Air Force to pull out of the SAC bases in Morocco He insisted on such action after Americans became involved in Lebanon in 1958 The United States agreed to leave as of December 1959 They were fully out of Morocco by 1963 SAC felt the Moroccan bases were much less critical with the long range capability of the B 52 Stratofortresses that were replacing the B 47s It also had completed USAF bases in Spain in 1959 

With the USAF leaving Rabat Sal in the 1960s the facility became a primary facility for the Royal Moroccan Air Force known as Air Base N 1 a status it continues to hold

Ejaculation happens when the body shoots out fluid after it has been aroused or stimulated Many animals ejaculate when they reproduce sexually This article is about ejaculation in human beings It is well known that a man ejaculates when he has an orgasm However it is believed that women also ejaculate

When a man is stimulated his penis becomes erect When he has an orgasm semen comes out from the end of his penis Semen contains sperm and other substances How long a man can be stimulated before ejaculating how long the ejaculation lasts the strength of the ejaculation and the amount of semen that comes out all vary from one man to another When a man ejaculates he has a very good feeling in his penis and his groin area A man can ejaculate after he masturbates or is touched by someone else sexually or even if he is not touched Ejaculation can also happen without control when a man is sleeping Boys do not ejaculate until they reach puberty

Scientists now think that women can also ejaculate when they have an orgasm They think that a woman ejaculates when her Grfenberg spot or G spot which is near the front of the vagina is stimulated and that the fluid comes out from somewhere near the opening of the urethra into the vulva They also think that the fluid is produced by the Skenes glands This fluid contains glucose and fructose which are kinds of sugars and other chemicals

In grammar an ejaculation is something spoken rather suddenly to express a feeling Oh Hey and My goodness are ejaculations Although it was common at the end of the 19th century and the start of the 20th century to call such terms ejaculations today it is considered old fashioned

In a man ejaculation is what happens when semen shoots out of the end of the penis Slang terms for ejaculation are blowing a load or blowing a wad busting a nut creaming cumming jizzing and skeeting Ejaculation takes place when the man has an orgasm usually after his genitals have been physically stimulated in some way However ejaculation can also happen if a man has not been touched for instance if he becomes aroused or stimulated by looking at sexy pictures watching sexy videos or thinking about sex When a man ejaculates while sleeping it is called nocturnal emission

Before a man can ejaculate his penis needs to be stimulated The penis is usually soft quite short and hangs down When a man is stimulated for example by seeing another naked person masturbating or being touched by someone else sexually the inside of his penis fills with blood This causes it to become longer thicker harder and to stand upright and is called having an erection Men can be stimulated for different amounts of time before they ejaculate

Ejaculation takes place in two stages

After a man has ejaculated his penis usually becomes soft and shorter again He may also have an enjoyable and relaxing feeling in his groin area It takes some time before he can have another erection and ejaculation This time is called the refractory period The average refractory period is about half an hour Younger men normally have a shorter refractory period than older men Men who are 18 years old have a refractory period of about 15 minutes while men in their 70s have one of about 20 hours Some mens penises remain hard after one ejaculation and they are able to have another ejaculation after some time without losing their erection Most young and middle aged men can probably have about two to three ejaculations in a few hours but it has been said that some men are able to have up to nine ejaculations a day

When a man ejaculates before he wants to this is called premature ejaculation If a man cannot ejaculate after having been aroused for a long time even though he wants to this is called delayed ejaculation or anorgasmia A man who is unable to ejaculate at all is said to have anejaculation Some men are able to have an orgasm without ejaculating This is called a dry orgasm

Apart from giving a man pleasure ejaculation may help a man stay healthy A study carried out in Australia seemed to show that men who ejaculate often have less chance of getting prostate cancer

Semen is known informally as cum jism or jizz Men ejaculate different amounts of semen Normally an ejaculation makes between 15 and 5 millilitres of semen More semen tends to come out if a man has not ejaculated for many days or if he has been stimulated for a long time Older men produce less semen If a man ejaculates an unusually small amount of semen this is a medical condition called hypospermia

Semen is usually a white or yellowish fluid It starts off being slightly thick and sticky then after a while it becomes more watery Semen contains many chemicals These include citric acid fructose enzymes that speed up chemical reactions in the body lipids and slippery fluids that help the semen to move through the urethra

The number of sperm in an ejaculation of semen depends on many things There may be more sperm if

If there are an unusually low number of sperm in an ejaculation this is called oligospermia If there are no sperm at all this is called azoospermia A man with oligospermia or azoospermia is usually infertile and cannot or finds it very hard to make a woman pregnant by having sex with her

If a man has a sexually transmitted infection or STI the germs that cause the disease can appear in his semen If the person that the man has sex with touches the semen he or she can become infected by the germs and pick up the disease AIDS gonorrhea hepatitis B herpes and syphillis are examples of STIs One of the ways for a man to lower the chance of passing on an STI to his sexual partner is to wear a condom on his penis when having sex

When a man has sexual intercourse with a woman he places his penis within her vagina and moves it in and out The vagina is warm and soft and it places pressure on the mans penis These sensations combined with the in and out movements stimulates the penis which causes the man to have an orgasm and to ejaculate If the woman is using birth control this will usually not cause her to become pregnant Otherwise the sperm in the semen can travel into the womans uterus and Fallopian tubes If there happens to be an ovum or egg cell in a Fallopian tube a sperm may fuse with the ovum This is called fertilization and makes the woman pregnant

However before a man ejaculates a clear colourless sticky fluid called pre ejaculate can come out of his penis Pre ejaculate is produced by the bulbourethral or Cowpers glands Some tests have shown that pre ejaculate does not contain any sperm However some sperm may have been left behind in the urethra from an earlier ejaculation and the pre ejaculate may carry this sperm out of the penis That is why a woman can become pregnant even if the man pulls his penis out of her vagina before he ejaculates Also if a man ejaculates near the womans vagina and semen falls on her body sperm can accidentally enter the vagina and cause a pregnancy To avoid the woman becoming pregnant when she does not want to the man and the woman can use methods of contraception or birth control For example the man can wear a condom on his penis or the woman can take birth control pills

Young boys cannot ejaculate A boys first ejaculation usually happens about one year after he begins puberty which is when his body starts changing into a mans body Most boys go through puberty in their teens The first time a boy ejaculates usually happens when he is asleep This is called a nocturnal emission or a wet dream It happens without the boys control often when he is having a dream about sex Scientists believe that wet dreams are the bodys way of removing too much semenTemplateFact When a boy begins masturbating wet dreams usually stop happening

When a boy starts to ejaculate he usually produces only a small amount of semen The semen is different from what an adult man produces It is usually clear and stays sticky It either has no sperm in it or sperm that do not move properly or do not move at all A boys semen only becomes like an adult mans semen about two years after his first ejaculation

Female ejaculation informally known as gushing or squirting happens when a woman has an orgasm and clear fluid comes out of her Scientists are not sure how the fluid is produced but think it comes from the Skenes glands Female ejaculation was mentioned in ancient times by the Greek philosopher Aristotle and by doctors and people who study anatomy However in much of the 20th century there were people who did not believe that female ejaculation existed and it was not studied in detail More people found out about the matter after a book called The G Spot came out in 1982 and became popular After that more research was done on female ejaculation

Many doctors and scientists now agree that there is such a thing as female ejaculation but do not know much about how it happens or how the womans body makes the fluid ejaculated Some think that female ejaculation mostly happens when a womans Grfenberg spot or G spot which is near the front of the vagina is stimulated It is not known for sure if the fluid is ejaculated from the urethra or the vagina However in 2007 tests by researchers from Vienna in Austria found that there is tissue like glands around a womans urethra and that substances made by the tissue enter the urethra near its opening into the vulva Therefore it is more likely that during female ejaculation the fluid comes out from the urethra It is thought that the Skenes glands make the fluid because female ejaculate contains a protein called prostate specific antigen and the Skenes gland is known to make PSA

Scientists have asked women about female ejaculation Between 54 and 60 of these women said that when they had an orgasm fluid came out of them Out of these women 6 said they ejaculated regularly and that it was strong while 13 said they ejaculated now and then A doctor called Gary Schubach believes that most women can learn how to ejaculate if taught how

Some scientists think that female ejaculation is just urine leaking out of a womans urethra However studies show that the fluid ejaculated is not exactly the same as urine although it has small amounts of urine in it The fluid is alkaline and has these substances in it

Some diseases or sicknesses can cause large amounts of fluid to come out of women For example fluid can come out of a womans vagina if she has an infection of the vagina or a sexually transmitted infection Some women also suffer from urinary stress incontinence which means that sometimes they cannot stop urine from leaking out Because of this if large amounts of fluid come out from a womans vulva it is a good idea for her to see a doctor in case it is not female ejaculation but some kind of sickness

A team is a group of people who have a certain task to complete In order to meet their target the members of the group must work well with each other

Successful team  a group of people who tend to meet their target without facing any sort of barrier The group members cooperate with each other and take other members ideas into consideration

Unsuccessful team  a group of people who have a very difficult time when attempting to complete a certain task The members of the group think of only themselves and create an uncomfortable environment for other members of the team

The name Shwa was given to Hirohito after he died Emperors of Japan are normally renamed in this way and people started using the new name in 1990 During his long reign many people outside Japan call him Emperor Hirohito or just Hirohito

Prince Hirohito was named regent for his father in 1921 He became emperor after his fathers death

Hirohito was the emperor of Japan during the war in the Pacific and Asia from 1931 to 1945 His role in this period is controversial

After Japans defeat in the war the role of emperor changed The emperor became a symbol of the state

Hirohito was the first emperor to travel outside Japan He visited Europe in 1971 and he traveled to the United States in 1975

After his passing cancer was revealed as the cause of the emperors death 

He was succeeded by his son Prince Akihito

The state funeral for the late emperor was an international event World leaders attending the funeral included US President George H W Bush French President Franois Mitterrand the Duke of Edinburgh 

Emperor Shwa is buried in the Imperial mausoleum in Hachiji along with Emperor Taish

In an overview of writings by and about Hirohito OCLCWorldCat includes roughly 900 works in 1500 publications in 15 languages and 31000 library holdings  

Human evolution is about the origin of the human beings All humans belong to the same species which has spread from its birthplace in Africa to almost all parts of the world Its origin in Africa is proved by the fossils which have been found there

The term human in this context means the genus Homo However studies of human evolution usually include other hominids such as the Australopithecines from which the genus Homo had diverged by about 23 to 24 million years ago in Africa

It was known for a long time several centuries that man and the apes were related At heart their anatomy is similar despite many superficial differences This was the reason why Buffon and Linnaeus in the 18th century put them together in one family Charles Darwins theory of evolution says that such basic structural similarity comes from the common origin of the group The apes and man are close relatives and are primates the order of mammals which includes monkeys apes lemurs and tarsiers 

The great apes live in tropical rainforests It is thought that human evolution started when a group of apes began to live more in the savannah Savannah is more open with trees shrubs and grass This group the australopithecines started walking on two legs They began to use their hands to carry things Life in the open was quite different and there was a big advantage in having better brains Their brains grew to be much larger and they began to make simple tools All this began at least 5 million years ago We have fossils of two or three different groups of walking apes and one was the ancestor of humans

The biological name for human or man is Homo The modern human species is called Homo sapiens Sapiens means thought Homo sapiens means the thinking man 

The science that is concerned with finding out how human evolution happened is called physical anthropology or paleoanthropology It explains how the human race developed by looking at ancient humans fossils tools and other signs of human life in the past The modern field of paleoanthropology began in the 19th century with the discovery of a skull of Neanderthal man in 1856

By 1859 zoologists had known for a long time that humans were in their anatomy similar to the great apes There were also differences humans can speak for example But the similarities were more basic than the differences Humans also have features with a much older history from early in the life of vertebrates 

The idea that species were the result of evolution had been proposed before Darwin but his book gave much evidence and many were persuaded by it The book was On the Origin of Species by means of Natural Selection published in November 1859 In this book Darwin wrote about the idea of evolution in general rather than the evolution of humans Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history was all Darwin wrote on the subject Nevertheless the implications of the theory were clear to the readers of the time

Different people discussed the evolution of humans Among them were Thomas Huxley and Charles Lyell Huxley convincingly illustrated many of the similarities and differences between humans and apes in his 1863 book Evidence as to Mans Place in Nature When Darwin published his own book on the subject The Descent of Man and selection in relation to sex the idea of human evolution was already well known The theory was controversial Even some of Darwins supporters did not like the idea that human beings have evolved their impressive mental capacities and moral sensibilities through natural selection

Since the 18th century scientists thought the great apes to be closely related to human beings In the 19th century they speculated that the closest living relatives of humans were either chimpanzees or gorillas Both live in central Africa in tropical rainforests mainly of the Congo It turns out that the chimpanzee species are closest to us Biologists believed that humans share a common ancestor with other African great apes and that fossils of these ancestors would be found in Africa which they have been It is now accepted by virtually all biologists that humans are not only similar to the great apes but actually are great apes

The issue was finally settled in modern times by studies on the sequences of proteins and genes in apes and man These studies showed that man shares about 9899 of these structures with chimpanzees This is a much closer relationship than with any other type of animal and fully supports the ideas put forward in the 19th century by Darwin and Huxley

Primates have diversified in habitats such as trees and bushes They retain many features which are adaptations to this environment Here are some of those traits

Not all primates exhibit these anatomical traits nor is every trait unique to primates In regard to behavior primates are frequently highly social live in groups with flexible dominance hierarchies

Closely related animals almost always have closely related parasites This usually comes about because parasites evolve with their hosts and when host populations split their parasites split also It is also possible for parasites to get from one species to another Two of the most serious parasitic infections of humans in Africa have originated in apes Each may have been transferred to humans by a single cross species event 

There are several species of mosquito and several species of the malarial parasite Plasmodium The most serious type P falciparum which kills many millions of people each year originated in gorillas It is now virtually certain that chimpanzees are the source of HIV 1 the major cause of AIDS This information is got by the sequence analysis of the nucleic acid of ape and human parasites

The relevance of this to evolution is that our physiology is so close to the apes that their parasites were able to transfer to humans with great success Humans have much less resistance to these parasites which are ancient in origin but comparatively new to our species

It was not until the 1920s that hominid fossils were discovered in Africa In 1924 Raymond Dart described Australopithecus africanus The specimen was called the Taung Child an australopithecine infant discovered in a cave deposit being mined for concrete at Taung South Africa The remains were a remarkably well preserved tiny skull and a cast of the inside of the individuals skull Although the brain was small its shape was rounded unlike that of chimpanzees and gorillas and more like a modern human brain Also the specimen exhibited short canine teeth and the position of the foramen magnum was evidence of bipedal locomotion All of these traits convinced Dart that the Taung baby was a bipedal human ancestor a transitional form between apes and humans 

It took another 20 years before Darts claims were taken seriously This was after other similar skeletons had been found The most common view of the time was that a large brain evolved before bipedality the ability to move on two feet It was thought that intelligence similar to that of modern humans was a prerequisite to bipedalism 

The australopithecines are now thought to be immediate ancestors of the genus Homo the group to which modern humans belong Both australopithecines and Homo sapiens are part of the tribe Hominini but recent data has brought into doubt the position of A africanus as a direct ancestor of modern humans it may well have been a cousin The australopithecines were originally classified as either gracile or robust The robust variety of Australopithecus has since been reclassified as Paranthropus although it is still regarded as a subgenus of Australopithecus by some authors

In the 1930s when the robust specimens were first described the Paranthropus genus was used During the 1960s the robust variety was moved into Australopithecus The recent trend has been back to the original classification as a separate genus

It was Carolus Linnaeus who chose the name Homo Today there is only one species in the genus Homo sapiens There were other species but they became extinct 

The figure shows where some of them lived and at what time Some of the other species might have been ancestors of H sapiens Many were likely our cousins they developed away from our ancestral line 

Anthropologists are still investigating the exact line of descent A consensus on which should count as separate species and which as subspecies has not been reached yet In some cases this is because there are very few fossils in other cases it is due to the slight differences used to classify species in the Homo genus

The evolution of the genus Homo took place mostly in the Pleistocene The whole genus is characterised by its use of stone tools initially crude and becoming ever more sophisticated So much so that in archaeology and anthropology the Pleistocene is usually referred to as the Palaeolithic or the Stone Age

Homo habilils was likely the first species of Homo It developed from the Australopithecus about 25 million years ago It lived until about 14 million years ago It had smaller molars and larger brains than the Australopithecines

There are two proposed species that lived from 19 to 16 million years ago Their relation has not been clarified One of them is called Homo rudolfensis It is known from a single incomplete skull from Kenya Scientists have suggested that this was just another habilis but this has not been confirmed The other is currently called Homo georgicus It is from Georgia and may be an intermediate form between H habilis and H erectus or a sub species of H erectus

Homo erectus was first discovered on the island of Java in Indonesia in 1891 The discoverer Eugene Dubois originally called it Pithecanthropus erectus based on its morphology that he considered to be intermediate between that of humans and apes Homo erectus lived lived from about 18 million to 70000 years ago The earlier specimens are sometimes seen as a different species or a subspecies called Homo ergaster or Homo erectus ergaster 

In the Early Pleistocene 151 mya in Africa Asia and Europe presumably some populations of Homo habilis evolved larger brains and made more elaborate stone tools these differences and others are sufficient for anthropologists to classify them as a new species H erectus In addition H erectus was the first human ancestor to walk truly upright This was made possible by the evolution of locking knees and a different location of the foramen magnum They may have used fire to cook their meat

A famous example of Homo erectus is Peking Man others were found in Asia Africa and Europe Many paleoanthropologists are now using the term Homo ergaster for the non Asian forms of this group They reserve H erectus only for those fossils found in the Asian region that meet certain requirements which differ slightly from ergaster

Homo neaderthalensis lived from about 250000 to about 30000 years ago Also less usual as Homo sapiens neanderthalensis there is still some discussion if it was a separate species Homo neanderthalensis or a subspecies of H sapiens While the debate remains unsettled evidence from mitochondrial DNA and Y chromosomal DNA sequencing indicates that little or no gene flow occurred between H neanderthalensis and H sapiens and therefore the two were separate species In 1997 Dr Mark Stoneking then an associate professor of anthropology at Pennsylvania State University stated 

More investigation of a second source of Neanderthal DNA supported these findings

A genetic analysis of a piece of finger bone found in Siberia has produced a surprise result It dates to about 40000 years ago at a time when Neanderthals and modern man were living in the area German researchers found its mitochondrial DNA did not match either our species or Neanderthals The possibility is that the bone may belong to a previously unknown species The degree of difference in the DNA suggests this species split off from our family tree about a million years ago well before the split between our species and Neanderthals

Homo floresiensis which lived about 10000012000 years ago has been nicknamed hobbit for its small size Its size may be a result of island dwarfism the tendency for large mammals to evolve smaller forms on islands H floresiensis is intriguing both for its size and its age It is a concrete example of a recent species of the genus Homo that shows derived traits not shared with modern humans In other words H floresiensis share a common ancestor with modern humans but split from the modern human lineage and followed a different evolutionary path The main find was a skeleton believed to be a woman of about 30 years of age Found in 2003 it has been dated to approximately 18000 years old The living woman was estimated to be one meter in height with a brain volume of just 380 cm3

There is an ongoing debate over whether H floresiensis is indeed a separate species Some scientists believe that H floresiensis was a modern H sapiens suffering from pathological dwarfism Modern humans who live on Flores the island where the skeleton was found are pygmies This fact is consistent with either theory One line of attack on H floresiensis is that it was found with tools only associated with H sapiens

Stone artefacts have now been found on Flores which can be dated to a million years ago These artefacts are proxies which means there were no skeletons of humans but only a species of Homo could have made the artefacts The artefacts are flakes and other implements 48 in all some of which show signs of being worked to produce a cutting edge This means that humans were present on Flores by that date but it does not tell us which species that was

Homo sapiens has lived from about 250000 years ago to the present Between 400000 years ago and the second warm period in the Middle Pleistocene around 250000 years ago its skull grew and more sophisticated technologies based on stone tools developed One possibility is that a transition between H erectus to H sapiens occurred The evidence of Java Man suggests there was an initial migration of H erectus out of Africa Then much later a further development of H sapiens from H erectus in Africa Then a subsequent migration within and out of Africa eventually replaced the earlier H erectus 

Studies of human Y chromosome DNA and mitochondrial DNA have largely supported a recent African origin Evidence from autosomal DNA also supports the recent African origin The details of this great saga are not fully established yet but by about 90000 years ago they had moved into Eurasia and the Middle East This was the area where Neanderthals Homo neanderthalensis had been living for a long time

By about 42 to 44000 years ago Homo sapiens had reached western Europe including Britain In Europe and western Asia Homo sapiens replaced the Neanderthals by about 35000 years ago The details of how this happened are not known

At roughly the same time Homo sapiens arrived in Australia Their arrival in the Americas was much later about 15000 years ago All these earlier groups of modern man were hunter gatherers

Current research has established that human beings are genetically rather homogenous The DNA of individuals is more alike than usual for most species This may have resulted from their relatively recent evolution or from the Toba catastrophe Distinctive genetic have arisen as a result of small groups of people moving into new environmental circumstances These adapted traits are a very small component of the Homo sapiens genome and include such outward racial characteristics as skin color and nose shape and internal characteristics such as the ability to breathe more efficiently at high altitudes

H sapiens idaltu from Ethiopia about 160000 years ago is a proposed subspecies It is the oldest known anatomically modern human

ImageRoman Republic Empire mapgifthumb250pxArea under Roman control

 Ancient Rome is the name for a civilization which began as a small farming community in the 10th century BC Italy It grew to become the largst empire in the ancient world It started as a monarchy then became a republic then an empire

The Roman Empire was so big that there were problems ruling a territory which stretched from Britain to the Middle East In 293 AD Diocletian split the empire into two parts A century later in 395 AD it was permanently split into the Western Roman Empire and the Eastern Roman Empire

The Western Empire ended because of the Germanic tribe the Visigoths in 476 AD In the 5th century AD the western part of the empire split up into different kingdoms The eastern Roman Empire stayed together as the Byzantine Empire The Byzantine Empire would be defeated by the Ottoman Empire in 1453

Roman culture spread to Western Europe and the area around the Mediterranean Sea Its history still has a big influence on the world today For example Roman ideas about laws government art literature and language are important to European culture The Roman language Latin slowly evolved becoming modern French Spanish Italian and Romanian and influenced many other languages like English

Beginning with Emperor Nero in the first century AD the Roman government did not like Christianity At some points people could be put to death because they were Christians Under Emperor Diocletian the persecution of Christians because the strongest However Christianity became an officially supported religion in the Roman Empire under Constantine I who was the next Emperor With the signing of the Edict of Milan in 313 it quickly became the biggest religion All religions except Christianity were banned in 391 AD by an edict of Emperor Theodosius I

The Byzantines were threatened by the rise of Islam whose followers took over the territories of Syria Armenia and Egypt and soon threatened to take over Constantinople In the next century the Arabs also captured southern Italy and Sicily

The Byzantines however managed to stop Islamic invader from moving further into their lands during the 8th century and beginning in the 9th century took parts of the conquered lands back over In 1000 AD the Eastern Empire was at its largest point Basileios II reconquered Bulgaria and Armenia culture and trade flourished However the expansion was suddenly stopped in 1071 at the Battle of Manzikert This finally made the empire start becoming weaker Several centuries of fighting and Turkic invasions ultimately made it possible for Emperor Alexius I Comnenus to send a call for help to the West in 1095 

The West responded with the Crusades eventually resulting in the Sack of Constantinople by participants in the Fourth Crusade The conquest of Constantinople in 1204 split what little land remained in the Empire into new countries the ultimate winner being Nicaea After the recapture of Constantinople by Imperial forces the empire was little more than a Greek state confined to the Aegean coast The Eastern Empire came to an end when Mehmed II conquered Constantinople on 29 May 1453

Globalization is the way that local or national ways of doing things become global that is done together around the world It is about economics or trade technology politics and culture People feel differently about globalisation some think it helps everyone while others think it hurts some people

When most people talk about globalization they usually mean changes in the economy that happen because of free trade and technology In the late 20th century many countries agreed to lower tariffs or taxes on goods that are imported from other countries The Internet and other communication technologies also made it easy for people to buy and sell products to people around the world 

Herman E Daly has said that there is an important difference between internationalization and globalization Internationalization is about nations working together for the same goals These are things like treaties alliances and other international agreements Globalization is about making national borders less important for those who want to buy or sell things around the world He says that globalization is making national economies into one global economy because many depend on people from other countries

Some people like Noam Chomsky do not like globalization because they feel it only helps rich people get richer by making poor people poorer Offshore outsourcing when companies hire workers in cheaper countries is often a part of globalization This sometimes means that some people lose their jobs Joseph Stiglitz has said that international groups like the World Bank and the IMF have made it harder for poorer nations to get richer Critics of globalization also feel that it leads to global brands like Coca Cola and McDonalds taking over smaller local shops and businesses Jean Baudrillard believes that globalization hurts local cultures and is the cause of most terrorism He also believes that most critics of globalization just want to stay in power

Others like Thomas Friedman believe that globalization can bring people together and make everyone richer without getting rid of local cultures People who support globalization also believe that it makes war less likely because it is bad for business Friedman believed that no two nations with a McDonalds would ever go to war with each other After NATO bombed Serbia he changed and said that no two nations who make products for Dell Computers would ever go to war 

Many believe that globalization helps out poorer nations by bringing them business A report by the World Bank said that poverty in India and Indonesia was cut in half because of globalization The report also said that people in poorer nations are living longer and better because they were making more money

North Holland is a province of the Netherlands It is in the northwest The capital is called Haarlem Other cities in the province are Amsterdam Hilversum Alkmaar Zaandam and Hoorn

Folk music is music that is played or sung by ordinary people It is traditional music that people learn by listening to other people playing it and then copying them We say that the tradition is orally transmitted or handed down orally meaning that the music is not written down but taught by speaking Every country has its own traditional music Folk song is part of folk music

In the 1960s a new type of music was started by Bob Dylan who mixed traditional folk song with rock and roll This music is sometimes called folk  

Folk music is music for everybody to play and listen to In this way it is different from classical music which is mainly developed by professional musicians for a smaller group of people Folk music is part of a popular culture although the term popular music or pop music today refers to a kind of music which people can hear through television radio and other means of recording

In many parts of the world nearly all music is folk music The term folk music is usually used for European and American music which is part of an oral tradition  Folk music as an oral tradition is much less important than it used to be in part because of new technology Folk tunes are now often written down and they have influenced other kinds of music so that the differences between various types of music are harder to see

In older times folk music was part of communal recreation This means that small communities such as villages or families would relax by playing and singing music together People would often make up a new song or new piece of music or make changes to music that they already knew In this way music was always changing  People would get musical ideas from other groups nearby This is why folk music from neighbouring countries often sound similar

Ballads were a popular kind of folk music These were folk songs which told a story Sometimes they had a refrain after each verse so that everybody could join in Ballads told stories of love myths or folklore This is how stories were handed down from one generation to another

Instrumental folk music was used for dancing Some of the instruments may have been very simple such as a pair of sticks rattle or a simple drum Other instruments may include fiddle bagpipes harp zither or various wind instruments depending on the time of history and the country

Some singing was polyphonic ie there were two or more parts Very often two voices would sing in parallel In countries such as Russia people sang in three or four parts eg in the tradition of podgolosnaya In countries such as Britain this polyphonic tradition did not exist Folk songs there were sung by one singer unaccompanied

Folk music used different scales These are called modes The Ionian mode was the most common in Western Europe In some parts of Eastern Europe modes with several semitones were used

Folk music also includes simple childrens songs and lullabies

Folk music was sung by people as they worked In the early days of European immigration in America the pioneers sang as they travelled cowboys sang as they worked slaves sang in the cottonfields

In the 18th century folk music started to have an influence on classical music People from the higher classes started to be interested in folk music because they were conscious of being part of a tradition Composers such as Mozart and Schubert wrote folk dances for orchestras or small groups of instruments

Folk music was used by many composers in the Romantic period Gustav Mahler used folk song in a lot of his music In the early twentieth century some composers travelled around collecting folk music which was being played or sung by people in the country They often used some of these ideas in their music Bartok did this in Hungary as well as in Bulgaria and in the United States and people such as Cecil Sharp and the composer Ralph Vaughan Williams collected folk music in England In the United States the influence of jazz on classical music is all part of the story of folk music

Abraham is a character in the Bible and Quran There he is said to be the father of all Jews This is because he is their ancestor The story about Abraham is a part of the Jewish Christian and Islamic religions In Islam he is considered as one of the 5 great prophet

Abraham is the father of Isaac ishmael and the grandfather of Jacob Abraham is believed to be the founding patriarch of the Israelites Ishmaelites and Edomites Abraham was the third son of Terah and the grandson of Nahor Abrahams older brothers were named Nahor and Haran

The Tao Te Ching is the second most translated book in history behind only the Bible Why are there hundreds of translations The text is short The language is not clear  the author wanted it to be unclear because he is talking about things that are hard to describe There are many interpretations or ways to understand what the book says

Bacon is a type of meat that comes from pigs It is taken from the sides back or belly of the pig It is often cut in thin slices unlike other cured or smoked pork products It is usually fried or grilled It can also be microwaved 

In the USA back bacon and smoked ham is sometimes called Canadian bacon

Bacon contains high amounts of fat Since bacon contains pork eating it may be against the beliefs of certain religions In some cultures and religions eating pork may be considered unclean Because of this other varieties of bacon are also made out of turkey or chicken instead Turkey bacon and chicken bacon usually contain half of the fat of pork based bacon

The Molotov Ribbentrop Pact was signed by Vyacheslav Molotov and Joachim von Ribbentropp on 23 August 1939 The pact promised that neither Russia nor Germany would attack the other It also divided Poland between them

However after the pact was signed Hitler broke it in 1941 This was part of a series of conflicts in World War II

Vyacheslav Mikhailovich Molotov was a Soviet politician and diplomat He was a leading figure in the Soviet government from the 1920s when he came to power He was a protg of Joseph Stalin until the 1950s Nikita Khrushchev dismissed him from office He was the main Soviet signatory of the Molotov Ribbentrop pact of 1939 This pact was signed between Germany and the USSR and it was a promise not to attack each other The pact lasted about two years until Germany started the invasion of the Soviet Union on June 22 1941

Babylonia was a city state in Mesopotamia in the second millenium BC over 3000 years ago Its capital city was Babylon which meant The Gate of the Gods They built an empire out of the lands of the former Akkadian empire

Mesopotamia is the region of the two rivers Euphrates and Tigris At that time the region also included the city states of Assyria to the north and Elam to the south east It is part of the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East It was there people first lived together in a civilization with farming cities and writing 

The Babylonians had a written language that they used for trade and communication They got it from the Sumerians who invented it The Babylonians used the same cuneiform system of pressing triangular shapes into soft clay They wrote in two different languages the Sumerian for religious purposes and Akkadian for official purposes

Hammurabi was a king of Babylon who fought wars and made Babylonia into an empire by putting Assyria under a vassal king He created the earliest written set of laws called the Code of Hammurabi It has 280 judgments and can be seen today in the Louvre a museum in Paris Whereas the earlier Sumerian punishments had not been harsh Babylonian law was quite severe The death penalty was given for theft murder and other crimes

The houses in Babylon had open roofs so that on hot nights the family could sleep there The living rooms dining rooms and the kitchens were of course downstairs Lamps burned with olive oil and every house had a chapel for burial and worship ceremonies Since Mesopotamia had only clay for use in building the strong wooden supports for the houses were imported from Lebanon Eventually people began baking their bricks and improved the strength of their buildings

Later Babylon was sacked by the Hittite king Musilis I which led to the so called Dark Ages of the Bronze Age where there is little evidence in writing The date of the sacking of Babylon is debated by archaeologists who have proposed no fewer than four chronologies Possible dates for the sack of Babylon are

The difficulty is to line up the Mesopotamian dates with the Ancient Egyptian dates

After the Hittite destruction Babylon was ruled by Kassites for 576 years Next it was ruled by Elam and then regained its independence for about three centuries They were then conquered by the Neo Assyrians A century later they again became free to form the Neo Babylonian or Chaldean Empire This constant conquest and re conquest is partly due to geography There are no natural boundaries except the rivers and it is easy to get at the cities from north or south

The king Nebuchadnezzar II whose reign of 43 years made Babylon once more the mistress of the civilized world conquered Phoenicia in 585 BC 

The Babylonian empire was finally brought to an end by Cyrus the Great of Persia 

It was in 549 BC that Cyrus put an end to the empire of the Medes Three years later Cyrus had become king of the Achaemenid Empire and was engaged in a campaign in northern Mesopotamia 

In 539 BC Cyrus invaded Babylonia A battle was fought at Opis in the month of June where the Babylonians were defeated and immediately afterwards Sippara surrendered to the invader Two days after the capture of Sippara the soldiers of Cyrus entered Babylon without fighting Cyrus did not arrive until the 3rd of Marchesvan Gobryas having acted for him in his absence Gobryas was now made governor of the province of Babylon

Cyrus now claimed to be the legitimate successor of the ancient Babylonian kings and the avenger of their god Bel Marduk The invasion of Babylonia by Cyrus was doubtless helped by the presence of foreign forced exiles like the Jews who had been planted in the midst of the country

One of the first acts of Cyrus was to allow these exiles to return to their own homes carrying with them the images of their god and their sacred vessels The permission to do so was embodied in a proclamation whereby the conqueror endeavored to justify his claim to the Babylonian throne The feeling was still strong that none had a right to rule over western Asia until he had been consecrated to the office by Bel and his priests and accordingly Cyrus henceforth assumed the imperial title of King of Babylon

Like the Sumerians the Babylonians ate vegetables fruits meat and fish They also ate bread and enjoyed toasting and eating the pesky but crunchy locusts which destroyed their precious crops

The Babylonians loved art Beautiful vessels ornamented with sparkling gold were buried with the kings In those days books dealt with floods which were thought to be caused by sin or about the journey of Abraham Science too improved well they invented the first calendar the 60 minute hour and the advance multiplication table

Life was rich full and usually peaceful People rarely thought about war or how to protect the city As a result Babylon was conquered in 730 BC by the Assyrians and Kassites This great civilization then ended

Noise is another word for sound It usually means it is not wanted Noise can also mean data that does not have a meaning like white noise Noise is perceived by our ears They can be damaged by noise

Karma is a word meaning the result of a persons actions as well as the actions themselves It is a term about the cycle of cause and effect According to the theory of Karma what happens to a person happens because they caused it with their actions It is an important part of many religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism 

Karma is about all that a person has done is doing and will do Karma is not about punishment or reward It makes a person responsible for their own life and how they treat other people

The Theory of Karma is a major belief in Hinduism Ayyavazhi Sikhism Buddhism and Jainism All living creatures are responsible for their karma  their actions and the effects of their actions

 Karma is the universal principle of cause and effect Our actions both good and bad come back to us in the future helping us to learn from lifes lessons and become better people In religions that include reincarnation karma extends through ones present life and all past and future lives as well 

Karma is basically energy One person throws out energy through thoughts words and actions and it comes back in time through other people Karma is the best teacher forcing people to face the consequences of their actions and thus improve and refine their behavior or suffer if they do not Even harsh karma when faced in wisdom can be the greatest spark for spiritual growth The conquest of karma lies in intelligent action and unemotional response 

The process of action and reaction on all levelsphysical mental and spiritualis karma One must pay attention to thoughts because thought can make karmasgood bad and mixed

I say kind words to you and you feel peaceful and happy I say harsh words to you and you become ruffled and upset The kindness and the harshness will return to me through others at a later time

An architect thinks creative productive thoughts while drawing plans for a new building But were he to think destructive unproductive thoughts he would soon not be able to accomplish any kind of positive task even if he desired to do so

Hindus look at time as a circle as things cycle around again Karma is a very just law which like gravity treats everyone the same The law of karma puts man at the center of responsibility for everything he does and everything that is done to him Understanding the way karma works Hindus try to live a virtuous life This is called dharma

There are three types of karma in Hinduism

Karma is considered one of the natural laws of the mind just as gravity is a law of matter Just as God created gravity to bring order to the physical world He created karma as a divine system of justice that is self governing and infinitely fair It automatically creates the appropriate future experience in response to the current action 

Several different views exist in Hinduism regarding the role of divine beings In Hinduism many see the deities or devas as playing some kind of role Other Hindus such as the Mimamsakas reject such notions and see karma as acting independently considering the natural laws of causation sufficient to explain the effects of karma 

Some interpretations of the Bhagavad Gita suggest an intermediate view that karma is a law of cause and effect yet God can mitigate karma for His devotees It is said in Bhagavad Gita that only the karma that is done with a sense of doership and with attachment to the karma could cause good or bad reactions Karma that is done with an attitude of duty and without attachment to the results will not create any effect and will move one closer to God

Another view holds that a Satguru acting on Gods behalf can mitigate or work out some of the karma of the disciple

The Western Hemisphere is a geographical term for the half of the Earth that is west of the Prime Meridian Pretend that the earth is cut in half from the North Pole through England to the South Pole The Western Hemisphere is the half to the west The other half is called the Eastern Hemisphere

A Molotov cocktail also known as a petrol bomb benzine torch molotov grenade or a Molotov bomb is the generic name for different kinds of simple incendiary weapons They are relatively easy to make For this reason they are commonly associated with irregular military forces and rioters Most of those bombs are used far more often to commit basic arson In urban slang they are often referred to as a homemade frag

A Molotov cocktail consists of a glass bottle partly filled with a flammable liquid The liquid will typically be gasoline alcohol methanol or ethanol The mouth of the bottle is closed with a cork or other type of tight sealing made of rubber glass or plastic and a cloth rag is fixed securely around the mouth The weapon is used by first soaking the rag in a flammable liquid immediately before using it lighting the rag and throwing the bottle at the target The bottle breaks when it lands spilling the flammable liquid over the target which is then ignited by the burning rag

Many substances may be added to the basic Molotov cocktail to enhance its use as a weapon These include

Molotov cocktails are similar to napalm bombs in principle Napalm was originally made by combining flammable naphthalene and petrol with a thickening agent palmitic acid The latter two are the main ingredients of Molotov cocktails When gasoline is used as the main ingredient motor oil is commonly added to help the gasoline cling to the target

The name Molotov cocktail is derived from Vyacheslav Mikhailovich Molotov a Soviet politician He was the Peoples Commissar for Foreign Affairs or the Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union

During the early part of World War II when Finland refused to surrender some land to the Soviet Union the Soviets invaded The poorly equipped and heavily outnumbered Finnish Army faced Red Army tanks in what came to be known as the Winter War The army borrowed an improvised incendiary device from the 193639 Spanish Civil War In that conflict the Spanish Nationalists under the orders of General Francisco Franco had used the weapon against Soviet T 26 tanks Those tanks helped the Spanish Republicans in a failed 1936 Soviet assault near Toledo 30 km from MadridrefMadrid

When Molotov claimed in radio broadcasts that the Soviet Union was not dropping bombs but rather delivering food to the starving Finns the Finns started to call the air bombs satirically Molotov bread baskets Soon they responded by saluting the advancing tanks with Molotov cocktails At first the term was used to describe only the burning mixture itself but the term was soon applied to the combination of both the bottle and its contents This Finnish use of the hand or sling thrown explosive against Soviet tanks was repeated in the subsequent Continuation War Molotov cocktails were eventually mass produced by the Finnish military bundled with matches to light them

These weapons saw widespread use by all sides in World War II They were very effective against light tanks and very bad for enemy morale The following is a first hand description of their effects written during the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in 1943

During the 1948 ArabIsraeli War members of the Israeli Kibbutz Degania managed to stop a Syrian tank assault by using Molotov cocktails They were frequently used against Soviet tanks with great efficiency in the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 

The weapon has been used against tanks effectively because of the conformation of parts of tanks particularly around the undersides and fuel tank entrances A Molotov cocktail could blow up the fuel tank destroying the machine particularly for older tank models Molotov cocktails are much more effective against gasoline engines than diesel engines tanks This is because diesel has a high flashpoint of 64 C making it more difficult to ignite compared to petrol Some Soviet tanks actually had an entry to the gas tank on the side of the vehicle which could be opened by combatants in close quarters letting out the highly flammable liquid and making destruction of the tank even easier Note that these tactics were only effective due to the advantage guerrillas had in close quarters tanks can barely maneuver in such conditions and are not able to counter quick moving enemies armed with incendiary bombs 

Petrol bombs were widely used throughout the Troubles in Northern Ireland in riot situations directed towards the RUC or the British Army As well as occasional situations where they continue to be used against the PSNI and army they are frequently used in sectarian attacks on homes and businesses by both communities Fireworks and homemade grenades known as blast bombs now commonly accompany petrol bomb attacks on the security forces

As such things can cause a lot of damage and actually kill people it is illegal in most countries to make or possess them When they are used against property this usually counts as arson When they are used against people the charges range from manslaughter to murder

Given the recent terrorism laws such things could also fall under anti terror legislation

Molotov cocktails were put to use recently during the riotous 2005 civil unrest in France Another situation with popularity for them is the Palestinian Intifada

In Sydney during the Cronulla Riots rioters carrying Molotov cocktails were apprehended when they carried open bottles in a bus The resulting smell of petrol alerted the driver who in turn alerted the police

During the Columbine High School massacre the two gunmen built and threw several Molotov cocktails however none of them exploded It is presumed that this was due to their being overfilled

Flammability or inflammability means that something can be set on fire easily It will burn easily The words come from Latin The word at the base is in flammare It means something like to put fire to a thing

Inflammable and flammable are used to mean the same thing People sometimes get confused and think that inflammable means not flammable because the prefix in is often used to mean not For example something that is inhuman is not human Since many people do not know that inflammable means burns easily flammable is used more often in public places as a warning

Arson is a crime When someone sets fire to a property they do not own and they want to cause damage it is called arson A person who commits arson is an arsonist

A cocktail is a kind of mixed drink Usually it is made with alcoholic drinks such as vodka gin or rum Since such spirits do not have much taste of their own other broken wikt linkingredientingredients are added Common ingredients are fruits fruit juice sugar crushed ice and ice cubes If the cocktail is served in a bar or nightclub it is often garnished with a piece of fruit for example a gin and tonic could be garnished with lemon a Pia Colada with pineapple and a cherry

Most cocktails were invented in the late 19th or early 20th centuries People began drinking a lot of cocktails in the United States in the 1920s due to Prohibition Around that time cocktails from Cuba such as the mojito became popular around the world

Cocktails made without alcohol are also made

Because all the ingredients give their flavor to the finished drink a cocktail is only as good as the worst ingredient

There are many kinds of cocktails They include

There is a group called the IBA that determines what common cocktails are and how they should be made

A sneeze is a reaction in the nose in which air and mucus are forced out quickly It often happens after breathing dust or other small things into the nose When people sneeze their eyes close This is a natural reflex which keeps the eyes from being bulged by the great pressure of air which is being released through the sinus cavity A common thing to say to people when they sneeze is Bless you or in the United States sometimes Gesundheit There is a story that the blessing started with Pope Gregory VII He said a blessing might stop people from getting the bubonic plague which was killing people in Rome at the time When people sneeze the speed is about 150 kilometers per hour or more The heart does not stop

Pumas also called cougars or mountain lions are large wild cats that live on the west coast of Canada in the western half of the United States including Alaska and Florida and most of Central and South America Cougars are mainly tan coloured and can be up to 9 feet long although average length is 6  8 feet They can weigh from 29 kilograms to 90 kilograms Most pumas live 21 yearsFactsubstMARCH 13th 2009 Although pumas are very large and some are larger than humans the puma is classified is a small cat That means that in scientific terms the puma is more closely related to the Domestic Cat than they are to Lions Unlike the big cats in the genus Panthera the puma cannot roar Instead it can growl hiss screech and purr Since pumas are in the biological sense small cats they are capable of purring continuously The big cats can only purr while breathing out 

Cougars are carnivores because they eat only meat They hunt deer raccoons squirrels foxes rabbits and skunks They can also eat mice beavers coyotes birds and porcupines They hunt at night Cougars can see better at night than people can They can hear well too Cougars stalk their prey That is they walk slowly and quietly they hide and then when close they jump or run fast to catch their prey They live and hunt alone Female cougars take care of their babies until they are old enough to fend for themselves Baby cougars are called cubs

Cougars live in the mountains and forests far from people However encounters with humans do happen sometimes Cougars have been known to attack humans 26 people have been killed by cougars in North America in the last 30 years However what cougars have done to people is nothing compared to what people have done to cougars Cougars used to be found all over eastern North America However they were hunted to extinction there by the beginning of the 1900s However recent sightings of cougars have been reported from Michigan New Brunswick southern Indiana Kentucky and Vermont For now the only confirmed unambiguous population of cougars east of the Mississippi River is in Florida where a subspecies of the cougar called the Florida Panther lives 

Schools that have a cougar for a mascot are

Armour is a protective covering or clothing used to try to prevent injury when being attacked Armour can be worn by a person or it can be used to protect machines animals even buildings Armour has always been made from the strongest materials available at the time but weight has always been a problem Early armour was made from leather then later metals were used Some modern armour like bullet proof vests are made from plastics that do not stretch or break such as Kevlar These plastics may be woven into a cloth and used in layers which makes them even stronger

Armour put on vehicles is usually made of metal and can include one layer over another with open spaces in between or multiple layers of metal ceramics and other materials Another type of armour uses blocks of explosive that explode when another explosion goes off near it This explosive armour protects by pushing against the other explosion Vehicle armor is often angled to increase the amount of armour that must be shot through to get inside and to make the shot bounce off rather than piercing the armour

Tanks have the heaviest armour of all land vehicles Other military vehicles have armour but not as much as a tank 

Sometimes armour is put in non military vehicles such as limousines used by leaders of a country or by anyone who thinks they might be attacked eg film stars or presidents of major companies

In the past armour has also been used in wars to protect animals such as dogs elephants and horses Today police dogs and horses sometimes wear woven plastic bullet proof vests

North Star Computers was one of the earliest manufacturers of microcomputers Before they started making their first computer the North Star Horizon they made floppy disk drives for S 100 bus computers They included a disk operating system called North Star DOS The Horizon used the North Star disk controller and operating system It was one of the first microcomputers that had multi user features

Their second computer called the North Star Advantage ran CPM and had the keyboard and monitor built in The graphics were very powerful for their time When the IBM PC came out North Star made an MS DOS compatible processor card that could be added to the Advantage

Their third computer the North Star Dimension was multi user like the Horizon but MS DOS based

Because their products in the early 1980s were only MS DOS compatible not fully PC compatible they never sold very many and the company went out of business

Risk is the possibility of something bad happening People use the word risk when they are actually talking about probability it means they want to say how likely something is to happen

People often take risks This means that they do something that is risky ie that might be dangerous There is a possibility that something bad might happen 

In epidemiology risk is defined as the number of events divided by the number of people prone to that event For example if the risk of neonatal death in a population is reported as 11000 it means that from each 1000 babies born 1 is likely to die

Risk is different from prevalence Prevalence refers to the number of people with a disease in a population while risk means the number of new cases divided by the number of people who could possibly become a case

A risk assessment is a list of things that could go wrong In many Western countries when teachers take children on an outing they may have to fill in a risk assessment form which lists all the possible dangers and says what they should do to stop bad things from happening

Focus is a word that means many things 

The pipe organ is a keyboard instrument in which the sound is made by air blowing through pipes A person who plays the organ is called an organist The organist plays the instrument using both the hands and the feet The hands play the keyboards while the feet play pedals which also make notes 

Organs have been made for many centuries They are usually found in places for Christian worship such as churches and cathedrals although they may also be found in places like town halls and concert halls or even large private houses Very small organs can be called chamber organs Organs in large churches cathedrals or halls are very large instruments indeed and are built especially for the building they are in They are called pipe organs to distinguish them from modern electronic organs

No two organs are ever quite the same and they vary greatly from one country to another and one historical period to another The information here is about organs from Europe Britain and America

How an organ works A description of the organ 

In a pipe organ the musical notes are made by blowing air through pipes Every organ must have pipes something to blow the air and a way of controlling which pipes are played 

The pipes are made of metal or wood They are lined up in rows in the organ case which can be as big as a room The metal pipes are round tubes They can be made of different types of metal but the most common type is an alloy called spotted metal because it has round shiny spots on it For some reason this alloy makes pipes that sound very good Very small pipes can sometimes be made of silver like flutes Some organs also have some pipes made of brass that sound like trumpets Most organs have a lot of wooden pipes The wooden pipes have four flat sides and make a sound different from that of the spotted metal pipes They are not usually seen they are neatly lined up behind the large metal pipes at the front of the organ which are sometimes painted with colours and patterns All the pipes have to be made with an end that tapers at the bottom where the air blows in 

Each pipe can play only one note which depends on its size The small pipes play high notes and the large pipes play low notes Each pipe has its own special sound which depends on the material it is made from and on the shape of the pipe The pipes are arranged in ranks so that all the pipes of the same shape and material can be controlled to play a tune together without all the others 

To blow air through the organ there are boxes called wind chests When the organist is playing heshe can see a little gauge that tells whether there is enough air The wind chests can be kept full in two ways The old fashioned way is to have an enormous set of bellows which are pumped up and down by a person using a large handle This sucks in air and fills the wind chest Pumping the bellows of a large pipe organ is heavy work For this reason most organs nowadays have an electric motor and a large fan which fills the wind chest 

The organist uses keyboards like those on a piano to play the organ A small organ may have just one keyboard but many organs have two keyboards and a very big one may even have five Organists do not call them keyboards they call them manuals An organist will talk about a four manual organ The manuals are arranged on the organ console and the organist sits on a bench in front of the console to play Apart from the manuals there are two other important parts of the console There are a set of long wooden pedals which the organist can play with hisher feet Each pedal plays a different note 

On either side of the manuals there are rows of stops which look like knobs The stops can be pulled out or pushed in When a stop is pulled out it turns on some sets of pipes The organist can choose whether to play loud pipes or soft pipes flute sounding pipes or brassy pipes sweet pipes or harsh sounding pipes As the organist plays heshe does not just have to think about the right notes Heshe also has to think about the sort of voice that the organ should play in Heshe can play different ranks of pipes together by pulling out several stops Some pipes usually the biggest decorated pipes at the very front of the organ are used only for the grandest music By tradition these pipes are the symbol of the Voice of God 

When the organist presses the keys of the organ the sound comes from the air blowing through the pipes This is because a valve opens up to let the air into the pipe and closes again when the organist stops pressing that key This can happen in several ways Traditional organs have what is called a tracker action The trackers are thin wooden rods and wires which move backwards and forwards opening and shutting all the valves They are worked by levers under the keyboard A tracker action organ has to have the console right near the organ usually under the big front pipes 

A more modern development was to have a tubular pneumatic action in which the console could be away from the organ but connected to it by tubes through which air could be pushed to open the valves In the most modern pipe organs the manual is connected to the organ pipes by electric wires The power to open and shut the valves is controlled by electro magnetic switches The console does not have to be close to the organ This makes it possible for the organist to sit in a position where heshe has good contact with the people in the church or with other musicians

The technical details 

 The manuals A very small organ may only have one manual Most organs have at least two In English and American Organs the lower manual is the main one and is called the Great The upper manual is called the Swell because it operates pipes which are inside a swell box which has broken wikt linkshuttershutters that can be opened or closed This makes the music get louder or quieter The organist operates the swell box with a pedal which broken wikt linkpivotpivots It is in the centre just above the pedal board On old English organs the swell box is operated by a lever at the side This is quite difficult to use Most of these have now been replaced by central swell boxes

If there is a third manual it is called the Choir in English speaking countries Originally the English called them chair organs because they were a separate instrument The organist had to turn round and face the other way to play it It is thought that the word chair gradually changed to choir because it was often used to accompany the choir In German organs the third manual was called the Positiv The name Rckpositiv was used because the pipes were behind the organists back as heshe sat facing the main organ These started to become popular again with organ builders in the 1950s when it was felt that the Romantic organ was not suitable for old music and some organ builders started using Baroque principles again so that the music of composers such as Bach could sound like it used to The Choir manual is nearest to the player the Great is in the middle and the Swell is farthest away The Choir or Positiv often contains soft stops which are suitable for accompanying the choir On French organs from the late 19th century onwards the three manuals are arranged differently the Great is nearest to the player the Positif is the middle manual and is like a smaller version of the Great and the Swell is the top manual This makes it easy for the organist to build up the music getting louder gradually by starting at the top and gradually coming down

The fourth manual is called the Solo because the stops on this manual are used to play out the tune as a solo This manual is even farther away from the player than the Swell Large cathedral organs usually have four manuals The Solo will probably have a very loud stop indeed called the Tuba or Tuba Mirabilis 

If there is a fifth manual it may be called the Echo because it has very quiet stops that echo Alternatively especially on American organs it might be a Bombarde The Bombarde usually contains loud bold reed stops including stops called Bombarde For instance a State Trumpet or Pontifical Trumpet might be placed on this manual which can be heard above all the other stops playing The Bombarde is borrowed from French Organs where it is a standard stop on nearly all the manuals and pedals Having a Bombarde Manual is something of a luxury for an organist It can be found for example on the organ of Westminster Abbey

It is extremely unusual to have more than five manuals but in America there are a few very large organs The Wanamaker organ at Macys store in Philadelphia has six manuals The worlds largest organ is in the Atlantic City Convention Hall It has seven manuals and over 33000 pipes However the largest organ in the world does not work since it would be too expensive to run it

Using the manuals Having two or three manuals makes it possible to have quick changes of sound during a piece The player can also play on two manuals at once one with the left hand and one with the right This is particularly useful to make a tune louder than the accompaniment The manuals can also be coupled together for example pulling out the Swell to Great stop will make all the sounds from the Swell come out on the Great as well On an organ with mechanical action the keys of the Swell will be seen playing by themselves like a pianola but on some older organs it can be hard work for the organists fingers when the manuals are coupled as it makes the action very heavy

The notes on the pedals are arranged like the notes on a keyboard but are obviously much bigger The player needs to learn to play by feel otherwise he will have to spend all his time looking at his feet He plays each note either with the toe or the heel and either on the inside of the foot or the outside The American and British Standard organ contains 30 notes giving a range of nearly 2 octaves They are not quite in a straight line but fan out a little to make it easier to play In German and French organs and organs built before 1920 the pedalboard will be straight without any fan curvature to it Many organists find that this makes it more difficult to play Organists need a good pair of shoes ones which have good narrow heels and preferably pointed toes The soles need to be fairly slippery but not too much so that the player can slide the foot from one pedal to another Organists usually like to keep a pair of shoes which are worn only for playing the organ so that the soles do not have grit or dirt from the street 

The stops The stops on an organ console give different sounds like the instruments of an orchestra and have names which tell the organist what kind of sound they will produce The stops are usually to the left and right of the organist and they are pulled out Some organs have tab stops or rocker stops which are in front of the player and can be rocked forwards and backwards for onoff

The stops of an organ can be divided into families

The chorus stops are the foundation stops the basic ones which are good for building up the big solid sound A diapason or principal is a chorus stop

The flute stops sound like flutes in an orchestra They are gentler than the diapasons and sound good for very quick and light music

The reeds are stops like the oboe clarinet trumpet fagotto trombone Each pipe has a reed inside Their sound is very strong and nasal

The strings are quiet stops which sound like string instruments These are stops like the violone and gamba

There is another way of grouping the stops Each stop will have a number underneath the name The number may be 16 8 4 2 1 or even 2 23 or 1 35 If the number is 8 this is called an eight foot stop This is the normal pitch the note will sound as it is written eg when playing Middle C the sound will be Middle C A 4 foot stop will sound an octave higher than written a 2 foot stop will be two octaves higher A 16 foot stop will sound an octave lower than an 8 foot stop 8 foot is therefore the normal pitch and the others are added to it to make a larger brighter sound 16 foot stops are normal in pedal parts

Mutation stops are stops in which a note does not sound a whole number of octaves above the normal pitch Examples are the Tierce 1 35 and the Nazard or Twelfth 2 23

An organist needs to learn which combinations of stops sound good together and how to balance them well Each organ is different and has its own character

The combination of stops that an organist chooses for a particular piece of music is called the registration The list of all the stops that a particular organ has is called the specification The specification of an organ shows the names of the stops for each of the manuals and for the pedals as well as the list of couplers

Organs also have buttons called pistons which help to change the registration in the middle of a piece There are toe pistons operated by the feet and thumb pistons which are placed just below each manual so that they can be pushed by the thumb while the fingers keep playing Large organs often have general pistons which change any combination of stops across the organ These are often be computerised so that players can set them up differently depending on the music they are going to play If several players regularly use the instrument they can each have their own personal settings for the pistons which they can lock so that no one else can change them

Each stop controls a row of pipes called a rank Each rank makes a different sound The stops control the air flow through the ranks Some stops may control more than one rank For instance a Mixture stop of three ranks will have 182 pipes and in some organs the Celeste is a 2 rank stop The celeste pipes are tuned slightly sharper than the rest of the organ so that when played together with another quiet stop such as the Salicional there will be a pleasant throbbing beat because two pipes are slightly out of tune with one another Organ Pipes are normally made of metal or wood High quality metal organ pipes usually contain 75 percent tin or more and the rest is lead The Pipes are placed on windchests inside an organ case in a special room called an Organ chamber A windchest is a box like device which contains pallets that are opened and closed to admit air to a pipe so that it sounds The pallets are operated by pull wires and rollers in the case of a tracker instrument but may also be operated by pneumatics or direct electric action using magnets

There is always air being pumped into the windchest when the organ is switched on In the days before electricity someone had to pump the air into the windchest using bellows This was hard work Large organs would have needed more than one organ blower to do this job

No other instrument has developed in such a wide variety of ways as the organ If Bach who lived in the early 18th century had gone from his home in Germany to France he would have found it impossible to play his music properly on French organs If Couperin who lived at the same time had gone from his home in France to Germany he would not have been able to play his music on the organs that Bach was using Neither of them could possibly have played on an organ in England at the time For one thing English organs in the 18th century still had no pedals This means that organists need to know a lot about what organs were like in other countries in other centuries in order to know what registrations to use when playing music by composers of the past 

The earliest organs were water organs invented in Ancient Greece The Romans used them in circuses and gladiator combats because they were loud They were still popular in some countries a few hundred years ago for example in pleasure gardens

In the Middle Ages large organs were built in the huge Gothic cathedrals in Britain These instruments did not have different stops all the ranks sounded at once They were played by a slider mechanism Only in the 11th 12th and 13th centuries did they start to use a keyboard The so called Mixture Organ still sounded several pitches at once Very small organs called portatives were used in broken wikt linkprocessionprocessions Positives were a bit bigger and were used to accompany singing in the church The Regal was like a portative but it had reeds and no pipes It could be put on a table

By about 1450 the organs that were being built in Germany and the Netherlands had two or three manuals and pedals There were stops so that the player could choose which ranks he wanted to sound The collection of pieces called the Buxheimer Orgelbuch is one of the first collections we have of organ music French organs too were developing In England organs were quite small Composers like John Bull William Byrd and Orlando Gibbons wrote music for chamber organs In the Netherlands Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck was a very famous organist and teacher 

The Baroque period was a great period for organ music in Germany Organs there were built on the Werkprinzip which meant that each keyboard with its pipes was built separately like two or three different organs although they were played from the same console Organs like these were built by the famous Arp Schnitger Many famous German composers wrote organ music especially Johann Pachelbel in South Germany and in North Germany The great composer Johann Sebastian Bach learnt from these composers and wrote some of the most famous organ music of all times The great organ builder Gottfried Silbermann lived during this time and built organs with a very beautiful tone Instead of a keyboard called a Choir he built an Oberwerk which was above the Hauptwerk 

French organ builders at this time were very interested in colour Many stops were reeds that had names like Cornet Tierce and Prestant When all the stops of the Principal chorus played together it was called the Plein jeux This was like the medieval Blockwerk All the reed chorus together was called Grands jeux This would have sounded very loud and was used for dialogues and fugues  Composers included Nicolas de Grigny Louis Marchand Louis Nicolas Clrambault Louis Claude Daquin and Franois Couperin

In England there was not much interest in developing the organ It was used for accompanying the choir There were no pedals Pieces for organ were called voluntaries Henry Purcell wrote a few organ pieces 

Organ composition reached a great peak in the work of JSBach but then people started to lose interest Not many developments took place in organ building during the Classical music period Although Mozart played the organ and called it the King of Instruments he did not often write music for it Among the organ builders at this time were Joseph and Claude Ignace Callinet who built the organ at Notre Dames in 1837 

The organ in 19th century Germany started to be used for imitating the sound of an orchestra People also started to be interested in playing the music of JS Bach Many Classical organs were re built and sometimes they lost their original character Organs in different countries started to sound the same

Gradually composers started writing for the organ again Felix Mendelssohn wrote some excellent sonatas and preludes and fugues which were inspired by Bachs music and made other composers want to write organ music Robert Schumann and Franz Liszt wrote for the organ and later in the century Max Reger and Sigfrid Karg Elert

In France the organ builder Aristide Cavaill Coll was a real genius His organs had lots of new ideas including the Barker lever and placing families of stops on to separate chests Organists could change their registrations quickly pushing in or pulling out the stops that they needed Composers included Csar Franck Charles Marie Widor and Louis Vierne The last two wrote long works in several movements which they called Symphonies because they were full of colourful sounds like those in a symphony orchestra There were usually three manuals called Grand Positif and Rcit placed in that order The Grand had warm foundation stops and big reeds The Positif had string stops as well as a solo reed and the Rcit had lighter reeds

In England Samuel Wesley wrote some important organ music inspired by JS Bach and his son Samuel Sebastian Wesley was influenced by Continental Romantic composers such as Mendelssohn In 1851 the organ builder Henry Willis built a large organ for Crystal Palace Exhibition It had three manuals and a pedal board This set the standard in English organ building for the future

During the 20th century organ builders became more and more interested in returning to some of the ideas of the Baroque and Classical periods Many organs now have electric action but a good mechanical action has the advantage that the player feels more close to the instrument that he is playing Some large 20th century organs are able to play many kinds of organ music Other 20th century organs were built as copies of Baroque or Classical instruments but this means these instruments are mainly suitable for Baroque or Classical music and are not well suited for music of the 19th and 20th centuries 

In the 19th century many organs in England and America were placed in corners of churches where they could not be heard very well In the 20th century organ builders thought more about the best position for the organ so that the sound would fill the main part of the church thenave Among the most famous 20th century organ composers are Marcel Dupr 1886 1971 Jehan Alain and Olivier Messiaen in France Paul Hindemith in Germany and Edward Elgar and Herbert Howells in England The Czech composer Petr Eben was one of the most important organ composers at the end of the 20th century writing in an individual style

As well as the obvious use of the organ for accompanying church choirs and broken wikt linkcongregationcongregational singing the organ has often been used to accompany instruments In the Baroque period small organs were used to accompany solo instruments or small groups of instruments or orchestras This kind of accompaniment was called continuo Occasionally composers have written organ concertos in which the organ is the solo instrument and the orchestra accompanies Handel wrote several of these In modern times Francis Poulenc wrote an organ concerto There is an important organ solo in Symphony no 3 by Saint Sans Other orchestral works sometimes have organ parts Organists have often made organ transcriptions ie arranged music written for other instruments so that it can be played on the organ

The words Celt and Celtic can have many meanings

The following should only be pronounced selt

The Manx language is a language spoken in the Isle of Man 

It is a Celtic language of the Goidelic language family It is in the same family as Scottish and Irish

Manx is spoken mainly by people who learn it through interest It died out as a natural community language in the 20th century The last of the old native speakers died in 1974

Manx is protected under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages

Manx was beginning to differ from Middle Irish in about 900  1600 AD and it is called Yn Ghaelg Yn Ghailck by Manx speakers There became fewer and fewer Manx speakers during the 19th century and the language was replaced by English In 1901 9 of the people in the Isle of Man were said to speak Manx but in 1921 the number dropped to only 1 

Today Manx is used as the only language taught at five of the Isle of Mans pre schools Manx is taught as a 2nd language at all of the Islands primary and secondary schools

The Goidelic languages or Gaelic languages are a language family of the Celtic languages They are spoken in Scotland Ireland and the Isle of Man

There are three Goidelic languages

The Manx is a breed of domestic cat It either has no tail at all a rumpy or it has a very short tail a stumpy This is because of a natural difference in spine length The back legs are also longer than the front legs The breed comes from the Isle of Man where it was found as early as three hundred years ago

Agaves are succulent plants Succulent plants store water in their leaves Cacti are one kind of succulents agaves are another kind There are quite a few such kinds of succulent plants

Agaves grow mainly in Mexico The agave plants have their leaves in a rosetta arrangement They flower only once produce seeds and die off

Tequila is made from agaves Pulque is beer made from agave juice

Applesauce is a sauce that is made from stewed and mashed apples Peeled or unpeeled apples can be used and different spices or additives like cinnamon can be used Sugar or high fructose corn syrup is sometimes added to the applesauce to sweeten it Applesauce can be fine or coarse textured and can include large pieces of apple It is easy to make at home and it is also sold already made in supermarkets as a common food or as a snack for children and people who have false teeth or other problems with eating solid food Parents often feed it to their babies because teeth are not needed to eat it It is sometimes recommended to fight diarrhoea since it is high in dietary fibre

In the United Kingdom apple sauce is normally used as a sauce for ham pork and gammon

Charles II was king of England Ireland and Scotland from 1649 to 1685 His father was Charles I of England who was executed after losing a war with Parliament 

Prince Charles was the Kings eldest son As a little boy he was made Prince of Wales as a sign that he would one day be king By the time he grew into a young man his father was already at war with Parliament Prince Charles did not take much part in the fighting His mother Henrietta Maria was French and she took her children to France when the war broke out to keep them safe Prince Charles was only eighteen when he heard that his father was dead This made him King and he started calling himself King Charles II straight away but Parliament was still in control of Britain and would not let him take his throne 

In 1651 Charles II returned to Britain and fought Parliament at the Battle of Worcester He was defeated but he was not caught by the enemy because he hid in an oak tree Later he was forced to disguise himself as a servant A young lady called Jane Lane helped him to escape and he sailed to Holland where his supporters were He kept his own royal court there until 1660

While Charles was in Holland Britain was being ruled by Oliver Cromwell an ordinary man who had been chosen as leader of the country by Parliament Cromwell was very strict so the people soon grew tired of him When Cromwell died in 1658 his son Richard was chosen to be the next leader Richard Cromwell was ineffective and King Charles II was asked to come back and rule Britain

In 1660 Charles II was brought back to Britain and took his throne Many of his enemies were punished for having executed his father and fought against him but Richard Cromwell was allowed to go and live quietly away from London Charles was popular and was called The Merry Monarch because he changed many of the laws that Cromwell had made and allowed people more freedom to enjoy themselves He liked to go to the theatre played cards and enjoyed sports such as horse racing Some people thought that a king should be more serious and not spend so much time and money on pleasure

There were also some people who did not like King Charles II because of his religious beliefs He had been brought up by his mother who was a Roman Catholic while most people in the country were Protestant He married a princess from Portugal Catherine of Braganza They did not have any children but Charles refused to divorce Catherine because he respected her and he did not agree with divorce Before he was married he had several girlfriends and lovers and even after he was married he went on having lovers who were called mistresses The most famous of these was an actress called Nell Gwyn Several of Charless lovers had babies but none of these children were allowed to follow Charles as king because they were illegitimate meaning that they had been born to parents who were not married to each other

The most popular of Charles IIs children was James Scott Charles gave him the title Duke of Monmouth Jamess mother had been Charless girlfriend when he was living in Holland and some people said that they had been secretly married If this had been true then James would have been allowed to be king when Charles died There were many who wanted this to happen because they did not like the thought of Charless younger brother being the next king This brother who was also called James was a Roman Catholic and was not popular

Charles II died quite suddenly and his son James Duke of Monmouth started a rebellion in the hope of becoming the next king He was defeated by the royal army which supported Charless brother James The Duke of Monmouth was executed by having his head chopped off and Charless brother became the next ruler King James II

Allan Kardec was a French philosopher and teacher He dedicated the last 15 years of his life to organise a philosophical doctrine called Spiritism He was a great divulger of the educational ideas of Pestalozzi in the 19th century Published books of grammar mathematics and suggestions for the improvement of public education in France He was a teacher of physiology astronomy physics and chemistry and the classes were in your own home in Paris

In 1854 Rivail started studying a phenomena that some people called as paranormal or supernatural that were very common in that time Other people actually tell that these phenomenas are unknown natural s law 

His pedagogical sense made him create a philosophy in which the spiritual manifestations were useful to social and moral improvements of men Inspired by this idea he dedicated his last years to organise a philosophical system with a strong educational appeal the Spiritism

The sex organs which scientists call the genitalia or genitals are the parts of the body that allow sexual reproduction to take place They are also for urination to remove waste products from the body While all animals have sex organs this article is about the sex organs of human beings

The genitals are the main parts of the human body that make men and women different Some parts of the genitals are outside the body while other parts are inside In a man his external genitals are the penis and the scrotum Inside his body the testicles produce sperm and a substance called testosterone which makes a person grow into a man and to feel like a man Other glands produce a fluid called semen The part of a womans genitals that is outside her body is called the vulva Inside her body are the vagina which holds the penis during sexual intercourse the uterus in which a baby grows when the woman is pregnant the ovaries which produce ova and a substance called estrogen which makes a person grow into a woman and to feel like a woman and the Fallopian tubes which connect the ovaries to the uterus

If a man and a woman want to reproduce sexually they have to engage in sexual intercourse This involves placing the mans erect penis into the womans vagina When the man ejaculates his semen flows into the woman If a sperm in the semen reaches the womans Fallopian tubes and fuses with an ovum this causes the woman to become pregnant A man and woman can also have sexual intercourse for pleasure without wishing to have a baby Men and women and gay couples can also use their sex organs in other ways for pleasure

The sex organs are the parts of the body that allow sexual reproduction to take place They are also for urination to remove waste products from the body All animals have some kind of sex organs This article is about the sex organs of human beings In humans the sex organs are in the lower abdomen at the part of the body where the legs join the torso

The scientific name for the sex organs is genitalia or genitals They are also commonly called the reproductive organs The genitals include both organs that can be seen on the outside of the body as well as internal organs Sometimes however the words genitalia or genitals are used to refer only to the external sex organs The sex organs are informally referred to as the private parts or privates

Males and females have different sex organs In fact the genitals are the main parts of the human body that make men and women different

A mans genitals are made up of many parts The parts that can be seen on the outside of a mans body are his penis which is shaped like a banana or a sausage and his scrotum which is a bag that hangs beneath the penis and contains the two testicles

Inside a mans body the testicles make tiny cells called sperm which are needed for sexual reproduction The testicles also make a hormone called testosterone This is a chemical that makes a person grow into a man and feel like a man The testicles are glands which are special parts of the body that make chemicals Other glands that make up the genitals are the prostate seminal vesicles and bulbourethral glands Together these glands make a white sticky fluid called semen that sperm float in Finally a mans body contains ducts such as the two vasa deferentia or ducta deferentia which carry sperm out of the testicles and the urethra which carries semen through the penis and out of the body The urethra also carries urine away from the bladder

In reproduction the job of the penis is to carry sperm from the testicles into a womans body so that a sperm can join together with the womans ovum to form a new cell that will grow into a baby The process of fusion of a sperm and an ovum is called fertilization A mans penis is usually soft quite short and hangs down When a man becomes aroused the inside of his penis fills with blood This causes the penis to become bigger thicker and harder and to stand upright and is called having an erection When a man has an erection he is able to have sexual intercourse by putting his penis into a womans vagina During an erection a valve stops urine from entering the urethra so that only semen flows along it This is why it is very difficult for a man to urinate when he is having an erection

Young boys can have erections but their bodies do not start producing sperm until they have reached puberty This usually happens when they are in their teens

The part of a womans genitals that is on the outside of her body is called the vulva The main parts of the vulva are two sets of fleshy lips called the labia The outer labia can be seen at the front of the womans body On an adult woman they are generally covered with some hair Between the outer labia are the inner labia which do not have hair and are very sensitive At the front of the inner labia is the outside part of the clitoris which is covered by the clitoral hood During sexual intercourse the clitoris gives feelings of pleasure to the woman

Most of a womans genitals are tucked inside her body Behind the labia is a tube called the vagina which cannot be seen on the outside of the body When a man and a woman have sexual intercourse the mans penis is placed into the womans vagina When a woman menstruates blood and other fluid from the uterus pass out from her body through the vagina If a woman uses a tampon to absorb this fluid she puts it into her vagina The vagina is also called the birth canal because when a pregnant woman has a baby it passes through the vagina

Like a man a woman has a tube called the urethra connecting the bladder to the vulva through which urine is removed from the body The opening of the urethra is between the clitoris and the opening to the vagina

In many women the opening of the vagina is partly or completely blocked by a thin tissue called the hymen Some women are born without a hymen The hymen usually breaks when a woman has sexual intercourse for the first time causing some bleeding In some cultures a broken hymen is taken as a sign that a girl has had sex However a broken hymen is not a clear sign of sexual intercourse because other activities such as exercise can also cause the hymen to break In some women the hymen may remain unbroken even after sex

At the top of the vagina is the cervix which is a ring of muscle separating the vagina from the uterus or womb The cervix allows menstrual fluid to flow from the uterus into the vagina and during sexual intercourse it allows semen from a mans penis to flow from the vagina into the uterus The uterus is a very muscular and stretchy organ in which babies grow during pregnancy When a woman is not pregnant each month the lining of the uterus grows thicker then breaks down causing her to menstruate Connected to the top of the uterus are two Fallopian tubes on the left and right These tubes join the uterus to the two ovaries The ovaries produce ova or egg cells that are needed for reproduction Each month an ovum travels from one of the ovaries into a Fallopian tube If after the woman has had sexual intercourse with a man the ovum fuses with a sperm and implants in the wall of the uterus the woman will become pregnant The ovaries also produce the female hormone estrogen which causes a person to grow into a woman and to feel like a woman

Young girls do not start producing ova and menstruating until they have reached puberty Like boys this usually happens in their teens Once a woman starts menstruating she is capable of becoming pregnant

The sex organs or genitals are used for sexual reproduction and for sexual intercourse For sexual reproduction to happen a man and a woman need to have sexual intercourse with each other A mans penis becomes erect when he is aroused for example when he sees a naked woman or is touched by her When a woman is aroused her clitoris and vulva also swell and the inside of her vagina produces mucus a substance that makes it slippery To reproduce the man places his penis inside the womans vagina and moves it backwards and forwards The woman may also move her hips back and forth or in a circular motion The friction caused by this movement together with the warmth and pressure of the vagina causes the man to have pleasurable feelings in the penis which grow stronger and stronger When the feelings are at their strongest the man is said to be having an orgasm At this point muscles in the mans body contract strongly again and again to push semen through the urethra The semen then ejaculates or shoots out from the end of the penis into the womans vagina The woman may also have an orgasm which causes the vagina to tense up and relax repeatedly Scientists are not sure why women have orgasms Some believe that the orgasm helps the sperm in the mans semen to swim up the vagina into the cervix so that it is more likely that a sperm cell will fuse with an egg cell Others think that the female orgasm causes the vagina to hold on to the penis more tightly which makes sex more exciting for the man and causes him to ejaculate more quickly or to produce more semen or that it encourages a woman to have sex more often as it feels good Both of these events would make pregnancy more likely to happen After the man has ejaculated the blood flows out of his penis and it becomes smaller and soft again

Sometimes a man and a woman may have sexual intercourse because it gives them pleasure without wishing for the woman to become pregnant They may try to stop fertilization from happening by using methods of contraception or birth control Common methods of birth control include the man wearing a condom on his penis and the woman taking birth control pills that stop her ovaries from releasing egg cells

Apart from the man putting his penis into the womans vagina the sex organs can be used in other ways in sexual intercourse The man and woman can rub each others sex organs with their hands They can use sex toys such as dildos or vibrators They can also engage in oral sex When a man uses his mouth lips and tongue to touch a womans clitoris and vulva this is called cunnilingus When a woman uses her mouth lips and tongue to touch a mans penis this is called fellatio A man can also put his penis into a womans anus This is called anal sex

People who are gay or homosexual also use their genitals to have sexual intercourse with each other Two women can rub each others sex organs put sex toys into them or perform oral sex on each other Two men can also rub each others sex organs or perform oral sex or anal sex on each other

When a man strokes his own penis or a woman rubs her clitoris and vulva in order to feel good or to reach orgasm this is called masturbation

The sex organs are also used for urination which is one of the ways in which the body removes waste products Both men and women have a bladder which is an organ that stores urine In a man a thin tube called the urethra passes from his bladder right through his penis In a woman the urethra opens into the vulva When a person urinates urine flows from the bladder through the urethra and out of the body

A poodle is a breed of dog They are very smart and are one of the most popular kinds of dogs Many people own them or show them Poodles were once used as hunting and sporting dogs but now they are mostly pets Poodles do not shed as much fur as some dogs so they are good pets for people who are allergic to dogs

Poodles are also popular because they come in many different colors and sizes They are most often white or black but can be orange called apricot dark gray called blue and other colors There are also some rare colors such as chocolate brown and brindle 

Poodles are bred in many different sizes The three main sizes from largest to smallest are Standard Miniature and Toy There are also other sizes like the very small Teacup that are not official This means that these other sizes cannot be part of professional dog shows

Irish or Gaeilge is a language spoken in Ireland Irish is a Celtic language This means that Irish is similar to Scottish Gaelic Breton Cornish Manx and Welsh Many people who speak Irish can understand some Scottish Gaelic but not Welsh This is because the Celtic languages are divided into two groups One group is called the p Celtic languages and the other is called the q Celtic languages Irish and Scottish Gaelic are q Celtic languages and Welsh is a p Celtic language Irish has no yes or no words There were great poets who wrote in Irish Their poems became the songs of the people People told stories about the heroes of old times Many of the poems were about them At one point Queen Elizabeth I of England and Ireland promoted Irish with a view to using it to translate the Bible into that language and tried to learn it herself Christopher Nugent ninth Baron of Delvin gave her a primer about it Until the nineteenth century most people in Ireland spoke Irish this changed after 1801 because after Ireland joined the United Kingdom its state schools were incorporated into the British system and required to only teach or even allow English speaking The Roman Catholic Church also began to discourage Irish and Daniel OConnell though a nationalist and an Irish speaker himself discouraged it because most job opportunities were in the USA and the British Empire 

Today Irish is the first official language of the Republic of Ireland although in practice English retains a dominant position in government It is not spoken by most Irish people outside the Gaeltacht for day to day life but a lot of people speak it daily also or when among friends or family It has to be taught in all schools in Ireland

The newest Gaeltacht in Ireland is on the Falls Road in Belfast City where the whole community has been making Irish their first language for several years This area is called the Gaeltacht Quarter 

There are around 15 million speakers The places where Irish is spoken a lot are called Gaeltachts or in Irish Gaeltachta Around 70 of the people in these areas can speak Irish

The Apollo program was a project by the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration The goal was to send a human to explore the Moon and bring him home to earth safe It was started by US President John F Kennedy in 1961 The first person to walk on the Moon was Neil Armstrong of Apollo 11 on June 20 1969 

One reason the program started was that the Soviet Union was the first country to send a person into outer space Since this was during the Cold War many in the US thought that the US needed to stay ahead of the USSR in space exploration

The Apollo program ended in 1972 After that NASA began to work on the Space Shuttle program the International Space Station and many unmanned space exploration projects

NASA or the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is the part of the United States government that deals with space broken wikt linkExplorationexploration and aeronautics the operating and designing of planes NASA has had many successful missions including the ISS and Apollo 11 which put the first man on the Moon in 1969 NASA started on July 29 1958 NASAs motto is For the benefit of all

NASA was preceded by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics NACA was a US federal agency founded on March 3 1915 to undertake promote and institutionalize aeronautical research On October 1 1958 the agency was dissolved and its assets and personnel transferred to the newly created National Aeronautics and Space Administration

NASA was founded to compete with the Soviet Union in the space race A space race is a period in history when two countries compete or have a race to explore space A space race can be for reasons of war or just for exploration In the 1950s and 1960s there was a space race between the USA and the Soviet Union  now called Russia The Soviets started first launching Sputnik 1 the first object made by people to enter space in October 1957 The Americans were worried by this It caused a crisis known as the Sputnik Crisis as the Americans feared the Russians might start building weapons in space This all happened at a time called the Cold War when the USA and the Soviet Union were always very close to war

Originally NASA was very small with only four laboratories and around eighty people working there In 1960 they set up the Mercury project The Mercury Project was a series of space missions designed by NASA They were mostly to test if humans could survive in space After they proved it was possible for people to live in space they moved on They recruited a German engineer and scientist called Wernher von Braun to help build their rockets Von Braun had worked to help the Nazis build test rockets during World War II On May 15th 1961 astronaut Alan Shepard became the first American in space Less than a year later John Glenn became the first American to orbit or circle the Earth in a spacecraft called Friendship 7 Once the Mercury Project proved that humans could live in space the Gemini Project was started But less than year after it began it was replaced with the Apollo Program

The Apollo Program was started by President John F Kennedy in the 1960s The program was made of 16 missions designed to send a man to the Moon and return him safely back to Earth The first Apollo mission Apollo 1 ended in disaster when a fire in the command module killed all the astronauts onboard The Apollo 8 and 9 missions went to the moon They tested equipment and took photos but did not land The projects main success came in 1969 when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the Moon as part of Apollo 11 The mission was a big success for NASA and over six million people watched it worldwide

In the 1980s and 1990s NASA began to concentrate on building Space Shuttles Four Shuttles were built by 1985 The first to launch was the space shuttle Columbia in October 1981 At this time the public began to lose interest in the space program and NASA faced budget cuts They had planned for the space shuttles to cost less as they could be used more than once But eventually it turned out the Space Shuttles were more expensive as building them in the first place cost more money than normal There was further problems for NASA after the Space Shuttle Challenger disintegrated while in mid air over the Atlantic Ocean near Florida All seven astronauts on board died in the disaster The incident is known as the Challenger Disaster

The Challenger Disaster forced NASA to think about the way they worked The entire Space Shuttle fleet was suspended for a year after the disaster It was also around this time that NASA launched the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit Hubble became one of NASAs greatest achievements when it took a photo known as the Hubble Deep Field The HDF is sometimes called by scientists the most important image ever taken

NASA also now works with the Russian space agency quite often When the Space Shuttle fleet was grounded after the Columbia disaster in 2003 Russian rockets continued to take up parts to the International Space Station Costing over 10 billion dollars so far NASA has lost much public interest in this project

In 2010 NASA is going to shut down the space shuttles and replace it with another rocketfactdateJuly 2010

NASAs continuing operations include missions to the planets Mars Saturn and Pluto Missions to Jupiter are also planned for the near future The New Horizons spacecraft flew past Jupiter in February 2007 studying some of the planets moons On July 14 2015 the craft will fly by Pluto take high resolution pictures of the planets surface and analyse the chemical properties of its atmosphere or air 

NASA announced in 2004 that they plan to have a permanent Moon base by 2020 A senior NASA administrator also stated in 2007 that NASA aims to put a man on Mars by 2037

However in early 2010 President Barack Obama cancelled the Constellation project that was aiming to have humans return to the moons surface by 2020 He said the project was behind schedule and lacking in innovation At the same time he cut back the amount of money NASA will be getting from the government in 2011

NASA has launched over 500 missions in its 50 year history There have been over 150 missions with humans onboard or manned missions NASA spacecraft such as Cassini Huygens and the Voyager program have visited every planet in the Solar System Four NASA spacecraft have left the Solar System Voyager 1 Voyager 2 Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 As of 2010 Voyager 2 is 11346 AU or around 17000000000 kilometers away from Earth

Advaita Vedanta is a type of Hinduism People who believe in Advaita believe that their soul is never really different from God The Sanskrit word for soul is Atman and the Sanskrit word for God is Brahman The most famous Hindu philosopher was named Adi Shankara who lived in India more than a thousand years ago Adi Sankara learned the sacred texts of Hinduism like Vedas and Upanishads under his teacher Govinda Bhagavadpada and later wrote extensive commentaries of Hindu sacred texts called Upanishads In these commentaries he proposed the theory of Advaita saying that the Upanishad actually teach that the individual soul is not different from God He also taught that there is only one essential principle called Brahman and everything else is a kind of expression of that one Brahman Because of this theory of one being his teachings became popular as the Advaita The way he said this to people was Atman is Brahman 

Adi Shankara was very smart and knew that people would wonder how he could say such an odd thing He realized that many people would ask him If a persons soul is really one with God all along then what makes a person feel so separate from God His answer to this was that we are ignorant of our real self being God because we see through a kind of filter  like looking through a dirty piece of glass  and he called this filter we look through maya which means illusion in Sanskrit Shankara said that our ignorance makes us feel very separate from God and even from everything around us Shankara suggested that the best way people can find the truth is for them to try to clear their thinking of all ignorant thoughts be very good and think very hard about who they really are He said that if a person did all these things he would realize that God was himself all along 

This is a very different idea from some other religions where we are told we are separate from God and need to go to Him In Advaita the idea is that people never really were separate from God but their ignorance made them see it that way

Not all Hindus believe in Advaita Vedanta Many others believe there is a difference between a persons soul and God just like in many other religions 

The Parthenon is a temple in the middle of the Acropolis in Athens Greece It was a temple to Athena for nearly 2000 years The name Parthenon means the virgins place in Greek It was built between 447 BC and 432 BC during the reign of Pericles It is considered one of Greeces greatest architecture accomplishments 

Thomas Bruce 7th Earl of Elgin took the some of the sculptures now called the Elgin Marbles from the Parthenon in 1759 They have been on display in the British Museum since 1816

The building was constructed using limestone foundations and 22 000 tons of pentelic marble 

The building was designed by the architects Ictinus and Callicrates It has 46 doric columns which support the roof with 8 across the front and back and 17 on each side

Physical anthropology deals primarily with looking at how the human body has changed over the course of time It compares the human body to that of other primates Studies of physical anthropology often include looking at the theories of Evolution 

Jackals are canids found in Africa and Asia They are nocturnal carnivorous and eat small mammals birds and reptiles To hunt they can run at speeds of 16kmh

Jackals are monogamous and a pair defends its territory from other pairs They mark the territory with urine and feces The territory may be large enough to hold some young adults who live with their parents until they have their own territory Sometimes jackals join small packs for example to hunt a big animal but normally hunt alone or as a pair

Today they are very common on safaris and are also found next to human settlements

There are four species of jackals

A canid from Ethiopia and Eritrea the Ethiopian Wolf is sometimes called Simian Jackal but it is really a wolf The Ethiopian Wolf is one of the rarest and most endangered of all canids

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization also called the North Atlantic Alliance the Atlantic Alliance or the Western Alliance is an international organization for peace and defense established in 1949 from the North Atlantic Treaty signed in Washington DC USA on April 4 1949 Its headquarters are in Brussels Belgium Its other official name is the same name in French Organisation du Trait de lAtlantique Nord

NATO has two official languages English and French defined in Article 14 of the North Atlantic Treaty 

Its members in the beginning were The United States Belgium the Netherlands Luxembourg France the United Kingdom Canada Portugal Italy Norway Denmark and Iceland Three years later on 18 February 1952 Greece and Turkey also joined

In 1954 the Soviet Union suggested that it should join NATO to preserve peace in Europe The NATO countries did not agree as it would destroy the purpose of NATO

When West Germany joined the organization on 9 May 1955 it was described as a decisive turning point in the history of our continent by Halvard Lange Foreign Minister of Norway at the time Indeed the result was the Warsaw Pact signed on 14 May 1955 by the Soviet Union and its satellite states as response to NATO This hardened the positions of the two opposing sides of the Cold War

After the Cold war in 1999 three former communist countries Hungary the Czech Republic and Poland joined the NATO On 29 March 2004 seven more Northern European and Eastern European countries joined NATO Estonia Latvia and Lithuania and also Slovenia Slovakia Bulgaria and Romania 

Croatia and Albania received NATO membership invitation on 3 April 2008 Republic of Macedonia received only conditional invitation because it was vetoed by Greece due to Republic of Macedonias name dispute with Greece

Sakharov was a very clever scientist He graduated from college during World War II but was kept out of the army to do scientific research for the government Sakharov helped the Soviets develop the hydrogen bomb in the 1950s But he also made many peaceful uses of nuclear power

The bomb he had helped make started Sakharov to be a dissident He argued with Khrushchev against nuclear tests that were not needed He was afraid that these tests put peoples lives and healths in danger without need He began asking too for more freedom of speech The government removed him from his secret work and as his special job as a scientist Sakharov began to see what unhappy lives most Soviet citizens led

Persecution only made him speak out more He asked for more religious liberty and defended others who had spoken out and been put into jail The secret police began to watch him and to make files of information against him After Sakharov criticized activities of the USSRs Arab allies Arab terrorists came to his apartment and held him his wife and his stepson broken wikt linkhostagehostage for an hour Do you want to kill us cried Sakharovs wife We can do worse things than kill you they replied After the terrorists left without doing anything Sakharov tried to tell the police about it The police did not really care

The only thing that protected Sakharov was many people knew about him outside the Soviet Union The Communists were afraid that if something happened to him it would get a bad image of the USSR But when Sakharov criticized the Soviet broken wikt linkinvadeinvasion of Afghanistan in 1979 they became very angry and took him to the city of Gorky There he was watched by the police outside his apartment He tried to go on a hunger strike not eating anything The Soviet Union was afraid he might die so they force fed him

Sakharov kept on asking for glasnost In 1986 Mikhail Gorbachev who agreed with Sakharov and thought there should be glasnost let the dissident scientist return home Sakharov continued to call for reform and on December 12 1989 he publicly demanded an end of Communism Two days later he died But two years later his demand became true as the Communist government ended

The 1st century was the century that lasted from 1 to 100

During this period Europe North Africa and the Near East fell under increasing domination by the Roman Empire It continued expanding under the emperor Claudius The reforms introduced by Augustus during his long reign stabilized the empire Later in the century the Julio Claudian Dynasty which had been founded by Augustus came to an end with the death of Nero in 68 There followed the famous Year of Four Emperors a brief period of civil war and instability which was finally brought to an end by Vespasian 9th Roman emperor and founder of the Flavian Dynasty

China continued to be dominated by the Han Dynasty despite a 14 year interruption by the Xin dynasty under Wang Mang Han rule was restored in 23 Wang Mangs rule represents the watershed between the WesternFormer Han and the EasternLater Han The capital was also moved from Changan to Luoyang

According to the New Testament during the reign of Tiberius Jesus a Jewish religious leader from Galilee was crucified in Jerusalem on the charge of blasphemy for claiming to be the Son of God But God raised him from the dead three days later see Resurrection of Jesus Over the next few decades his followers following the Great Commission including the apostle Paul carried his message throughout the Greek speaking regions of Asia Minor eventually introducing it to Rome itself Roman rulers began to persecute the new sect almost immediately and would continue to do so for centuries sometimes vigorously and other times passively Christian tradition records that all of Christs apostles except John the Evangelist suffered martyrdom

In the 4th century Christianity was eventually taken up by the emperor Constantine One of his successors Julian the Apostate renounced it for paganism and again persecuted the Church However by the end of the 4th century Emperor Theodosius I proclaimed Christianity as the state religion of the Roman Empire

Lynx is the name of four species of wild cats Not all biologists agree about the taxonomy of lynx in use today Kitten is a baby cat or lynx

Lynxes have short tails and usually some hair on the ears They have large paws padded for walking on snow and long whiskers on the face The color of the body is from light brown to grey and is sometimes marked with dark brown spots especially on the legs They weigh about 5 kg or about 11 pounds and can weigh up to about 30 kg

The lynx live in the high altitude forests with many shrubs reeds and grass It hunts only on the ground but it can climb trees and swim 

It can be found in the some places in northern Scandinavia in North America and also in the Himalayas Since the 1990s people try to move part of the population of the Eurasian Lynx to Germany It can also be found in Biaowiea Forest and southern Spain

Since 1999 the Colorado Division of Wildlife try to move other wild lynx population from Canada back to the United States

Usually lynxes live alone but a group can travel and hunt together They sleep in crevices or under rocks It gives birth to 2 to 4 kittens at a time It eats birds and mammals for example rabbits sheep and goats

The Marbled Cat Pardofelis marmorata is sometimes also called a kind of lynx The Caracal or Desert Lynx and the Jungle Cat are similar to the lynx but they are not much of a relative

The Iberian Lynx is the most endangered feline in the world There are only two populations in the southern Spain Hunting lynxes is illegal in many countries

RAID is an acronym that stands for Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks or Redundant Array of Independent Disks RAID is a term used in computing With RAID several hard disks are made into one logical disk There are different ways this can be done Each of the methods that puts the hard disks together has some benefits and drawbacks over using the drives as single disks independent of each other The main reasons why RAID is used are

It is not possible to achieve all of these goals at the same time so choices need to be made

There are also some bad things

Most of the work on RAID is based on a paper written in 1988 

Companies have used RAID systems to store their data since the technology was made There are different ways in which RAID systems can be made Since its discovery the cost of building a RAID system has come down a lot For this reason even some computers and appliances that are used at home have some RAID functions Such systems can be used to store music or movies for example

A hard disk is a part of a computer Normal hard disks use magnetism to store information When hard disks are used they are available to the operating system In Microsoft Windows each hard disk will get a drive letter Unix and Linux like operating systems have a single rooted directory tree This means that people who use the computers sometimes do not know where the information is stored

In computing the hard disks are sometimes called physical drives or physical disks What the operating system shows the user is sometimes called logical disk A physical drive can be split into different sections called disk partitions Usually each disk partition contains one file system The operating system will show each partition like a logical disk 

Therefore to the user both the setup with many physical disks and the setup with many logical disks will look the same The user cannot decide if a logical disk is the same as a physical disk or if it simply is a part of the disk Storage Area Networks completely change this view All that is visible of a SAN is a number of logical disks

In the computer data is organised in the form of bits and bytes In most systems 8 bits make up a byte Computer memory uses electricity to store the data hard disks use magnetism Therefore when data is written on a disk the electric signal is converted into a magnetic one When data is read from disk the conversion is done in the other direction An electrical signal is made from the polarity of a magnetic field

A RAID array joins two or more hard disks so that they make a logical disk There are different reasons why this is done the most commons ones are

RAID is done by using special hardware or software on the computer The joined hard disks will then look like one hard disk to the user Most RAID levels increase the redundancy this means that they store the data more often or they store information on how to reconstruct the data This allows for a number of disks to fail without the data being lost When the failed disk is replaced the data it should contain will be copied or rebuilt from the other disks of the system This can take a long time The time it takes depends on different factors like the size of the array

One of the reasons why many companies are using RAID is that the data in the array can simply be used Those using the data need not be aware they are using RAID at all When a failure occurred and the array is recovering access to the data will be slower Accessing the data during this time will also slow down the recovery process but this is still much faster than not being able to work with the data at all  Depending on the RAID level however disks may not fail while the new disk is being prepared for use A disk failing at that time will result in losing all the data in the array 

The different ways to join disks are called RAID levels A bigger number for the level is not necessarily better Different RAID levels have different purposes Some RAID levels need special disks and special controllers

In 1978 a man called Norman Ken Ouchi who worked at IBM made a suggestion describing the plans for what would later become RAID 5 The plans also described something similar to RAID 1 as well as the protection of a part of RAID 4

Workers at the University of Berkeley helped to plan out research in 1987 They were trying to make it possible for RAID technology to recognize two hard drives instead of one They found that when RAID technology had two hard drives it had much better storage than with only one hard drive However it crashed much more often

In 1988 the different types of RAID were written about by David Patterson Garth Gibson and Randy Katz in their article called A Case for Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks This article was the first to call the new technology RAID and the name became official

RAID uses a few basic ideas which were described in the article RAID High Performance Reliable Secondary Storage by Peter Chen and others published in 1994

Caching is a technology that also has its uses in RAID systems There are different kinds of caches that are used in RAID systems

In modern systems a write request is shown as done when the data has been written to the cache This does not mean that the data has been written to the disk Requests from the cache are not necessarily handled in the same order than they were written to the cache This makes it possible that if the system fails sometimes some data has not been written to the disk involved For this reason many systems have a cache that is backed by a battery

When talking about a mirror this is a very simple idea Instead of the data being in only one place there are several copies of the data These copies usually are on different hard disks If there are two copies one of them can fail without the data being affected Mirroring can also give a boost when reading data It will always be taken from the fastest disk that responds Writing data is slower though because all disks need to be updated

With striping the data is split into different parts These parts then end up on different disks This means that writing data is faster as it can be done in parallel This does not mean that there will not be faults as each block of data is only found on one disk

It is possible to calculate different kinds of checksums Some methods of calculating checksums allow finding a mistake Most RAID levels that use redundancy can do this Some methods are more difficult to do but they allow to not only detect the error but to fix it

Many of the ways to have RAID support something is called a hot spare A hot spare is an empty disk that is not used in normal operation When a disk fails data can directly be copied onto the hot spare disk That way the failed disk needs to be replaced by a new empty drive to become the hot spare

RAID works by spreading the data over several disks Two of the terms often used in this context are stripe size and chunk size 

The chunk size is the smallest data block that is written to a single disk of the array The stripe size is the size of a block of data that will be spread over all disks That way with four disks and a stripe size of 64 kilobytes 16 kB will be written to each disk The chunk size in this example is therefore 16 kB Making the stripe size bigger will mean a faster data transfer rate but also a bigger maximum latency In this case this is the time needed to get a block of data

Many controllers can put disks together in the following way Take the first disk till it ends then they take the second and so on In that way several smaller disks look like a larger one This is not really RAID as there is no redundancy Also spanning can combine disks where RAID 0 cannot do anything Generally this is called just a bunch of disks

This is like a distant relative of RAID because the logical drive is made of different physical drives Concatenation is sometimes used to turn several small drives into one larger useful drive This can not be done with RAID 0 For example JBOD could combine 3 GB 15 GB 55 GB and 12 GB drives into a logical drive at 355 GB which is often more useful than the drives alone

In the diagram to the right data are concatenated from the end of disk 0 to the beginning of disk 1 end of disk 1 to the beginning of disk 2 If RAID 0 were used then disk 0 and disk 2 would be truncated to 28 blocks the size of the smallest disk in the array for a total size of 84 blocks

Some RAID controllers use JBOD to talk about working on drives without RAID features Each drive shows up separately in the operating system This JBOD is not the same as concatenation

Many Linux systems use the terms linear mode or append mode The Mac OS X 104 implementation called a Concatenated Disk Set does not leave the user with any usable data on the remaining drives if one drive fails in a concatenated disk set although the disks otherwise operate as described above

Concatenation is one of the uses of the Logical Volume Manager in Linux It can be used to create virtual drives

Most modern hard disks have a standard called Self Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology SMART allows to monitor certain things on a hard disk drive Certain controllers allow to replace a single hard disk even before it fails for example because SMART or another disk test reports too many correctable errors To do this the controller will copy all the data onto a hot spare drive After this the disk can be replaced by another

Leonid Brezhnev was a leader of the Soviet Union Born in 1906 Brezhnev was dictator of the Soviet Union from 1964 until his death in 1982 During the Second World War in Russia Brezhnev acted as a spy instead he spied on his own countrymen for political reasons 

Unlike Nikita Khrushchev the leader of the Soviet Union before him Brezhnev did not agree with the process of destalinization and did not support reform Under Brezhnev the Soviet economy almost completely consisted of military spending Because all of the countrys resources were going to the military just like under Joseph Stalin consumer wants were ignored The standard of living began to fall

Brezhnev died on November 10 1982

An approximation is a version of a piece of information that does not describe it exactly but is close enough to be used An approximation may be used either when the exact piece of information is not known or when its too long or complicated and people need something simpler

For example if you wanted to add 20002 and 20003 you can add 2 and 2 and it would be an approximation

Aesop or sop known only for his fables was by tradition a slave of African descent who lived from about 620 to 560 BC in Ancient Greece Aesops Fables are still taught as moral lessons and used as subjects for various entertainments especially childrens plays and cartoons

Nothing was known about Aesop from credible records The tradition was that he was at one point freed from slavery and that he eventually died at the hands of Delphians In fact the obscurity shrouding his life has led some scholars to deny his existence altogether

His most famous fable in America is a parable of the tortoise and the hare In this story a rabbit challenges a tortoise to a race The rabbit is sure of its victory and as a result depending on the version of the story in some way completes the race slower than the turtle Often the hare takes a nap or takes too many breaks The persistent tortoise despite being slower wins because it persevered

Aesops Fables or Aesopica refers to a collection of fables credited to Aesop Aesops Fables has also become a blanket term for collections of brief fables usually involving personified animals

The fables remain a popular choice for moral education of children today Many stories included in Aesops Fables such as The Fox and the Grapes The Tortoise and the Hare and The Shepherd Boy and the Wolf are well known throughout the world

The term smell may refer to one of the following articles

Olfaction is the sense of smell The sense of smell is how a man or animal notices a smell by using the nose Animals have much better noses than people Animals can detect small particles in the air or sometimes water that people can not 

People have special cells in the nose that can detect some chemicals These cells are called olfactory epithelium All vertebrates have these cells The smell is first processed by the olfactory bulb in the olfactory system Then this information is given to the brain 

In insects smells are sensed by sensilia on the antennae and first processed by the antennal lobe

Camembert cheese more generally known as Camembert is a French soft cheese It originated in the village of Camembert in Normandy Since 1983 the name Camembert de Normandie has been protected as Appellation dOrigine controle

Camembert is made from unpasteurized cows milk and is ripened by the moulds Penicillium candida and Penicillium camemberti for at least three weeks It is produced in small rounds about 250 grams in weight which are wrapped in paper and boxed in thin wooden boxes

When fresh it is quite crumbly and relatively hard but it characteristically ripens and becomes more runny and strongly flavoured as it ages

Camembert can be used in many dishes but it is popularly eaten uncooked on bread or with wine or meat to enjoy the subtle flavour and texture which do not survive heating 

Camembert was reputedly invented in 1791 by Marie Harel a farmer from Normandy However the origin of the cheese we know today as camembert is more likely to rest with the beginnings of the industrialisation of the cheese making process at the end of the 19th century In 1890 an engineer M Ridel invented the wooden box which was used to carry the cheese and helped to send it for longer distances in particular to America where it became very popular These boxes are still used today

Before fungi were properly understood the colour of Camembert rind was a matter of chance most commonly blue grey with brown spots From the early 20th century onwards the rind has been more commonly pure white but it was not until the mid 1970s that pure white became standard

The cheese was famously issued to French troops in the First World War becoming firmly fixed in the French popular culture as a result It has many other roles in French culture literature and history It is now internationally known and many local varieties are made around the world

The cheese is said to have inspired Salvador Dal to create his famous painting The Persistence of Memory Its melting watches were inspired by the sight of a melting wheel of over ripe Camembert

The Camembert de Normandie was granted a protected designation of origin in 1992 after the original AOC in 1983

Camembert A National Myth by Pierre Boisard ISBN 0 520 22550 3 claims that Camembert was one of the first globalised homogenised and standardised foods

Body piercing or just piercing is a form of body modification where humans of either gender pierce their skin to put jewellery through the hole later There are many different reasons some people have piercings such as religious or other cultural purposes Many people especially in North America and Europe choose to be pierced for ornamental or sexual pleasure

In early records it was not common to discuss the use of piercings or their meanings However body adornment and modification are estimated have been around for more than 5000 years found in mummies like tzi the Iceman Europes oldest natural mummy estimated to be about 5300 years old Piercing of the ears nose and tongue have a long history in many ancient cultures and lip piercing and stretching were more common in African tribes especially for cultural identification

Body piercings of any kind were not popular in Western cultures in the beginning of the 20th century After World War II the gay subculture used piercings as a fashion statement  Other subcultures such as hippie and the punk movement also began to use piercings as a form of expression in the 1960s and 1970s

Elonka Dunin is an American woman who was born in 1958 Her job is to make computer games at Simutronics Corporation in Missouri She also knows a lot about famous puzzles especially a puzzle called Kryptos which no one knows all the answers to yet

In 2006 she wrote a book with hundreds of puzzles in it called The Mammoth Book of Secret Codes and Cryptograms

A supernova is when a very big star explodes This happens when a star totally runs out of energy to make heat and light The biggest of these stars we know of are called Hypergiants and smaller ones are called supergiants They are very big and because of gravity they press on their centers very hard and use up their energy very quickly so they usually only live for a few million years Then they become a black hole or a neutron star Small stars do not explode They cool and shrink down into a white dwarf star

Supernovas are very big explosions When the star explodes it will be brighter than all other stars around it If a supernova explosion happened near the Earth we could see it in the sky even during the day

Supernova explosions happen rarely In our own galaxy the Milky Way the last supernova happened in the year 1604 We can see supernovas in other galaxies too Every year we see 300 supernovas in other galaxies because there are so many galaxies

Without supernovas there would be no life on Earth This is because many of the chemical elements were made in supernova explosions These are called heavy elements Heavy elements are needed to make living things The supernova is the only way heavy elements can be made Other elements were made by fusion in stars Heavy elements need very high temperature and pressure to form In a macho supernova explosion the temperature and pressure are so high that heavy elements can be made Scientists call this supernova nucleosynthesis

It could be dangerous if a supernova explosion happened very close to the Earth The explosion is very big and many kinds of dangerous radiation are formed But we do not have to be afraid Only very big stars can explode as supernovas There are no stars big enough near the Earth and if there was it would take millions of years for it to happen

Scientists can learn things from supernova explosions Astronomers and scientists who study cosmology often look at supernovas They can also tell us about physics

SN 1572 was seen by Tycho Brahe This supernova helped astronomers learn that things in space could change SN 1604 was seen by Johannes Kepler It was the last supernova close enough to be seen at Earth without a telescope SN 1987A is the only supernova so close that scientists could find neutrinos from it

Disco music Disco music blends pop music with funk music soul music Latin music such as salsa and rock and roll Disco music usually consists of a singer electric guitars synthesizer keyboards electric bass guitar and a drummer or electronic drum machine Disco music is often very simple music with a strong beat and a strong bass line Disco music often has many electronic effects

Disco dancing is often sexually suggestive When people go disco dancing they usually wear tight trousers leather shoes or boots and glittery clothes Women going disco dancing often wore tight clothes that revealed body parts such as their thighs or the upper part of their chest Men going disco dancing often opened up the buttons of their shirts to show the upper part of their chest

Disco music is played at disco clubs In the late 1970s there were famous disco clubs such as Studio 54 in New York City Disco clubs have a large dance floor and a large pa system A Disk Jockey plays records of disco music through powerful amplifiers with a number of high wattage speakers Disco music was usually played very loud with lots of low bass frequencies Disco clubs usually had coloured lights that flashed with the music called scanners and mirror balls with hundreds of small mirrors that reflect light onto the dancers and all corners of the room

Most people who went disco dancing at disco clubs drank alcohol such as champagne and rum Many people consumed illegal drugs such as cocaine or marijuana so that they would become intoxicated People who went disco dancing often had many sexual relationships with people that they would meet at the disco club

Jainism is an ancient religion of India that teaches non violence towards all living beings Its philosophy and practice rely mainly on self effort in progressing the soul on the spiritual ladder to divine consciousness Any soul which has conquered its own inner enemies and achieved the state of supreme being is called jina which means conqueror or victor 

Jainism is also called Shraman Dharma or the religion of Nirgantha by ancient texts It is refered to in Hindi and in Tamil 

Jainism was revived by a lineage of 24 enlightened ascetic leaders called tirthankaras culminating with Parshva and Mahavira In the modern world it is a small but influential religious group with about 42 million followers in India and successful growing immigrant communities in North America Western Europe the Far East Australia and elsewhere

Jains successfully sustained this ancient religion to this era and have significantly influenced and contributed to ethical political and economic spheres in India Jains have an ancient tradition of scholarship and have the highest degree of literacy in India Jain libraries are the oldest in the country Tamil Jains and Tulu Jains who are native to their region residing in places of TamilNadu and Karnataka early since 1st century BC Even though South Indian Jains are distinguishable in some of their routines and practices from North Indian Jains the core philosophies and belief systems are the same for both cultures

A sect is a small religious or political group that separates from a larger group Sects have many of the same beliefs and practices as the original group but often have some different doctrines In contrast a denomination is a large religious group

The Caracal also called Persian lynx or African lynx is a wild cat Caracals are similar to lynxes but are more related to the Serval Caracals are the fastest of the small cats

The Caracal is 65 cm in length plus 30 cm tail It has longer legs and a look very similar to a lynx The colour of its fur may be wine red grey or sand coloured There are also black caracals Young caracals have red spots on the fur but the only markings adults have are black spots above the eyes A special part of the caracal body are its long black ears  the word caracal come from the Turkish word karakulak Their ears are controlled by 20 different muscles to help them find the animals they hunt

Caracals live in Africa and West Asia Their habitat is dry steppes and semi deserts but also can live in places similar to woodlands savannas and scrub forests They live alone or with a mate in a territory 

A caracal may live without drinking for a long time  they get the water from the body of the animals they eat It hunts at night for rodents birds and hares It is not usual but sometimes they hunt small antelopes or young ostriches They prefer to eat only the external meat of the mammals they hunt and do not eat the internal organs and they also do not like eating fur But they eat the feathers of small birds and rotten meat 

They can hunt birds very well a caracal is able to snatch a bird in flight sometimes more than one at a time Caracals can jump and climb every well which enables them to catch hyraxes better than any other carnivore 

Because they can learn tricks and get accustomed to live with humans caracals are sometimes kept as pets Farmers in Africa do not like them because sometimes they enter in farms and eat chickens and other animals So they make their dog chase the caracal

It is not easy to see caracals in nature because they hide very well Drivers in countries where caracals live for example Kenya and Botswana see many animals next to roads but it is very rare a sighting of a caracal 

There are many species of caracals See them and where they live

Eels have fewer fins than other fish They do not have all the belly and chest fins The back and anal fins are long and usually connected to the tail fin The fins do not have spines

The shoulder bones are separate from the skull The scales have smooth edges or are absent

Eels hatch from eggs Baby eels are flat and transparent They are called leptocephalus A young eel is called an elver For a long time people did not know where eels came from because baby eels look very different from adults They thought the babies were a different species

Most eels prefer to live in the shallowest parts of the ocean They live at the bottom of the ocean sometimes in holes Eels in the Anguillidae family come to fresh water to broken wikt linkdwelldwell there Eels in the Nemichthyidae family swim about 500 m below the ocean surface Eels in the Synaphobranchidae family live as deep as 4000 m below the surface

Most eels are predators They hunt their prey

True eels belong to the order Anguilliformes

This order has 4 suborders called Anguilloidei Nemichthyoidei Congroidei and Synaphobranchoidei

The suborders are separated into 19 families The families are divided into 110 genera The genera are then divided into species

There are 400 species of eels in all

Freshwater eels and marine eels are used in Japanese food Eels are used in Cantonese food and Shanghai food

Some people eat the European eel and other eels that live in lakes all around the world A traditional London food is jellied eels The Spanish meal angulas consists of deep fried elvers

Hand netting is the only legal way of catching eels in England It has been done for thousands of years on the River Parrett and River Severn

Eel skins are used to make some wallets and purses

An Easter egg is an egg eaten and used for decoration during the Easter holidays The egg was a symbol of the earth to celebrate spring It was used by early Christians as a sign of the resurrection of Jesus

The use of painted and decorated Easter eggs was first recorded in the 13th century The church did not let people eat eggs during Holy Week but chickens still laid eggs during that week Because there was nothing else to do with the eggs they were used for Easter decoration

In modern times chocolate eggs with a colorful wrapping are given to children to be eaten In the United Kingdom children receive on average 88 chocolate Easter eggs every year It is unclear where this tradition comes from Most likely it comes from a pagan fertility ritual during spring Sometimes on Easter children go on egg hunts to look for Easter eggs They can look for them indoors or outdoors

An easter egg is also the name of something secret added in computer programs such as a joke a picture or a message that can be uncovered

Although there have been claims that Easter eggs came from the pagan symbols there is no solid evidence for this At the Passover a hard boiled egg dipped in salt water is a symbol of both new life and the Passover sacrifice offered at the Temple in Jerusalem In Christian times the egg was a symbol of new life just as a chick might hatch from the egg The Easter egg tradition may have celebrated the end of the privations of Lent In the Medieval Europe people were not allowed to eat eggs on fast days It was traditional to use up all of the eggs that they had before Lent began and this also made the tradition of Pancake Day Eggs were viewed as symbols of new life and fertility through the ages It is believed that for this reason many ancient cultures including the Ancient Egyptians Persians and Romans used eggs during their spring festivals In Eastern Christianity both meat and dairy are still not allowed to be eaten during the fast and eggs are seen as dairy too

It was during Easter that everybody was trying to get rid of the eggs before the fast Eggs were given as gifts for children and servants and used for decoration And this is probably the reason why eggs came to be associated with Easter

Lemurs are primates and prosimians The word lemur comes from the Latin word lemures which means ghosts This name refers to many of the nocturnal lemur species and their large eyes Lemur may be any member of the four lemuriform families but it is also the genus of one of the lemuriform species There are two so called flying lemurs but they are not real lemurs

Lemurs live only on the island of Madagascar and some smaller islands next to it for example the Comoros They weigh from 30g to the 10kg Larger species have all become extinct since human groups moved to Madagascar Usually the smaller lemurs are active at night and the larger ones are active during the day

Lemurs are white and black with a ring tail They are about 15 meters tall and weigh about 2 to 35 kilograms They move quietly usually at night sometimes letting out eerie wailing cries which some people think is the reason why they got their names

Lemurs mostly eat fruit leaves and other plant parts They live in family groups of 5 to 42 members which is called a troop Females are dominant and remain in the same troop for life Males move between troops The females gestation period lasts four to five months and they usually have between one and two babie Lemur mothers nurse their babies until they are about four months old Then they begin to feed the babies solid food such as fruit Lemurs spend most of their time in the trees Some are fantastic leapers flinging themselves from tree to tree Lemurs live for about 27 years 

Lemurs communicate with a variety of hoots They will also send messages with scents When a male lemur wants to scare another male away he first rubs its tail on the smelly glands under its arms and then waves the tail in the other males face These are called stink fights

Species  Today there are approximately 32 35 living lemur species All lemurs are endangered species because people destroy their habitat and hunt them

Good Friday is a religious holiday usually observed by Christians It is also called Holy Friday Black Friday or Great Friday It is observed to remember the crucifixion of Jesus Christ his death and his rising from the dead The holiday is often at the same time as the Jewish holiday of Passover

The estimated year of Good Friday is AD 33 by two different groups and at first as AD 34 by Isaac Newton by the differences between the Biblical and Julian calendars

According to the Bible Jesus was arrested in the Garden of Gethsemane by the Temple Guards This was done through the help of his broken wikt linkdiscipledisciple Judas Iscariot Judas received money for broken wikt linkbetraybetraying Jesus He had told the guards that whomever he kisses was the one they were to arrest Jesus was brought to the house of Annas Annas was the father in law of the high priest at that time Caiaphas There he was questioned However it was with little result Tied up he was sent to Caiaphas the high priest where the Sanhedrin had come together

Lots of people came and said conflicting things about Jesus to make him look bad As he heard these Jesus said nothing At last the high priest tells Jesus I broken wikt linkadjurationadjure you by the Living God to tell us are you the Anointed One the Son of God Jesus said yes You have said it and in time you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Almighty coming on the clouds of Heaven The high priest ripped his clothes crying out that Jesus had blasphemed God The trial ended with a sentence of death While they were questioning Jesus Peter was waiting in the courtyard He also said that he did not know Jesus three times to people standing by According to the Bible Jesus already knew that Peter would say this

In the morning the people brought Jesus to the Roman governor Pontius Pilate They said he was troubling the nation They also said he tried to stop people from paying taxes to Caesar and wanted to make himself a king Pilate questioned Jesus He told the people that Jesus had nothing to be sentenced for When he learned that Jesus was from Galilee Pilate said that Jesus should be judged by the ruler of Galilee King Herod At that time Herod was in Jerusalem for the Passover Feast Herod questioned Jesus but Jesus did not answer Herod sent Jesus back to Pilate Pilate told the people that neither he nor Herod have found Jesus guilty Pilate wished to have Jesus whipped then let him go

It was a custom during the feast of Passover for the Romans to let one prisoner go free as requested by the Jews Pilate asked the crowd whom they would like to go free The crowd asked for Barabbas another prisoner He had gone to prison for murdering people Pilate asked what they would have him do with Jesus At this and they demanded Crucify him Pilates wife warned Pilate to have nothing to do with this broken wikt linkrighteousrighteous man She had had a dream about him earlier that day

Pilate had Jesus whipped then tried to let him go The chief priests demanded that Jesus be sentenced to death because he claimed to be Gods son This filled Pilate with fear He brought Jesus back inside the palace and demanded to know from where he came

Coming before the crowd one last time Pilate declared Jesus innocent He washed his own hands in water to show he has no part in this However Pilate handed Jesus over to be crucified so that the crowd would not get angry and that he could keep his job Jesus carried his cross a place of the Skull or Golgotha in Hebrew In Latin it is called Calvary There he was crucified with two criminals

Jesus is hung on the cross for six hours in extreme pain During his last 3 hours on the cross there is darkness over the whole land At last Jesus cried It is finished He then gave up his spirit There is an earthquake Tombs break open and the curtain in the Temple is torn from top to bottom The centurion on guard at the crucifixion declares Truly this was Gods Son 

Joseph of Arimathea a member of the Sanhedrin and secret follower of Jesus who had not said yes to his death went to Pilate He asked for the body of Jesus Another secret follower of Jesus and member of the Sanhedrin named Nicodemus brought a mix of spices and helped wrap the body of Christ Pilate asked the centurion to make sure that Jesus is dead A soldier pierced the side of Jesus causing blood and water to flow out At this the centurion told Pilate that Jesus was dead

Joseph of Arimathea took the body of Jesus wrapped it in a clean linen shroud and placed it in his own new tomb that had been carved in the rock The tomb was in a garden Nicodemus also came bringing 75 pounds of myrrh and aloes and placed them in the linen with the body of Jesus according to Jewish burial customs They rolled a large rock over the entrance of the tomb Then they went back home and rested because at sunset began Shabbat According to the Bible on the third day Sunday which is now known as Easter Sunday Jesus rose from the dead

Special prayer services are often held on this day with readings from the Gospel accounts of the events leading up to the crucifixion Major Christian churches say that Christs crucifixion as a voluntary act which he did for everyone who believed in him and also one by which together with resurrection on the third day death itself was crushed

The Archaea are a group of single celled organisms The name comes from Greek old ones They are a major division of living organisms

Archaea are tiny simple organisms They were originally discovered in extreme environments but are now thought to be common to more average conditions Many can survive at very high or very low temperatures or highly salty acidic or alkaline water Some have been found in geysers black smokers oil wells and hot vents in the deep ocean Recent research has found ammonia eating archaea in soil and seawater 

In the past they had been classed with bacteria as prokaryotes and named archaebacteria but this classification is a mistake The Archaea have an independent evolutionary history and show many differences in their biochemistry from other forms of life They are now classified as a separate domain in the three domain system In this system the three distinct branches of evolutionary descent are the Archaea Bacteria and Eukaryota

Archaea are like bacteria prokaryotes single celled organisms that do not have nuclei and cell organelles of the eukaryote type

Jared Mason Diamond is an American author and scientist He is famous for writing a book named Guns Germs and Steel which in 1997 won a Pulitzer Prize

Diamond was born in Boston Massachusetts His father was a doctor and his mother was a teacher He received his college degree from Harvard University in 1958 and then he received a doctorate degree from the University of Cambridge in 1961

In 1966 he became a teacher at UCLA a university in Los Angeles California He has also traveled to some islands called New Guinea which are far away from the United States in the South Pacific Ocean Diamond is famous for knowing a lot about the birds that lived on that island and he has traveled there many times

Diamond is very famous for the things that he writes He is able to write about science in ways that many people can understand and he has written many articles for famous magazines like Discover in the United States 

He also writes books One of his first books was called The Third Chimpanzee which talked about the way that people evolved from monkeys and how many things are the same between humans and monkeys

His most famous book is Guns Germs and Steel In his book Diamond explained why he thought that different parts of the earth had people on them at different times and why some people in some parts of the world had more science or farming than people in other parts of the world The book went over thousands of years of human history

In 2004 he wrote another book called Collapse How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed In this book Diamond wrote about why he thought that some groups of people from many hundreds of years ago were able to have their groups get very big and strong while other groups fell apart His book talked about what people today can maybe learn from the studying the problems from history

The Iglesia ni Cristo is a church which was made in the Philippines by Felix Manalo in 1914 The INC says it was made by Jesus Christ The church does not believe in the religious teachings of the Trinity including the teaching that Jesus is God

Felix Manalo joined many religious organizations as a young adult He said that God gave him a mission to teach the gospel and to bring back the first church made by Jesus The INC began with a handful of followers on July 27 1914 in Punta Santa Ana Manila with Manalo as highest minister It has now spread to many different countries 

Some of the teachings INC believes in are

In some countries a municipal court is a court with limited jurisdiction both in people and laws Most commonly municipal courts only deal with the laws and citizens of one city or town But in some places they make decisions for an entire county and may be involved with early hearings of cases that will be tried in a higher court Some things that often involve municipal courts are traffic tickets leash laws and building code violations and death

Municipal courts in Mississippi are Judge Alone courts This means that judges alone hear the presented cases and offendershave no right to jury trials In felony cases in Mississippi the Municipal court holds a preliminary hearing and then sends the case to the grand jury of the state The Municipal court is not a court of record and its cases are summarized by docket

There are no municipal court facilities in the state All courthouses are done at the county level For example if a speeding ticket violation occurred it automatically goes to the county seat in which the violation occurs whether it is in a municipality or unincorporated In the case of some elongated counties like Chatham County there is an alternate courtroom in Siler City as well as Pittsboro the county seat In other cases where there are multiple large population centers like in Guilford County court cases are handled in Greensboro and High Point Although a federal issue traffic violations occurring in military bases are not subject to civilian courts 

Emma Goldman was one of the most well known anarchists from the late 1800s and early to mid 1900s 

Emma Goldman was an anarchist so she did not like governments She was known as an anarcho communist because she also had communist ideas She believed that people should run their own lives and that everyone should be equal She also was a supporter of feminism and was one of the first people to support gay rights She was also an atheist

She originally supported the use of violence to bring about revolution but later in life decided that violence should only be used for self defense

She was born in modern day Lithuania She moved to Rochester New York with her sister when she was 17 

At first she worked in a textile factory and married her co worker Jacob Kersner Their marriage was short and Goldman moved to New York City and became a member of the anarchist community She became good friends with Alexander Berkman and helped him plan the attempted assassination of Henry Clay Frick a rich man who treated his workers badly Berkman was unsuccessful and spent fourteen years in prison but Goldman was not punished 

Goldman did face many legal troubles though In 1893 she was convicted of starting a riot and spent a year in prison She was arrested in 1901 for allegedly conspiring in the assassination of President McKinley but was never found guilty In 1916 she was spent time in prison for giving out information on birth control In 1917 she was arrested and spent two years in prison for not supporting World War I 

In 1919 Goldman and Berkman were deported to Russia because the American government thought they were too dangerous The Russian Revolution had just happened and Goldman was hopeful that Russia might end up being a good place She ended up deciding that the revolution in Russia was not as good as she thought and that the Bolsheviks tricked many of the people in Russia She thought the Bolsheviks were too controlling and were too powerful She also did not like that the Soviet Union put lots of anarchists in jail for not agreeing with them

She and Berkman left after two years and Goldman lived in many places in Europe including England and France In 1936 she moved to Spain to help the anarchists fight the fascists during the Spanish Civil War

Computers are electrical machines Therefore Computer engineering is related to Electrical engineering and Computer science If you study Computer engineering you learn about the hardware and software of computers You will learn circuit theory and electronic circuits too Because Computer engineering is closely linked with Electrical engineering the fields are found in the same department at many universities 

Computer engineering is often compared to Computer science Computer engineering is about computer hardware and some software Computer science is about computer software only Computer engineers study Computer engineering but software engineers study Computer science

Computer engineering is a difficult major in college but computer engineers are needed Software engineering companies telecommunications firms designers of digital hardware and many other companies hire Computer engineering majors right out of college and pay them well

Computer engineering students learn about computers and computer related system design and development The computer related systems are software systems hardware systems and systems of software and hardware in combination Students also need to learn fundamental science subjects and mathematics

Maharbal was Hannibals cavalry leader during the Second Punic War Many times he was important in Carthages successes over Rome In his Italian campaign Hannibal always was able to have more cavalry than Rome and so relied on them and Maharbal to give himself a big advantage

Maharbal is most famous for what he said to Hannibal after the Battle of Cannae According to Livy a Roman historian the conversation went like this after Maharbal said he wanted to go with the army to Rome immediately

I commend your zeal Hannibal said to Maharbal but I need time to weigh the plan that you propose Assuredly Maharbal replied no one man has been blessed with all Gods gifts You know Hannibal how to gain a victory you do not know how to use it  Livy The History of Rome 2251

In Simple English I like your enthusiasm Hannibal said to Maharbal but I need time to think about what you want to do Maharbal said back It is true that no one is perfect You know how to win Hannibal you do not know what to do after

Livy wrote this in Latin so Maharbals reply is often quoted in Latin and is a famous phrase Vincere scis Hannibal victoria uti nescis

Hannibal sometimes known as Hnnibal Barca was a Carthaginian statesman and general He was the biggest enemy of the Roman Republic He is most famous for what he did in the Second Punic War He marched an army from Iberia over the Pyrenees mountains and the Alps mountains into northern Italy and defeated the Romans in a series of battles He kept an army in Italy for many years A Roman invasion of North Africa made him return to Carthage He lost and the Romans made him leave Carthage He lived at the Seleucid court and convinced the Emperor to fight Rome When he lost a naval battle Hannibal fled to the Bithynian court When the Romans told him to give up he killed himself

Hannibal is listed as one of the greatest military commanders in history Military historian Theodore Ayrault Dodge once called Hannibal the father of strategy because even his greatest enemy Rome copied his military ideas

Hannibal which means mercy of Baal was the son of Hamilcar Barca After Carthage lost the First Punic War Hamilcar began to try to make Carthage have better luck Hamilcar began to conquer the tribes of Spain Carthage at the time was in a poor condition Its navy could not carry his army to Iberia Hamilcar had to march towards the Pillars of Hercules and transport it across the strait According to a story Hannibal went to his father while he was making a sacrifice to the gods Hannibal was quite young He begged to go with his father Hamilcar said yes and made Hannibal promise that he would never be a friend of Rome Hannibal told his father 

In Hannibal became the leader of the army He spent two years consolidating his holdings and finishing the conquest of Iberia south of the river Ebro Rome feared the growing strength of Hannibal They made an alliance with the city of Saguntum and claimed to be protecting the city Saguntum was south of the river Ebro Hannibal attacked the city because of this It was captured after eight months Rome wanted justice from Carthage The Carthaginian government saw nothing wrong with Hannibals actions The war Hannibal wanted was declared at the end of the year 

Hannibals army was made up of as many as 75000 foot soldiers and 9000 horsemen Hannibal left New Carthage in late spring of 218 BC He fought his way north to the Pyrenees He defeated the tribes through clever mountain tactics and stubborn fighting After marching 290 miles and reaching the Ebro river Hannibal chose the most trustworthy and loyal parts of his army of Libyan and Iberian mercenaries to keep going with him He left 11000 troops to keep watch over the newly conquered region At the Pyrenees he let go of another 11000 Iberian troops Hannibal entered Gaul with 50000 foot soldiers and 9000 horsemen 

Hannibal needed to cross the Pyrenees the Alps and many important rivers In the spring of 218 BC he fought his way to the Pyrenees He made peace deals with the Gaulish leaders and reached the Rhne River Arriving at the Rhne in September Hannibals army numbered 38000 infantry 8000 horsemen and thirty seven war elephants

Hannibal got away from a Roman force sent to fight him in Gaul He then went up the valley of one of the streams of the Rhne River By autumn he reached the foot of the Alps His journey over the mountains is one of the most famous achievements of any military force After this journey Hannibal came down from the foothills into northern Italy He had arrived with only half the forces he had started with and only a few elephants Hannibal had lost as many as 20000 men crossing over the mountains 

Publius Cornelius Scipio commanded the Roman force sent to stop Hannibal He did not expect Hannibal to cross the Alps He expected to fight Hannibal in Spain With a small army still in Gaul Scipio tried to stop Hannibal He moved his army to Italy by sea in time to meet Hannibal Hannibal made the area behind him safer by defeating the tribe of the Taurini The opposing forces fought at carthage Here Hannibal forced the Romans to get out of the plain of Lombardy This victory did much to weaken Roman control over the Gauls The Gauls decided to join the Carthaginians Soon all of northern Italy was unofficially allied Gallic and Ligurian troops soon raised his army back to 40000 men Hannibals army was ready to invade Italy Scipio retreated across the River Trebia He camped at the town of Placentia and waited for more troops 

The senate had ordered Sempronius Longus to bring his army from Sicily to meet Scipio and face Hannibal Hannibal was in position to head him off Sempronius avoided Hannibal and joined Scipio near the Trebbia River near Placentia At Trebia Hannibal deafeated the Roman infantry by a surprise attack from an ambush in the flank

Arriving in Etruria in the spring of 217 BC Hannibal decided to lure the main Roman army led by Flaminius into battle Hannibal found Flaminius camped at Arretium Hannibal marched around his opponents left side and cut Flaminius off from Rome Hannibal made Flaminius chase him On the shore of Lake Trasimenus Hannibal destroyed Flaminiuss army in the waters or on the nearby slopes He killed Flaminius as well He had gotten rid of the only force that could stop him from getting to Rome He realized that without siege engines he could not hope to take the capital He decided to continue into central and southern Italy He hoped this show of strength would create a revolt against the Roman government After Lake Trasimene Hannibal said I have not come to fight Italians but on behalf of the Italians against Rome Rome was put into an immense state of panic They appointed a dictator named Quintus Fabius Maximus He was an intelligent and prudent general

Fabius adopted the Fabian strategy He refused open battle with his enemy while placing several Roman armies in Hannibals vicinity to limit his movement Fabius sent out small detachments against Hannibals foraging parties Residents of small northern villages were told to post lookouts They could gather their livestock and possessions and take refuge into fortified towns This would wear down the invaders endurance 

Hannibal decided to march through Samnium to Campania He hoped that the devastation would draw Fabius into battle Fabius refused to let himself be drawn into battle His troops became irritated by his cowardly spirit The epithet cunctator means delayer His policies were not liked Romans were used to facing their enemies in the field The people wanted to see a quick end to the war 

The rest of autumn continued with frequent skirmishes After six months Fabius would be removed from his position in accordance with the Roman law

In the Spring of 216 BC Hannibal captured the large supply depot at Cannae in the Apulian plain He had placed himself between the Romans and their source of supply The Roman Senate resumed their Consular elections in 216 They chose Caius Terentius Varro and Lucius Aemilius Paullus as Consuls The Romans raised a new army that was much larger than ever before The total strength of the army which faced Hannibal was between 90000 and 100000 men

The Roman army marched southward to Apulia After a two days march they found Hannibal at the Audifus River The Consuls had to switch their command on a daily basis The Consul Varro was a man of reckless and hubris nature He was determined to defeat Hannibal Hannibal drew him into a trap The Roman army had no way to escape Due to brilliant tactics Hannibal surrounded and destroyed all but a small remainder of this force It is estimated that 50000 70000 Romans were killed or captured at Cannae Among the dead were eighty senators The Roman Senate was comprised of no more than 300 men  this was 2530 of the governing body This makes the Battle of Cannae one of the worst defeats in the history of Ancient Rome It is also one of the bloodiest battles in all of human history in terms of the number of lives lost within a single day After Cannae the Romans refused to fight Hannibal in battles They tried instead to defeat him by attrition They relied on their advantages of supply and manpower 

Because of this victory most of southern Italy joined Hannibals cause During that same year the Greek cities in Sicily revolted against Roman control The Macedonian king Philip V supported Hannibal This started the First Macedonian War against Rome Hannibal made his new base in Capua the second largest city of Italy

Without the resources from his allies or reinforcements from Carthage Hannibal could not do much more Hannibal began losing ground He continued defeating the Romans whenever he could bring them into battle but was never able to complete another decisive victory

In 212 BC conspirators in Tarentum let Hannibal into the city They then blew the alarm with some Roman trumpets This let Hannibals troops pick off the Romans as they stumbled into the streets Hannibal told the Tarentines to mark every house where Tarentines lived The houses not marked were looted The citadel held out This stopped Hannibal from using the harbor and Rome was slowly gaining ground over Hannibal In the same year he lost Campania

In 211 BC the city of Capua fell In summer of that year the Romans destroyed the Carthaginian army in Sicily Meanwhile Hannibal had defeated Fulvius at Herdonea in Apulia but lost Tarentum With the loss of Tarentum in 209 BC and the Romans capturing of Samnium and Lucania his hold on south Italy was almost lost 

In 207 BC he retired into Bruttium These events marked the end to Hannibals success in Italy In 203 BC Hannibal was recalled to Carthage to lead the defence of his homeland against a Roman invasion

Both Scipio and Hannibal met on the field of Zama Hannibal had about 50000 infantry and 4000 cavalry Scipio had 34000 infantry and 8700 cavalry For years Hannibal had won victories with his experienced army He now faced the best of the Roman army while he led a makeshift army They did not do well against the Romans Hannibal was defeated 20000 men of Hannibals army were killed at Zama The same number of men were taken as prisoners The Romans lost as few as 500 dead and 4000 wounded With their best general defeated the Carthaginians accepted defeat and surrendered to Rome

Seven years after the victory of Zama the Romans demanded Hannibals surrender Hannibal went into voluntary exile He journeyed to Tyre the mother city of Carthage and then to Ephesus and Syria

In 190 BC he was placed in command of a Phoenician fleet but was defeated in a battle off the Eurymedon River Hannibal went to Crete but he soon returned to the Asia Minor At Libya on the eastern shore of the Sea of Marmora he was going to be turned over to the Romans Rather than letting himself be taken he drank poison The precise year of his death is not certain It is believed to be 183 BC He died in the same year as Scipio Africanus

Pinocchio is the second animated Disney movie made by Walt Disney and first released to movie theaters by RKO Radio Pictures on February 7 1940 Based on the story Pinocchio Tale of a Puppet by Carlo Collodi it was made in response to the huge success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs

The movie tells the story of Pinocchio a wooden puppet made by a man named Geppetto and brought to life by the Blue fairy after Geppetto wishes he could have a son She tells him he can become a real boy if he proves himself brave truthful and unselfish Pinocchio must try to be good so he can become a real boy with the help of his friend Jiminy Cricket Thus begins the adventures of the puppet into a real boy which involve many encounters with a series of unpleasant characters 

The movie was adapted by Aurelius Battaglia William Cottrell Otto Englander Erdman Penner Joseph Sabo Ted Sears and Webb Smith from Collodis book The production was supervised by Ben Sharpsteen and Hamilton Luske and the films sequences were directed by Norman Ferguson T Hee Wilfred Jackson Jack Kinney and Bill Roberts

It features the song When You Wish Upon A Star which has been used at the start of most Disney movies since 1985

A man called Gepetto makes a wood puppet called Pinocchio He wishes that Pinocchio was a real boy and the Blue Fairy makes Gepettos wish come true But to become a real boy instead of a live puppet Pinocchio has to prove that hes good The Blue Fairy assigns a cricket named Jiminy Cricket to guide him and keep him out of trouble This is a hard job and Pinocchio does a lot of things wrong

On his first day of school two crooks a fox named Honest John and his mute sidekick named Gideon trick Pinocchio to join Strombolis puppet show instead Pinocchio is popular in the show but Stromboli is cruel to him and locks him in a bird cage The Blue Fairy asks Pinocchio how this happened but Pinocchio lies and his nose grows longer With the help of the Blue Fairy and Jiminy Pinocchio escapes from the cage

The crooks trick Pinocchio again and tell him to go to Pleasure Island He meets Lampwick a bad boy who convinces him to gamble smoke drink vandalize and other bad things The island is magical and the boys who act like jackasses turn into donkeys These donkeys are sold to work in the local salt mines

Lampwick becomes a donkey but Pinocchio only changes part way with donkey ears and a donkey tail He escapes from Pleasure Island and returns to Geppettos house But Geppetto is not there He has gone to sea to search for Pinocchio 

Pinocchio and Jiminy go looking for Geppetto but they are eaten by the huge whale Monstro Monstro has also swallowed Geppetto Pinocchio builds a fire to make Monstro sneeze and this frees them all But they are lost in the ocean and Geppetto is drowning He tells Pinocchio to swim to shore and save himself but Pinocchio grabs Geppetto and carries him to shore Geppetto survives but Pinocchio appears to be dead 

Geppetto and Jiminy are sad and return home with Pinocchios body The Blue Fairy decides that Pinocchio has proved that he is good enough and brings him back to life and also turns him into a real boy Everyone is happy and they celebrate The movie ends with Jiminy Cricket getting a badge of soild gold and a chorus sings a reprise of the song When You Wish Upon A Star

The original plan for the movie was very different from what they made Many characters and events from the original book were used in early versions Producer Walt Disney was unhappy with this version and had them change a lot of the story and characters

At first Pinocchio was going to look like a real wooden puppet with a long pointed nose a pointed hat and bare wood hands He was going to act more grown up and do bad things on purpose instead of being tricked into doing bad things But Walt Disney did not think that people would like this character so they changed his appearance and the way he acted They made him look more like a real boy with a small nose a childs hat and regular hands with gloves The only parts of him that still looked like a puppet were his arms and legs

Jiminy Cricket became a more important character He was not included in the first version of the story When they added him he looked more like a real cricket but Walt wanted more people to like him so Ward Kimball changed him into a little man with no ears That was the only thing about him that was like an insect

With the re release of Snow White and then Seven Dwarfs in 1944 came the tradition of re releasing Disney films every seven to ten years Pinocchio has been theatrically re released in 1945 1954 1962 1971 1978 1984 and 1992 The 1992 re issue was digitally restored by cleaning and removing scratches from the original one scene at a time getrting rid of blurry sound and making the color lighter The movie also received four video releases being a big seller in 1985 Then the more complex digital restoration that was done for the 1992 re issue was released on VHS followed by the final VHS release in 1999 The second Disney DVD release premiered the following year in 2000 The third DVD release and first Blu ray Disc release were released on March 10 2009 and like the 2008 Sleeping Beauty release the Blu ray package featured two discs and a bonus DVD of the film also included

Pinocchio was not successful at the box office when first released and Disney only earned 19 million against a 26 million budget The movie made some success at the American box office but was not able to profit due to its poor performance in Europe The timing of the moves release was a reason with World War II cutting off European markets Although the United States had not yet gotten into the war peoples interests may have not have meant much among Americans in seeing fantasy stories as they were in the days of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs It also lacked the romance element that had proven popular in Snow White

Nevertheless there were positive reactions to the movie as well Archer Winsten who had criticized Snow White said that The faults that were in Snow White no longer exist In writing of Pinocchio you are limited only by your own power of expressing enthusiasm Also despite the poor timing of the release the movie did do well both critically and at the box office in the United States Jiminy Crickets song When You Wish Upon a Star became a major success and still is today and is the fanfare for The Walt Disney Company Pinocchio also won the Academy Award for Best Song and the Academy Award for Best Scoring of a Musical Picture In 1994 Pinocchio was added to the United States National Film Registry as being very important in culture history or aesthetic In 2001 Terry Gilliam picked it as one of the ten best animated movies of all time and in 2005 Timecom named it one of the 100 best movies of the last 80 years Many film historians consider this to be the movie that is the closest to technical perfection of all the Disney animated features Pinocchio earned 84254167 at the box office

In June 2008 the American Film Institute revealed its Ten top Tenthe best ten films in ten classic American film genres After polling over 1500 people from the creative community Pinocchio was acknowledged as the second best film in the animation genre after Snow White

The songs in Pinocchio were composed by Leigh Harline Ned Washington and Frank Churchill Paul J Smith composed the incidental music score

The word RADAR was created in 1942 as an acronym for Radio Detection and Ranging This acronym replaced the British acronym RDF The word is now thought by many people as a regular word no longer as an acronym 

According to the FAA there are kinds of radar like below

GameSpot is a website that was created in June of 1996 by Pete Deemer Vince Broady and Jon Epstein

In the beginning the website was mainly about PC games Another similar site videogamespotcom was created in December of the same year to talk about console video game systems In 1997 videogamespotcom became videogamescom for a short time Afterward in 1998 videogamescom and gamespotcom joined together to become a single site

GameSpot makes video game and PC reviews previews downloads news and information It is known as one of the biggest game websites on the Internet ZDNet bought Gamespot later on However ZDNet was later bought by CNET Networks so now GameSpot belongs to CNET

On October 3 2005 GameSpot changed how the website looked making it similar to what TVcom looks like 

TVcom is a popular website owned by the CNET Games Entertainment family of websites which also includes GameSpot GameFAQs and MP3com The website replaced the popular TV Tome website

The website has information about television Other than episode guides TVcom also has news reviews photos trailers and TV listings

People can also get accounts on TVcom like other CNET websites Users get a user page and can keep track of television shows They can also add things like episode details and cast members

Olive is a kind of muddy green color In actuality it is really a shade of dark yellow Some dark shades of olive can also be made by mixing a darker color with green 

The color of old US Army field uniforms is a shade of olive called olive drab that was used because it was hard to see against trees and grass

The most common place you will find the color olive is on an olive It is the color of the outside olive An olives center is usually brown or sometimes orange or red 

There is a mineral called olivine that is colored a pale olive color

The natural resource most used by the people is the rich land Most of the people living there are farmers They make lots of cashews millets peanuts sesame seeds and tea Lots of natural gas are there but these resources are usually underdeveloped Many people there raise cattle and sheep The cattle are raised for their milk or to carry things in Hindu areas

The broken wikt linkclimateclimate of South Asia can be divided into three basic kinds tropical dry and temperate The northeast is from tropical to subtropical Moving west the moisture and elevation change causing a steppe and a desert climate that is like the Middle East There is also a part of steppe climate in the center of the lower peninsula Two parts of the South Aisna climate especially affect the people One is the monsoons These changing winds bring lots of the areas rain so when they do not come early the land becomes very dry Hurricanes also happen every year and sometimes destroy many things In the extreme north of India and Pakistan the climate is affected by the mountains

Thermodynamics is a branch of physics that studies the movement of heat between different objects Thermodynamics also studies the change in pressure and volume of objects It is normally studied by using a branch of mathematics called statistics to look at the motion of particles Thermodynamics also has two main branches called classical thermodynamics and statistical thermodynamics An important idea in thermodynamics is that of systems A system is an object or a group of objects

In thermodynamics there are four laws of thermodynamics that say that energy can be moved between two objects in the form of heat 

In the past thermodynamics was studied to make steam engines work better Now ideas from thermodynamics are used in everything from making engines to studying black holes

Bollywood is a word which refers to the Hindi Language movie industry in India

It is often used to describe Indian Cinema as a whole but that is not correct Bollywood only refers to Hindi language films The term Bollywood combines Bombay and Hollywood

Roman Catholicism do it to infants to mark their becoming members of the church It is a sacrament usually performed by a priest In most other churches it is when the person is old enough to decide that they are ready

Some churches sprinkle water on the person Other churches use immersion or dunking in the water

In the Old Testament a similar washing ceremony was done when priests were ordained Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist before he began his ministry The usual form of baptism among the earliest Christians was for the person to be immersed totally or partially But sprinkling or pouring was also practiced at an early day with sick and dying persons when total or partial immersion was not practical

Chen Dynasty was the fourth and the last of the Southern dynasties in China It was defeated by the Sui Dynasty This dynasty was strong as one of the remaining ethnic han dynasties science flourished it was very rich though few records survive from this time the chen dynastys rulers had a tax system and ruling system similar to that of the kang qian era with only ethnic han they were incredibly wealthy with more wealth than according to legend 10 europes at the time silver intake was enormous and the demand for chinese silk spices porcelain artwork and various other goods were insatiable what few remaining records say that as much as 30 million taels of silver were in the reserves in the end the chen dynasty gave rise to the sui after abdication by the last chen emperor

Fighter aircraft are small airplanes that are made to fight other airplanes They are often fast having aerodynamic shapes and very powerful engines for their size They also usually are maneuverable Fighters can carry many different kinds of weapons including missiles machine guns and bombs While fighters may be used to attack vehicles soldiers or buildings on the ground they are different from bombers because they are usually designed to attack other airplanes

Aircraft carriers are warships that carry airplanes and other aircraft like helicopters They are used by navies to allow aircraft to fight along with naval warships Aircraft carriers are usually very large carrying hundreds or thousands of sailors and tens or hundreds of aircraft

The top of an aircraft carrier is called the flight deck and looks like a very small airport Old aircraft carriers carried airplanes that could takeoff and land in the short distance of the flight deck without help Similarly small modern aircraft carriers only carry helicopters or specially designed airplanes that can take off and land straight up and down or in the short distance of the flight deck The flight deck of a large modern aircraft carrier has a landing area and a take off area The landing area is in the back and has a short runway Airplanes stop by using a hook on the back of the airplane to grab wires stretched across the runway In the front the flight deck has a steam powered catapult that connects to the front wheel of an airplane The catapult throws the airplane off the deck helping it take off quickly

Because they are so big modern aircraft carriers often have on board nuclear power plants Other aircraft carriers are powered by diesel engines

Except for their airplanes aircraft carriers usually have few weapons so other warships escort them Together the aircraft carrier and these warships form a carrier group

Edward Kasner is an American mathematician He is famous for creating the word googol and the word googolplex

Kasner went to Columbia University and received his PhD in 1899

Around 1920 Kasner decided to make a good catchy name for a very big number While he was walking with his nephews Milton and Edwin Sirotta in New Jerseys Palisades Kasner asked them to think of good names Milton was the one who said googol 

In 1940 with James Roy Newman Kasner made a book about math called Mathematics and the Imagination ISBN 0486417034 It was in this book that the name googol was first used 

In modern times the website Google was based on Kasners number googol

The Jubilee line is a line on the London Underground It runs from Stanmore in north London to Stratford in east London The colour of the Jubilee line on tube maps is grey

The line opened on 1 May 1979 taking over one of the Bakerloo Lines two branches to relieve the main part of the line To the Baker Street to Stanmore part a new four kilometre part into central London was added terminating at a new station at Charing Cross railway station

The old Charing Cross station on the Circle District Bakerloo and Northern lines was renamed Embankment The new Charing Cross tube station created a new interchange from the stations of Strand on the Northern Line and Trafalgar Square on the Bakerloo

The Jubilee Line of 1979 was to be the first part of the project but because of the lack of money the line stayed the same until the late 1990s Phase 2 would have extended the line along Fleet Street to stations at Aldwych Ludgate Circus Cannon Street Fenchurch Street St Katherines Dock Wapping and then under the River Thames to New Cross terminating at Lewisham An alternative plan was created in the late 1970s to extend the Jubilee Line in parallel with the River Thames this would taken the Line from Wapping to Thamesmead Via Surrey Docks North Canary Wharf North Greenwich Custom House Silvertown Woolwich Arsenal and to Thamesmead However the river line extension as it was called was too expensive and construction of the extension never started

Changes in land use particularly the new areas in the Docklands area caused the project to change considerably in the 1990s The Jubilee Line Extension opened in three stages in 1999 split from the existing line at Green Park creating a one station branch to Charing Cross which is now closed With the extension the Jubilee Line is the only line on the London Underground network that crosses all other lines

When the Jubilee Line was opened it was run with 1972 trains In 1984 the 1972 trains were replaced by the new 1983 trains The old 1972 Stock were used on the Northern Line The 1983 trains proved to be unreliable in service with their single doors making passenger loading and unloading slower than on other trains with wider doors With the opening of the Jubilee Line Extension the opportunity was taken to introduce new trains and today the line is worked by 1996 trains

  

A medical emergency is an injury or illness that poses an immediate threat to a persons long term health or life It needs to be treated immediately Doctors that are trained in emergency medicine are taught how to react to medical emergencies and how to resuscitate patients

When there is a medical emergency emergency medical services should be notified as soon as possible by calling for help using a local emergency telephone number such as 911 in the United States or Canada 112 in most of continental Europe and on GSM cell phones 999 in the UK and most of its former colonies 118 in Italy 119 in South Korea and Japan 000 in Australia 101 in Israel and 111 in New Zealand The people that answer emergency calls emergency medical dispatchers generally ask for the callers name where they are and some information on the person that is being called about eg whether or not they are conscious how badly injured they are their name if it is known and if they have any other illnesses

People that know first aid are expected to help as much as they can Moving the victim to a safe place can sometimes do more harm than good and should be left to people that know how to properly move injured people unless there is no alternative Many states have laws that protect those helping

If the victim is not breathing or if a heartbeat cannot be felt artificial respiration and cardiopulmonary resuscitation could be needed to keep a persons blood circulating long enough for medics to attempt revival Emergency medical technicians Outdoor Emergency Care technicians or paramedics can use airway management techniques to help a person who is not breathing

While in a hospital environment staff members that are on duty are trained to deal with emergency situations Emergency medical physicians are trained to deal with many medical emergencies and have up to date cardiopulmonary resuscitation and advanced cardiac life support certificates In major incidents most hospitals have protocols to have staff that are not at work at the hospital to go on duty as fast as they can

Emergency departments follow basic advanced cardiac life support protocols which include keeping a patients blood pressure and blood saturation at acceptable levels Possible exceptions include the clamping of arteries in severe haemorrhage

Most emergencies are quite unspectacular They will happen close to home and not to complete strangers

Of all emergencies

Sprints are short running races in athletics They are events in which runners will not have to pace themselves but can run as fast as possible for the entire distance These are often some of the more popular events in the Olympic Games The most common distances are 60 meters 100 meters 200 meters and 400 meters

Boxer is a dog breed 

Boxers are good watch dogs They are very strong and like to run in open spaces They come in various colors like fawn brindle fawn brindle mix white white fawn mix and brindle white mix Males are 23 27 inches at the withers and the females are 21 12 25 12 inches at the withers Boxers are one of the most popular breeds of dogs in the US and over breeding is a concern

Boxers are quite loyal dogs and unlike certain breeds are not one person dogs They will become extremely loyal to a person family or group of persons and family friends They make friends by nature and are incredibly curious dogs who love to explore They are especially well suited to be with children and elderly persons though they can knock people down playing These dogs may be feared because of their fearsome stance that can look intimidating They rarely bark needlessly

They have a high energy level and require lots of exercise They love to play and have fun Owners note that they act puppy like their entire lifetime Their temperament is jovial and mean boxers are an extreme rarity Boxers love to chase run play tag and get any form of attention whenever possible Boxers are easy to train to do tricks especially for rewards including attention love and recognition They are extremely clever dogs with a good memory they love to ride in vehicles and are excellent road trip dogs 

These dogs can range from medium size to quite large They are prone to some neurotic behaviors and can become extremely anxious if left alone and void of human companionship If they are left alone crate training is important Dogs who are crate trained do not mind the practice and often feel secure in a den like setting while an open house may make the dog agoraphobic causing them to destroy things Boxers are easily trained and are bright dogs who want to please While not aggressive they will demonstrate some protective behaviors over their owners and families especially children Boxers do well with other dogs and pets such as cats if they are properly acquainted and socialized Because boxers are very bright dogs they may challenge owners mentally by being defiant or by being openly obstinate This type of behavior requires love patience and repetitive conditioning 

Many veterinarians now refuse to crop the boxers ears and many owners prefer the naturally floppy ears to avoid painful and possibly cruel cosmetic surgery Many owners like the cute appearance Most boxers have their tail cropped at birth White boxers which were drowned at birth for much of the breeds span are now sold or allowed to be distributed as pets though most are neutered or spayed to prevent breeding 

Medical issues common to boxers can include hereditary conditions such as hip displasia certain forms of heart defects and certain forms of cancer A reputable breeder vs a puppy mill boxer is recommended All dogs should get all necessary and regular vaccinations have regular veterinarian checkups and teeth cleanings along with a good diet and plenty of exercise The average lifespan of a healthy boxer is 911 years Many people get a boxer and then may give it to a rescue or pound because they are not ready or willing to devote the time that boxers require for training and attention A boxer will not be ignored and will go to great lengths to draw attention to itself good or even bad Jumping on people is a common complaint so positive reinforcement training is a must They are affable lovable clown like yet dedicated dogs who adore their owner

For the proper home with space room effort and love a boxer is an ideal pet and irreplaceable friend family member and companion

The boxer was bred in Germany and was originally bred for bull bating and dog fights but when that was ruled out they were used as hunting dogs and farm dogs and just regular house pets The Boxer breed was created from the brabanter and bullenbaiser Though originally bred to be fighting and later used as a military sentry or police dog boxer owners will confirm that this type of role is no longer suitable for boxers as many decades of breeding had produced a dog that is too docile for this type of duty

American Graffiti is a 1973 movie directed by George Lucas This was Lucas second movie and made him very well known The events in the movie take place in 1962 in Modesto California It is about what happens to a group of teenagers one night while they are driving around town and listening to radio DJ Wolfman Jack

Lake Vostok is the biggest of the seventy lakes in Antarctica that are under the ice It is at 77 S 105 E and it is under Russias Vostok Station It is also 4000 meters under Antarcticas surface 

The lake was found by Russian and British scientists They used an object called a radar to find it 

The lake consists of fresh water The temperature of the water is about 3C The freezing point of water is at 0 C but the water in the lake remains liquid because of the high pressure of the ice 

There are two separate basins in the lake These are separated by a ridge It has been suggested that the ecosystems of the two basins are different 

Lake Vostok is an oligotrophic extreme environment It is supersaturated with oxygen The levels of oxygen are fifty times higher than those typically found in ordinary freshwater lakes on Earth The weight of the ice on top of lake Vostok is believed to add to the high concentration of oxygen Oxygen from the ice gets dissolved into the water of the lake Deposits of oxygen and other gases are trapped in the lake as well The structure that traps them is called a clathrate Gases trapped in clathrates are enclosed in ice they look like packed snow These structures form at the high pressure depths of Lake Vostok they would become unstable if brought to the surface

No other natural environment on earth is as rich in oxygen For this reason if there are any forms of life in the lake these would probably need to have adapted to the high levels of oxygen to be able to survive there Some adaptations might include high concentrations of protective enzymes

The environment in the lake is very similar to that on Jupiters moon Europa or Saturns moon Enceladus Finding life in the lake would therefore make it more probable that life has existed on one of these moons

Infrared radiation is a type of electromagnetic radiation The wave is longer than light which humans can see and shorter than microwaves The word infrared means below red It comes from the Latin word infra and the English word red Red light has the longest wavelength that human eyes can see Infrared waves cannot be seen by the eye The infrared wave is between 750 nm and 1 mm People sense infrared as heat Most remote controls use infrared to send the control signals

Before Bluetooth was invented some computers personal digital assistants and mobile phones were using the infrared technology to send files to other devices Bluetooth replaced infrared in the early 2000s Infrared is limited by the need to have both devices in a line of sight with each other

Infrared lasers are used to provide the light for optical fiber communications systems Infrared light with a wavelength around 1330 nm or 1550 nm are the best choices for standard silica fibers

Infrared vibrational spectroscopy can be used to identify molecules by listing their chemical bonds An IR spectrometer is a machine that shines infrared light from a set range of frequencies on a sample It measures which exact light frequencies are absorbed by the sample 

Each chemical bond in a molecule vibrates at a frequency which is characteristic of that bond A group of atoms in a molecule may have multiple modes of oscillation caused by the stretching and bending motions of the group as a whole If an oscillation leads to a change in dipole in the molecule then it will absorb a photon which has the same frequency The vibrational frequencies of most molecules correspond to the frequencies of infrared light Typically the technique is used to study organic compounds using light radiation from 4000400 cm1 the mid infrared The spectrometer records all the frequencies of absorption in a sample This can be used to gain information about the sample composition in terms of chemical groups present and also its purity

Charles V was Holy Roman Emperor King of Spain Naples and Sicily and king of the Burgundian territories He was called Carlos I in Spain though he is also commonly called Carlos V His nickname was El Dorado or the golden one because of his good and impressive rule 

Philip the Handsome and Joanna the Mad of Castile were his parents His grandparents on his mothers side were Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile Their marriage made Spain into one kingdom His grandparents on his fathers side were Emperor Maximilian I and Marie Duchess of Burgundy

His Majesty or His Imperial Majesty was first used when he was king His Empire became large and was known as in which the sun does not set He was also known as The Emperor of Universal Dominion

The Renaissance is a period in the history of Europe beginning in about 1400 and following the Medieval period also known as the Middle Ages 

Renaissance is a French word meaning rebirth The reason that the period is called by this name is that at that time people started taking an interest in the learning of ancient times in particular the learning of Ancient Greece and Rome The Renaissance was seen as a rebirth of that learning The Renaissance is often said to be the start of the modern age 

During the Renaissance there were many famous artists many writers and many philosophers Many people studied mathematics and different sciences A person who is clever at a great number of things is sometimes called a Renaissance man Leonardo da Vinci who was a painter a scientist a musician and a philosopher is the most famous Renaissance Man

The Renaissance started in Italy but soon spread across the whole of Europe In Italy the time is divided into three periods 

Following the Mannerist period was the Baroque period which also spread across Europe from about 1600 Outside Italy it can be hard to tell where the Renaissance period ends and Baroque begins 

In the Middle Ages there were very few books The books that existed nearly all belonged to churches or universities or to very rich people They were written by hand and often had beautiful hand painted pictures They were so expensive that most people could not own them 

Even if an ordinary person went to the church and looked at a book there they could not read them because they were written in Latin the language of the Ancient Romans that was used in the Catholic Church and only understood by priests and well educated people People were forbidden by law from copying the Bible into Italian English German French or other local languages 

In 1423 the first printed books were made in Europe The way of printing quickly improved so that large books like the Bible could be made and sold cheaplyIt took 300 calf skins or 100 pig skins to print the BibleThe printers then began to print everything that they thought was interesting Ancient Greek and Roman writings poetry plays lives of the saints mathematics textbooks medical textbooks Christian stories naughty stories books about animals and monsters advice to princes as to how to rule their people and maps of the world 

Suddenly all this wonderful knowledge was available to thousands of people who never had it before Before 1423 all this knowledge belonged to priests monasteries and universities Suddenly it belonged to everyone

The time of Ancient Greece and Rome when there were many philosophers writers painters sculptors architects and mathematicians was seen by people as a Golden Age a time when things were beautiful well organised and well run This time had lasted from about 400 BC to about 400 AD

In the year 1400 in the city of Rome people could wander around looking up at the ruins of a city that had once been great Inside the broken walls that had been smashed in 410 AD were the remains of huge temples sports arenas public baths apartment blocks and palaces Nearly all of them were ruined and could not be used Nearly all of them were half buried in dirt A lot of them were pulled down to use as building stone But they showed people what great things could be done Among the ruins of this once great city the people of Rome lived in cottages They still went to church in the huge churches built by the first Christian Emperor Constantine the Great in the 4th century They still held market day in the Ancient Roman market place of Campo dei Fiori

One day in 1402 into the middle of Rome came a young man called Filippo Brunelleschi and a teenage boy called Donatello They were fascinated by everything that they saw They measured ancient ruined buildings they drew things and they dug around for weeks looking for bits of broken statues and painted pottery that they could stick together They were probably the worlds first archaeologists By the time they went back home to Florence they knew more about Ancient Roman architecture and sculpture than anyone had known for about a thousand years Brunelleschi became a very famous architect and Donatello became a very famous sculptor They both used the ideas that they had when they were studying the remains of ancient Rome

The city of Florence is really where the Renaissance began In those days Italy was not one single country It was lots of little states all governed in different ways and all fighting or making allies with each other all the time 

Rome was politically powerful because Rome had the Pope the person in control of the Roman Catholic Church Because of his very great importance as a spiritual leader most people and most cities did not want to argue with the Pope whichever Pope he might be Because a new pope was elected when the old one died everyone who was rich and powerful was always hoping it might be a member of their family It was always a good idea to have several young men in the family trained as priests just in case It was also a good idea to be good friends with other rich families One way to do this was to have lots of daughters and get them to marry rich powerful men from different cities This was the way that politics worked 

Other cities that were powerful were Venice with its great big navy Milan which controlled trade with Northern Europe and was very rich Genoa which controlled trade with France and Spain and was very rich and Florence 

The power of Florence was not founded on a strong army on a strong fortress or a good position to control trade It was founded on banking The cleverness in business of one single family was very important in making Florence powerful and the centre of Renaissance learning The family were called the Medici 

Giovanni Bicci de Medici was the first important member of the family He invested his money very wisely and became rich He and his son Cosimo de Medici began the Medici Banking Company which did so well that they soon had branches of the bank in large cities all over Europe including London and Paris Giovanni Bicci and Cosimo were the richest men in Europe 

Their wealth encouraged other families from Florence Florence already had an industry the cloth industry Florentine merchants traded with Lombard traders from the north of Italy They bought English wool and Chinese silk to be woven into the most magnificent cloth in Europe at the riverside factories of Florence Florence was perfectly sited for making cloth A lot of water is needed to make cloth Other towns nearby are high on the tops of hills but Florence is in a wide valley with the broad Arno River flowing through it There was a harbor on the coast near Pisa The Pisans were not very friendly towards Florence so Florence took them over Then the rich traders of Florence could have their own ships and did not have to worry about the Lombard traders who brought their goods across Europe and over the mountains on the backs of donkeys 

Cosimo de Medici was a patriot and a patron He was a patriot because he acted like a father to his city He became part of the town council They were a group of men called the signorina Cosimo made laws that adjusted the taxes Some of the rich people did not like this at all and left the city making Cosimo more powerful He took good care of industry of trade and of farming because Florence needed all these things He particularly needed the loyalty of all the farms and villages because a city in a valley is easy for an army to attack Cosimo built public buildings and when he had a palace built for himself he had long stone seats built along the walls for the poor and the elderly to sit on

Charles I of England was the King of England and Scotland of the House of Stuart crowned 27 March 1625 He was a son of James I of England He was married to Henrietta Maria of France

Charles was born at Fife in Scotland before his father came to the throne of England He had an elder brother Henry who was clever handsome and popular and who was next in line for the throne Henry died suddenly in 1612 and his brother Charles was made Prince of Wales in his place showing that he was now the heir to the throne Charles was less suited to be king than Henry had been because he was small and weak and not as clever After his brother died the person he was closest to was George Villiers Duke of Buckingham who was also his fathers best friend The Duke of Buckingham was very powerful and rich but was not popular with common people He took Charles to Spain in the hope of finding him a Spanish princess as a bride but they had a lot of problems on the journey and could not persuade the Spanish king to give them his daughter as a wife for Charles On the way home they went to France and there Charles met the French royal family The youngest of the French princesses was called Henrietta Maria of France and Charles later chose her to be his wife

When Charles became king he needed money for a war with Spain but Parliament wouldnt give it to him Therefore he dissolved parliament and did not call it again for eleven years from 1629 to 1640 This made him very unpopular with the people who did not like the different taxes they had to pay directly to the king since Parliament could not vote to give him any budget Many also did not like the Kings closest advisor William Laud Archbishop of Canterbury who was trying to force everyone in England to use the same Anglican Prayer Book and stop the many other Protestant denominations that were becoming popular at that time

When the king and the Archbishop then tried to force a Prayer Book on Scotland which was even more Protestant armed rebellion broke out there Now that the king was at war he needed more money than ever so he had no choice but to call Parliament again in 1640 The members of Parliament angry at the things that had been going on for 11 years did not want to give him money to fight his war instead they spent the session complaining about what had been gong on in the country for the last 11 years So after only three weeks Charles dissolved Parliament again For this reason it was known as the Short Parliament

Without enough money Charles lost the war badly and had to pay the Scots even more money that he did not have This meant that once again he had to call a Parliament much as he hated to do so One of the first things they did was vote that the King had to call Parliament and could not shut them down again Charles had no choice but to agree This Parliament is known as the Long Parliament because it ended up lasting for twenty years until 1660

The Parliament and the King then began to quarrel about who was in control of the army Each side ended up with their own army and this led to the English Civil War that started in 1642 The army of Parliament got the upper hand in this war and Charles after a crushing defeat in 1646 went to the Scots for protection But they decided to turn him over to Parliament in 1647 Charles escaped at one point and went to the governor of the Isle of Wight for protection but this was also a bad move because he too was on the side of Parliament and only captured the king again While he was being held in the castle Charles made an agreement with the Scots who joined his side and the fighting started again in 1648 Because he was still making trouble for them even while he was captured Parliament voted to put the king on trial This had never been done to a king of England before

At the trial he was found guilty and was finally put to death by beheading in January 1649 Some of the members of Parliament who were opposed to killing king Charles were purged and from this time on what was left of the Long Parliament became known as the Rump Parliament This Parliament took complete power in England and there was no new king at all until 1660

Maria Antonia Josepha Johanna widely known as Marie Antoinette was an Archduchess of Austria and the queen of France and Navarre She became the queen consort of Louis XVI of France in 1770 Her marriage was at first an unhappy one and it was not properly consummated for several years This made her very unpopular She was not actively interested in politics Her lack of power habits of spending money and the bad idea the French people had of her helped begin the popular French Revolution in which she was executed

On the morning of 2 November 1755 Maria Teresa Queen of Hungary and Empress of the Holy Roman Empire gave birth to Marie Antoinette her fifteenth child and last daughter The Empress quickly became well again after giving birth and was reported to have looked happy and healthy Marie Antoinette was taken care of by Constance Weber a wet nurse When Marie Antoinette was a child she often gave gifts to Constance Weber and her son Joseph According to Joseph Marie Antoinette once said to Constance Good Weber have a care for your son

Joseph Weber added that the Archdukes and Archduchesses were allowed to make friends with ordinary children Except on formal celebrations people who did not have a very high birth or title were still liked and allowed into the court Marie Antoinette was known as Antoine when she was young The Austrian court young Madame Antoine grew up in was already beginning to become much less formal Antoine was taught by Countess Brandeis who loved Marie Antoinette and treated her very kindly Antoines first recorded letter written when she was 11 or 12 was to dearest Brandeis from your faithful pupil who loves you dearly Antoine However though the countess taught Antoine about morality and religion she did not educate her on many other subjects and Antoine did not like to concentrate Later one of her friends said that when she talked her words were not connected like a grasshopper In fact when Antoine was 12 she could not write or even speak French and German properly though she spoke Italian well She greatly loved music though In 1759 shortly before she became four years old Antoine sang a French song at a party for her father while her brothers and sisters sang Italian songs She listened to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart playing marvellously once too She was also famous for her beautiful dancing and the graceful way she carried her head She had been officially taught by the famous French ballet master Jean Georges Noverre Sadly she was much less skilled at reading

Still she loved her childhood home in Vienna and later missed it very much She once said about her mother I love the Empress but Im frightened of her even at a distance when Im writing to her I never feel completely at ease She disliked her sister the Archduchess Marie Mimi Christine who her mother seemed to love most But her relationship with her sister Maria Charlotte Carolina was quite different they loved each other warmly They were very close and a painter later said that they resembled each other greatly Charlotte was more forceful and Antoine was usually thought to be prettier

At the beginning of 1767 the Empress had five daughters with her Marie Christine was already married to Prince Albert of Saxony Elizabeth who was very pretty was 23 Amalia almost 21 Josepha was 16 Charlotte was 14 and Antoine was now 12 The Empress wanted Josepha who was gentle and pretty to marry Charles III of Spain But then bad things started to happen Her son Josephs second wife died because of smallpox and was buried After that Maria Teresa caught the smallpox and almost died

Then Maria Teresa took her daughter Josepha who was about to begin her bridal journey to Naples to go to the tomb of Josephs wife to pray But the tomb had not been closed tightly enough Probably because of this Josepha suddenly caught smallpox and died Elizabeth also caught the disease She lived but her beauty was gone Antonia who had caught smallpox when she was two years old and become healthy again did not catch the disease

But a bride was still needed for King Ferdinand of Naples Maria Teresa quickly wrote a letter explaining what had happened to Charles III of Spain a month after Josepha died I grant you one of my daughters to make good the loss she wrote I do currently have two who could fit one is the Archduchess Amalia who is said to have a pretty face and whose health should promise the other is the Archduchess Charlotte who is also very healthy and a year and seven months younger than the King of Naples Soon the King of Naples married Charlotte and Amalia was married to Louis XVs grandson Don Ferdinand of Parma Amalia was not happy with her mothers decision

The only daughter left was now Marie Antoinette Empress Maria Theresa decided to use Antonia to make Austria become friendly with France After long discussions Antonia was engaged to Louis Auguste Dauphin of France The duc de Choiseul from France and the Prince of Starhemberg from Austria helped arrange the wedding

They immediately began preparing Marie Antoinette for her marriage Her teeth were crooked but a French dentist came to fix it After a painful three months Marie Antoinette had a smile that was very beautiful and straight Her thick mountain of curls were dressed by Larsenneur a famous hairdresser who powdered and softened her hair Marie Antoinette also had a high forehead which was thought unfashionable at that time though she had a long graceful neck

Her education was also changed In November 1768 the Abbe Jacques Mathieu de Vermond went to Vienna to teach Antonia She was clever but without the knowledge a future queen should have She was also lazy and unable to concentrate She could not read or write properly in French or German but a year after Vermond had arrived she could speak it well enough By the time she left Austria she was speaking French easily and well even if it had a small German accent The Abbe also found that Marie Antoinette did not know much about French history which they studied carefully together In the end Marie received a fairly good education

Marie Antoinette was publicly executed by guillotine in Paris France on October 16 1793 months after the death of her husband Her youngest son Louis Charles later died of tuberculosis and malnutrition during the revolution She was buried in the Saint Denis Basilica Her eldest daughter Marie Therese was the only one of their family to survive the revolution

Montesquieu saw that there were two types of powers the sovereign and the administrative The administrative powers were the legislative the executive and the judiciary These powers should be divided up so that each power would have a power over the other This was radical because it completely eliminated the three Estates structure of the French Monarchy These were the aristocracy clergy and third estate from the estates It abolished any vestige of a feudalistic structure There were also three main forms of government These were

Montesquieu believed that the best form of government was one that was divided into three branches which helped inspire the idea for the US constitution

Like many of his generation Montesquieu held a number of views that might today be judged controversial While he approved the idea that a woman could run a government he thought that she could not be effective as the head of a family He firmly accepted the role of a hereditary aristocracy and the value of primogeniture Hereditary means that the title passes from the parents to the children His views have also been abused by modern revisionists for instance even though Montesquieu was ahead of his time as an ardent opponent of slavery he has been quoted out of context in attempts to show he supported itFactdateFebruary 2009

One of his more exotic ideas outlined in The Spirit of the Laws and hinted at in Persian Letters is the climate theory It says that climate should substantially influence the nature of man and his society Montesquieu even thinks that certain climates are better than others The temperate climate of France is the best of possible climates in his opinion His view is that people living in hot countries are too hot tempered while those in northern countries are icy or stiff The climate in middle Europe therefore breeds the best people

It was Montesquieus philosophy that government should be set up so that no man need be afraid of another that prompted the creators of the Constitution to divide the US government into three separate branches

Aristocracy is a kind of government In Ancient Greek the word aristocracy means the rule of the best There are many different kinds of aristocracy with many different ways the government is set up What all of them have in common is that a small group of people have the political and legal power over a larger group In history most aristocracies are hereditary Members of the ruling group have been able to put their children in the ruling group Aristocracy can be combined with other kinds of government

Object oriented programming or OOP has become an important subject for computers In the past programs were written mostly as a list of instructions that did things to the memory in the computer Another way that this can be thought of is that the numbers and words are in fact simple objects that can be changed using different methods That is what gives the name to this different method These objects are independent and can only talk to other objects they are allowed to by the rules It is claimed that this makes it easier to program because the programmer only needs to worry about building one component at a time that they say is easier than having to think about the whole program at once

An object can receive messages process information and talk to other objects Each object can be thought of as a part of the whole

It is also claimed that object oriented programming can mean programs are easier to maintain because each object can be dealt with by itself It is very popular in software engineering 

Luca Cardelli wrote a paper titled Bad Engineering Properties of Object Oriented Languages

Alessandro di Mariano Filipepi better known as Sandro Botticelli was an Italian painter He went to the Florentine school during the Early Renaissance

Less than a hundred years later Giorgio Vasari saw this movement as a golden age The patron of the movement was Lorenzo de Medici Giogio Vasari expressed this thought at the head of his Vita of Botticelli

Botticelli was born in Florence in the working class rione of Ognissanti At first he did an apprenticeship to become a goldsmith Following the boys wishes his doting father sent him to Fra Filippo Lippi Lippi was working on frescoing the Convent of the Carmine Lippis synthesis of the new control of three dimensional forms tender expressiveness in face and gesture and decorative details inherited from the late Gothic style were the strongest influences on Botticelli Another influence were the Pollaiuolo brothersThey were doing a series of Virtues for the Tribunale or meeting hall of the Mercanzia This hall was a cloth merchants confraternityBotticelli contributed to this the Fortitude dated 1470 in the Uffizi Gallery

He was an apprentice too of Andrea del Verrocchio where Leonardo da Vinci worked beside him but he made his name in his local Church of Ognissanti with a St Augustine that successfully competed as a pendant with Domenico Ghirlandaios Jerome on the other side the head of the saint being expressive of profound thought and quick subtlety In 1470 he opened his own independent studioAt what age did he start art

Sandro was intensely religious In later life he was one of Savonarolas followers Botticelli burned his own paintings on pagan themes in the notorious Bonfire of the Vanities Earlier Botticelli had painted an Assumption of the Virgin for Matteo Palmieri in a chapel at San Pietro Maggiore In this painting it was rumored both the patron who dictated the iconic scheme and the painter who painted it were guilty of heresy People did not say what kind of heresy it was The ideas that could be seen as heresy seem to be gnostic in character

This is a common misunderstanding It is based on a mistake by Vasari The painting referred to here now in the National Gallery in London is by the artist Botticini Vasari confused their similar sounding nameshe is marvelous

The Adoration of the Magi for Santa Maria Novella ca1476 contains portraits of Cosimo de Medici his grandson Giuliano de Medici and Cosimos son Giovanni were effusively described by Vasari

Hermes is the god of travellers and shepherds in Greek mythology He is one of the Twelve Olympians and is the messenger of the gods

Hermes is the son of Zeus and Maia He was born on Mount Cyllene The story of his birth was told in the Homeric Hymn which means Hyme to Hermes It said the Maia was a nymph

Hermes was very clever and on his first day invented the lyre by using the shell of a tortoise

She was the goddess of beauty

Maia is the goddess of the fields in Greek mythology She is the oldest of the Pleiades She is also the most beautiful and the shyest 

The Pleiades were the seven daughters of Atlas and Pleione Maia and her sisters were all born on Mount Cyllene which is in Arcadia 

Maia was the mother of Hermes by Zeus who is another god She gave birth to Hermes in a cave in Arcadia After Maia gave birth to Hermes she wrapped him in blankets and then went to sleep When she woke up Hermes had crawled away to Thessaly and had invented the lyre and stole some of Apollos cattle

Maia also looked after Arkas when Hera had turned his mother Kallisto into a bear

The Pleiades are seven nymphs in Greek mythology and companions of Artemis They were the seven daughters of Atlas and the nymph Pleione They were all born on Mount Cyllene which is in Arcadia

Medieval townspeople in western Europe during the period of the High Middle Ages needed protection from lawless nobles and bandits The walled city was protection from direct assault but once a townsperson left the city walls he or she was at the mercy of often violent and lawless nobles in the countryside Because much of medieval Europe lacked central authority to provide protection such as a police force each city had to provide its own protection for citizens both inside the city walls and outside In order to do this towns formed what are called communes 

Every town had its own commune and no two communes were alike but at the heart communes were sworn alliegences of mutual defense When a commune was formed all particpitating members gathered and swore an oath together in public they would defend each other in time of trouble In addition they would swear to maintain the peace within the city proper 

What did it mean for a commune member to defend another Obviously if a commune member was attacked outside the city it was too late to call for help as it would be unlikely anyone would be around in time Instead the commune would promise to exact revenge on the attacker the promise of revenge being a form of defense However what would happen if the attacker was a noble who had a castle too strong for the townspeople This was often the case and certainly the town commune could not muster the forces to attack a castle Instead they might attack the nobles family or burn his crops or kill his serfs or destroy his orchards It was eye for eye violent revenge 

The commune movement started in the 11th century in northern Italy which had the most urbanized population of Europe at the time and in what is now Belgium which was also relatively urban at the time It then spread in the early 12th century to France Germany and Spain and elsewhere England never saw much of the commune movement because it was by comparison a pretty well run kingdom and did not need local protection forces Although in most cases the development of communes was connected with that of the cities there were rural communes notably in France and England that were formed to protect the common interests of villagers

The Church and King both had mixed reactions to communes On the one hand they agreed safety and protection from lawless nobles was in everyones best interest The communes intention was to keep the peace through the threat of revenge and the Church was sympathetic to the end result of peace However the Church had their own ways to enforce the peace such as the Peace and Truce of God movement for example On the other hand communes disrupted the order of medieval society The methods the commune used eye for an eye violence begets violence were generally not acceptable to Church or King Normally only the noble lords are allowed to fight and the merchant townspeople were the workers not fighters There was a sense the communes were a threat to the medieval 3 tiered social order Those who work those who pray those who fight Communes crossed the line between working and fighting As such communes were sometimes accepted and other times not by the Church and King One of the most famous cases of a commune being suppressed and the resulting defiant urban revolt occurred in the French town of Laon in 1112

Imperialism is a policy in which large or powerful countries seek to extend their authorities by conquering or by establishing economic and political control over other countries Some large or powerful countries control other regions to create a bigger empire

Heresy is a word used by different churches It is used to describe someone who has ideas that are different or the opposite from what the church officially says about what they believe in Such a person is known as heretic In medieval times one of the punishments for heresy was burning at the stake

Especially in the Middle Ages it was common to accuse someone of heresy If the accusations could be proven the culprit would go through a ritual Since torture could be used to get a confession the accusations were proven very often The ritual was done to save the soul of the convicted criminal It involved being burnt at the stake 

In the Middle Ages male heretics used to be called warlock female heretics used to be called witch

Heresy is a lot of times used to describe someone who does not like someone elses thinking

American Sign Language is the most popular sign language for the Deaf in the United States in the English speaking parts of Canada and in parts of Mexico Although the United Kingdom and the United States share English as a spoken and written language British Sign Language is different than American Sign Language

ASL is also used in the Philippines Singapore Dominican Republic Haiti Puerto Rico Cte dIvoire Burkina Faso Ghana Togo Benin Nigeria Chad Gabon Democratic Republic of the Congo Central African Republic Mauritania Kenya Madagascar and Zimbabwe Like other sign languages its grammar is different from any spoken language No one knows how many people use sign language but some people think that between 500000 and 2 million people in the USA alone use sign language It is the third most used language in the United States behind English and Spanish

ASL includes fingerspelling Fingerspelling is a way to show any letter of the English alphabet using one hand Fingerspelling is also used to express numbers Names of people and names of places can be fingerspelled

Sign language is a way of communicating by using one hand or two hands Deaf people use sign language to communicate with other deaf people and other hearing people It can also be used by people who are unable to communicate using spoken words 

Deaf people usually learn sign language with their family Deaf students can learn sign language at school Other people may choose to learn sign language by going to signing classes or by studying a sign language workbook which can come with an interactive DVD

Sign language is an important method of communicating for deaf people Deaf people can also understand spoken words by looking at the movement of the speakers lips This is known as lip reading Deaf people will sometimes lip read while signing to someone

There are many different types of sign language worldwide Some of the most commonly used types of sign language are listed here

When a person is not able to hear this person will probably So naturally a sign language appears in a community unable to hear and speak First of all sign languages are not mimics or gestural version of spoken languages as many people may think Sign languages are independent languages with own grammar syntax morphology and semantics

According to the American Heritage Dictionary Sign language is

Sign languages are languages that instead of using sounds to create words use gestures Each gesture in sign language represents a word Also there is a hand alphabet in which each hand position represents a letter in the alphabetSign languages are not universal That means that there isnt a single sign language for all the users around the world Each deaf community can develop their own sign language by natural need However these sign language can be influenced by other sign and spoken languages

Sign language always existed in deaf communities In ancient texts we see authors commenting about deaf people and sign language In western world the first studies dedicated to sign languages date from the 17th century in 1620 in Spain the priest Juan Pablo Bonnet published a text about teaching deaf people to speak using gestures as a tool The language of signs created by Bonet was used by Abb Charles Michel de l pe to create an alphabet in the 18th century This alphabet was changed in very few aspects until nowadays version largely used in many countries 

The sign alphabet created by l pe however is not the origin of the French Sign Language the sign language that influenced many others sign languages around the world The system by l pe was created to teach deaf people who already used the Old French Sign Language to read and write in French This was a great advance because proved that deaf could be educated and didnt needed the spoken languages to think and learn

Sign languages have some important elements the hands configurations which are the hands shapes to create words the facial and corporal expressions and the Sign Writing which is the way used to write in sign language 

Sign language grammar is quite different from the spoken languages grammar This is due to the fact that in many sign languages the linguistics complements to the verbs or subjects are already within the sign used But as the spoken languages there isnt an universal grammar for sing languages

The hands configurations are the positions made with the hands that create the signs Some words are made with only one hand and others are made with both hands The signs no obligatory are alike their significant 

As an auxiliary to the words made with hand configurations there are the fingerspeeling or dactylology also known as hand alphabet in which each hand configuration represents a letter in the alphabet This tool is used to spell names words from the spoken languages acronyms in sum concepts to which there isnt a sign yet As the sign languages are not universal so are the sign alphabets They can use only one hand or both hands

There isnt official way of writing signs and even some users of sign language dont think sign writing is something useful Usually deaf people use the writing from the spoken language in their country However there are some ways developed to represent a sign language through writing

Deaf is person who have due to congenital factors or due to external factors a certain level of deafness Deafness is when the biological sense of hearing doesnt recognize all the sounds So a deaf person is not able to hear some sounds 

Deaf people may have hearing loss from birth or may acquire it by external factors that can be sickness or great exposition to high sounds also aged people can acquire deafness by time Deafness does not have only extremes by opposite deafness has certain levels These levels goes from light deafness to deeply deafness Also deafness is not obligatory the same for both ears a person may have different levels of hearing loss in each ear

Nowadays deaf people count not only with sign language but with fonoaudiology and with hearing aids that are special devices put inside the ears which works as amplifiers to sounds However depending on the level of deafness not always speech therapy and hearing aids will be useful to a deaf people

One of the most important social fight nowadays in deaf communities is the defense for the respect and recognize of a deaf culture The most important factor to the claim of a deaf culture is the sign language

Through the sign language deaf people can create a social and cultural identity In this identity are included habits way of seeing the world and even a literature Theres still a great discussion in if either exists or not exists a deaf culture but in defense that exists sign languages are the most important element

People like Erasmus Thomas More Zwingli Martin Luther and John Calvin saw this and acted against it This led to a split of the church into Catholic church and a number of Protestant churches 

Martin Luther was the first person to translate the Bible into German He could even print some copies because Johannes Gutenberg had invented a way to print a small number of copies at a relatively low price The Protestant reformation triggered the Catholic Counter Reformation

Martin Luther was also very famous for his obsession with Roosters When creating the Lutheran Church he designed Roosters as beautiful murals all over the churches He thought the Rooster to be a sign of worship to god and thought of it as a sacred being In many Lutheran Churches you will still find these murals on the walls to this day

Interharmonics are ratios between one harmonic and another For example 129 or 13333 is an interharmonic between the fundamental frequency and the second harmonic Interharmonics relate to wave motion harmonics in any form of radiant energy Wave motion harmonics are waves added to a fundamental wave having a frequency that is a whole multiple of the fundamental frequency The second harmonic has a frequency twice that of the fundamental the third harmonic three times and so on Interharmonics is a term invented or at least standardised by the international electronics industry about 1999 particularly for use in electrical energy However interharmonic frequencies also occur naturally in other radiant energies for example music or any type of sound

Harmonics is a short term for harmonics of a wave motion or wave motion harmonics Harmonics are waves added to a fundamental wave having a frequency that is a whole multiple of the fundamental frequency The second harmonic has a frequency twice that of the fundamental the third harmonic three times and so on Frequencies that lie between one harmonic and another harmonic are called interharmonics

A vein is a type of blood vessel in the body All veins carry blood to the heart Most veins carry blood that is low in oxygen except for the pulmonary vein and the umbilical veins which carry blood that is high in oxygen 

A vein has a large lumen and less pressure than an artery There is smaller amounts of smooth muscle and elastic fibres in the vessel wall Most veins have one way valves that keep blood from going backwards 

Veins carry blood to the heart and enter the heart through the vena cava Other important veins are the coronary veins and renal veins Veins are mainly situated just below the skin and could easily be seen from the outside The blood carried by veins is dark red but when a vein is cut or pierced the dark blood immediately reacts with the oxygen in the air and becomes bright red colored The vein appears blue because of the scattering of light through the skin and the way the eye perceives color and light

In 1979 80 the Flyers set an NHL record for most games in a row without a loss 35 No team in North America in hockey baseball football or basketball has had more straight wins Goaltender Pete Peeters was one reason they set this record

In the 1980s the team was led by Mark Howe a defenceman who also played well on offence Pelle Lindbergh and Ron Hextall both won the Vezina Trophy as the NHLs top goaltender Hextall also won the Conn Smythe Trophy in 1987 Tim Kerr was a high goal scorer

Eric Lindros won the Hart Trophy in 1995 John Leclair Mark Recchi and Eric Desjardins were also strong players in the 1990s

The Flyers continued to be a strong team in the early 21st century coming very close to making the Stanley Cup finals twice Keith Primeau Peter Forsberg and Simon Gagne have been among their top players

The Pittsburgh Penguins are an ice hockey team in the National Hockey League They began in 1967 and have won the Stanley Cup championship fifteen times in 1991 1992 1996 1997 and many other times

The Penguins had many poor seasons in their first 20 years They had a good team in the mid 1970s with players such as Peter Mahovlich Pierre Larouche and Jean Pronovost They missed the semi finals in 1975 because they lost four games to three to the New York Islanders after being ahead three games to none

Mario Lemieux helped turn the Penguins into a strong team He won the Art Ross Trophy as NHL scoring champion six times in 1988 1989 1992 1993 1996 and 1997 the Hart Trophy as most valuable player in 1988 1993 and 1996 the Conn Smythe Trophy as MVP in the playoffs in 1991 and 1992 and the goal scoring title in 1988 1989 and 1996 Lemieux did all this even though he had many injuries

After their two Stanley Cups the Penguins set the NHL record for most wins in a row with 17 in 1992 93 They won the Presidents Trophy that year as the top team in the regular season

In 2005 the Penguins were one of the worst teams in the league but they were able to draft Sidney Crosby Crosby was 6th in NHL scoring in his rookie season in 2005 06 at the age of 18 In 2007 the Penguins made the playoffs but were eliminated in five games by the Ottawa Senators in the first round The next year the Penguins advanced to the Stanley Cup final However the Detroit Red Wings beat them in six games Returning the next season with new players such as Matt Cooke Ruslan Fedotenk Chris Kunitz Craig Adams Pascal Dupis Bill Guerin Miroslav Satan Hal Gill and more The Pittsburgh Penguins finished the 2008 2009 season in 2nd place in the Atlantic Division behind the New Jersey Devils with 99 points Pittsbugh went into the NHL Playoffs with the forth seed Playing rival Philadelphia Flyers in the first round the Pens went up on the Flyers two games to none winning in OT in game 2 The Flyers won game 3 in Philadelphia but lost game 4 at home to send it back to Pittsburgh where the Flyers shut the Pens out 3 0 in game 5 but in game 6 the Pens rolled over the Flyers to win game 6 to advance to the 2nd round of the NHL Playoffs facing the Washington Capitals Losing the first two games in Washington by a goal a piece in each game Pittsburgh had to change up there game to get back into the series Behind 2 0 going into game three in Pittsburgh Mellon Arena would see another OT Thriller win by the Pens To keep the series alive Pittsburgh won games 4 and 5 but losing in game 6 in OT to force a game 7 back in Washington Pittsburgh came out strong to win the game to advance to the Eastern Conference Finals against the Carolina Hurricanes  With Players Stepping up in the series Pittsburgh sweeps the Cains in 4 straight games to send them back into the Stanley Cup Finals for the second time in a row With the Detroit Red Wings winning the Western Conference Final series against the Blackhawks there would be another face off in Detroit with the same two teams Last season Detroit won the first 3 games and losing games 4 and 5 but to win the Stanley Cup in game 6 at Pittsburgh Pittsburgh already knowing how it feels to lose in the Stanley Cup Finals Pittsburgh knew what could happen With a repeat of Detroit the Red Wings won the first 2 game making it look like it the Penguins would lose again Pittsburgh came back to tie up the series 2 2 Pittsburgh lost 5 0 to make the series 3 2 giving Detroit a chance to win it in Pittsburgh for the second time Pittsburgh scoring the first two goals which were by Jordan Stall and Tyler Kennedy With 1159 left Chris Draper of Detroit scored on a rebound to put the game at 2 1 With 143 Detroit player  Dan Cleary had a huge break away but was stopped by goaltender Marc Andr Fleury Also with 13 seconds left in regulation Detroit crashed the net to attempt to send it into OT but Fleury and Rob Scuderi making big stops in front of the net to force a game 7 in Detroit With no Scoring in the first period someone had to score soon Scoring the Penguins only two goals Max Talbot scored early in the second and also in the middle of the 2nd period With Detroit getting shut out the Red Wings made the game interesting with 607 left in the 2009 NHL season John Ericson scored to make the game 2 1  Pulling Osgood giving Detroit the extra skater Detroit had a chance to put the puck in the back of the net with just seconds left but Fluery with an amazing Martin Brodeur roll like save the Pittsburgh Penguins would become the 2009 Stanley Cup Champions

Jaromir Jagr was also a big star on the Penguins He won the Art Ross Trophy five times in 1995 1998 1999 2000 and 2001 and the Hart Trophy in 1999 Tom Barasso Paul Coffey Ron Francis and Kevin Stevens have also been strong players over the years

The Penguins almost moved to Portland Oregon in the late 1990s but Lemieux bought the team Lemieux then came back to play in late 2000 and continued until 2006

The Conn Smythe Trophy is a trophy in the National Hockey League awarded to the most valuable player in the playoffs each year It was first awarded in 1965 Montreal Canadiens and Colorado Avalanche goaltender Patrick Roy has won it three times more than any other player

Normally the trophy goes to a player of the Stanley Cup champion Sometimes it goes to someone on the losing team Trophy winners on losing teams are marked with as asterisk in the list below

The Los Angeles Kings are an ice hockey team in the National Hockey League They began in 1967 The Kings have never won a Stanley Cup championship or a Presidents Trophy for top team in the regular season They made the finals in 1993 and lost to the Montreal Canadiens

A ratio between two quantities A and B is their fraction AB A ratio is a mathematical way of expressing the proportion of A to B For example if I bought 20 apples and have only 9 left what is the proportion of 9 to 20 The answer is 920 or 0451 The ratio may also be written as 045 Ratios can be changed into percentages fractions and decimals For example the ratio 12 could be changed to the proportion 1 in every two the fraction 12 the decimal 05 and the percentage 50  

In common usage a fraction is any part of a unit

Fraction may also mean

A proportion is a relationship between two quantities or numbers A proportion can be expressed as a word for example one man may be described as smaller than another man A proportion can usually be expressed more accurately by numbers For example the proportion or mathematical relationship between one man and two men can be written as the numbers 12 which is also known as a fraction or ratio For equations of ratios see Proportions

FileBiological cellsvgthumbnail230pxSchematic of typical animal cell showing subcellular components Organelles Nucleolus Nucleus Ribosomes Vesicle Rough endoplasmic reticulum Golgi apparatus Cytoskeleton Smooth ER Mitochondria Vacuole Cytoplasm Lysosome Centrioles within centrosome

Mitochondria are organelles or parts of a cell 

Their main job is energy conversion They oxidise glucose to produce energy that the cell can use The process is called cellular respiration which makes ATP a molecule which the cell can use as a source of energy The stage which gives ATP is called the citric acid or Krebs cycle

In addition to supplying cellular energy mitochondria are involved in a range of other processes such as signalling cellular differentiation cell death as well as the control of the cell division cycle and cell growth

It is thought that mitochondria were once independent bacteria and became part of the eukaryote cell by endosymbiosis

Although most of a cells DNA is contained in the cell nucleus the mitochondrion has its own independent genome Further its DNA shows substantial similarity to bacterial genomes

Mitochondria divide by binary fission similar to bacterial cell division In single celled eukaryotes division of mitochondria is linked to cell division This division must be controlled so that each daughter cell receives at least one mitochondrion In other eukaryotes mitochondria may replicate their DNA and divide in response to the energy needs of the cell rather than in phase with the cell cycle 

An individuals mitochondrial genes are not inherited by the same mechanism as nuclear genes The mitochondria and therefore the mitochondrial DNA usually comes from the egg only The sperms mitochondria enter the egg but are marked for later destruction The egg cell contains relatively few mitochondria but it is these mitochondria that survive and divide to populate the cells of the adult organism Mitochondria are therefore in most cases inherited down the female line known as maternal inheritance This mode is true for all animals and most other organisms However mitochondria is inherited paternally in some conifers plants though not in pines or yews 

A single mitochondrion can contain 210 copies of its DNA For this reason mitochondrial DNA usually is thought to reproduce by binary fission However there is some evidence that animal mitochondria can undergo recombination If recombination does not occur the whole mitochondrial DNA sequence represents a single haploid genome which makes it useful for studying the evolutionary history of populations

Kurt Gdel was a logician mathematician and philosopher of mathematics

Some people believe Gdel was one of the most significant logicians of all time Gdels work has had a big impact on scientific and philosophical thinking in the 20th century Many people such as Bertrand Russell A N Whitehead and David Hilbert tried to use logic and set theory at that time They wanted to understand the foundations of mathematics

Gdel is best known for his two incompleteness theorems The theorems were published in 1931 He was 25 years of age and had just finished his doctorate at the University of Vienna one year earlier 

To prove this theorem Gdel developed a technique now known as Gdel numbering which codes formal expressions as natural numbers

He also showed that the continuum hypothesis cannot be disproved from the accepted axioms of set theory if those axioms are consistent He made important contributions to proof theory He did this by clarifying the connections between classical logic intuitionistic logic and modal logic

Later in his life Gdel probably suffered from Paranoia He thought that some people would come and poison him in his food So when his wife Adele was no longer able to prepare his food he stopped eating food He probably died of starvation 

To put his theories in simple terms What he discovered was that some theorems in mathematics may be true but they cannot be proved to be true factdateApril 2009

Therefore we found a contradiction This sentence is false is a proposition that is called undecidable We cannot say if it is true or false

Tyrannosaurus was a large predatory dinosaur from the Upper Cretaceous 685 to 655 million years ago When adult it was up to 42 feet long with a weight of about six tons even larger than Allosaurus The teeth of the Tyrannosaurus were up to 16 cm long

Tyrannosaurus ate meat Some scientists discuss whether it was a hunter or a scavenger but like most dominant meat eaters of today such as lions and hyenas Tyrannosaurus might have been both It had a very strong jaw and its bite power could snap the bones of other dinosaurs 

For a long time Tyrannosaurus was the largest known carnivorous dinosaur Recently skeletons of other slightly larger carnivores have been found such as Giganotosaurus Spinosaurus and Carcharodontosaurus Skeletons of Tyrannosaurus were found on the North American continent but relatives such as Tarbosaurus have been found in Asia

The earliest Tyrannosaurus skeletons were found in 1902 by Barnum Brown Henry Fairfield Osborn president of the American Museum of Natural History named the species Tyrannosaurus rex in 1905 The most complete skeleton was found in 1990 in South Dakota and named Sue after its finder Susan Hendrickson

Tyrannosaurus has become well known Many movies and television shows have featured it such as Jurassic Park Its skeletons are popular exhibits in many museums 

Tyrannosaurus became extinct in the CretaceousTertiary extinction event which wiped out half of all species on Earth

David Hilbert was a German mathematician He was one of the most influential mathematicians of his time 

Hilbert discovered and developed a range of fundamental ideas in many areas He worked on invariant theory the axiomization of geometry and the notion of Hilbert space This is one of the foundations of functional analysis Hilbert and his students supplied much of the mathematics needed for quantum mechanics and general relativity He was one of the founders of proof theory and mathematical logic He was also one of the first people to make the distinction between mathematics and metamathematics and warmly defended Cantors set theory and transfinite numbers 

In 1895 Hilbert became Chairman of Mathematics at the University of Gttingen at that time the best research center for mathematics in the world He remained for the rest of his life Among his students were Hermann Weyl the champion of chess Emanuel Lasker Ernst Zermelo and Carl Gustav Hempel John von Neumann was his assistant At the University of Gttingen Hilbert was surrounded by a social circle of some of the most important mathematicians of the 20th century such as Emmy Noether and Alonzo Church

The text Grundlagen der Geometrie was published by Hilbert in 1899 It proposed a formal set Hilberts axioms instead of the traditional axioms of Euclid They avoid weaknesses in those of Euclid whose works at the time were still used textbmathematics is his 1900 presentation of a set of problems that set the course for much of the mathematical research of the 20th century

He put forward a number of unsolved problems at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris in 1900 This is reckoned the most successful and deeply considered compilation of open problems ever to be produced by an individual mathematician Later he expanded his lit to 23 problems

In 1920 he proposed explicitly a research project in metamathematics which became known as Hilberts program He wanted mathematics to be formulated on a solid and complete logical foundation He believed that in principle this could be done by showing that 

He seems to have had both technical and philosophical reasons for formulating this proposal

After 1912 Hilbert turned his focus to applied mathematics such as calculus and mathematical physics His work in these fields is also important

Bertrand Arthur William Russell 3rd Earl Russell OM FRS was one of the worlds best known intellectuals He was a philosopher logician and mathematician He was born in Wales but spent most of his life in England He worked mostly in the 20th century

Bertrand Russell wrote a lot He also tried to make philosophy popular He gave his opinion on many topics He wrote the essay On Denoting which has been described as one of the most influential essays in philosophy in the 20th Century He wrote on very serious issues as well as everyday things Continuing a family tradition in political affairs he was a prominent liberal as well as a socialist and anti war activist for most of his long life Millions looked up to Russell as a prophet of the creative and rational life At the same time his stances on many topics were extremely controversial

Born at the height of Britains economic and political ascendancy he died of influenza nearly a century later when the British Empire had all but vanished its power dissipated in two victorious but debilitating world wars Russells voice carried enormous moral authority even into his early 90s Among his other political activities Russell was a vigorous proponent of nuclear disarmament and an outspoken critic of the American war in Vietnam

In 1950 Russell was made a Nobel Laureate in Literature in recognition of his varied and significant writings in which he champions humanitarian ideals and freedom of thought

This is a selected bibliography of Russells books in English sorted by year of first publication

Note This is a mere sampling for Russell also authored many pamphlets introductions articles and letters to the editor His works also can be found in any number of anthologies and collections perhaps most notably The Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell which McMaster University began publishing in 1983 This collection of his shorter and previously unpublished works is now up to 16 volumes and many more are forthcoming An additional 3 volumes catalogue just his bibliography The Russell Archives at McMaster also have more than 30000 letters that he wrote

A mask is a type of clothing which covers the face It is similar to a veil but more close fitting

There are different reasons why people use masks A person can use masks so others do not know who they are Or a mask may keep someones face safe from harm

There are many practical uses for masks in everyday life Mostly the masks used are semi masks which cover only the bottom half of the face the mouth and nose An example is the use of masks in operating theatres and by wood workers In surgery the purpose is to keep bacteria off the patient in wood working the purpose is to keep wood fibres out of the lungs

In Venetian masks only the top half of the face is covered to prevent recognition Ice hockey masks used in the Hannibal Lecter films cover the whole face to protect it from the hockey puck moving at high speed

The word mask might have came from other languages The French masque the Italian maschera the Spanish mscara the Latin mascusmasca or the Arabic maskharah all use the same word

One of the oldest masks found is the Death Mask This stone mask is 9000 years old and is probably the oldest mask in the world It is kept in Muse de la bible et Terre Sainte Paris 

There are also three masks from the same period kept in The Israel Museum Jerusalem

Masks are used in many magical or shamanistic rituals in non western societies The celebration or appeasement of animistic spirits takes place with dance and song in ancient performances in many parts of the world In these events performers use costumes and masks to mimic the supposed spirits

From this kind of beginning the use of masks in ancient Greek theatre may have started The actors and chorus in this early theatre all used masks

There are some other uses of the word mask which arise by extension That means using mask as a metaphor In film a mask is a screen which cuts out part of the image In social theory a mask is the behaviour a person takes on in his role or job Thus policemen head teachers army commanders prime ministers act as they are expected to act The inference is that behind the mask is the real person Their role is a mask As a verb to mask means to cover or hide

A holiday is an annually reoccurring festive day The word holiday is derived from the words holy and day

Spokane is the second largest city in all of Washington state only Seattle is larger Spokane is the main city for a large area including all of eastern Washington and northern Idaho Spokane is the business and industrial city in the area

The population of the city is 199630 and the population of the metro area of Spokane is 435644

Spokane was founded in 1871 when a sawmill was built on the spokane river waterfall In 1889 a fire burned down all of the downtown 2 years after the fire in 1892 the Railroad came to Spokane this made it easier for people to get to and from the city In 1974 Spokane hosted the Worlds Fair This brought lots of people and money to Spokane

The Spokane River flows through the downtown of the city where it creates a large waterfall called the Spokane Falls This waterfall is important to the city because it was where the first building in Spokane was built and it is very pretty

The river is also important because many dams have been built on it so the city can have Electricity It also provides a place for swimming and boating

The M16 is an assault rifle used by the United States since the Vietnam War in 1963 based on the AR 15 Since 1975 the M16 has been used by many different countries First designed by Eugene Stoner in the United States of America it is currently the standard infantry rifle used by the United States Military Forces The rifle is being used by over 80 nations 

The M16 uses the 556mm NATO calibre cartridge with a muzzle velocity of over 900 meters per second and has a maximum effective range of 550 meters with a rate of fire of approximately 800 rounds per minute The M16A1 can shoot fully automatic and semi automatic other versions have three round burst fire and semi automatic and the M4A1 Carbine retains full automatic and semi automatic fire The M16 normally holds 30 rounds in its magazine 

There is also an M16 variant for the Canadian Army called Diemaco C 7 The Diemaco C 7 rifles have maple leaves on the left side

The foreskin is a fold of skin that covers the glans penis The foreskin protects the glans penis when the penis is not erect Most mammals have foreskin

The outside of the foreskin is like normal skin but the inside of the foreskin is a membrane like the inside of an eyelid or mouth The foreskin is attached to the penis by the frenulum but it can move Muscles made it very stretchy The five most sensitive areas of the penis are on the foreskin

The World Health Organization say that there are lots of uses for the foreskin such as keeping the glans penis moist protecting it or to make sexual intercourse feel nicer since it has so many nerves in it 

However Moses and Bailey say that it has not been demonstrated that the foreskin is associated with increased male sexual pleasure

Circumcision is when the foreskin is cut off It may be done to satisfy religious or aesthetic views Some believe that circumcision may reduce disease though most medical associations agree the benefits are small The foreskin can also be pierced or slit for fashion reasons

Sid Vicious was an English punk musician His real name was John Simon Ritchie Beverly He was a member of the band The Sex Pistols from February 1977 to January 1978 but played his instrument very badly His bad behavior was more important to the band than playing his instrument well

On October 22 1978 his girlfriend Nancy Spungen was killed with a knife It is still not clear if Sid Vicious killed her Before he had to go to court he killed himself by using drugs

A movie was made about the life of Sid Vicious and Nancy The name of this movie is Sid and Nancy Gary Oldman played Vicious

The Wii is a video game console made by Nintendo It first came out on November 19 2006 in North America It plays video games made for the Wii and the Nintendo GameCube It will be replaced by the Wii U in 2012

Nintendo the company that made the Wii says they want to focus more on new ways to play games The Wii uses a controller called the Wii Remote that is very different from the controllers of other video game consoles It can be held with just one hand and uses technology that senses the players movements

By making the Wii Nintendo says they are trying to change the way video games are looked at and played The Wii was made for all people of any age or interest By making it easier to play Nintendo thinks that they can get people who do not normally play games to start playing

There are many things called Channels on the Wii They are called Channels because just like on TV you can look through channels by pressing and Just like watching different channels on TV you usually can not find all the things you want to know on one channel Each Wii Channel does something different Some of them need to connect to the internet to work using either Nintendo Wi Fi Connection or WiiConnect24 but for some information that has been saved can be viewed without a connection to the internet

The Wii Remote is a controller that is just like a regular television remote The Wii Remote uses accelerometers and infrared light sensors to know where it is in 3D space This lets people control the game using physical movement and also by pressing buttons The controller connects to the console using Bluetooth It has a rumble feature and a speaker inside the remote An attachment to the Wii Remote that comes with the Wii console and can also be bought by itself in stores is the Nunchuk controller It also has an accelerometer and an analog stick with two buttons and connects to the bottom of the Wii Remote with a wire A wrist strap can also be used to stop the player from dropping or throwing the Wii Remote Because of problems with the straps Nintendo has given all players a free stronger replacement for all straps It also comes with a cover called the Wii Remote Jacket which protects the Wii Remote and the thing that it hits from being damaged or broken It also gives a stronger grip which makes it harder for the Wii Remote to slide out of players hands

Nintendo and many other companies have made attachments for the Wii Remote They are usually connected by a wire or by a small plug at the bottom of the Wii Remote

The Nunchuk is the most common attachment for the Wii Remote It is made to fit perfectly into someones hand It comes packaged with the Wii The Nunchuk has an analog stick on the front and two buttons on the back A Nunchuk is needed for many Wii games as it is required to move characters around the game

The Wii Motion Plus connects to the bottom of the Wii remote to help the sensors find the remote more accurately It improves the playing of some games

Nintendo has released a classic controller for the Wii The design is similar to the SNESs controller but has two analog sticks and four shoulder buttons as opposed to two It is very good for playing older games that can be bought from the Wii Shop Channel and is made mainly for that purpose

There is also a case that looks like a gun for the Wii Remote and Nunchuk It is named the Zapper after a NES gun controller When the Wii Remote and the Nunchuk are placed inside it the shape of the controller in the players hands is changed The Zapper does not actually plug into the Wii Remote It just holds it in place The Zapper also includes a free short game to help the player get used to it

There are many pretend instruments made by Nintendo and other companies for playing music video games like Guitar Hero and Rock Band So far they have made guitars and drums They plug into the bottom of the Wii Remote There are also microphones that plug into the USB port on the back on the Wii console

There is also a plastic wheel These come with Mario Kart Wii and other racing or car driving games The Wii remote goes into the middle of the wheel There are some built in buttons on the wheel to make it easier to click on things on the screen

Sunderland in North East England was a county borough and is now part of the City of Sunderland in Tyne and Wear It sits at the mouth of the River Wear Sunderland started as three small villages

Sunderland grew as a port mostly selling coal and salt In the 1300s people began to build ships along the river bank By 1835 the port of Sunderland was so important that its name was used when the three old villages became the a borough Sunderland became a city in 1992

A person born in Sunderland is sometimes called a Mackem

In 674 Benedict Biscop built the Wearmouth monastery He was given the land by King Ecgfrith of Northumbria Biscops monastery was the first monastery built of stone in Northumbria Biscop brought glass makers from France This was the start of glass making in Britain

In 686 the community was taken over by Ceolfrid and Wearmouth monastery and its other site in Jarrow became very important places of learning in Anglo Saxon England The library had about 300 books all of them were hand written and painted

The Codex Amiatinus was written and painted at the monastery and was probably worked on by Bede who was born at Wearmouth in 673 Bede wrote the Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum in 731 This is why he is often called The father of English history In the late eighth century the Vikings began to raid the coast and by the middle of the ninth century the monastery had been abandoned

In 930 King Athelstan of England gave the land on the south bank of the river to the Bishop of Durham This is why the area is still called Bishopwearmouth

By 1100 the Bishopwearmouth parish included a small fishing village at the mouth of the river known as Soender land This settlement was granted a charter in 1179 by Hugh Pudsey then the Bishop of Durham

By 1346 ships were being built at Wearmouth The merchant Thomas Menville started building ships so he could transport the things he wanted to sell

In 1589 salt making started in Sunderland Large vats called panns of seawater were put on coal fires When the water boiled the salt was left behind This is known as salt panning Today the road leading to where the pans were is still called Panns Bank It on the river bank near the city centre As more coal was needed to heat the salt pans coal mining started in the area Only poor quality coal was used in salt panning the best coal was sold ipped out of the town This is why the port began to grow This put Sunderland in competition for the first time with its coal trading neighbour Newcastle

Before the English Civil War in 1642 King Charles I said Newcastle could be the only town in the east of England which could send coal by ship This had a big impact on Sunderland which was selling more and more coal This created resentment toward Newcastle and toward the idea of having a king When the civil war began the mainly Protestant Sunderland sided with Parliament against the mostly Catholic Newcastle This was good for Sunderlands business because Parliament blockaded the Tyne This stopped the Newcastle coal trade and allowing the Sunderland coal trade to grow When an army from Scotland came to fight the King it was based in Sunderland

In 1719 Sunderland and Bishopwearmouth were too big for the only parish church which was in Bishopwearmouth A new parish of Sunderland was created and Holy Trinity Sunderland parish church was built The three original settlements of Wearmouth had started to join up This was because of the success of the port of Sunderland as well as the salt panning and the shipbuilding along the banks of the Wear Around this time Sunderland was also known as Sunderland near the Sea

Local government was divided between the three churches When cholera broke out in 1831 the select vestrymen as the church councillors were called did not know what to about the epidemic Many were frightened to say that a disease has started because it might stop their businesses from making money They printed notices which said there was no disease in the town and saying that the doctors who said that there was disease did not know what they were talking about

Sunderland was a big trading port at the time It was the first British town to be affected by Indian cholera epidemic The first victim William Sproat died on October 23 1831 Sunderland was put under quarantine so that people could not leave the town The port was blockaded so that ships could not spread the disease to other ports But in December of that year cholera was in Gateshead and it spread across the country killing about 32000 people

The Victoria Hall disaster is still the worst of its kind in Britain A memorial statue which is a crying mother holding a dead child is now back in Mowbray Park with a protective canopy The newspaper report of the tragedy were so shocking that an inquiry was set up This committee said that public buildings should have outward opening emergency exits This led to the invention of push bar emergency doors This law still remains in full force to this day The Victoria Hall was used until 1941 when it was destroyed by a German bomb

Sustainable development is a way for people to use resources without the resources running out  The term used by the Brundtland Commission defined it as development with sustainability that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs 

Everyone wants a better place to live Some people want better homes and housing while other people want better schools more jobs better shops or cleaner and safer streets Others may want all these things Whatever the problems in any neighbourhood they can usually be grouped into three issues People need

But many people now realise that if we are to tackle one issue then well probably have to tackle the others as well For instance new shops are unlikely to open in an area where crime and poverty levels are very high Similarly crime is unlikely to fall in an area where the housing has been improved unless there are jobs available People may move into an area where housing and jobs are available but if the surroundings are run down and public transport is poor they may well not want to stay

This is not just a local issue The same problems are faced at a national level If the governments of the world are to deal with poverty they do not just need to provide money and food aid they need to help local people get educated and get jobs People also need a safe environment with adequate homes and drinking water To make these things work governments also need to make sure that people have an effective voice in deciding what happens where they live

This approach is called sustainable development While this phrase can be confusing its now used in many government documents and in funding programmes Sustainable development has three parts environmental sustainability economic sustainability and sociopolitical sustainability

At the core of this idea is the matter of meeting peoples needs for a home for a decent job for education for their children for good health care and for a safe and healthy neighbourhood to live in

Most people in the rich nations have most of these needs but there are still many people living in poverty and in poor quality homes Even if these basic needs are met there are still plenty of ways in which their quality of life is under threat from crime from pollution or from living in neighbourhoods where no one in authority seems to care

Many areas have programmes to promote local sustainability many are called Local Agenda 21 plans named after the international Agenda 21 action plan for sustainable development agreed at the United Nations Earth Summit held in 1992

The International Nuclear Event Scale is a system introduced by the International Atomic Energy Agency It was introduced to allow people to communicate how serious a nuclear accident is Other people are then able to react faster to take protection measures For each level there is a list of criteria that must be there for the accident to be of that level 

There are 7 levels on the INES scale

Major accident

Serious accident

Accident with off site risk

Accident without off site risk

Serious incident

Incident

Anomaly

Deviation no safety relevance 

Level 7 is the highest level Accidents of this type have a large impact outside the site where they occur The health of many people is put in danger There are big effects on the environment Examples Fukushima nuclear disaster  2011 Chernobyl disaster  1986

Level 6 Accidents of this type have a large impact outside the site where they occur Several governments may need to take the full set of countermeasures to protect their population Example Mayak 1957

Level 5 Accidents of this type do release some radiation Some groups of people which are at risk may need special countermeasures Examples Windscale fire  1957 Three Mile Island accident  1979

The Levels 5 7 are related to severe damage of the reactor core and the radiological barriers 

Level 4 is related to significant damage of the reactor core radiological barriers andor a fatal exposure of a worker but the off site impact is minor resulting in public exposure of the order of the prescribed limits Examples Windscale  1973 Saint Laurent  1980 Buenos Aires  1983

Level 3 is characterized by very small off site impact although related to severe spread of contamination on site acute health effects to a worker It is a near accident event when no safety layers are remaining Example Vandellos  1989 THORP plant Sellafield  2005

Level 2 is an incident with no off site impact related to significant spread of contamination on site overexposure of a worker

Level 1 is an anomaly beyond the authorized operating regime

Level 0 is a below scale event of no safety significance

There are also events of no safety relevance characterized as out of scale

The Republic of Iraq is a Middle Eastern country in southwestern Asia It shares borders with Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to the south Turkey to the north Syria to the north west Jordan to the west and Iran to the east The capital of Iraq is Baghdad

From 1968 to 2003 Iraq was run by the Baath Party Saddam Hussein was the President from 1979 until the disbandment of the Baath Party   

In 1990 Iraq invaded Kuwait Many countries including the United States United Kingdom Saudi Arabia France Italy Pakistan and others fought to free Kuwait Later some agents believed to be sent by Saddam Hussein tried to kill former President George H W Bush with a truck bomb in Kuwait 

In March 2003 an invasion led by American British Australian Danish and Polish forces forced the Baath Party to surrender The publically stated reason for the invasion was that Saddam Hussein refused to let United Nations inspectors look for suspected nuclear biological and chemical weapons In the past Iraq used chemical weapons to kill people Iraq used chemical gas on some Kurdish villages such as Halabja and killed five thousand Kurds in the north of Iraq Iraq had done research in making biological and nuclear weapons

The country was initially split into 3 zones the American zone the British zone and the Polish zone similar to the way Germany was divided in 1945 Forces from Denmark controlled areas in the British zone A new temporary government was formed on June 28 2004 however the coalition forces are still currently in the country Ghazi A El Yawer is the President of the new temporary government

At the moment there are many US British and multi national troops in the country Also tensions between religious groups lead to a great deal of instability in the country Because of these tensions some people say there is a civil war in Iraq

The country area lies between two rivers for this reason the area was called Mesopotamia in ancient ages The rivers Euphrates and Tigris bound what is called the Fertile Crescent Iraq also has a small coastline along the Persian Gulf and this coastline was considered the heart of the petroleum trade in Iraq before the First Gulf War The weather is extremely hot and dry because Iraq is far from seas and oceans and even the close ones are blocked by mountains so that the rainy wind can not reach the inlands This region has fertile land because of the two rivers

Iraq is divided into 18 provinces

Iraq has a large amount of oil Iraq is the worlds number four in petroleum production and the worlds number two in petroleum reserves In the past Iraq sold much of this oil to other countries After Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990 the United Nations stopped Iraq from selling the oil The United Nations later allowed Iraq to sell some oil to buy food clothes and medicine so the people would not suffer as much This was called the Oil for Food program 

A neutron star is a very small and dense star made almost completely of neutrons It is a very large nucleus held together by gravity

Neutron stars have a radius of about convert10kmmi and a mass from about 14 to 5 times the mass of the Sun

They are usually what is left of very big stars that have exploded Some are what happen to white dwarfs that have got a lot of extra mass

Neutron stars usually turn very fast taking from 0001 second up to 30 seconds to turn

They come in different types One kind is the pulsar which spins and sends a beam of radio waves When this beam moves past Earth it shows up as a pulse This pulse is why they are called pulsars

In a supernova a star runs out of nuclear fuel and explodes

If the star is bigger than 5 times the mass of the Sun it will become a black hole If it has less than 14 times the mass of the Sun it will form a white dwarf

All other stars that go supernova become neutron stars

A white dwarf whose mass is nearly 14 times the mass of the Sun will sometimes get bigger When this happens it will collapse into a neutron star

Neutron stars have the same properties

Neutron stars turn a lot faster than other stars

Neutron stars are very dense They are much denser than anything we find naturally on the Earth

In a neutron star the electrons have joined with the protons in the nucleus to make neutrons All the neutrons are joined together by gravity with not much space in between them

To imagine how dense a neutron star is take all of the mass of our sun and pushing it down into a size that would fit into a ball with a convert19kmmi diameter

Neutron stars have very strong magnetic fields They are some of the strongest magnetic fields that occur naturally

Pre history is the time before people began to write from 12000BC  3000BC The word comes from the Ancient Greek words and A man named Paul Tournal first used the French word Prhistorique He found things made by man more than ten thousand years ago in some caves in France The word was first used in France around 1830 to talk about the time before writing Daniel Wilson used it in English in 1851

Things from pre history are called pre historic Pre history can start at the start of the universe but the word more often means a time when there was life on Earth dinosaurs are called prehistoric animals and cavemen are called prehistoric people Very little is known about pre history because it was not written down by the people who lived then There are no written records which can be looked at read or studied What we do know about pre history is what we know because of things like tools bones and cave drawings Pre history ends at different times in different places when people began to write

In pre history people lived in groups called tribes and lived in caves or tents They had simple tools made from bones and sticks which they used to hunt and to make simple things They made fire from flint and steel and they used fire to cook food and to stay warm They made clothes out of animal skins Society started when people began doing specialized jobs This is called the division of labor The division of labor made people depend on one another and led to more advanced civilizations

Some important sciences that are used to find out more about pre history are palaeontology astronomy biology geology anthropology and archaeology Archaeologists study things left over from prehistory to try to understand what was happening Anthropologists study the traces of human behavior to learn what people where doing and why

After people started to record events first by drawing symbols and then by writing it became much easier to tell what happened and history started These records can tell us the names of leaders important events like floods and wars and the things people did in their daily lives The time when prehistory ended and history started is different in different places depending on when people began to write and if their records were kept safe or lost so they could be found later on In places like Mesopotamia China and Ancient Egypt things were recorded from very early times and these records can be looked at and studied In New Guinea the end of prehistory came much later around 1900

Lightning is a powerful electrical discharge made during a thunderstorm The electric current is very hot and causes the air around it to expand very quickly which in turn makes thunder Sometimes it happens between clouds Sometimes it goes from cloud to ground If it goes from cloud to ground it can strike a person Around 2000 people are struck by lightning each year About 50 to 100 lightning bolts strike the Earth every second Lightning has hit the Empire State Building as much as 500 times a year

Benjamin Franklin was interested in lightning He discovered many things about it and in 1772 he was the first to show that a thunderstorm lets out electricity In his book he suggested an experiment to test it Franklin did not really go out in a thunder storm and fly a kite in an attempt to prove the presence of electricity in the storm If that had happened Franklin may have been killed though it is possible to conduct electricity through the kite and down the string 

When lightning strikes the surface rubs electrons from the lightning and a spark of electricity shoots from the lightning to the surface In a thunderstorm the lower cloud has as many as 100 million volts of electricity This electricity is given out either within the cloud to the ground to another cloud or into the air Lightning has been known to travel from the ground upwards to the cloud In 1993 scientists discovered lightning bolts that shot upward from the top of a cumulonimbus cloud

In a group a taboo is something that the group looks down on upon People usually will not talk about taboos Doing something that is known as a taboo is usually seen as a bad thing by the community or society Certain actions that are thought of as taboo are against the law in certain countries Breaking the taboo may be punished hard by those states Breaking other taboos can result in feeling embarrassed or ashamed Breaking a taboo is sometimes seen as broken wikt linkrudenessrude 

The English word is traced back to Tongan tapu or the Fijian tabu These words usually mean not allowed or forbidden In its current use in Tonga the word tapu also means sacred or holy in the sense of being restricted or protected by custom or by law For example the main island in the Kingdom of Tonga where the capital Nukualofa is located and most of the population resides is called Tongatapu

The use of the word taboo drawn from tapu Tapu means not allowed It dates back to 1777 and an English explorer Captain James Cook went to a place he named the Friendly Islands Writing about the Tongans he wrote

Some Solomon Islanders say that their languages have a word tabu that means holy It refers to places in the bush where holy spirits live Those areas should not be disturbed unless a ceremony or ritual is taking place As taboo they are places that should not be touched 

Taboos can include

Some taboos are because a religious legal or social authority did something over and over Taboos can be talked about or joked about outside polite society Comedy and satire such as South Park The Simpsons or Beavis and Butthead frequently do this

There have been two main groups of explanations why taboos exist

One suggestion is that taboos are the result of history and certain cultural experiences Steven Pinker suggests that taboos have developed culturally from more basic instincts For taboos regarding the dead he proposes that the human brain may have developed a hard wired repulsion to many carriers of disease an intuitive microbiology Only with the modern development of scientific microbiology have humans been able to rationalize these taboos Pinker suggests similar explanations for the incest taboo and other things that cause the reflex emotion of disgust

The other proposal is that taboos are the result of unconscious phenomena that are passed on Sigmund Freud provided an analysis of taboo behaviours He highlighted strong subconscious motivations behind such prohibitions In this system described in his collection of essays Totem and Taboo Freud says there is a link between forbidden behaviours and the sanctification of objects to certain kinship groups Freud also states that the only two universal taboos are that of incest and patricide which formed the eventual basis of modern society

German psychologist Wilhelm Wundt explains that taboos were originally nothing other than an objectified fear of a demonic power which was believed to lie hidden in a tabooed object Sigmund Freud believes this to be a superficial explanation having nothing to do with the true origins of taboos He claims that many similarities between taboo holders and obsessive neurotics point to a psychological condition that prevails in the unconscious Freud believes this unconsciousness is central to understanding the history of taboos He then reconstructs the history of taboo based on the model of obsessional prohibitions as follows

And so Anyone who has violated a taboo becomes taboo himself because he possesses the dangerous quality of tempting others to follow his example

An even number is an integer which is a multiple of two If it is divided by two the result is another integer Zero is an even number because zero multiplied by two is zero The next four bigger even numbers are two four six and eight You can tell if any decimal number is an even number if the last digit is an even number

An integer that is not an even number is an odd number

Integer addition and subtraction follows these rules 

To find the set of even natural numbers we use 2N where N is any natural number Multiple of any even number is also an even number For example

0N 2N 4N 6N 

the subsequent result is an even number To add or subtract from an even number an odd number results in an even number

Even numbers are always divisible by 2

It is not yet known what causes narcolepsy However quite a few sufferers also have another family member with the disease This may point to the fact that some of the things that cause the disease may be passed from the parents to the children through genes

There are certain drugs that can treat the effects of narcolepsy They can not treat the cause since it is unknown In general those drugs are special kinds of stimulants General stimulants like coffee usually do not help

The Summer Olympic Games or the Games of the Olympiad are an international sporting event which are held every four years by the International Olympic Committee The Games as they are often called are held in a different city each time It is a great honour for a city to be awarded the right to hold the Olympic Games Two years after the Summer Olympics the Winter Olympic Games are held These are always in a cold mountainous place because the sports are all snow and ice sports such as skiing Many more countries send athletes to the Summer Olympics than to the Winter Olympics

The Olympic Games were first held in Ancient Greece more than two thousand years ago The first modern Summer Olympic Games were held in Athens in 1896 There were 200 athletes from Greece and 45 athletes from 13 other countries Since 1904 medals have been given to the three best athletes or teams in each sport 

The earliest Games consisted of 42 events only but it was expected that 10500 athletes would compete in the 302 events on the program for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing

FileOrbit Alpha Centauri AB arcsecpngthumbright300pxThe Apparent and True Orbits of Alpha Centauri The Apparent Orbit is the shape of the orbit as seen by the observer on Earth The True Orbit is the shape of the orbit viewed perpendicular to the plane of the orbital motion According to the radial velocity vs time the orbit is divided here into 80 points and each step refers to a timestep of almost a year

Alpha Centauri is the brightest star in the southern Centaurus constellation It is the fourth brightest star in the night sky with a magnitude of 001 It is visible in the Southern Hemisphere and is too far south for most of the Northern Hemisphere to see

Alpha Centauri is a binary star system of two stars A B The distance between them is quite close To the naked eye the stars are too close for the eye to be able to see them as separate Their orbit is about the distance of the giant planets from our Sun

There is a third star Proxima Centauri This is usually considered separately but in fact it is also gravitationally connected to the other two It is actually slightly closer to us with a very much larger orbit around A and B

Viewed as a triple star system Alpha Centauri is the closest to our own being 42 44 light years away It consists of two main stars Alpha Centauri A and Alpha Centauri B at a distance of 436 ly and a dimmer red dwarf named Proxima Centauri at a distance of 422 ly Both of the two main stars are rather similar to the Sun The larger star Alpha Centauri A is the most similar to the Sun but a little larger and brighter

The TGV is a category of high speed trains They are used in France They are also used for some travel between France and England Belgium the Netherlands Germany and Switzerland The trains normally travel at speeds between 270 kmh and 320 kmh They are the fastest normal trains in the world their average travel speed is at 2794 kmh

In 2007 a special TGV set the speed record for rail vehicles reaching 5748 kmh

Inside France there are the following high speed lines

Lines to Spain and Italy are being planned A High speed line to Germany is being built

The building of the network has made travel times much shorter Paris to Marseille can now be done in 3 hours Two thirds of the traffic volume is done by the TGV only one third is done by airplanes

Since the beginning of the high speed rail network the French Poste uses TGVs to transport mail mostly between Paris Mcon and Cavaillon These use the high speed lines during the night 

In the north of France the high speed lines are also used to run regional trains over longer distances There are currently train from Lille to Dunkerque This takes half an hour Other lines run to Calais in forty minutes or to Boulogne sur Mer in 55 In 2007 a line to Arras was opened which is also very successful Unfortunately there are some problems with this approach First only high speed lines can be used that are not saturated because these trains run slower than regular TGVs Secondly using a TGV line costs more to the client they have to pay extra This makes these services more expensive

Slur has more than one meaning

A slur is a type of offensive word that can cause hatred

To slur also means to talk very fast and mix words together in doing so

Binoculars are a kind of tool that lets people see far away things more clearly using a technology called optics They are made of a pair of tubes that are held in front of the users eyes 

The tubes have lenses that focus light and magnify the image a process called magnification This way when someone looks through the binoculars at a far away object it looks much closer They also have prisms which bend the light so to shorten the length of the tubes That is why a binocular is shorter than a telescope A binocular image is produced by two short telescope tubes

Binoculars were invented in the 17th century They do the work of a telescope in a more compact form they take up less space The Royal Navy used telescopes but now all ships have heavy binoculars They can be mounted on swivels to scan the horizon Binoculars are also standard issue in all armies Night vision binoculars use photocathode electronics to intensify the image

Binoculars are also used for theatre birdwatching and amateur astronomy

These features are present in some or all binoculars

An odd number is an integer which is not a multiple of two If it is divided by two the result is a fraction One is the first odd positive number The next four bigger odd numbers are three five seven and nine You can tell if any decimal number is an odd number if the last digit is an odd number 

An integer that is not an odd number is an even number An even number is defined as a whole number that is a multiple of two If an even number is divided by two the result is another whole number On the other hand an odd number when divided by two will result in a fraction

Since odd and even numbers are defined only in reference to the set of integers all negative numbers can also be either odd or even

To find the set of odd natural numbers we use 2N1 where N is any natural number

Little is known about the physiology of sleep paralysis However some have suggested that it may be linked to post synaptic inhibition of nerves in the pons region of the brain In particular low levels of melatonin may stop the depolarization current in the nerves which stops stimulation of the muscles

Studies suggest that many people get sleep paralysis at least once in their lives People who have narcolepsy often get it much more Many people try to induce sleep paralysis to have an Out of Body Experience If you suffer from sleep paralysis you can change it into an enjoyable experience

Bronze is a metal alloy Bronze is mostly copper with some tin added 

Bronze was the first alloy that was used by humans The first nation that used Bronze was Egypt about 3500 years BC This gave the name for the Bronze Age

Bronze is stronger than copper or tin alone Bronze lasts longer than copper Pure copper is soon hurt by air and water When copper is hurt by air or water the copper turns green and falls apart

When people learned how to make and work iron the Bronze Age ended and the Iron Age started Iron can be made harder than bronze but is susceptible to corrosion Iron also wears away faster than bronze when different pieces are moving against each other Iron is very common and easy to make For this reason iron costs less than bronze This is the reason why iron is now used where bronze used to be used

Bronze is still used to make many parts of machines We choose to make a part out of bronze when it is important that the part last for a long time around water and air or that the part not wear away The main things that are made out of it are pump parts bearings bells electrical components gears valves and other things

Bronze parts are usually cast in a foundry After they are cast bronze parts can also be worked in a lathe or milling machine or drilled Bronze is not normally worked with a hammer like iron

When an alloy is called Bronze it usually means the alloy of copper and tin When two words are used to name an alloy and one of the words is Bronze this means that the alloy is made mostly from copper The other word tells us what other metal was combined with copper to make this alloy

Bronze should not be confused with Brass which is a different alloy of copper and Zinc

David is a statue by Michelangelo begun in 1501 and completed in 1504 It is made of marble and is 17 feet tall It is a statue of a shepherd David whose story is told in the Bible David fought a battle with a giant soldier called Goliath He beat Goliath by knocking him down with a small stone from his slingshot David later became King of Israel  

Michelangelo has carved the figure naked in the way that Ancient Roman statues of Classical Gods were often made He shows David before the fight just as he is looking at Goliath and planning what to do 

The statue was paid for by the wool workers of Florence To the people of the Republic of Florence David the teenage boy who fought a giant was a symbol of how a small fierce town could battle off powerful invaders David was a particularly important symbol to the wool workers as well because as a boy he took care of his fathers sheep and as a king he was like a shepherd to his people 

The statue of David is a symbol of the City of Florence and is Michelangelos most famous work of sculpture It is often called The David 

From about 1464 the members of the Wool Guild wanted to have twelve statues of people from the Old Testament of the Bible carved for the Florence Cathedral These statues were to go on the buttresses all around the outside walls high up near the roof Two statues had already been made by Donatello and his assistant Agostino di Duccio Duccio was asked to carve a statue of David He began carving the statues feet chest and a hole between the legs He stopped making the statue when his master Donatello died in 1466 Antonio Rossellino then worked on the statue for two years The block of stone was untouched for 25 years and was left in the cathedral workshop where it was getting damaged by the weather Michelangelo began working on David on September 13 1501 It was finished on September 8 1504

When it was finished the statue was placed in front of the entrance to the Palazzo Vecchio During 1873 it was moved to the Accademia Gallery in Florence to protect it from damage The statue currently attracts many visitors to the Accademia Gallery

In 1991 the statue of David was attacked by a person with a hammer Before the person with the hammer could be stopped damage was done to the toes of the left foot

The Dvorak keyboard is an alternative way of putting letters on an English keyboard Most English keyboards have the keys lined up in a QWERTY layout The point of QWERTY was to prevent typewriter keys from sticking but it is not the most ergonomic or comfortable keyboard to type on Augustine Dvorak invented the Dvorak keyboard where letters are arranged based on how often they are used For instance the most common letters are in the center row of keys so less hand movement is needed when a person is typing

Now that we use computers instead of typewriters there is no reason to keep the QWERTY keyboard except that everyone already learned to type using it Many Dvorak keyboard users think that more people should use the Dvorak keyboard as it aims to prevent typing injuries But most users are used to the QWERTY keyboard and do not want to switch

A staff is a long wooden pole often used in martial arts Sometimes a staff is used like a cane when not in combat

A martial art is any form of fighting and an art that has a set way of practice There are many martial arts that come from certain countries They are practiced for many reasons fighting self defense sport self expression discipline confidence fitness relaxing meditation A martial art is a style of combat in many instances directed towards the self defence In the common usage the word applies to the systems of combat developed in all the world

A person who does martial arts is called a martial artist

One common method is particularly in the Asian martial arts it is the form or kata Martial arts may be used for self defense combat and fitness

The idea of martial art appeared first time in English language in the edition of 1920 of the Takenobus Japanese English Dictionary as a translation of the word bu gei or bu jutsu what means art or solution of the military matters

In simple words the martial arts are fighting systems There are many schools and styles of martial arts but all share the same goal the self defence Some of them like taiji quan also can be used in order to improve health and the form as flowing of the qi

Some martial arts were not born in Asia For example savate had appeared in France and the movements of sport of the capoeira came from the Brazil

Many martial arts include punches kicks holds and throws weapons or certain combination of earlier mentioned elements

The martial arts are divided in two great sets the so called hard martial arts like karate and kickboxing which give special consideration to the attack for beat the opponent and the soft martial arts like the judo and the aikido which fight the opponent in the less aggressive method using the force of the other for surrender him

It is difficult to compare the effectiveness of the different existing arts Recently people developed competitions like the Ultimate Fighting Champions in the United States of America or Pancrase in Japan That competitions also are known as mixed martial arts or MMA Although that is yet to be seen the financial success or defeat of these ways

The martial arts are defined in this method through the history to the soldier in the battlefield the only thing that was important for them was beat the enemy that one have before himself Whether a style is soft or hard or how many points are gained with a blow are details and subjects of discussion which appear in periods of peace when there were hand to hand combats

The martial arts are the arts of the war If the main goal in a competition depends on noting points to somebodys advantage then we are not before a martial art but before a sport

The history of the martial arts is wide The act of developing of the fighting systems dates from when the man had been able to cause to pass the knowledge along with the strategies of war Part of the most ancient written material on the subject dates from the 15th century in Europe and the authorship fall to famous masters like Hans Talhoffer and George Silver Also transcriptions of still more ancient texts had been brought to our days one of them is a document written by hand That document is called I33 and dates from end of the 13th century

The persons who train martial arts disagree with relation to the matter of the competitions Some arts like the boxing or the Thai boxing give attending to the sparring fights during training  and to taking part in competitions yet the most common of aikido and krav maga reject the competitions The reasons that cause these opinions are different Many of the arts desiring to compete argue that the competitions give place to better and more efficient techniques However certain styles not desiring to compete claim that the rules with which people developed these competitions ruin the art and does not represent what can happen in a real situation

In recent years there have been tries to return to life some martial arts considered historical Examples of this historical reconstruction of the martial arts are the pankration and the school of Shaolin that have not a continua tradition

Gonads are the ovaries and testicles A male usually refers to his testes as gonads more than a female would refer to her ovaries as gonads

Jakob Ludwig Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy was a German composer

His grandfather was the German Jewish philosopher Moses Mendelssohn He was one of the great composers of the Romantic period He loved the music of earlier composers like Bach Handel and Mozart and he built on the traditions they had made Mendelssohn was a child prodigy He was already composing great music when he was a teenager He wrote music for orchestra piano organ as well as chamber music and music for singing His violin concerto is one of the most popular concertos ever written and is played by all the famous violinists Two of his tunes are known by almost everybody the hymn tune Hark the Herald Angels Sing and the Wedding March which is played so often at the end of weddings

Mendelssohns family had plenty of money They were also very interested in music literature painting etc His grandfather Moses Mendelssohn was famous in German national literature His father was a banker and his mother came from a family who owned a lot of factories in Berlin The young Felix was educated at home by his parents Although the family was Jewish his parents had Felix baptized and his father became a Christian a few years later The Mendelssohn family added the name of Bartholdy to their name at this time

Soon Felix was being taught by private tutors including Ludwig Berger who taught him the piano He also learned music theory and composition He played the piano at a concert when he was nine and started to compose little plays with music In 1821 he was taken to meet the famous writer Goethe in Weimar It was to be the first of several visits and Goethes way of thinking and his works of German literature had a big influence on the young Mendelssohn He composed several works at this time including Singspiels symphonies and chamber music He travelled with his father and met many famous musicians

In 1825 the family moved to Berlin They had regular concerts on Sunday mornings in their large house Many rich and famous people were invited to their private concerts In October 1825 he wrote a String Octet which is one of his best works He studied the music of Johann Sebastian Bach whose music people had almost forgotten He found the music of Bachs St Matthew Passion and conducted a performance of it in 1829 It was a famous performance in music history because people suddenly realized how great Bach was Bachs music has never been forgotten again since then

During the years 1829 to 1835 Mendelssohn traveled all over Europe He visited London several times and he also performed Beethovens Emperor Concerto there He travelled to Scotland where he sailed to Fingals Cave in the Hebrides This inspired him to write the overture called The Hebrides When he was returning the stagecoach had an accident and he hurt his knee He stayed with the composer Thomas Attwood for some time before he could return to Berlin Next he travelled to Italy where he wrote the Italian Symphony In Italy he met Hector Berlioz and on his way back he met Chopin

He spent some time in Dsseldorf where he performed several oratorios by Handel as well as his own music In Frankfurt am Main he stayed with a family who had two daughters He married one of them Ccile Charlotte Sophia Jeanrenaud in 1837 They had a happy marriage and had five children

Felix and his young wife went to live in Leipzig where he became the conductor of the famous Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra This was one of the highest musical jobs in Germany He conducted a lot of music by 18th century composers who had been forgotten He also gave the first performance of Schuberts Symphony in C major which had been discovered by Robert Schumann nine years after Schuberts death Mendelssohn got some of the most famous musicians to come to Leipzig and perform with the orchestra Clara Schumann Franz Liszt Anton Rubinstein the young violinist Joseph Joachim and the Swedish soprano Jenny Lind Mendelssohn improved the playing of the orchestra making them one of the best orchestras in the world He also made sure that the players were paid well

In the early 1840s Mendelssohn spent some time in Berlin The new king Friedrich Wilhelm IV King of Prussia was very keen on music and had lots of ideas about new plans for concerts He wanted Mendelssohn to be in charge of this The king wanted to see Greek plays performed and Mendelssohn had to write incidental music for the performances of Antigone 

In June 1842 Mendelssohn was twice received by Queen Victoria at her palace in London Mendelssohn thanked the Queen by dedicating his Scottish Symphony to her He continued to conduct in Leipzig and helped to make Berliozs music famous in Germany He became director of the new Conservatoire in Leipzig In Berlin the king asked him to provide incidental music for Shakespeares play A Midsummer Nights Dream He had already written some of this music 17 years earlier but now he finished it and performed it in 1843

During his last years Mendelssohn suffered from bad health He continued to work and travel as much as he could but after a stroke in 1849 he died in Leipzig aged 38 His body was taken by a special train to Berlin where he was buried near the grave of his sister Fanny

Mendelssohns most famous works are his 5 symphonies his concertos his overtures and his Incidental Music to A Midsummer Nights Dream which includes the famous Wedding March He wrote some very good chamber music string quartets and piano trios and two very famous oratorios Elijah and St Paul His piano music includes a large collection of short pieces called Songs without Words which many pianists like to play His organ music shows his love for JSBach often sounding more Baroque than Romantic After his death Mendelssohns music became less popular for a time This may have been because of the rise of anti semitism in the mid 19th century it may also have been because some musicians played Mendelssohns music in a rather delightful way But many great musicians saw his greatness and his music is well loved today

Watercolours also called watercolor or aquarelle are paintings whose colours are water based pigments These are coloured materials gained from earths rocks plants or chemicals dissolved in water and then dried into a powder in the form of cakes or tablets When water is added the powdered pigment becomes liquid again The pigment is applied to white paper or white card by brush or cloth or cotton wool and allowed to dry Unlike painting in oil based pigments a watercolour cannot be painted over without spoiling the colour whose purity depends on the white backing below Therefore each area of a watercolour painting is painted only once without alteration and appears fresh and original rather than worked over Watercolour painting is often used in Chinese Korean and Japanese paintings Fingerpainting with watercolours came from China

An expert system is a program running on a computer Like a human expert it knows a lot about a subject People can ask the expert system a question The expert system will then use a set of rules and give answers to the question This method of automatic reasoning belongs to a field of computer science called artificial intelligence

Different groups of people can have different kinds of access to an expert system The people managing the network of computers have different needs than the office worker or secretary

Expert systems can be found in the following places

Expert systems are made of

The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol or DHCP is a protocol related to computers and networks Very often it is abbreviated to DHCP It was made so that computers could get access to the network automatically To be able to access the Internet an IP address is needed The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol allows for this IP address to be obtained automatically Other data like a DNS Nameserver or a time server can also be obtained that way Finally computers that support it can even get a disk image they boot from over the network

The address can be dynamic or it can be static After a certain time the address lease has to be renewed

A Protocol or Communication Protocol is like a language used by computers to talk to each other The protocol says what part of the conversation comes at what time It also says how to end the communication

A mobile phone is a little portable radio telephone

The mobile phone can be used to communicate over long distances without wires It works by communicating with a nearby base station which connects it to the main phone network As the mobile phone moves around if the mobile phone gets too far away from the cell it is connected to that cell sends a message to another cell to tell the new cell to take over the call This is called a hand off and the call continues with the new cell the phone is connected to The hand off is done so well and carefully that the user will usually never even know that the call was transferred to another cell

As mobile phones became more popular they began to cost less money and more people could afford them Monthly plans allowing people available for rates as low as US30 or 40 a month Cell phones have become so cheap to own that they have mostly replaced pay phones and phone booths except for areas with a lot of people

As well as making voice calls mobile phones can be used for other things

People have wanted to make mobile phones for a long time but it took until the late 20th century for technology to make them possible

Although Dr Martin Cooper from Motorola made the first call using a mobile phone in 1973 this was not on a cellular mobile phone network as we use today

The first mobile phone networks were created in the late 1970s in Japan Now almost all urban areas and many country areas are covered by mobile phone networks

The mobile phone was created in Germany by Dennis Petro Mulakuliano Vogel

A cell phone has combined two technologies telephone and radio

Cell phones work as two way radios They send electromagnetic microwaves from base station to base station The waves are sent through antennas This is called wireless communication

There are two types of cell telephone networks

Most of the older cell phones use analog networks All modern phones use digital networks

Digital networks are also known as second generation or 2G technologies They differ either by technology or by speed The most used digital network is GSM It is used mainly in Europe and Asia while CDMA networks are mainly used in North America Other countries like Japan have different 2G technologies

The radio waves that the mobile phone networks use are split into different frequencies The frequency is measured in Hz Low frequencies can send the signal farther Higher frequencies provide better connections and the voice communications are generally clearer Four main frequencies are used around the world 850 900 1800 and 1900 MHz Europe uses 900 and 1800 MHz and North America uses 850 and 1900 MHz

Today there are mobile phones that work on two three or four frequencies The most advanced phones work on all frequencies They are called world phones and can be used everywhere

There are different kinds of phones A flip phone flips open and is best for calling A bar phone is shaped like a candybar and the keys and screen are on one face A slate phone is a phone that has almost no buttons and uses a touchscreen A slider phone slides on rails It can slide out number keys or a mini keyboard but some do both A swivel spins on an axle

When a mobile phone is switched on it connects to the nearest mobile phone base station Electronics in the base station check that the phone is allowed to use the network The base station covers what is called a cell and a phone can move between different cells but will only ever communicate with one cell at a time This is why mobile communications are sometimes called cellular communications

Once connected to a cell the mobile phone can make calls As the network knows that the phone is connected to that particular cell it can also route calls to the mobile phone Sometimes the connection to the cell is lost for example when using the subway This means the phone cannot make or receive calls until the connection is made again

The network is the company that provides the phone service In most areas there will be more than one mobile network Customers choose networks based on how well the different networks work in their area or by price

There are two main ways to pay for mobile phone calls

Some digital mobile phones need a separate microchip called a Subscriber Identity Module or SIM to work The SIM has information like the phone number and payment account and this is needed to make or receive calls The SIM may be supplied by the same company as the phone or a different one Sometimes you can change the network by using a SIM from another network but some companies do not want this to happen and they lock the phone so that you have to use their SIM This type of phone uses GSM signals

The others have a special radio inside them that only makes phone calls when the phone is activated When someone buys a contract the network gives them a code that if they enter it into the phone the phone will then make calls It is almost always impossible to switch to a different networks code on this type of phone This type of phone is called CDMA

The latest mobile phones are commonly referred to as smart phones These phones can be used for email browsing the internet playing music and games and many other functions that computers can perform This is because they basically are small computers Older phones also used computer technology but lacked many of the parts of a computer that were too big to fit into a phone Modern phone makers have been able to make computer parts small enough to fit inside a phone 

Advancements have also been made in the field of data communication Smart phones can send and receive data much faster than older phones The industry uses different standards to label the data transmission rates 2G was introduced in 1991 2G means 2nd Generation 2G phones transmit data at about the same speed as a 56kbps dial up modem would get 3G was introduced in 2002 3G phones vary in speed but range from about 200kbps to 14mbps This is comparable to a DSL or low end Cable Modems speed Most smart phones use 3G technology because 2G is not fast enough to practically use e mail internet and other data features A new Generation of technology is being introduced now called 4G 4G speeds are estimated to be as fast as 100mbps to 1gbps This would be as fast as some computer networks that use ethernet The newest smart phones use 4G technology

Nyx was the goddess of the night in Greek mythology She came out of Chaos

Her Roman equivalent was Nox

In his theogony Hesiod tells Night is born of Chaos her offspring are many and telling With Erebus Night gives birth to the following deities

Later on her own Night gives birth to 

In his description of Tartarus Hesiod says further that Hemera day who is now Nights sister rather than daughter left Tartarus just as Nyx entered it when Hemera returned Nyx left This mirrors the portrayal of Ratri night in the Rig Veda where she works in close cooperation but also tension with her sister Ushas dawn

Nyx had other children on her own These were

Hemera was the goddess of daylight in Greek mythology She was the daughter of Erebus and Nyx and the sister of Moros Charon Keres and the Nemesis Goddess of Retribution 

Hyginus listed Gaia Thalassa and Ouranos as Hemeras children While in Hesiods Theogony Hemera was not mother of Gaia nor Ouranos but mother of only Thalassa Hemera got Thalassa with her brother Aether 

Aether was the god of light in Greek mythology He was the son of Erebus but had no mother Aether was the Protogenos of the bright glowing upper air of heaven  the substance of light Above him lay the solid dome of the sky god Ouranos and below the transparent mists of earth bound air 

In the evening his mother Nyx drew her veil of darkness between the aither and the aer to bring night to man In the morn his sister wife Hemera dispersed these mists revealing the shining blue aither of day Night and day were regarded as quite independent of the sun in the ancient cosmogonies

Aither was one of the three airs The middle air was Aer or Khaos a colourless mist which enveloped the mortal world The lower air was Erebos the mists of darkness which enveloped the dark places beneath the earth and the realm of the dead The third was the upper air of aither the mist of light home of the gods of heaven It enveloped the mountain peaks clouds stars sun and moon The stars themselves were said to be formed from the concentrated fires of aither

His female counterpart was Aithre Titanis of the Clear Blue Sky mother of the Sun and Moon

The Keres are female death spirits in Greek mythology and were the daughters of Erebus and Nyx They look very dark and have sharp teeth claws and like the taste of blood The Keres look around battlefields for hurt people and people who are dying

Eris is the goddess of strife and discord in Greek mythology She is the daughter of Nyx but has no father She is the opposite of Harmonia who is the goddess of harmony

The Romans called her Discordia In Roman statues of Discordia and in other Roman art of her she looks scary and ugly and she is holding a knife

Nowadays there are some people who call themselves Discordians This idea comes from a book called Principia Discordia which was written by Greg Hill and Kerry Thornley in San Francisco in the year 1958 or 1959 The book says that Eris might not have been scary and ugly after all but that she was just misunderstood

The Principia Discordia describes the Discordian Society and its Goddess Eris as well as the basics of Discordianism

Geras is the god of age in Greek mythology His mother is Nyx but he has no father

Hypnos is the god of sleep in Greek mythology He is the son of Nyx and the twin brother of Thanatos the god of death

His sons are the Oneroi Morpheus Phobetor and Phantasos

Momus is the god of blame in Greek mythology His mother is Nyx but he has no father He was kicked out of Olympus after criticizing Zeus and Aphrodite

Moros is the god of fate in Greek mythology His mother is Nyx but he has no father sadly But still as the god of fate he decides what fate a person gets

Metis is the goddess of wisdom in Greek mythology She is one of the Titans and is the daughter of Oceanus and Tethys She was the mother of Athena

There is also a moon named after Metis

There are many stories about Athenas birth In Hesiods Theogony Zeus had sex with Metis but was then scared of her having a child because a prophecy had said that Metis would have children who were more powerful then Zeus To try and stop Metis having a child Zeus changed her into a fly and then swallowed her However Zeus was too late and Metis was already pregnant

When she was inside Zeus Metis made a helmet and a robe for her baby The hammering noise caused Zeus to have a headache To try and help Zeus with the pain Prometheus Hephaestus Hermes or Palaemon cut his head open with a Minoan axe Athena then came out of Zeuss head She was fully grown and had her armour on

Eos is the goddess of the dawn and a Titan in Greek mythology She is the daughter of Hyperion and Theia

She is the sister of Helios the sun god and Selene the moon goddess

Eos leaves her home which was at the edge of ocean every morning to wake her brother Helios She opens the gates of heaven so that Helios can ride his chariot across the sky each day

Selene is the goddess of the moon and a Titan in Greek mythology She is the daughter of Hyperion and Theia 

She later became one with the goddess Artemis In Roman mythology the moon goddess is called Luna Latin for moon The Roman Luna became one with Diana 

Like most moon deities Selene plays a fairly big role in her pantheon In the collection of poems called the Homeric hymns there is a Hymn to Selene used with the hymn to Helios in it Selene is called far winged a name ordinarily applied to birds Selene is also talked about in Nonnus Dionysiaca 48581 Pausanias 514 and Strabo 1416

The etymology of Selene is not known but if the word is from Greek it is probably connected to the word selas meaning light Boreion Selas is the Greek name for Aurora Borealis The word selenology the study of the geology of the Moon comes from her name The chemical element Selenium was also named after Selene 

In post Renaissance art Selene is shown as a beautiful woman with a pale face She is sometimes riding a silver chariot pulled by oxen or a pair of horses Often she is shown riding a horse or bull wearing robes and a half moon on her head and carrying a torch

In the old pre Olympian genealogy of the gods Helios the sun is Selenes brother after her brother Helios finishes his trip across the sky Selene freshly washed in the waters of the Earth circling Ocean begins her own trip as night falls upon the earth which becomes lit from the light of her head and golden crown When she is growing after mid month it is a sure token and a sign to mortal men Her sister Eos is goddess of the dawn Eos also carried off a human lover Cephalus which is like a myth of Selene and Endymion

Anna Kavan was an English writer

Her early work comprising six novels gave little indication of the style and content of her post 1939 writing The change of her name to the nom de plume Anna Kavan in 1940 signalled an experimental form focussed on the nocturnal language of dreams and addiction

I Am Lazarus is a collection of short stories that address the disturbing unreality of mental illness particularly as a result of war related post traumatic stress disorder

Kavan travelled extensively during the Second World War spending 22 months in New Zealand That countrys proximity to Antarctica informed her writing of Ice  the post apocalyptic novel which won her the Brian Aldiss Science Fiction Book of the Year award in 1967 

Kavans biographical details have until recently been vague and sketchy but recent discoveries of letters and unpublished manuscripts have shed revealing light on her life and times Dr Jennifer Sturm of Auckland University has made a recent study of Kavans writing and has unearthed significant validation of her biographical details Kavan is currently enjoying something of a belated interest London publishers Peter Owen Publishers have for many years flown the Kavan flag and continue to do so with the recent re release of Ice and a forthcoming publication of Guilty a new posthumous release of Kavans work 

The word Voodoo which has many different names and spellings is the name of a West African religion Voodoo is animist and spiritist and a lot of Voodoo beliefs have to do with ancestor spirits Some of it is based on Catholic beliefs but most of Voodoo is from the Fon Ewe and Yoruba peoples The word vodn is the Fon Ewe word for spirit 

In Voodoo many gods and spirits are prayed to or called on Both spirits of nature and of dead people are important The spirits of family member who have died are especially important Voodoo often has rituals with music and dancing Drums are used to make most of this music In Voodoo people often believe that a spirit is in their body and controlling the body Having a spirit come into is wanted and important This spirit can speak for the gods or dead people you love and can also help to heal or do magic

Voodoo came to places like Haiti and the United States as Vodu Some people think Voodoo and Vodu are the same religion Some people think they are not the same religion because Voodoo has changed some after it was taken from Africa For example African Vodu often has animal sacrifice but this is not common in Haiti and never done in the United States Another example is that an African sea god became a Haitian sea Goddess Voodoo in Haiti and America has also added some Catholic ideas that were not known in African Vodu

Voodoo is an important religion in Haiti When Haiti beat the French in a war and became its own country the people of Haiti believed that Voodoo had helped them win Also in Haiti there are both good priests and dark sorcerers The bokor acts like a kind of religious policeman and may curse bad people It is the bokor who are said to make zombies becoming a zombie is the worst curse because it means a person loses their soul

Voodoo originally entered the United States via immigrants from Africa and Haiti such as Marie LaVeau the Voodoo queen of New Orleans Marie was a pacifist and known for healing people Though unprecedented the local Catholic priest let Marie practice Voodoo in the Catholic church and as a result she became famous leading many in Louisiana to believe in Voodoo

In most parts of the US Voodoo is primarily practiced by African descendants who follow the teachings as part of a family heritage Louisiana however which is the US state with the most Voodoo believers the belief system has attracted a number of caucasian followers as well

People fear the unknown and as most people do not know much about Voodoo it is used to frighten and its practices are portrayed as evil Voodoo is shown in many horrorsuspense movies and has come into American pop culture through music movies art and many other mediums

Like many other religions and practices people learn about Voodoo and Hoodoo through movies and TV shows where it has gained the popularity it has today as a form of entertainment Hoodoo was showcased in the 2005 horror suspense movie The Skeleton Key starring Kate Hudson and in the upcoming 2009 Disney movie The Princess and the Frog Zombies are a large part of popular horror culture and they originated in Voodoo folklore from the original word nbzambi which refers to the primary sprit andor to ones soul There are four types of zombies in Voodoo the Great Spirit the Spiritual Soul the Herbal Zombie and the Bargained Zombieeach type is created differently Zombies of Voodoo folklore do not come to be from a zombie bite it is a large misconception

Zombies are portrayed as monsters and are in plays and many movies including the 2009 release of Zombieland and the 2004 movie Shaun of the Dead both horror comedies 

Just as there is Christian music there was music that came from Voodoo rituals which influenced jazz and many of the original jazz players are rumored to have had a connection to Voodoo in some way including Jelly Roll Morton and Louis Armstrong Storyville a district in New Orleans was a place where at night Jazz was played and Hoodoo was sold There jazz thrived and pulsed with the voices and instruments of Jelly Roll Sweet Emma Barrett and many others There are many songs and albums that reference Voodoo andor Hoodoo either in the title or in the actual song such as in David Bowies song Magic Dance with the lyric You remind me of the babe What babe The babe with the power What power The power of the hoodoo Hoodoo You do Do what Remind me of the babe Another example is Rob Zombie who started the band White Zombie

There are many books on the subject of Voodoo and Hoodoo such as How Tos and folk tales One of the most famous books incorporating these themes is The Serpent And The Rainbow by Wade Davis which is also a movie though the author was very displeased with the result A list of books can be found here

Many people enjoy partaking in Voodoo and Hoodoo practices such as buying love potions and casting or having spells casted for them that promise luck money health or success While some only do it for the fun of it many take it seriously as it is a religion Hoodoo can be used for harm but that is adverse to how it is supposed to be used as Voodoo is not an evil religion by any means

Hephaestus married his own Sister Aphrodite When Aphrodite was born Zeus feared that the gods would battle over her hand in marriage so Zeus arranged that Aphrodite would marry Hephaestus Hephaestus gave Aphrodite his best creations and even gave her a magic girdle that made her irresistible to men Hephaestus was well liked by all of the Olympians He was not involved in their plots Hephaestus preferred to be alone in his workshop Hephaestus was also worshiped by the Greeks because he proved that those who labor are also noble Hephaestus reminds us of the value and dangers of losing our selves in work 

Vulcan is the god of fire in Roman mythology His Greek equivalent was the god Hephaestus He is the son of Jupiter and Juno and the husband of Venus

Vulcan was born extremly ugly His mother Juno tried to throw him off a cliff but failed to kill her son Instead she put him in a volcano and told him to stay there for the rest of his young life Little did she know that her young boy would grow to be a very talented blacksmith for all the gods and goddesses of Olympus

Vulcan made thrones for the other gods to sit on in Mount Etna Through his identification with the Hephaestus of Greek mythology he came to be considered as the manufacturer of art arms iron jewellery and armor for various gods and heroes including the thunderbolts of Jupiter He was the son of Jupiter and Juno and husband of Maia and Venus His smithy was believed to be underneath Mount Etna in Sicily

Vulcan had a happy childhood with dolphins as his playmates and pearls as his toys Late in his childhood he found the remains of a fishermans fire on the beach and became fascinated with an un extinguished coal still red hot and glowing

Vulcan carefully shut this precious coal in a clamshell and took it back to his underwater grotto and made a fire with it On the first day after Vulcan stared at this fire for hours on end On the second day he discovered that when he made the fire hotter with bellows certain stones sweated iron silver or gold On the third day he beat the cooled metal into shapes bracelets chains swords and shields Vulcan made pearl handled knives and spoons for his foster mother he made a silver chariot for himself and bridles so that seahorses could transport him quickly He even made slave girls of gold to wait on him and do his bidding

Later Thetis left her underwater grotto to attend a dinner party on Mount Olympus wearing a beautiful necklace of silver and sapphires which Vulcan had made for her Juno admired the necklace and asked as to where she could get one Thetis became flustered causing Juno to become suspicious and at last the queen god discovered the truth the baby she had once rejected had grown into a talented blacksmith

Juno was furious and demanded that Vulcan return home a demand that he refused However he did send Juno a beautifully constructed chair made of silver and gold inlaid with mother of pearl Juno was delighted with this gift but as soon as she sat in it her weight triggered hidden springs and metal bands sprung forth to hold her fast The more she shrieked and struggled the more firmly the mechanical throne gripped her the chair was a cleverly designed trap

For three days Juno sat fuming still trapped in Vulcans chair she could not sleep she could not stretch she could not eat It was Jupiter who finally saved the day he promised that if Vulcan released Juno he would give him a wife Venus the goddess of love and beauty Vulcan agreed and married Venus He later built a smithy under Mount Etna on the island of Sicily It was said that whenever Venus is unfaithful Vulcan grows angry and beats the red hot metal with such a force that sparks and smoke rise up from the top of the mountain to create a volcanic eruption

According to Virgil Vulcan was the father of Caeculus12

To punish mankind for stealing the secrets of fire Jupiter ordered the other gods to make a poisoned gift for man Vulcans contribution to the beautiful and foolish Pandora was to mould her from clay and to give her form He also made the thrones for the other gods on Mount Olympus

Vulcans oldest shrine in Rome called the Volcanal was at the foot of the Capitoline in the Forum Romanum and was reputed to date to the archaic period of the kings of Rome23 and to have been established on the site by Titus Tatius4 the Sabine co king with a traditional date in the eighth century BC It was the view of the Etruscan haruspices that a temple of Vulcan should be outside the city5 and the Volcanal may originally have been on or outside the city limits before they expanded to include the Capitoline Hill1 The Volcanalia sacrifice was offered here to Vulcan on August 232 Vulcan also had a temple on the Campus Martius which was in existence by 214 BC16The Romans identified Vulcan with the Greek smith god Hephaestus and he became associated like his Greek counterpart with the constructive use of fire in metalworking A fragment of a Greek pot showing Hephaestus found at the Volcanal has been dated to the 6th century BC suggesting that the two gods were already associated at this date3 However Vulcan had a stronger association than Hephaestus with fires destructive capacity and a major concern of his worshippers was to encourage the god to avert harmful fires His festival the Vulcanalia was celebrated on August 23 each year when the summer heat placed crops and granaries most at risk of burning17 During the festival bonfires were created in honour of the god into which live fish or small animals were thrown as a sacrifice to be consumed in the place of humans8 Vulcan was among the gods placated after the Great Fire of Rome in AD 649 In response to the same fire Domitian established a new altar to Vulcan on the Quirinal Hill At the same time a red bull calf and red boar were added to the sacrifices made on the Vulcanalia at least in that region of the city10

Vulcans blacksmith workshop was said to be below Mount Etna in Sicily Italy Each year on August 23 the festival of Vulcanalia is held During the festival fish and small animals are thrown into the fire

Greenhouse gases reflect radiation from the Earth and stop it from being lost into space This causes the Earths temperature to be higher than it would be without greenhouse gases The name for this is the greenhouse effect

Most greenhouse gases are natural  water vapor is the most common and causes most of the greenhouse effect on Earth Other greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide Chlorofluorocarbon and ozone A natural greenhouse effect is not bad Without greenhouse gases the earth would be on average 33 degrees Celsius colder and life would probably not be possible on Earth for heat is important for life forms 

However humans are adding too much more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere Mainstream Science believes that this has caused the planets average temperature to rise by causing the greenhouse effect The most important greenhouse gas that humans add to the atmosphere is carbon dioxide which there is less than 1 in the atmosphere Carbon dioxide is released when people burn fossil fuels like oil coal and natural gas This is done for transportation energy and industries 

Water vapour is the most abundant of these gases but merely reacts to climate change In other words when the atmosphere is warm there is more water vapour Thus there is a higher possibility of clouds and precipitation 

In addition to burning fossil fuels human beings add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by cutting down treesWe also add methane to the atmosphere by raising cattle and other farm animals such as geese turkeys pigs chickens and sheep Human activity adds water vapor to the atmosphere through increased evaporation by the use of cooling towers in thermal cycle power plants or creation of artificial lakes These activities contribute to global warming

Although global warming is a world wide danger there are some proof and evidence that global warming would be occurring with or without humans creating greenhouse gas emissions This is because there are natural causes that us humans have no control over These include the sun spots are exploding therefore raising the heat large eruptions in the major volcanoes on the earth which increases gases and this is damaging plants the orbit the Earth takes has changed  movement to or from the sun the Earth is different when compared to how it sits near the sun changes the temperature up or down meteors caused explosions as they made contact with the Earth Earths absorption of solar radiation and heat energy that is emitted by the sun This in turn will make temperature rise and get higher on the top surfaces of the earth

In Ancient Australia the first people to live in Australia arrived between 42000 and 48000 years ago They came from Asia and had dark skin and black hair Most of them were hunter gatherers and nomadic This meant that they walked around from place to place and did not make cities

There were two main types of people living in Australia  the Aborigines and the Torres Strait Islanders Together they are called Indigenous Australians The Torres Strait Islanders lived in the north east and the Aborigines lived everywhere else They lived in separate tribes and each tribe had its own language and traditions They also thought that families were very important 

They had a strong religion They believed that everything had come from the Dreamtime and that the earth was sacred They believed that spirits such as the Rainbow Serpent had made the world The religion was passed on from parents to children and their culture is famous for its oral history They practiced their religion in the form of corroborees These were important dances and songs about their religion They worshiped many gods They believed that the rainbow serpent made all the water come

The Aboriginal people did not know writing but they painted pictures on rocks and bark They used paint that they made from crushed rocks and water in colours like brown red orange and yellow They used symbols to mean different things and could draw stories with them Their art is famous for using dots and handprints

In Australian Aboriginal religion the Dreamtime also called The Dreaming had four parts The beginning of everything the life and power of the ancestors the way of life and death and power in life Dreamtime was all four of these things at the same time because it is more powerful than time and space In it all things exist at once The Aboriginal peoples call Dreamtime the all at once time because they think it is the past present and future at the same time

They meet The Dreamtime by doing special dances and singing special songs Aboriginals believe that people have a part of them that will live forever This part existed before a person was born and will exist after they die It exists in The Dreamtime All Australian Aboriginals believe in the Dreamtime Each tribe has stories that say things about it Most Aboriginals believe that all life is connected to the great spirit ancestors of the Dreamtime

The expression Dreamtime is often used to describe the time before time or the time of the creation

The Loch Ness Monster more often called Nessie is a supposed animal said to live in the Scottish loch of Loch Ness the second biggest loch in the country The Loch Ness Monster story was big in the field of cryptozoology 

Most scientists believe that the Loch Ness Monster is not real and they say that many of the seeings are either hoaxes or pictures of other mistaken existing animals However a popular theory among believers is that Nessie is a plesiosaur an extinct meat eating aquatic reptile that lived in the Mesozoic era The Loch Ness monster has also been described as an elephant eel and other creatures

The Surgeons photograph was the only photographic evidence of a head and neck all the others are humps or disturbances Dr Wilson claimed he was looking at the loch when he saw the monster so grabbed his camera and snapped five photos After the film was developed only two exposures were clear The first photo shows what was claimed to be a small head and back The second one a blurry image attracted little publicity because it was difficult to interpret what was depicted 

The image was revealed as a hoax in 1994 Supposedly taken by Robert Kenneth Wilson a London gynaecologist it was published in the Daily Mail on 21 April 1934 Wilsons refusal to have his name associated with the photograph led to it being called Surgeons photograph 

The strangely small ripples on the photo fit the size and of circular pattern of small ripples as opposed to large waves when photographed up close Analysis of the original uncropped image fostered further doubt A year before the hoax was revealed the makers of Discovery Communicationss documentary Loch Ness Discovered analysed the uncropped image and found a white object was visible in every version of the photo It seems to be the source of ripples in the water almost as if the object was towed by something the narrator said But science cannot rule out it was just a blemish on the negative he continued Additionally analysis of the full photograph revealed the object was quite small only about convert60to90cmft0abbron long 

After Christian Spurlings confession most agree it was what Spurling claimed a toy submarine with a sculpted head attached Details of how the photo was accomplished were published in the 1999 book Nessie the Surgeons Photograph Exposed Essentially it was a toy submarine with a head and neck made of plastic wood built by Christian Spurling

Spurling was the son in law of Marmaduke Wetherell a big game hunter who had been publicly ridiculed in the Daily Mail the newspaper that employed him Spurling claimed that to get revenge Marmaduke Wetherell committed the hoax His co conspirators were Spurling his son Ian Marmaduke who bought the material for the fake Nessie and Maurice Chambers Chambers asked surgeon Robert Kenneth Wilson to offer the pictures to the Daily Mail 

The hoax story was disputed by Henry Bauer Unfortunately for Bauer he claimed that plastic wood did not exist in 1934 when actually it was a popular DIY and modelling material from the 1920s 

No animal has ever been discovered in the loch which resembles the mythical monster

The Master Race was an idea used by Adolf Hitler and others to say that one race of people were better than others

This idea mostly began in the 19th century It is not a theory liked by any scientists today It claims there is a hierarchy of races It was also claimed that at the bottom of the hierarchy were black skinned people from Africa and Aborigines from Australia while pale skinned Nordic people were at the top of the hierarchy 

Arthur de Gobineau believed that cultures become bad when races mix Arthur Schopenhauer liked with this idea He said that the White race had become what it was though hardship and bad conditions in the North Others who liked the theory were Guido von List Lanz von Liebefels and Houston Steward Chamberlain

Hitler and his supporters the Nazi party took power in Germany in 1933 They were Social Darwinists meaning they thought that one race was superior and would win over all the others The Nazis made laws that were based on their ideas of race They claimed that Aryans were the master race called Aryanization They also made propaganda that blamed Jews for many things German Jews were forbidden to own property and were attacked and killed When Germany invaded other countries in Europe they also started putting people into concentration camps This systematic killing is known as The Holocaust today

To help increase the numbers of Aryans the Nazis set up special homes called Lebensborn These were for unmarried pregnant woman who were likely to have children that had Nordic qualities Heinrich Himmler believed that this would help create the master race He arranged for nine Lebensborn homes to be built in Germany and another ten in Norway There were also Lebensborn in France Belgium and Luxembourg About 20000 children were born in these homes during the Third Reich

The Sistine Chapel is a large chapel in the Vatican Palace the place in Italy where the Pope lives The Chapel was built between 1473 and 1481 by Giovanni dei Dolci for Pope Sixtus IV 

The Sistine Chapel is the Popes own chapel It is used for important Masses and ceremonies When a pope dies the College of Cardinals meet in the Sistine Chapel to elect a new pope 

The Sistine Chapel is famous for its fresco paintings by the Renaissance painter Michelangelo

The Sistine Chapel is a brick building shaped like a rectangle The outside is plain with no decoration and no big door It has a walk way near the top for soldiers It has six arched windows on its two side walls and a curved ceiling called a barrel vault 

The inside of the chapel is richly decorated The floor is of coloured marble The lower parts of the walls are painted to look like gold and silver cloth 

The other decorations in the chapel are paintings which tell stories to help people understand about Jesus Christ and about the Roman Catholic Church 

The middle part of the walls has 12 large paintings called frescoes done by famous artists in 1481 The artists names were Domenico Ghirlandaio Sandro Botticelli Perugino Cosimo Rosselli Pinturicchio Benedetto Ghirlandaio Luca Signorelli and Bartolomeo della Gatta The frescoes show stories from the Bible On the north side the stories are about the life of Moses On the south side they are about the life of Jesus 

Above the stories near the windows are painted pictures of Popes

The ceiling is the most famous part of the Sistine Chapel and many thousands of visitors go to see it In 1505 Pope Julius II asked Michelangelo to paint the ceiling Michelangelo was a famous sculptor He did not want to be a painter Three years later he agreed to paint the ceiling He worked from 1508 to 1511 standing on a high platform with his arms stretched above his head Because he painted onto wet plaster the smell and the heat was terrible He wrote a poem about how sick he was 

Along the centre of the ceiling are painted nine pictures that tell stories from the Book of Genesis in the Old Testament of the Bible The stories start with three pictures of God making light making the Earth the Sun and the Moon and making the Sea and Sky 

The next three pictures tell the story of the first man and woman Adam and Eve In the first scene God has just made Adam He reaches out his hand and touches his finger to give him Life 

In the next picture Adam is asleep and God makes Eve from one of Adams ribs 

In the third picture there are two scenes Adam and Eve are tricked by the Devil to eat fruit from the tree that they have been told not to touch In the other scene an angel chases them out of Gods Garden of Eden This story tells how sin came into the world 

The last three pictures are about Noahs Ark They tell about a sad and sinful world Because of human sin and unkindness God sends a flood Only Noah and his family escape in the large boat that they build When the flood has ended they make an altar and kill a sheep as a sacrifice to God But then Noah grows grape vines makes wine and gets drunk One of his sons sees Noah lying naked and laughs at his father Noah is ashamed and curses his son These stories show how people keep acting the wrong way even when they get a second chance 

All around the wall Michelangelo painted twelve big figures of wise men and women These were the prophets and sibyls who told people that God would send Jesus Christ to save them from sin 

Also painted on the ceiling are 20 beautiful young men called the ignudi No one knows what they are for sure but perhaps they are angels 

When the ceiling was finally uncovered everyone was amazed Giorgio Vasari who wrote Mchelangelos life story says that hundreds of people came every day to stare and stare

Michelangelo was happy to get back to his sculpture But in 1537 Pope Paul III ordered him to paint another large fresco This time it was on the wall above the altar It was finished in 1541

Michelangelo painted The Last Judgement which shows Jesus judging the people of the Earth and sending some to Hell while others are welcomed into Heaven by Saints He painted most of the figures naked This made some of the priests in the church very angry They paid another artist to paint clothes onto the Blessed Virgin Mary and many of the other figures

Macbeth is a play by William Shakespeare Shakespeare wrote three types of plays histories comedies and tragedies and Macbeth is the shortest tragedy written by Shakespeare It was written between 1603 and 1607 during the reign of King James I of England

Shakespeare based some characters in the play roughly on records of real people in Holinsheds Chronicles a history book from 1587 However the things that happen in the play are very different from what happened in real life 

Macbeth is one of Shakespeares most popular plays and has often been acted since his time in theatres and movies There have also been several comic books and novels written based on the story of the play 

The first characters we see in the play are the three Witches They talk to each other in a mysterious way and agree to meet with Macbeth on the heath This scene includes the famous line fair is foul and foul is fair a subject which becomes a main part of the play 

In Act I Scene ii there is a war going on King Duncan is at a camp near Forres listening to reports from the battlefield An injured officer is brought in He saved Malcolms life The officer tells Duncan about the battle He says that it was going badly until Macbeth fought his way to the rebel leader Macdonwald and disembowelled him But as soon as that happened the Norweyans led by their king Sweno also attacked They were joined by a traitor the Thane of Cawdor Macbeth and Banquo fought bravely until they were defeated Duncan is pleased by the news He orders that the Thane of Cawdor be executed and his title given to Macbeth

In Iiii the Witches appear again They talk about using their powers on humans and it becomes clear that they have a lot of power but they cannot kill people Macbeth and Banquo are returning from the battlefield to Forres and meet the witches Banquo is amazed by the way the witches look because they look like women but they have beards Macbeth is not afraid and asks them what they are They do not answer him but greet him as the Thane of Glamis the Thane of Cawdor and the future King Macbeth is surprised because he knows that he is not the Thane of Cawdor and does not think he will ever become the King Banquo asks the witches what his future will be like They answer in riddles saying that he will be lesser than Macbeth and greater not so happy yet much happier and that he will be the father to a line of kings Then the witches disappear 

Ross and Angus come to find Macbeth and tell him that the King has given him the title of Thane of Cawdor Macbeth is surprised and happy but he starts thinking of ways to become king This frightens him because he thinks that the only way he can become king is to murder Duncan

In Iiv Macbeth and Banquo return to Forres and Duncan thanks them for their courage and hard work He also says that his son Malcolm will be his heir Macbeth realizes that he will have to get past both Duncan and Malcolm to become king Duncan says he is going to Macbeths castle for the night 

In Iv Lady Macbeth is reading a letter from Macbeth that tells her about the witches and their prophecy She is very excited and starts planning to murder Duncan A messenger tells her that Duncan will be staying at their castle that night She calls on evil spirits to make her strong and evil so that she can murder Duncan Macbeth comes in and she tells him of her plans

Iv shows Duncan Banquo Donalbain Malcolm Macduff and some of the thanes entering Macbeths castle Duncan and Banquo agree that the castle is sweet and pleasant Lady Macbeth enters and greets them

Ivii is the last scene in Act I Macbeth is talking to himself about why it is wrong to kill the king He knows that it is a bad thing to do especially because he is the host and Duncan trusts him Lady Macbeth enters and scolds him for being a coward and says that he is not brave enough to be a man She works out how they are going to kill Duncan and convinces Macbeth to do it

Act II starts with Banquo and his son Fleance walking in a courtyard in Macbeths castle They meet Macbeth who lies to Banquo and says that he has not thought about the witches prophecy When they leave Macbeth sees a hallucination of a knife He knows it is not real but before his sight it changes and becomes covered in blood He leaves to kill Duncan

Lady Macbeth enters in scene ii She has already made Duncans guards drunk Macbeth comes in with his hands covered in blood carrying the knifes of the guards He is very troubled Lady Macbeth comforts him and tells him to wash his hands and cover the guards with blood so it looks like they did it But Macbeth is afraid so Lady Macbeth does it instead

In IIiii the porter is very drunk He pretends to be the porter of the gate of hell and takes a long time to open the gate for Macduff and Lennox Macbeth greets them Macduff says that he is there to wake the king and Macbeth leads him to the kings room Macduff is shocked to see the king murdered on his bed He runs out shouting and wakes everybody up Macbeth pretends he did not know about the murder as everyone comes to see what is happening He admits that he killed the guards and says that he did it because he was so angry that they killed Duncan Lady Macbeth faints and they rush to help her Malcolm and Donalbain think that somebody is lying They know it is not safe for them to stay in Scotland so they run away Malcolm goes to England and Donalbain to Ireland

Scene iv is a talk between Ross and an old man They talk about how strange the night was Nature seems to have turned into a mess now that Duncan is dead Macduff comes in and says that Macbeth is going to become king He does not trust Macbeth and is not going to the coronation

Banquo is alone on stage at the start of Act III He realizes that Macbeth has become everything the witches said he would become He thinks that Macbeth did wrong to get the crown but he does not want to say anything He hopes that his son will also be king as the witches said Macbeth Lady Macbeth and the lords enter Macbeth asks Banquo if he is going riding that afternoon and if Fleance is going with him Banquo says yes to both Two men come to see Macbeth and he goes to meet them He is angry that he has risked everything to become king but that Banquos sons will be kings after him The men are actually murderers Macbeth tells them that Banquo is the reason they are unhappy and have bad lives and convinces them to kill Banquo and Fleance

Macbeth talks to Lady Macbeth in scene ii He says that he has nightmares and cannot sleep He is jealous of Duncan because he is dead and does not need to worry anymore Macbeth also says that he is worried about Banquo being alive but he does not tell his wife about the murderers

In IIIiii the two murderers meet another one also sent by Macbeth They kill Banquo but Fleance escapes

Scene iv has Macbeth at a banquet with the nobles The murderers come in and inform him of Banquos death and Fleances escape He returns to the table where the nobles are eating and looks for a seat Even though there is one empty he cannot see it He has a vision of the murdered Banquo sitting in his seat and becomes hysterical talking to the vision Lady Macbeth explains it to the nobles as an illness and asks them to leave as Macbeth becomes more and more upset

Many editors say that scene v of Act III along with a song in IVi is not written by Shakespeare This is because the writing is different to the way Shakespeare usually writes It has a witch called Hecate in it who is not previously mentioned in the play She seems to be in charge of the other witches and is scolding them for dealing with Macbeth without informing her

In the final scene Lennox is talking to another lord They find out that Macduff has gone to England to convince Malcolm to return and claim his throne and to ask for the help of King Edward of England

The play ends when Macduff kills Macbeth

Many actors think it is bad luck to say the word Macbeth and will not say the plays name Instead they call it The Scottish Play One theory about where this superstition came from is that the play deals with witchcraft

Loves Labours Lost is a comedy play by William Shakespeare which was written between 1588 and 1597

The Pieta is a statue by Michelangelo It is now in the first temple on the right of Saint Peters Basilica in the Vatican City

The following are other statues by Michelangelo

Raffaello Sanzio usually known as Raphael was a Renaissance painter and architect With Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo he is one of the greatest painters of the High Renaissance

He is best known for his paintings of the Madonna and Christ Child and for his paintings in the Vatican in Rome Italy 

Raphael was born in Urbino in the region of Umbria Italy He was the son of Giovanni Santi who was also a painter and Magia di Battista Ciarla Giovanni Santi was Raphaels first teacher but he died when Raphael was only eleven

While about 15 Raphael became an apprentice at the workshop of the painter Pietro Perugino called by that name because he was the most famous painter in the town of Perugia Perugino was famous not only in Umbria but also in Rome and in Florence the home of Leonardo and Michelangelo He had been one of the artists given the important job of painting the Popes large chapel in the Vatican the Sistine Chapel

Perugino was known to have expert ways of painting and was good at getting paintings finished on time which made him popular with his patrons He painted some portraits but most of his pictures are religious Some of his paintings are small pictures of the Madonna and Child that could be used in a family chapel for private worship But because he was famous Perugino also got lots of work from wealthy patrons and from churches so he painted many very large pieces to go above the altar in church To do this he needed the help of his apprentices 

Raphael was able to learn a great deal from Perugino  drawing the anatomy of the human figure paint chemistry and the technique of putting the paint onto the picture in smooth layers The figures in Peruginos paintings often have very sweet gentle faces Many of Raphaels paintings are also sweet and gentle Some painters such as Leonardo were quick to change their style and make their paintings show their own touch But Raphael continued to paint in the style that Perugino taught him He added to this new ideas that he learnt by looking at the work of other artists Unlike Leonardo and Michelangelo Raphael did not give the world anything new in the Art of Painting He is famous simply because he was so expert at what he did and because people loved his paintings so much

The painting that is thought to be his earliest known work is a small picture called The Vision of a Knight In this painting a knight lies asleep In his dream there are two beautiful women One woman dressed in soft flowing clothes offers him flowers The other woman dressed in dark clothing offers the knight a sword and a book The path behind the pretty woman runs beside a river The other path leads up a steep mountain Raphael was thinking about choices Should the knight take the easy road or should he try to change things

Other early pictures by Raphael are Three Graces and Saint Michael

Raphaels first major work was The Marriage of the Virgin which was painted in 1504 It was influenced by Peruginos painting for the Sistine Chapel of Jesus giving the Keys to Saint Peter It is now in the Brera Gallery in Milan Italy

In about 1504 Raphael went with another painter Pinturicchio to Florence Italy Florence was famous for its artworks its artists workshops its new Renaissance buildings and its huge cathedral Raphael wanted to see the work of Michelangelo Leonardo da Vinci and other important painters and sculptors

Florence had a very strong tradition of making images of the Madonna and Child because the city was dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary On almost every street corner there was a painting or a brightly coloured statue of the Madonna and Child

While he was in Florence Raphael painted many of his famous Madonna paintings The most famous of these paintings are

In 1508 Raphael was called to Rome by Pope Julius II He became so popular whilst he was in Rome that he was known as the Prince of Painters He spent the last 12 years of his life in Rome and created many of his most famous paintings

While he was in Rome he was commissioned to paint a fresco of the Prophet Isaiah in the Church of SantAgostino While he was working on the painting he went to visit his friend the architect Donato Bramante Bramante was at the Vatican while Michelangelo was painting the Sistine Chapel ceiling Of course Raphael wanted to see what the famous master was doing While Michelangelo was away Bramante took Raphael into the Chapel When Raphael saw the way that Michelangelo had painted the prophets he was so excited that he went back to SantAgostinos Church scraped his painting off the wall and started all over again It is easy to see that Raphaels painting is in the style of Michelangelo Raphael was not ashamed of this He did it to give honour to the great master 

Among Raphaels most famous paintings are the frescos that are painted on the walls of Julius IIs own rooms in the Vatican Palace known as the Stanze The paintings in the Stanza della Segnatura and the Stanza dEliodoro were created by Raphael himself whilst the Stanza dellIncendio was designed by Raphael and painted by his assistants

One of the frescoes in the Stanza della Segnatura is of the greatest importance This painting is called The School of Athens It shows a group of learned people from Ancient Greece philosophers poets dramatists mathematicians and others They are listening to the central figure who is the philosopher Plato The painting is meant to show that at that time the early 1500s there was a new birth of ideas and learning among the people of Rome that was equal to the learning of Ancient Athens

To make this message clear Raphael used the faces of the people that he knew Michelangelo with his broken nose is sitting with his chin on his hand The tall figure of Plato with long hair and flowing beard is a portrait of Leonardo da Vinci

One of the excellent things about this painting is the way that Raphael has painted the building in which the figures are standing The architecture looks as if it is opening up from the real room

In the 1500s painters were often asked to design architecture Raphaels first work as an architect was the funeral chapel in the church of Santa Maria del Popolo Pope Leo X also chose Raphael to help design Saint Peters Basilica alongside Donato Bramante After Bramante died Raphael took over the designing of the basilica and changed its groundplan from a Greek Cross to a Latin Cross Michelangelo went back to Bramantes plan but made it simpler Then another architect Maderna made the building longer as Raphael had planned

Raphaels last work of art was a painting of the Transfiguration This was an altarpiece but Raphael died before he could complete it It was instead finished by Giulio Romano who was one of Raphaels assistants

Raphael died on his 37th birthday and was buried in the Pantheon in Rome His funeral mass was celebrated at the Vatican and his Transfiguration altarpiece was put at the head of Raphaels funeral carriage 

A non governmental organization is a group of people from different countries acting together but not connected with the government of any country Usually non governmental organizations are non profit  that is they are trying to do something other than make money for the people who run them They include organisations such as Oxfam and World Vision 

Non governmental organization is a term that has become widely accepted as referring to a legally constituted non governmental organization created by natural or legal persons with no participation or representation of any government In the cases in which NGOs are funded totally or partially by governments the NGO maintains its non governmental status and excludes government representatives from membership in the organization 

Government funding of NGOs is controversial since according David Rieff writing in The New Republic the whole point of humanitarian intervention was precisely that NGOs and civil society had both a right and an obligation to respond with acts of aid and solidarity to people in need or being subjected to repression or want by the forces that controlled them whatever the governments concerned might think about the matter

Unlike the term intergovernmental organization non governmental organization is a term in general use but is not a legal definition In many jurisdictions these types of organization are defined as civil society organizations or referred to by other names

Wikipedia is an internet encyclopedia project in many languages It is free of chargereffreenote 1 It is also open content which means anyone can copy it for any purpose as long as they follow certain rules 

It is owned by the American organization Wikimedia Foundation which is located in San Francisco California 

Its name is a combination of the two words wiki a Hawaiian word for quick and encyclopedia Because the word was made by combining parts of those words it is a portmanteau 

It was started on January 10 2001 by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger as part of Nupedia But they separated in January 15 2001 It is based on an older Internet encyclopedia named Nupedia It is a wiki that runs using the software MediaWiki 

Anyone can change the pages in Wikipedia or even make new ones Wikipedia has a standard format that must apply for all pages in the encyclopedia 

As of December 2007 Wikipedia had about 925 million pages in 253 languages and more than 174 billion words across all Wikipedias

Some people think that the English Language Wikipedia shows bias and unfairness Editors of reference works such as the Encyclopdia Britannica have questioned Wikipedias utility and status as an encyclopedia Others believe that Wikipedia is more useful than other encyclopedias because it can be updated so quickly

Wikipedia began as a related project for Nupedia Nupedia was a free online English language encyclopedia project Nupedias articles were written and owned by Bomis Inc which was a web portal company The main people of the company were Jimmy Wales the Bomis CEO and Larry Sanger the editor in chief for Nupedia Nupedia was first licensed under the Nupedia Open Content License which was changed to the GNU Free Documentation License before Wikipedia was founded when Richard Stallman requested them

Larry Sanger and Jimmy Wales are the founders of Wikipedia Wales is credited with defining the goals of the project Sanger created the strategy of using a wiki to reach Wales goal On January 10 2001 Larry Sanger proposed on the Nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a feeder project for Nupedia Wikipedia was launched on January 15 2001 It was launched as an English language edition at wwwwikipediacom and announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list Wikipedias policy of neutral point of view was codified in its initial months and was similar to Nupedias earlier nonbiased policy Otherwise there were relatively few rules initially and Wikipedia operated independently of Nupedia

Wikipedia gained early contributors from Nupedia Slashdot and also from search engine indexing It grew to about 20000 articles and 18 languages by the end of 2001 By late 2002 it had 26 languages 46 by the end of 2003 and 161 by the end of 2004 Nupedia and Wikipedia both existed till Nupedias servers were stopped in 2003 After this its text was incorporated into Wikipedia The English Wikipedia passed the 2 million article mark on September 9 2007 making it the largest encyclopedia ever assembled eclipsing even the Yongle Encyclopedia which had held the record for exactly 600 years

The English Wikipedia reached 3 million articles in August 2009 In terms of the numbers of articles and of contributors it appeared to have been reduced around spring 2007

On January 15 2011 Wikipedia celebrated its 10th birthday It used a special logo to celebrate its 10 years since it opened on January 15 2001 and the logo was used for the whole day on the sidebar of the English Wikipedia

A conservation law is a statement used in Physics that says that the amount of something does not change in time That thing could be as simple as mass or charge or something that has to be calculated like energy or angular momentum

For example the law of conservation of mass is the conservation law that says that the amount of mass is always conserved even if it is changed into another form This means that if the mass of the universe could be measured right now its mass would be known tomorrow because it will not change

For a long time people thought that these laws were true for the amount of mass and energy in the universe Later on Albert Einstein said that they were not completely true He said that mass could change into energy If this happened it would be against the conservation laws because if mass was changed into energy the total amount of mass goes down and the total amount of energy goes up 

Einstein said that conservation laws could still be used if all the mass and all the energy were combined He said that even though the mass changes or the energy changes the sum when they are added together does not change So now there is just one conservation law for mass and energy together

Some of the things that are thought to be conserved are

Conservation laws are helpful for people when they do problems in Physics This is because if they know that a thing is conserved it gives them more mathematical information about the thing they are doing the problem about

Because science does not know where consciousness originally comes from some mystic philosophers have guessed that there may also be a law of conservation of consciousness in the universe That is to say when something loses consciousness or dies that consciousness may not disappear but may go into some kind of unseen pool of consciousness according to this idea

Conservation laws can come in two types global or local 

A global conservation law just says that the total amount of something in the universe does not change in time 

Animal rights is a term used for the general belief that non human animals have certain natural rights Most animal rights promoters believe that non human animals have the natural right not to be used by humans for any means including food clothing experimentation and entertainment Just as human rights are gained simply because someone is a human animals have animal rights simply because they are an animal

Introversion and Extroversion made up by Carl Jung in the 1920s is one theory that describes how a person gets energy from the world Many people associate introverts with being quiet and shy and extroverts with being loud and sociable According to the theory introverts get energy from inside themselves and extroverts get energy from outside of themselves 

Those who follow this way of looking at the world say that everyone has some parts of both traits in them though one will usually dominate over the other At one time extroverts were thought to make up almost three fourths of American society Now researchers typically assume that the number of extroverts is pretty much equal to the number of introverts in the country

Sartell is a city in the US state of Minnesota The 2000 census said 9641 live in the city Newer information says 12629 people live in the city Sartell is in both Stearns County and Benton County

Sartell started as a small town near the Mississippi River It was first named The Third Rapids because it was the third rapids that French fur traders came to as they went north from St Anthony Falls in Minneapolis

One of the first people to live in this young town was Joseph B Sartell He came in 1854 and worked as a millwright at a local sawmill In 1877 he started a flour mill at the nearby Watab River In 1884 he started the Sartell Brothers Lumber Company with his sons

In 1905 some people started to build the Watab Pulp and Paper Company They also started to build the Sartell Dam across the Mississippi near the third rapids Both of these things were finished in 1907 Seven people died when building the dam Since that time Watab Pulp and Paper was rebuilt several times and many people bought and sold it Now a company called International Paper owns it

It was in 1907 that residents of the town decided it was time to incorporate Several influential people felt the town ought to be named Wengert after a local businessman Another man lobbyied to have the town named Oberly after himself However because of his many relatives and generous contributions to the community the town was incorporated as The Village of Sartell in honor of Joseph B Sartell From 1907 until 1973 there was a Sartell on nearly every City Council the most prominent being Ripley B Rip Sartell who was mayor for 31 years

The town continued to grow slowly and developed a number of businesses and a downtown on the east side of the Mississippi along US Highway 10 In the 1960s the highway was re routed greatly contributing to the demise of the downtown area The later construction of a new bridge over the Mississippi in the early 1980s replaced the remaining businesses This and Sartells nearby location to St Cloud Minnesotas major retail center account for Sartells lack of a traditional downtown

Because residents wanted to educate their children locally Independent School District 748 Sartell St Stephen was created in 1969 Despite not having a downtown the city continued to grow and the pace of the growth increased in the 1970s From 1970 to the present the population of the city has grown from 700 to over 10000

Sartells city council has a mayor and four council members They are elected at large to represent the community They also legislate policy for the city As of October 2005 Sartells mayor is Robert Pogatshnik and its four council members are Mary Lewandowski Tim ODriscoll Paul Orndorff and Joe Perske They have the authority to pass and enforce ordinances establish public and administrative policies create advisory boards and commissions and manage the citys financial operations including preparing a budget auditing expenditures and transacting other city business as required by law The City Council also appoints a City Administrator who overseas the day to day operations of the city and implements the policies of the Council

The United States Census Bureau says that the city has a total area of 159 km 153 km of it is land and 06 km of it is water The total area is 375 water

The city is located on both sides of the Mississippi River The area around the city has lots of farmland and forests

Because the Mississippi River goes through the city people use the river to have fun When it is warm people ride boats swim catch fish and water ski on the river When the river is frozen in winter people ride snowmobiles cross country ski and catch fish through holes in the ice 

The city has also built places for people to have fun These include 24 parks walking pathways playgrounds a bike lane tennis courts baseball and soccer fields ice rinks a disc golf course and a wading pool

Transportation to and from Sartell is limited to surface roads mainly US Highway 10 and Minnesota Highway 15 which both pass along the outskirts of the city A rail line runs through town but serves only as freight transportation for the local paper mill The presence of dams along the Mississippi River and the waterways relatively shallow depth render it useless for anything more than recreational watercraft traffic

Pop Punk or Punk Pop is a form of popular music that blends punk rock with pop music and rock music Pop punk music has a lighter happier sound than most punk rock and hardcore punk music Most punk rock and hardcore punk music sounds angry and harsh and has lyrics about protest and anger

There are several types of pop punk An early type of pop punk was developed right after Punk rock became popular in the late 1970s Most of this kind of music is very much like Punk rock but it features things from other kinds of music like pop music and older rock music and country music so different people can enjoy it Some people call the Ramones a pop punk band The Ramones were a band from the United States

In the 1990s pop punk became very popular in North America Bands such as Green Day and Blink 182 sold millions of recordings and did many tours

In the 2000s and 2010s which is the decade we are in now many bands have joined or contributed to the pop punk genre They include Fall Out Boy Relient K FM Static Hawk Nelson and Amber Pacific

Some people who like 1970s punk rock or 1980s hardcore punk do not like pop punk The 1970s punk rock or 1980s hardcore punk was usually angry rebellious protest music In contrast 1990s pop punk songs are nicer and lighter Some people think 1990s pop punk is too commercialized and nothing like the older punk music from the 1970s and 1980s

Due to problems in Ireland most importantly a famine that made it difficult to grow potatoes in Ireland between 1845 and 1852 many Irish moved out of Ireland and to other countries such as the United States and Canada At present many more Irish live in the United States than in Ireland with many of them living in large American cities such as Boston New York and Chicago

Achille Claude Debussy was a French composer He is one of the most important composers of the early 20th century Most of his compositions are for orchestra or for piano He also wrote some songs chamber music and one opera He made his music very different from the Romantic style that other composers were using at the time He is often called an Impressionistic composer because he was influenced by the group of painters called Impressionists They were not so much interested in making their paintings look exactly like the real world but preferred to paint things such as the effect of the sunlight shining on water Debussy often did this in his music which creates a special atmosphere

Claude Debussy did not have an easy childhood His father was a travelling salesman and his mother worked as a seamstress He learned the piano when he was young and went to the Paris Conservatoire For a time it seemed that he would become a concert pianist but he did not do well enough in his examination After winning an important prize the Prix de Rome he went to Rome for two years but he did not enjoy it He visited Bayreuth in 1888 and 1889 to hear Wagners operas but he did not like them He preferred sounds like that of the Javanese gamelan which he heard in Paris at the World Exhibition

In 1899 he married a young woman named Lily Texier He got a job as music critic of a journal called La revue blanche He wrote his opera Plleas et Mlisande which was performed at the Opra Comique It was extremely successful and was performed 100 times there during the next ten years He wrote exciting music for orchestra Ftes galantes and a work called La Mer which he worked at while staying in Brighton on the south coast of England It is one of the most exciting pieces of music about the sea

Debussy was now starting to become very famous His personal life changed He left his wife because he had fallen in love with Emma Bardac who was an amateur singer for whom Gabriel Faur had written a song cycle La Bonne Chanson Her husband was a banker She bought an apartment and Debussy lived with her there for the rest of his life They had a daughter called Chou Chou born in 1905 They married in 1908

Debussys next orchestral work was called Images He began composing a set of preludes for piano Other works followed Khamma Le martyre de St Sbastian and the ballet Jeux which was produced in 1913 by Dyagilevs company People soon forgot about this work because only two weeks later the same ballet company produced Stravinskys Rite of Spring which caused a riot

By this time Debussy was already ill with cancer His visit to London in 1914 was his last trip to another country He wrote more piano works a set of tudes and a piano duet called En blanc et noir He planned to write six sonatas each for a different group of instruments but he only wrote three of them one for cello and piano one for flute viola and harp and one for violin and piano The Sonata for violin and piano was the last work he played in public He became very ill and died in 1918

Debussy is often thought of together with Ravel but really they composed in very different ways Between 1892 and 1894 Debussy worked on a short orchestral piece called Prlude laprs midi dun faune It is about a fawn waking up and seeing the world around him It is based on a poem by Mallarm a poet who belonged to the group known as the Symbolists It is a wonderful piece of music but many people at the time did not understand it Saint Sans for example did not understand the way that the musical ideas flowed gently into one another He was always an enemy of Debussy 

There is a lot of variety in Debussys piano musicSome of it is very difficult to play eg the tudes and pieces such as Lisle joyeuse Other collections are much simpler eg Suite bergamasque which includes the very popular piece called Clair de lune He wrote two books of preludes Each of the pieces has a title but the titles are printed at the end of each piece as if he did not want the listener to know what it was about until afterwards

Debussy wrote wonderfully for the voice making the music just right for the rhythm of the French language This can be heard in his songs and his opera Using melodies and harmonies which are often quite simple he creates a special kind of dream world which can be very powerful He often uses the whole tone scale and the pentatonic scale which give the music a hazy feeling because it does not seem to be clearly in one particular key He liked to use unusual chords just for their own sake not in order to make them lead to a particular key He also used the old scales known as the church modes

Debussys music had a great influence on many composers in the 20th century Cage Messiaen Boulez and Stockhausen all learned from listening to his music

Differentials are the main focus of differential calculus

Differentials can also be used in automobiles where they are used for turning for example while turning right the right wheel travels a shorter distance than the left the differential slows down the wheel so it will not slip

This is because the inside wheel is closer to the center of the turn meaning that it travels on an arc with a shorter radius thus resulting in less distance traveled

Geta are traditional Japanese sandals They are stilted to keep the hem of a kimono above the ground They are worn with tabi socks Geta makes the persons feet stay out of the mud

Usually Japanese people wear them with a casual kimono rather than formal one It is common to wear them with bare feet when a yukata is worn Also they are worn with western clothes Today in Japan most people rarely wear kimono and rarely wear geta One reason for this is most gravel roads were changed to asphalt roads for Tokyo Olympic Since 1995 the number of people who wear geta casually increased because of the pretty looks and sounds In addition the popularity of geta grew little by little through trend for yukata At one time Japanese people thought that it is hard to walk with geta and sometimes get injured by hanao Hanao is a rope which is set between the big toe and second toe when geta are worn However because of efforts by yukata makers and footwear makers Japanese people are starting to like to wear geta again

We find out that Neville doesnt like his stepfather who is a nasty man He tells this to Crisparkle Rosa tells Helena that she doesnt like Jasper who is her music teacher She says she finds him scary When Neville meets Rosa he falls in love with her He is angry that Edwin Drood doesnt like her very much but still wants to get married Edwin makes Neville angry and Neville attacks him Jasper tells everyone that Neville is a violent person 

Reverend Crisparkle wants Edwin and Neville to be friends He wants to say sorry to Edwin but only is Edwin accepts the apology They all decide to have dinner the day before Christmas at Jaspers house so that everyone can say sorry

Mr Gregious who takes care of Rosa tells Rosa that she has a lot of money This money is from her father who is dead She asks him if they money will still be given to her if she doesnt marry Edwin Mr Gregious says that she will still get the money even if she doesnt marry Edwin Mr Gregious meets Edwin and gives him a ring The ring belonged to Rosas father and gave is to Rosas mother when they got married Mr Gregious says that if Edwin loves Rosa and wants to stay with her forever he must give her the ring If he doesnt love Rosa and doesnt want to stay with her forever he must give the ring back to Mr Gregious There is another man watching to make sure Mr Gregious and Edwin follow the rules Rosa and Edwin talk and they say they both dont want to get married anymore They want ask Mr Grewgious to tell Jasper this Edwin says he will soon give the ring back

Meanwhile Jasper is in the graveyard again with Durdles Jasper gives Durdles some very strong wine which makes him drunk Jasper finds out that Durdles can tap the stone coffins and knows what is in them from this Jasper is interested in this trick Suddenly they see a boy called Deputy Jasper thinks the boy was following them so he holds him by the neck He doesnt kill him though and lets him go 

On Christmas Eve Neville buys a stick for walking He wants to do some walking in his spare time in the countryside Edwin goes to a jewellery shop because his watch is broken A woman who uses opium asks him what his first name is He tells her She says that she is happy his name is not Ned She says that Ned is in danger Edwin doesnt listen to her but he knows that Jasper sometimes calls him Ned

They have the planned dinner and everyone is friends again Edwin and Neville go down to the river to see the storm The next day we find out that Edwin is missing Jasper tells everyone that Neville killed him Neville goes off for a walk but the village people bring him back to the town 

Reverend Crisparkle stops Neville from going to jail by saying that he will look after him He says that he will bring Neville forward whenever he is needed Jasper is then told that Edwin and Rosa wont get married He is very upset Crisparkle finds Edwins watch and other belongings at the river 

Half a year later Neville is living in London A man called Mr Tartar meets Neville and he wants to share his garden with him He lives near Neville A new character called Dick Datchery comes to Cloisterham He lives near Jasper and watches him Datchery meets Deputy and asks where Jasper lives Deputy doesnt ever go near there because he is afraid Jasper will choke him again

Jasper goes and visits Rosa He tells her that he loves her She tells him to leave He doesnt give up and says he will destroy Neville unless she loves him Because Neville is the brother of her friend Helena Rosa is frightened She goes to Mr Grewgious in London and Crisparkle follows her Mr Tartar meets him and asks him if he knows who he is Crisparkle remembers that Tartar once saved him from dying in a river They tell Rosa not to talk to Neville or Helena in case Jasper is watching However Tartar lets Rosa meet Helena Grewgious finds a place for Rosa to live with another woman 

We see that Jasper is visiting the place where lots of people smoke opium in London He has not been there for a long time The woman who owns the place follows him She promises not to lose him again like last time She follows him all the way to Cloisterham She meets Mr Datchery who tells her Jaspers name He also says that he is going to sing in the church service in the morning The woman is called Princess Puffer She goes to the service and shakes her fist at Jasper

Dickens died before the story was finished He made a summary of the story as planned in a letter to his friend John Forster

 His first fancy for the tale was expressed in a letter in the middle of July What should you think of the idea of a story beginning in this way Two people boy and girl or very young going apart from one another pledged to be married after many yearsat the end of the book The interest to arise out of the tracing of their separate ways and the impossibility of telling what will be done with that impending fate This was laid aside but it left a marked trace on the story as afterwards designed in the position of Edwin Drood and his betrothed

I first heard of the later design in a letter dated Friday the 6th of August 1869 in which after speaking with the usual unstinted praise he bestowed always on what moved him in others of a little tale he had received for his journal he spoke of the change that had occurred to him for the new tale by himself I laid aside the fancy I told you of and have a very curious and new idea for my new story Not a communicable idea but a very strong one though difficult to work The story I learnt immediately afterward was to be that of the murder of a nephew by his uncle the originality of which was to consist in the review of the murderers career by himself at the close when its temptations were to be dwelt upon as if not he the culprit but some other man were the tempted The last chapters were to be written in the condemned cell to which his wickedness all elaborately elicited from him as if told of another had brought him Discovery by the murderer of the utter needlessness of the murder for its object was to follow hard upon commission of the deed but all discovery of the murderer was to be baffled till towards the close when by means of a gold ring which had resisted the corrosive effects of the lime into which he had thrown the body not only the person murdered was to be identified but the locality of the crime and the man who committed it So much was told to me before any of the book was written and it will be recollected that the ring taken by Drood to be given to his betrothed only if their engagement went on was brought away with him from their last interview Rosa was to marry Tartar and Crisparkle the sister of Landless who was himself I think to have perished in assisting Tartar finally to unmask and seize the murderer

Electromagnets are magnets that are only magnetic when there is a coil of wire with electricity running through it This is called a solenoid The strength of the magnet is proportional to the current flowing in the circuit Electromagnets are used for a variety of purposes In a simple example an electromagnet can pick up pieces of iron steel nickel and cobalt The electricity running through the wire is called a current The current is a flow of electrons negatively charged particles

Electromagnets can be made stronger by adding more coils to the copper wire or adding an iron core through the coils You can also increase the current to make the magnetism stronger

British electrician William Sturgeon invented the electromagnet in 1825 

An electromagnet is very beneficial because it can be turned on and off easily whereas a permanent magnet cannot be turned off and will continue to affect its immediate environment Iron stops being an electromagnet very quickly but steel takes time to wear off To make an electromagnet you can wind copper wire around a steel rod Then connect the two ends of the wire to the and  side of the battery 

Electromagnets are used in everyday items such as burglar alarms electric relays and fire bells Their ability to change from the state of non magnetic to magnetic just by passing an electric current through it allows it to be used in many different items

The 7 people who died had nothing in common People who tried to find out who did it said that it must have been 7 different people who killed them They said that they were probably a part of a gang They said that a big gang like the mafia might have killed these people

Ivan Milat was a man who lived near Belangalo State Forest He tried to help police to find out what happened Police said that he knew too much about the murders so they thought maybe he had killed someone So police started to spy on him to try to find out if he had killed people They found out that

Swedish is a language mostly spoken in Sweden and in parts of Finland especially along the coast and on the land islands More than nine million people speak Swedish It is similar to two of the other Scandinavian languages Norwegian and Danish and a person who understands one of these languages can understand the others Other Scandinavian languages such as Icelandic and Faroese are less closely related and cannot be understood by Swedish speakers Standard Swedish is spoken and written throughout Sweden but there are some local dialects with differences in grammar and vocabulary in small towns and rural areas

Swedish also has some important differences in grammar Definite articles are suffixed onto the end of their nouns so ett hus becomes huset Also unlike English Swedish uses two grammatical genders called Common and Neuter Nouns of the Common gender are sometimes called en words and many words for living things are en words Nouns of the Neuter gender are sometimes called ett words

The National Security Agency is a part of the United States government It was started in 1952 and the main office is in Maryland 

Their goal is to protect the US people by making codes and breaking codes They collect information by eavesdropping This means that they listen to what people are saying in other countries without letting the people know that they are listening The NSA is also in charge of making sure that other countries do not eavesdrop on the United States

Because the agency has to keep secrets not many people know exactly what the agency is working on 

Many people have written books about the NSA Sometimes the books are real history books and sometimes the books are fiction and say things about the NSA that are not true like in television shows like 24

Robert Pershing Wadlow was one of the tallest people who ever lived He was born in Alton Illinois US

A code or cypher is a way of changing information into something else Sometimes this is done as a way of keeping a message secret Sometimes it is done as an easier way of sending a message For example when people on two different boats want to send a message they may be too far away from each other to talk but they can send messages with a flag code Another code that people use a lot is called Morse Code which changes letters to dots and dashes like this

Computers use codes by changing letters into 1s and 0s This is called an ASCII code

Some people write codes as a kind of game They think it is fun to make codes and fun to break codes Breaking a code means taking it apart to understand how it works and then you can understand messages that are written in that code

In the United States there is an organization called the NSA Their job is to break other peoples codes and to make codes that the United States government can use which are hard to break

The algorithm for making a message secret is called the encryption algorithm To change a secret message back a decryption algorithm is needed

When you change the message back you most likely use a cypher The word Cypher is also in French as cifre and Latin as cifra from the Arabic word sifr

The goaltender in ice hockey is the player who defends his teams goal net by stopping shots of the puck from entering his teams net thus stopping the other team from scoring

At the very end of a game if a team is losing by one goal teams may take their goaltender out of the game and replace him with another player This makes it more likely that they will score a goal however it is also much easier for the other team to score without anybody defending the goal

Wikispecies is a sister project of Wikipedia and so it is a wiki supported by the Wikimedia Foundation It is a free directory of species that wants to make a full catalogue of all living things It tells of how species are classified into groups and how those groups are similar to one another It calls itself the directory of life 

It is supposed to be written and used by scientists not by normal people The people who write Wikispecies do not need to show that they know much about it 

It was started in August 2004 with biologists around the world invited to help Now the project has become a good directory listing the Linnaean taxonomy with links to Wikipedia articles on individual species since April 2005 The links are provided in different languages 

The articles in Wikispecies are all written in the Latin names so that scientists around the world no matter what language that use can use the website There is information in the article telling people what the articles living thing is called in every other language that has a common name for it Still Wikispecies is mostly in English its main page is in English and it is run in English

The League of Nations was the predecessor to the United Nations The League was founded during World War I but failed to maintain peace during World War II The League of Nations was thought up by Woodrow Wilson the American President during the First World War It was to be a group of nations that worked together to keep peace One of the reasons for its downfall was that after a vote the American public refused to join This meant the League did not have the power it needed to enforce any of the rules that made it up This later proved to be a fatal flaw in the Leagues structure 

After a series of disasters in the 1930s it was abolished It was thought to be weak and powerless after Japan completely ignored it when the League of Nations tried to stop Japan from invading Manchuria and Italy invaded Abyssinia The League did not fail completely it had prevented a few conflicts in Europe in the 1920s and worked hard to stamp out various public health and social problems around the world 

Another flaw in the League was that it was not representative enough no more than 65 nations were members at any given time and the interests of the leading members often outweighed those of smaller less powerful members 

The League also had no troops of its own and decisions it made were often slow For example when Japan invaded Manchuria in 1931 it took a whole year for the Leagues decision to be heard 

President Woodrow Wilson arranged a plan for a government of governments or rather an international peacekeeping force The idea of his plan was to settle problems between nations peacefully Wilson tried his hardest to persuade the international community that the league would discourage aggression and tackle the underlying problems that often lead to war such as poverty Wilson was however unable to convince the American public into supporting the League The United States did not want to be part of Wilsons approach for several reasons

First of all the United States consisted of many Americans being German immigrants and loathed the Treaty of Versailles The treaty said that Germany and its allies were to accept full responsibility for causing the war and reparations were to be made to certain countries The Treaty of Versailles was the treaty that set up the League of Nations and not agreeing to it meant not being part of the League of Nations

The next reason that America did not want to get involved in European affairs is because they did not want to risk more Americans dying in a war They also felt that it would result in them pouring effort into pointless actions such as sending soldiers all around the globe to sort out small disputes This was called isolationism Most of the American citizens felt it would be best to just avoid European and British affairs completely In 1946 the League of Nations formally ended and the United Nations was established along with a few of the Leagues committees such as the World Health Committee which still today maintains many of the same responsibilities of the League of Nations

These countries joined League of Nations in 1920

When seen from Earth a solar eclipse happens when the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun This makes the Moon fully or partially cover the sun Solar eclipses can only happen during a new moon Every year about two solar eclipses occur Sometimes there are even five solar eclipses in a year However only two of these can be total solar eclipses and they are quite uncommon

Many people who are sometimes called eclipse chasers or umbraphiles travel to faraway places to see solar eclipses After the solar eclipse on August 11 1999 in Europe people began to show more interest in solar eclipses On October 3 2005 there was another solar eclipse and unusually many people came to see it

The last total eclipse was the solar eclipse of July 11 2010 The next will be the solar eclipse of November 13 2012

A total solar eclipse is a natural phenomenon Yet long ago solar eclipses were thought to happen because of something supernatural or as a sign that something bad was going to happen This is still believed in some cultures today A total solar eclipse can frighten people who do not know what it means because the Sun seems to disappear during the day and the sky turns dark in just a few minutes

There are four different types of solar eclipses

The Suns distance from the Earth is about 400 times the Moons distance and the Suns diameter is about 400 times as big as the Moons This is why the Sun and Moon seem to be about the same size from Earth

Looking directly at the bright surface of the Sun itself can hurt the retina of the eye greatly because of the radiation that comes from the Sun It can even blind people The retina does not feel pain so damage may not be felt for hours

The Sun is usually so bright that it is hard to look at it directly However when the Sun is covered in an eclipse it is easier to look at it Sadly looking at the Sun during an eclipse is equally dangerous except in the very short time when the Suns surface is completely covered Looking at the Suns surface through binoculars a telescope or even a camera is extremely dangerous and can damage the eye in less than a second

Looking at the Sun without an eclipse does not usually hurt the eye very greatly because the pupil of the eye closes down and makes everything darker If the Sun is almost completely covered the pupil opens because there is not as much light However the parts of the Sun that can be seen are still equally bright and can hurt the eye very much

A collision occurs when two objects come in contact with each other All collisions have the same momentum before and after a collision Examples of collisions include car crashes bouncing a ball and playing pool Collisions are made from two smaller sections called elastic and inelastic collisions 

In the case of playing pool or bouncing a ball an elastic collision occurs An elastic collision generally occurs when an elastic or hard object experiences a collision that bounces off another elastic or hard object where the kinetic energy and momentum are the same before and after the collision In an experiment a small amount of energy will still be lost because of the friction between the surface and the objects

In the case of a car crash an inelastic collision occurs An inelastic collision generally occurs when a soft object experiences a collision that does not result in a bounce Kinetic energy is lost during this type of collision because the energy is transformed into other forces The momentum is the same before and after the collision

In the case of a two dimensional collision the rules in elastic and inelastic collision are still the same but vectors are used to find the momentum before or after a collision

A barnacle is a cirripede a kind of crustacean It is covered with hard plates of calcium carbonate and lives stuck to hard surfaces

It does not look like a crustacean and for many centuries it was thought to be a mollusc In the 1830s someone found their larvae and followed their development through to their adult form They have a nauplius larva typical of crustaeans Later Charles Darwin spent eight years working on barnacles and discovered that Thompson had been right

Barnacles grows on hard surfaces like piers boats rocks and on other animals such as turtles and whales Barnacles are a different group from crabs and shrimps They are considered a nuisance to the shipping industry and private boat owners

Barnacles are suspension feeders sweeping small food into their mouth with their curved feet They are cemented to rock and covered with hard calcareous plates which they shut firmly when the tide goes out The barnacles reproduce sexually and produce little nauplius larvae which disperse in the plankton Eventually the larvae change into cypris form and attach on other hard surfaces to form new barnacles Their comparative anatomy was worked out in detail by Charles Darwin 

Barnacles have the largest penis to body size ratio of the animal kingdom A few forms have become fully parasitic on larger crustacea

Barnacles are by far the commonest animals on rocky sea shores Their numbers on a shore in the Isle of Man have been estimated as a thousand million and they produce body material of 12 hundrededweight of tissue weighed after drying Each year they let go a huge number of larvae estimated as a million millionp110

Darwin set his work out in four parts There were the barnacles on stalks and those that sat on hard substrate Each of these was divided into living and fossil barnacles

Port Arthur was named after Van Diemens Land lieutenant governor George Arthur It started as a place to cut down timber from the forests in 1830 It is best known for being a penal colony From 1833 until the 1853 criminals from United Kingdom and Ireland were sent to Port Arthur as convicts The prisoners were kept busy ship with jobs including building the prison shoemaking smithing timber and brick making In the 1840s there were more than 1100 prisoners In 1842 the prisoners built a hospital and a big flour mill and grain store At the time it was built it was the biggest building in Australia This was later turned into a cell block After 1853 convicts from other prisons in Australia were sent to Port Arthur if they did more crimes or would not behave properly

In 1864 they started building the Asylum to hold the prisoners who had become insane During the 1860s and 1870s the prisoners left at the prison were either too old too sick or insane to keep working The prison closed in 1877

Port Arthur has the best example of a Separate Prison system This system was started at Pentonville prison in London The Separate Prison was started in 1848 finished in 1853 and made bigger in 1855 It has 80 prison cells built in the shape of a cross In the centre is a hall and a chapel There are exercise yards built between the arms of the cross The Separate system was a change in the way that prisoners were treated Instead of physical punishment the system used psychological punishment It was thought that physical punishment such as whippings only made prisoners worse It did not turn bad people into good people In the Separate prison they used the Silent System Prisoners wore a hood over their heads They were not allowed to talk or make any noise The guards wore special shoes and walked on mats so they wouldnt make any noise Even in the chapel each prisoner was kept in a separate wooden box where they could only see the altar The prisoners were supposed to use the quiet time to think about the bad things they had done Port Arthur was seen as the best prison in Australia

Port Arthur was a natural prison It is on the Tasman Peninsula which is almost completely surrounded by the sea It is joined to the rest of Tasmania by a small narrow piece of land about 30 metres wide This is called Eaglehawk Neck The Neck had a fence prison guards and savage dogs to stop prisoners from leaving There was no contact between visiting seamen and prisoners Ships had to give the guards their sails and oars when they arrived to stop people leaving without permission A semaphore message system was also set up between Port Arthur and Hobart Messages could be sent in just 15 minutes 

Escape from Port Arthur was said to be impossible like Alcatraz Island in the United States Some prisoners did try to escape One prisoner George Billy Hunt covered himself with a kangaroo skin and tried to get across the Neck The hungry guards on duty tried to shoot him to make an extra meal When he saw them pointing their guns Hunt gave himself up He was whipped 150 times Bushranger Martin Cash successfully escaped along with two others

The British Empires first boys prison was built on Point Puer 3 kms across Opossum Bay from Port Arthur Puer is the Latin word for boy It was for young boys some as young as 9 like James Lynch arrested for stealing toys The boys were kept away from the main convict area About 3500 boys were sent to Point Puer Like the adults the boys were given hard work such as stone cutting and building There was also a school run by 2 ex convicts One prisoner was James Gavagan When he was 11 he stole some umbrellas He was sent to Tasmania for 7 years He arrived at Point Puer in 1835 When he turned 17 he was sent to the main prison at Port Arthur He was released in March 1842 There is only a few stones left to mark the site of the boys prison Point Puer Excavation

The convicts built one of Australias first non denominational churches built in a gothic style All prisoners had to go to the church every Sunday People who did not like the new prison system said that this did not seem to make the prisoners into good people

Port Arthur was seen as a much better prison and would make the convicts better people But life at Port Arthur was just as hard and brutal as other penal colonies Some critics might even say that its use of psychological punishment together with no hope of escape made it one of the worst Some stories say that prisoners would murder others to escape the prison Murder would be punished by death Isle of the Dead is a small island in the bay near Port Arthur Everyone who died at the penal colony was buried on the island There are 1646 graves on the island but only 180 mainly those of prison staff have a headstone

The first railway in Australia was a human powered railway at Port Arthur The railway was built in 1836 The line ran from the beach at Taranna Tasmania for 7 kms to Port Arthur It carried both people and supplies It meant that ships from Hobart could unload in the calm water and not have to travel right around Cape Raoul to Port Arthur through rough seas The carriage was pushed along the tracks by 4 convicts Very little sign of the railway has survived The State Library of Victoria has a drawing of the convict railway 

When the penal colony closed in 1877 the area was renamed Carnavon During the 1880s the was sold and a small town was started Many buildings were pulled down and the bricks sent to make new buildings in Hobart Fires burned the area in 1895 and 1897 and ruined many of the old prison buildings Some buildings were changed for the new town to make a post office and town hall

Tourism started as soon as the prison closed This brought money into the new town Some of the old convicts gave guided tours of the prison In 1927 tourism had grown so much the areas name was changed back to Port Arthur 1916 saw the start of the Scenery Preservation Board which looked after the Port Arthur site By the 1970s the National Parks and Wildlife Service took over the site

In 1979 the government gave money to protect the site as a tourist area because of its historical importance The post office and town hall of Port Arthur were moved to nearby Nubeena Several grand sandstone buildings built by convicts were cleaned up These buildings include the Separate Prison the Round Tower the church and the remains of the main prison building The buildings are surrounded by green grass

The mass graves on The Island of the Dead also attract visitors The air about the small bush covered island is described as being sad and peaceful by visitors

Tourists can either walk around the area themselves or go on a guided tours There are also late night ghost tours There is a museum with written records tools clothing and other interesting things from convict times

Since 1987 the site has been managed by the Port Arthur Historic Site Management Authority paid for by the Tasmanian Government

On 28 April 1996 Martin Bryant killed 35 people and hurt 37 others at Port Arthur He was captured by the police This is now called the Port Arthur massacre This led to a national ban on semi automatic shotguns and rifles It also made a link between the Port Arthur and Dunblane a Scottish town which also had a shooting that year

Odysseus was a person in the Greek mythology He was the king of the island Ithaca and was married to Penelope Odysseus and Penelope had a son called Telemachos Odysseus is a major character in Homers Iliad and Odyssey

Odysseus fought in the Trojan War and invented the Trojan Horse which made the Greeks win the war After the war his adventurous journey home took the time of 10 years The story of that journey is told in the Odyssey

Cast iron is an alloy of iron The term is usually used for grey cast iron There are two main types of cast iron grey cast iron and white cast iron The differences between the two are mainly based on the amount of silicon in the alloy All cast iron has about 95 iron in it Grey cast iron has 2 silicon and 3 carbon White cast iron has less silicon

The silicon in grey cast iron causes the carbon to change into graphite This causes it to have a dark grey or almost black color With less silicon the carbon in white cast iron changes to cementite or iron carbide This causes white fractures to form on the surface and give white cast iron the name

Grey cast iron is very good at conducting heat Because of this it is often used to make cookware 

Incest means sexual intercourse between people who are related In many societies it is forbidden by law and religion Children that result from incest are more likely to have birth defects Incest is the ultimate form of inbreeding

The exact definition of the incest relationship varies In some societies it is immediate relations such as parents and their children or brothers and sisters of the same parents That way intercourse between cousins is permitted 

Other societies define it much more widely to include all blood relatives or all who live in the same household or belong to the same clan

The type of incest most often reported in the Western world is father daughter incest Incest between adults and children is a form of child sexual abuse This form has been shown to cause one of the worst forms of childhood trauma a trauma that often causes serious and long term psychological damage especially in the case of parental incest Stepfathers are more likely to abuse daughters that are biologically not their own than biological fathers since the Westermarck effect prevents strongly fathers from abusing their own daughters In the Eastern world especially in Japan mother son incest is most often reported

The term is often misused to apply to less serious sexual relationships between related people It is difficult to say how frequent incest is but researchers have estimated that between 10 and 15 of people have at least one incest experience Less than 2 of these involve intercourse or attempted intercourse Among women research by Russell and Wyatt has given estimates as high as twenty percent 

Incest between consenting adults is very rare or rarely reported Willing incest between adults is a crime in most countries although it is seen by some as a victimless crime The reason why it is usually prohibited is because it may lead into severly handicapped children

Most societies have some form of incest avoidance The incest taboo is and has been one of the most common of all cultural taboos both in current nations and many past societies with legal penalties imposed in some jurisdictions Most modern societies have legal or social restrictions on closely consanguineous marriages However in some societies such as that of Ancient Egypt brothersister fatherdaughter and motherson relations were practiced among royalty In addition the Balinese and some Inuit tribes have altogether different beliefs about what constitutes illegal and immoral incest 

The Canterbury Tales is a book of stories written by Geoffrey Chaucer in the 14th century This is an important book because it is one of the first to be written in the English language The book is about a group of travellers who are going from London to Canterbury As they travel along each person tells a tale thus making up the text of The Canterbury Tales 

Chaucer planned to write 120 tales but only 24 were completed Two of the stories are written in prose and the others are written in verse They were so popular that he was invited to read his stories to the king and royal court 

The Canterbury Tales is about a group of people who are pilgrims They are travelling on a journey to an important religious site In the Middle Ages many Christian people went on pilgrimages to Jerusalem Rome Santiago de Compostela and Canterbury Canterbury Cathedral was a famous pilgrimage site because it contained the shrine of Saint Thomas Becket Thomas Becket had been the Archbishop of Canterbury in the 1100s He had an argument with his old friend King Henry II and in 1170 he was murdered by some supporters of the king The King felt very sad and guilty He had a magnificent tomb built for his old friend People began to visit the tomb Soon some people said that Thomas Becket was a saint and that his bones could work miracles He is regarded as a martyr for the Christian faith and as a saint by both the Roman Catholic and Anglican churches In the late Middle Ages his shrine made Canterbury one of the four most important pilgrimage places in Europe 

Many pilgrims used to meet together in London The Canterbury Tales tells of the meeting of a group at an inn in Southwark which was a village south of the Thames River and now making up part of London This was a good place to meet because people from the north could cross the Thames River by London Bridge Canterbury is in the south east of England A reason why pilgrims used to gather in groups was that it was dangerous to travel alone In the days before modern banking every traveller had to carry a lot of money to pay for food and accommodation Robbers often attacked people along the roads 

When pilgrims gathered in a group the group could be made up of many different kinds of people both rich and poor noble and humble The groups often contained a number of religious people such as priests monks and nuns In Chaucers story the most noble person is a knight

The Canterbury Tales begins with a Prologue In the prologue Chaucer describes the time of year which is April when the weather begins to get warmer after winter He says that it is at this time that people begin to go on pilgrimage Chaucer tells the reader about the people who are gathered at the inn He describes the people so clearly that many of them have become famous characters in English Literature and have often been shown in paintings Chaucer describes how each person tells a story to entertain the other as they travel along 

The Tales are

The General Prologue The Knights Tale The Millers Prologue and Tale The Reeves Prologue and Tale The Cooks Prologue and Tale The Man of Laws Prologue and Tale The Wife of Baths Prologue and Tale The Friars Prologue and Tale The Summoners Prologue and Tale The Clerks Prologue and Tale The Merchants Prologue and Tale The Squires Prologue and Tale The Franklins Prologue and Tale The Physicians Tale The Pardoners Prologue and Tale The Shipmans Tale The Prioress Prologue and Tale Chaucers Tale of Sir Topas The Tale of Melibee The Monks Prologue and Tale The Nuns Priests Prologue and Tale The Second Nuns Prologue and Tale The Canons Yeomans Prologue and Tale The Manciples Prologue and Tale The Parsons Prologue and Tale Chaucers Retraction

Some of the tales are serious and others are funny Some of the funny stories are vulgar A lot of the tales talk about the Christian faith Sometimes the theme of one story is followed into the next story as a new story teller responds to a story they have just heard All of the tales are about the way that people think and behave towards each other

The Canterbury Tales is written in the type of English that most ordinary people used in Chaucers day Chaucer was one of the first authors who wrote stories in English Before stories were written in Latin or French Some other writers of Chaucers time also wrote in English Some of these writers were John Gower William Langland and the Pearl Poet 

Chaucer planned the stories before he wrote them but he did not finish his plan He planned that each character would tell four stories two while going to Canterbury and two while returning to London If Chaucer had finished he would have written 120 stories He only actually wrote 24 Chaucer began to write the stories in the 1380s He stopped writing them in the 1390s Some think that he deliberately did not write the total 120 stories

Chaucer was an important person in the royal court Some people think that in the stories Chaucer was saying things about court politics Some people think that Chaucer based his characters on people that he really knew and who were at the royal court

Some people think that Chaucer copied ideas from others peoples writings because some of the stories in The Canterbury Tales are very similar to them The characters however are very different The characters have different occupations and personalities They all tell different types of stories and they tell them in different ways The big story is about many pilgrims traveling to Canterbury They are riding horses and the trip takes several days Chaucer does not say much about the big story and most of the writing is about the stories told by the pilgrims

The two earliest manuscripts of The Canterbury Tales are the Hengwrt manuscript and the Ellesmere manuscript There are also 84 manuscript and four printed copies of The Canterbury Tales that were made before 1500 There are quite a lot of differences in the different copies Some experts on Chaucer have started The Canterbury Tales Project The project is to read all these copies of The Canterbury Tales find out the differences and write the most accurate copy

Sweat is a liquid that is made by the skin when the body is hot Sweat is made in sweat glands under the surface of the skin and it comes out of tiny holes in the skin called pores Sweat is mostly water but it also contains some salts 

The body makes sweat to cool itself down The sweat takes the heat from the body when it evaporates

Some people think sweat makes a person smell bad Many people use special sprays to stop this from happening Deodorants hide the odor of sweat Anti perspirants stop the body from sweating

The sweat glands in our skin contains two different groups of sweat glands apocrine sweat glands and merocrine sweat glands

Sweat also helps to remove waste from the body

Perspiration or sweat is your bodys way of cooling itself whether that extra heat comes from hardworking muscles or from overstimulated nerves The average person has 26 million sweat glands in their skin Sweat glands are distributed over the entire body except for the lips nipples and external genital organs The sweat gland is in the layer of skin called the dermis along with other equipment such as nerve endings hair follicles and so on 

The sweat gland is a long coiled hollow tube of cells The coiled part in the dermis is where sweat is made and the long part is a duct that connects the gland to the opening or pore on the skinss outer surface Nerve cells from the sympathetic nervous system are connected to the sweat glands There are two types of sweat glands

We are constantly sweating even though we may not notice it Sweating is your bodys major way of getting rid of excess body heat which is produced by metabolism or working muscles The amount of sweat produced depends upon our states of emotion and physical activity Sweat can be made in response to nerve stimulation hot air temperature andor exercise First lets concentrate on how sweat is made in an eccrine sweat gland 

When the sweat gland is stimulated the cells secrete a fluid that is similar to plasma  that is it is mostly water and it has high concentrations of sodium and chloride and a low concentration of potassium  but without the proteins and fatty acids that are normally found in plasma The source of this fluid is the spaces between the cells which get the fluid from the blood vessels in the dermis This fluid travels from the coiled portion up through the straight duct What happens in the straight duct depends upon the rate of sweat production or flow 

Low sweat production  Cells in the straight duct reabsorb most of the sodium and chlorine from the fluid This happens because there is enough time for reabsorption In addition water is reabsorbed osmotically So not much sweat reaches the outside Also the composition of this sweat is significantly different from the primary secretion There is not as much sodium and chloride and there is more potassium 

High sweat production  Cells in the straight portion do not have enough time to reabsorb all of sodium and chloride from the primary secretion So a lot of sweat makes it to the surface of the skin and the composition is close to but not exactly like the primary secretion The sodium and chloride concentrations are about half as much and potassium is about 20 percent higher Sweat is produced in apocrine sweat glands in the same way However the sweat from apocrine glands also contains proteins and fatty acids which make it thicker and give it a milkier or yellowish color This is why underarm stains in clothing appear yellowish Sweat itself has no odor but when bacteria on the skin and hair metabolize the proteins and fatty acids they produce an unpleasant odor This is why deodorants and anti perspirants are applied to the underarms instead of the whole body 

The maximum volume of sweat that a person who is not adapted to a hot climate can produce is about one liter per hour Amazingly if you move to a hot climate such as the American desert southwest or the tropics your ability to produce sweat will increase to about two to three liters per hour within about six weeks This appears to be the maximum amount that you can produce 

When sweat evaporates from the surface of your skin it removes excess heat and cools you This is actually due to a neat principle in physics which goes like this To convert water from a liquid to a vapor it takes a certain amount of heat called the heat of vaporization This heat energy increases the speed of the water molecules so that they can escape into the air For water this value is 540 caloriesgram or 226 x 106 jouleskilogram So if you can produce one liter of sweat which is equal to 1000 g or 1 kg in one hour then 540000 calories of heat can be removed from your body This is an extreme example using the maximum amount of sweat that a person can make Typically all of the sweat does not evaporate but rather runs off your skin In addition not all heat energy produced by the body is lost through sweat Some is directly radiated from the skin to the air and some is lost through respiratory surfaces of the lungs 

A major factor that influences the rate of evaporation is the relative humidity of the air around you If the air is humid then it already has water vapor in it probably near saturation and cannot take any more Therefore sweat does not evaporate and cool your body as efficiently as when the air is dry 

Finally when the water in the sweat evaporates it leaves the salts behind on your skin which is why your skin tastes salty The loss of excessive amounts of salt and water from your body can quickly dehydrate you which can lead to circulatory problems kidney failure and heat stroke So it is important to drink plenty of fluids when you exercise or are outside in high temperatures Sports drinks contain some salts to replace those lost in the sweat 

As we mentioned earlier sweating responds to your emotional state So when you are nervous anxious or afraid there is an increase in sympathetic nerve activity in your body as well as an increase in epinephrine secretion from your adrenal gland These substances act on your sweat glands particularly those on the palms of your hand and your armpits to make sweat Thus you feel a cold sweat Also the increased sympathetic nerve activity in the skin changes its electrical resistance which is the basis of the galvanic skin response used in lie detector tests 

Excessive sweating  usually on the palms of the hand or the armpits  that is not caused by emotional or physical activity is called diaphoresis or hyperhidrosis It is often an embarrassing condition The cause or causes are unknown but the condition may be due to the following 

hormonal imbalances overactive thyroid gland certain foods and medications overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system This condition can be treated by medications and surgical procedures

The spleen is a gland that works closely with the circulatory system The spleen is a ductless vertebrate gland It is not needed for life but is closely associated with the circulatory system where it functions in the destruction of old red blood cells and removal of other debris from the bloodstream and also in holding a reservoir of blood It is thought to be one of the centres of activity of the reticuloendothelial system Until recently the purpose of the spleen was not known It is increasingly recognised that its absence predisposes to certain infections The spleen produces monitors destroys and stores red blood cells The spleen also has two other functions the red and white pulp The white pulp helps fight infections and the red pulp removes unwanted materials

The spleen is shaped like a loose fist and is tucked under the left side of the diaphragm 

The average weight of an adult spleen is 044 lbs During and after digestion the size of the spleen increases Infection of malaria or mono can also cause the spleen to increase in size

If the increase in size is significant the spleen can rupture If the spleen ruptures immediate medical care is necessary You may need emergency surgery to control the bleeding

The placenta is a temporary organ found in most female mammals while they are pregnant

The mothers and babys blood never mixes That is why the placenta is necessary It acts as an exchange surface between the mother and baby and nutrients and oxygen are passed over by diffusion only If the mother and baby blood mixes it could be deadly for both the mother and the baby If the mother is blood type A for example and the blood type of the baby is B then different type blood will mix and the mother and baby would both die

The placenta is connected to the fetus by the umbilical cord which is made of blood vessels and connective tissue When the fetus is delivered the placenta is delivered afterwards and is often called the afterbirth

The Glorious Revolution was an event in the history of England in 1688 The people of England did not like the king King James II because he would not let them vote or worship God in the way they wanted to They invited William III of Orange Nassau to take over as king William was King James IIs nephew and Marys first cousin He came to England with his wife Queen Mary the daughter of King James II They let the old king escape so he moved to France out of fear

Electromagnetism is the study of the electromagnetic field The electromagnetic field pushes or pulls anything that has an electric charge The electromagnetic field affects all of space 

An electric field is an area where charged particles will feel an electric force The units used to measure electric fields are newtons per coulomb Electromagnetism is closely related to both electricity and magnetism because both involve movement of electrons

Electric fields can be drawn as arrows The arrows point which way a positive particle like a proton will be pushed if its in the field Negative particles like electrons will go in the opposite direction as the arrows In an electric field arrows will point away from positive particles and towards negative ones So a proton in an electric field would move away from another proton or towards an electron

A magnetic field is a part of the electric field that only exerts a force on moving charges

Through electromagnetic induction a changing magnetic field can produce an electric field This concept is used to make electric generators induction motors and transformers work Since the two types of fields were dependent on each other the two are thought to be one Together they are called the electromagnetic field

The electromagnetic force is one of the fundamental forces of nature The electromagnetic force is the force that causes an attraction between electrons and the positive nucleus All forces between atoms are caused by the electromagnetic force 

The electromagnetic radiation is thought to be both a particle and a wave This is because it sometimes acts like a particle and sometimes acts like a wave To make things easier we can think of an electromagnetic wave as a stream of photons

A photon is an elementary particle It is the particle that light is made up of Photons also make up all other types of electromagnetic radiation such as gamma rays X rays and UV rays The idea of photons was thought up by Einstein Using his theory for the photoelectric effect Einstein said that light existed in small packets or parcels which he called photons 

Photons have energy and momentum When two electromagnetic fields act on each other they switch photons So photons carry the electromagnetic force between charged objects Photons are also known as messenger particles in physics because these particles often carry messages between objects Photons send messages saying come closer or go away depending on the charges of the objects that are being looked at If a force exists while time passes then photons are being exchanged during that time

Fundamental electromagnetic interactions occur between any two particles that have electric charge These interactions involve the exchange or production of photons Thus photons are the carrier particles of electromagnetic interactions

Electromagnetic decay processes can often be recognized by the fact that they produce one or more photons They proceed less rapidly than strong decay processes with comparable mass differences but more rapidly than comparable weak decays

In 1600 William Gilbert said that electricity and magnetism were two different effects in his book De Magnete The link between electricity and magnetism was found through the work of Benjamin Franklin Romagnosi and rsted A scientist named Ampre then used mathematics in electromagnetism Many physicists then developed a theory of electromagnetism now known as classical electromagnetism James Clerk Maxwell then brought everything together into one theory of electromagnetism This type of electromagnetism was based on Maxwells equations and the Lorentz force law Maxwells studies showed what light actually was Maxwells work did not work with classical mechanics because he said that the speed of light was always constant It only depended on the permeability of the substance it was travelling through This led to the development of the theory of special relativity by Einstein

Albert Einsteins work with the photoelectric effect and Max Plancks work with black body radiation did not work with the traditional view of light as a continuous wave This problem would be solved after the development of quantum mechanics in 1925 This development led to the development of quantum electrodynamics which was developed by Richard Feynman and Julian Schwinger Quantum electrodynamics was able to describe the interactions particles in detail

Montgomery Ward was an American department store chain It started as a mail order catalog and department store in 1872 It owned Jefferson Ward discount stores Jefferson Ward stores in the northern US were sold to Bradlees in 1985 The rest closed in 1988 All its stores closed in 2000 In 2004 it reopened as an online store

Toes are the digits of the foot of an animal Many animal species walk on their toes and are called digitigrade Humans and other animals that walk on the soles of their feet are plantigrade hoofed animals are unguligrade

In humans the bones of each toe continue all the way to the heel although in from the base of the toes they come together in the body of the foot The inside toe is by far the thickest and is called the big toe great toe or hallux

The one on the other end is short and thin The toes especially the big toe play an essential role in walking although a loss of the smallest toe will not affect the way people move

Isaac Newton the father of the study of dynamics the study of motion developed three sets of laws that are believed to be true because the results agree with the laws he produced

If a body is at rest it remains at rest or if it is in motion it moves with uniform velocity until it is acted on by a resultant force 

In other words the first law says that an object that is not moving or moving in a constant speed in a straight line will stay like that until something pushes it or blocks its path As we all know nothing in the visual world ever stays in constant speed but the object itself is moving at constant speed while a force is stopping it from moving at constant speed friction That does not change the law However in space an object can move in a constant speed as long as it does not get close to any other objects and stays in open space This is why rockets use less fuel in space than they do getting to it

This law provides the definition and calculation of force through mass and acceleration

where m is the mass of the object and g is the local gravitational field equal to 98 meters per second2 on Earth Simply put this law states that energy cannot be created or destroyed but may be changed from one form to another

Newtons third law is

For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction

The statement means that in every interaction there is a pair of forces acting on the two interacting objects The size of the forces on the first object equals the size of the force on the second object The direction of the force on the first object is opposite to the direction of the force on the second object Forces always come in pairs  equal and opposite action reaction force pairs 

A variety of action reaction force pairs are evident in nature Consider the propulsion of a fish through the water A fish uses its fins to push water backwards But a push on the water will only serve to accelerate the water Since forces result from mutual interactions the water must also be pushing the fish forwards propelling the fish through the water The size of the force on the water equals the size of the force on the fish the direction of the force on the water is opposite the direction of the force on the fish For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction force Action reaction force pairs make it possible for fish to swim

Consider the flying motion of birds A bird flies by use of its wings The wings of a bird push air downwards Since forces result from mutual interactions the air must also be pushing the bird upwards The size of the force on the air equals the size of the force on the bird the direction of the force on the air is opposite the direction of the force on the bird For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction Action reaction force pairs make it possible for birds to fly 

Consider the motion of a car on the way to school A car is equipped with wheels which spin backwards As the wheels spin backwards they grip the road and push the road backwards Since forces result from mutual interactions the road must also be pushing the wheels forward The size of the force on the road equals the size of the force on the wheels the direction of the force on the road is opposite the direction of the force on the wheels For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction Action reaction force pairs make it possible for cars to move along a roadway surface

This is about the sport You may be wanting to read about a fence

Fencing is a sport that includes two people with swords The aim is to score hits There is also a referee In the olden times when two people argued they fenced the first one to draw blood was wrong and the person would be dead so the person that won would claim the dead persons house and belongings

The foil is a light and easy to bend weapon first made in mid 17th century as a weapon for practice Hits can only be scored by hitting the right target area with the point of the sword The target area is the torso

The pe is the heaviest of the three weapons To score a hit the push button on the end of the weapon must remain fully down for 2 10 milliseconds and must arrive with a force of at least 735 newtons

The sabre is the cutting weapon with a curved guard and a triangular blade However in modern electric scoring a touch with any part of the sabre will count as a hit The target area in sabre is everything from the waist up except for the hands

Fencers wear a uniform to avoid injury They a wear mask of black mesh with a bib Also a jacket short pants and a sort of half a shirt all of white fabric They must also wear socks that cover their legs Women must wear a chest protector These are collectively called whites

Administrators are people who organize things like businesses All businesses have administrators They make decisions organize the people who work there and make sure that things are working alright and there are no problems Their work is called administration The administrators are part of the management

Administrator is also the person in charge of some of the small territories of the United Kingdom for example Ascension Island and the British Antarctic Territory which are too small to run their own government

The Geneva Conventions are a set of four treaties of international law They were formulated in Geneva Switzerland All of the four treaties are about humanitarian issues The Swiss Henri Dunant was the person who started the creation of the conventions He did this after he saw the unimaginable cruelty of the Battle of Solferino in 1859

Some parts of the four Geneva Conventions say that all states who signed must create national laws to make violations of the Geneva Conventions a crime

The conventions and their agreements are as follows

In addition there are three more protocols to the Geneva Convention

After the First Convention was agreed the International Committee of the Red Cross was founded in 1863

All four conventions were last checked and agreed in 1949 Those versions are related to previous revisions In some cases ideas from the 1907 Hague Conventions were added Usually people refer to all four conventions as the Geneva Conventions of 1949 or simply the Geneva Conventions Later conferences have added text that forbids certain methods of warfare They have also spoken about issues of civil wars Nearly all 200 countries of the world are signatory nations in that they have signed and ratified these conventions 

Clara Barton was important in campaigning for the agreement of the First Geneva Convention by the United States the US signed in 1882 By the Fourth Geneva Convention some 47 nations had ratified the agreements

International law is the law that is used when there is a conflict between countries There are two different types of international law 1 Public International Law which applies to all countries but is not enforceable 2 Private International Law which is when there is a conflict between two or more countries that broke a certain law based on the countries law It is composed of a set of treaties In recent years people have also seen international organizations like the United Nations use international law

The Hague Convention is a set of treaties signed in Den Haag in 1899 and 1907 Along with the Geneva conventions they are among the first treaties to speak about war crimes and the laws of war They are considered to be part of international law

The Hague is the third largest city in the Netherlands after Amsterdam and Rotterdam It has a population of 490000 and an area of around 100 km It is in the west of the country in the province South Holland It is the capital of the province About 1 million people live in the urban area of The Hague on about 405 square kilometers 

Den Haag is where the government meets even though it is not the capital of the Netherlands The Dutch constitution makes Amsterdam the capital The Hague is the home of the Eerste Kamer or Senaat and the Tweede Kamer These are the same as the upper and lower houses in some other countries They form the Staten Generaal The Dutch Queen Beatrix lives and works in The Hague All foreign embassies and government ministries are in the city as well as the Hoge Raad der Nederlanden and many lobbying organisations

The SAS or Special Air Service is a Special Operations Organisation of the British Army It was founded in 1941 to attack behind the German line of defence in North Africa in World War II

The SAS is a very secret organisation its members often do not tell anyone except close family that they are in it The British Ministry of Defence rarely speaks of the SAS and mission details are never released until after a set amount of time

The Badge of the organisation is a knife with wings It shows the motto Who Dares Wins

Current SAS roles include

The SAS is thought of all over the world as one of the best if not the best Special Operations organisations This is mainly because of the intense training they are put through The hardest part of this is intense interrogation which the trainees must go through

The SAS is respected worldwide and used to train many other Special Forces Units

Kookaburra Sport is an Australian company named after an Australian bird related to the kingfisher which eats snakes and is therefore very valuable to the Australians

Lancashire is a county in the North West of England Its two cities are Lancaster and Preston Before 1974 Liverpool and Manchester were part of Lancashire

The county has developed a fierce rivalry with Yorkshire the next county east This comes from rivalry in sport such as in cricket and comes from the War of the Roses

A big attraction in Lancashire is Blackpool an English seaside resort which has a theme park called Blackpool Pleasure Beach It has the second largest rollercoaster in Europe and Blackpool Tower a tower which was made to look like the Eiffel Tower in Paris

Lancashire has market towns and small villages It is just south of an area of outstanding natural beauty called the Lake District Lancashire also has a lot of pleasant countryside such as White Coppice and the Rivington Moors

A famous food from Lancashire is Lancashire Hot pot which is made of meat onion or other vegetables and potatoes It is often found on many pub menus in the county and in other places in Britain 

The people of Lancashire are known for their friendly nature Humour is also an important part of Lancashire life

The Church of England is the leading Christian church in England It is the church established by law with its formal head being the English monarch It is the mother church of the Anglican Communion 

The Church of England understands itself to be both Catholic and Reformed

There are other Protestant churches in England which are not part of the Anglican Communion

The Church of England was created by King Henry VIII in 1534 Henry VIII was married to Catherine of Aragon but asked the Pope to annul the marriage He had wanted to annul the marriage because he wanted a male heir to his throne and Catherine could not produce one When the annulment was refused Henry VIII used his position as King to break away from the Roman Catholic Church and establish the Church of England sometimes called the Anglican Church

Tense is a system of verb forms Its main job is to show when the verb happens There are three main tenses

Some languages have all three tenses some have only two and some have no tenses at all English and Japanese for example have only two common tenses past and present Obviously English verbal phrases do indicate future time but not in the form of the verb itself We only have present and past The rest including the future is done by adding auxiliaries such as be have is shall will and so on So we get the continuous present with is taking the future with will take and so on These tenses are now called aspectsp1031

Chinese and Indonesian verbs do not show tense Instead they use other words in the sentence to show when the verb happens

Many people think that tense means any verb form or even certain combinations of auxiliary verbs and other verbs For example many people say that will go is future tense or that He is loved by many is passive tense This is not technically correct

Blackpool Tower is a monument in Blackpool a North England seaside town 

It was built in the style of the Eiffel Tower In 1891 It cost 45000 is 518 ft tall and weighs 2586 tons It is mainly made from Steel and Cast Iron 

It is used as a tourist attraction and is part of the Blackpool attractions These include the tower the Golden Mile which is a row of arcades the sea and Blackpool Pleasure Beach

The oldest part of the building is the aquarium which was part of Dr Cockers Menagarie and Aquarium in the 1870s It was kept open to earn revenue while the tower building went up around it

The tower is owned by Blackpool Council

A theme park or an amusement park is a place with attractions made up of rides such as roller coasters and water rides They usually contain a selection of different types of rides along with shops restaurants and other entertainment outlets Theme parks can be enjoyed by adults teenagers and children

Many are themed to a particular area there are water parks parks modeled after toys parks modeled after films or types of films usually adventure or action

Some famous theme parks include

Kookaburras are birds of the genus Dacelo It is the best known bird of Austrailia There is even a popular song about it The kookaburra is also called the laughing jackass 

Kookaburras originally lived in Australia and New Guinea Some were brought by humans to New Zealand between 1866 and 1880 but only those that were freed by Sir George Grey on Kawau Island are still there today

Kookaburras usually eat small animals small mammals insects small birds lizards and snakes 

Kookaburras usually live in family groups Young kookaburras help their parents to hunt and care for the smaller children

Polltax is a system of taxing It is based on the idea that everyone pays the same amount of tax This is regardless of how much they earn In the last few years of Margaret Thatchers reign as British Prime minister she received heavy opposition and mass riots were held when she tried to have polltax used as the tax system

Bonn is a city near Cologne It is in the German state of North Rhine Westphalia

Bonn was founded on an old Roman settlement today it has about 310000 inhabitants

Following World War II Bonn was in the British occupation zone In 1949 Bonn was chosen as the provisional capital of West Germany

Bonn was the choice of Konrad Adenauer a former Cologne Mayor and the first Chancellor of West Germany after World War II who came from that area Frankfurt am Main had most of the needed facilities already so using Bonn meant spending about 95 Million DM to building new roads and building However Frankfurt am Main had been an important city during the war and choosing Bonn was to symbolise a new start for the new Germany

Because of its relatively small size for a capital city Bonn was sometimes jokingly called the Bundesdorf

Bonn was the capital of West Germany from 1949 until 1990 it The Bundestag voted to move to Berlin on 20 June 1991 after a heated debate The Federal President had already decided to make Schlo Bellevue in Berlin his main official residence The extra building work needed meant it was 1999 before the governments move was completed

Beethovens birth place is located at Bonngasse Next to the market place is the Old Town Hall built in 1737 in Rococo style under the rule of Clemens August of Bavaria Its used for receptions of guests of the town and as a bureau for the mayor Close by is the Kurfrstliches Schloss which has been built as a residence of the prince elector and nowadays is the main building of the University of Bonn

The Poppelsdorfer Allee an alley flanked by chestnut trees connects the Kurfrstliches Schloss with the Poppelsdorfer Schloss a palace that was built as a resort to prince electors in the first half of the 18th century This axis is interrupted by a railway line and Bonn Central Station a building erected in 188384

The three highest buildings in the city are the radio mast of WDR in Bonn Venusberg the headquarters of the Deutsche Post called Post Tower and the former building for the German members of parliament Langer Eugen which nowadays is the new location of the UN Campus

The CAF Champions League is a football competition between the best club teams in Africa The teams are selected because of good performances in matches

Copa Libertadores de America is a football competition between the best club teams in South America and Mexico The teams are qualified based on how well they did in the national tournament The last year winner has assured participation The tournament is run by Confederacin Sudamericana de Ftbol

Copa Libertadores de America is played annually It usually happens between the months of February and June Its winner is qualified for the annual FIFA Club World Cup

Libertadores starts in January with the worst classified team of each country playing for to be a part of the Main Draw In February the Main Draw begins It is made up of 8 groups with 4 clubs in each group Each team plays 6 games They play three home games and three away games The top 2 clubs in every group advance to the next round A total of 16 clubs play in the playoffs

The better qualified clubs in the Main Draw take advantage of playing the second game of each round of the playoffs at home Libertadores goes on with clubs playing home and away round after round till the Finals

Unlike European club competitions the Copa Libertadores in the past did not use extra time or away goals to decide a tie Starting with the 2005 event CONMEBOL began to use the away goals rule with the extra time used only in the final matches

A longbow is a type of bow It is not as powerful as a crossbow its advantage is that more arrows per minute can be delivered Also the basic equipment cost little and could be made almost anywhere in Europe Metal tipped arrows could pierce all but the best plate armour Archers would usually have a second weapon often an axe for close quarter fighting

The longbow was mainly used in the Middle Ages up until Henry VIIIs reign The longbow was mainly used by the English although it originated in Gwent a county in Wales 

It was made from hard wearing flexible wood The devastating hail of the longbowmen was often very demoralizing The French often cut off the forefinger and middle fingers of those that they caught This led to the archers trying to make the French angry by waggling the fingers in a two fingered salute which is today considered rude

Longbows have been found in Europe as far back as the Mesolithic period

The African Union is an international organization consisting of fifty three African member countries Founded in Durban in July 2002 the AU was formed as a replacement to the Organization of African Unity and the African Economic Community 

The AU in the future aims to have a single currency and a single integrated defense force as well as other institutions of state including a cabinet for the AU Head of State The purpose of the organization is to help secure the continents democracy human rights and a sustainable economy especially by bringing an end to conflict between African nations and creating an effective common market

The Bastille was a prison in Paris France It was destroyed during the French Revolution on July 14 1789 This event is considered the beginning of the French Revolution Today in France July 14 Fte Nationale also called Bastille Day is a national holiday

The Bastille was built during the Hundred Years War It was called the Bastion de Saint Antoine At first it was just the Saint Antoine gate but from 13701383 this gate was made bigger and became a fortress It defended the east end of Paris and the Htel Saint Pol royal palace After the war it was turned into a prison Louis XIII was the first king to send prisoners there 

The Bastille was built in a rectangle shape 70 meters long and 30 meters wide It had eight towers and walls 25 meters high with a wide moat going around the outside There were two courtyards inside and houses against the walls Pairs of towers on the east and west sides had gates through which the rue Saint Antoine passed In the 1400s these were blocked up and a new city gate was built to the north on the present day rue de la Bastille A bastion on the eastern side was built later The walls and towers were of the same height and width and joined by a broad path Soldiers on the wall could move quickly to any part of the fortress without having to climb down inside the towers It also meant that there was enough room for placing artillery A similar design can be seen today at Chteau de Tarascon

As a prison the Bastille held common criminals such as forgers and thieves as well as people put in prison for religious reasons such as the Huguenots There were also people who had for printed or written things against the government or the King People of high rank were sometimes held there too The prison which could only hold about 50 prisoners was not as bad most of the prisons in Paris But secrecy about the prison and its prisoners gave it an evil reputation 

The people of Paris attacked the Bastille on 14 July 1789 following several days of protests They were after the gunpowder and weapons that were kept at the prison They were not attacking the Bastille to free the seven prisoners inside The prison was guarded by about 80 invalides led by Governor Bernard Ren de Launay There was also an extra group of 32 grenadiers from one of the Swiss mercenary regiments brought to Paris by the King shortly before 14 July

A crowd of around 8000 men and women were outside the Bastille by mid morning They wanted the guards to give up the prison remove the artillery guns and give them the gunpowder and weapons Two people chosen to represent those outside were invited into the fortress to talk with the Governor

At about 100pm the crowd broke into the undefended outer courtyard and the chains on the drawbridge to the inner courtyard were cut There was some gunfire but by mid afternoon the crowd was supported by mutinous Gardes Franaises of the Royal Army and two cannons De Launay ordered his guards to stop shooting and he gave up the fortress The crowd swept into the Bastille at about 530pm

The crowd took the weapons gunpowder and freed the seven prisoners They had to break down the doors because the keys had already been taken and shown in the streets Even though they had surrendered the Governor and some of the guards of the Bastille were killed Their heads were cut off stuck onto long poles and marched through the streets

The propaganda value of the Bastille was quickly seen by Pierre Franois Palloy Patriote Palloy He got together a group of men to begin pulling down the fortress by the next day People paid him to view the site and he sold off pieces as souvenirs By November 1789 the Bastille was largely pulled down The cut stones of the fortress were used to build the Pont de la Concorde

The site of the Bastille is now called the Place de la Bastille It is home to the Opra Bastille The large moat behind the fort has been turned into a marina for boats the Bassin de lArsenal To the north a covered canal the Canal Saint Martin goes under the road along the edge of the site

The remains of one tower of the fort were found during digging for the Mtro in 1899 These were moved to a park the Square Henri Galli a few hundred meters away The outline of the fort is also marked on the streets and sidewalks with special paving stones A cafe and some other businesses are now on the site of the fort and the rue Saint Antoine passes directly over it as it opens onto the roundabout of the Bastille

Cable television is a way of letting people watch television without having to get signals from an antenna The television signals are brought to the television through a cable People usually have to pay to subscribe to cable television With cable television people can watch hundreds of television channels You can have fun watching things for example cartoons shows movies idols news and more

An antenna or aerial is an electronic device designed to send or receive signals that have specific frequency Some electronic devices like radio television radar wireless LAN need antennas to work Antennas work properly in air or outer space Antennas length is usually up to the wavelength it uses

The word antenna is from Guglielmo Marconis test with wireless equipment in 1895 For the test He used a 25 meter long pole antenna with a tent pole called lantenna centrale in Italian So his antenna was simply called lantenna  After that the term antenna became popular among people and had the meaning it has today

There are many antenna models and each antenna has different purpose For example The isotropic radiator is a imaginary antenna that sends signals equally in all directions The dipole antenna is simply two wires with one end of each wire connected to the radio and the other end hanging free in space The Horn is used where high gain is needed the wavelength is short

Jack London was a writer who wrote many books He lived in the US state of California but also spent a lot of time in Hawaii and Alaska

His most famous book was The Call of the Wild The Call of the Wild is about a dog named Buck who is taken to Alaska to work with a pack of dogs pulling a sled This book took place during the Gold Rush Many people bought The Call of the Wild and Jack London became a famous writer

He also wrote other books about dogs and wolves Another one of his famous books is White Fang

Jack London was also a hobo at one time He wrote a book about this called The Road Jack London had political beliefs He was a socialist One of his famous books is The Iron Heel which is the story of the government using force against the socialist movement

Spacetime is a model in physics that joins the three dimensional space and one dimensional time into the idea of space time continuum Combining these two ideas helped physicists to make many laws of physics easier to understand and to explain how the universe works on the big level and small level

The actual number of dimensions in spacetime is not fixed but usually spacetime means a four dimensional spacetime Some other theories claim that there are more than four dimensions

Many people link spacetime with Albert Einstein who found special relativity However it was Einsteins teacher Hermann Minkowski who suggested this idea He hoped this new idea would clarify the theory of special relativity

In general relativity spacetime is curved by the existence of matter energy and momentum as said by the Einstein field equations

Many continuous space time leads to strange physical understanding For this reason many mathematical physicists study only seemingly real set of spacetime

In general relativity spacetime is thought as smooth and continuous However in the theory of quantum mechanics spacetime is not always continuous

Yank can be thought as a force in terms of jerk Force is mass times acceleration Similarly Yank is mass times jerk It is also the derivative of the force However when an object is moving near the speed of light a force is often written as the derivative of momentum In this case Yank is the rate of change of derivative of momentum

Jerk is used in engineering more than ever in making roller coasters Weak objects such as people can be damaged by high acceleration or high jerk Also jerk must be thought in the process of making any product Sudden change in acceleration means very large jerk This leads to a tool to be damaged faster

Jerk is also a mean name to call a mean person or an idiom for ugly behaviour 

The SI unit of electric current is the ampere This is equal to one coulomb of charge in one second Current can be found in wires batteries and lightning

In conducting materials some electrons are very loosely bound to the atoms of the material When large amounts of these atoms come together there is a sort of electron cloud that hovers near the atoms of the material If you examine a cross section of the piece of conducting material the electrons will move very quickly through it This motion is caused by temperature and electrons flowing in one direction tend to equal the electrons flowing from the other direction so this is not what causes current to flow Electrons flow from one atom to another a process has been compared to the passing of water buckets from one person to another in a bucket brigade

When an electric field is put on the wire the electrons respond almost instantly by drifting slightly in the opposite direction of the field They gain energy from the field which is lost very quickly when they bump into other electrons in the material As long as the field is in place however the electrons will gain back that energy that they lost and the process will continue This jolt that electrons receive from the electric field is the source of current not the overall flow of electrons themselves From this discussion we can see two things that current is not

When current is flowing in a wire circuit it accelerates when there is no resistance in the circuit Resistors are used to increase resistance in the circuit so it slows down the current The relationship between resistance current and voltage is shown by Ohms law

Inbreeding is a term in genetics meaning the crossing of closely related animals or plants Selfing used to describe self fertilisation in plants is the most extreme kind of inbreeding It is quite widespread in plants which carry both male and female flowers on the same plant Inbreeding is the opposite of outcrossing which is the mating of unrelated members of the same species

Other terms are inbred strain a group of organisms so inbred that they have little or no genetic variation and inbreeding depression which is the decreased fitness brought about by inbreeding

For human beings inbreeding is a very destructive trait and almost all cultures in the world have attempted to restrict inbreeding eg by prohibiting marriages between first cousins The ultimate form of inbreeding is called incest It is mating with blood relatives within the family

Loss of genetic variation means that many gene loci that were heterozygous are now homozygous The result of both genes at a locus being mutant can be serious 

The most intense form of inbreeding is the self fertilisation in an hermaphrodite in which the proportion of heterozygotes is halved in each generationp139 Aa x Aa gives 1 AA 2 Aa 1 aa and so on A similar effect takes twice as long with brother sister mating and longer still with mating in very small isolated groups The latter situation is famous because Sewall Wright did his calculations for just such groups and he called the process genetic drift Genetic drift and inbreeding are closely related concepts

The degree of inbreeding can be measured in various ways A simple test for mammals is the exchange of skin grafts If the skin grafts are not rejected the two animals must be nearly identical genetical Skin grafts can be successfully exchanged between rats in standard laboratory strains and between cheetahs caught in the wild

Why is it that inbreeding brings about a loss of viability There are two answers and both seem to be true The first is that a group with little genetic variation is vulnerable to environmental challenges infections sudden climate events predators Small groups are vulnerable to chance events in any case but with no heritable variability they are even more vulnerable

The second explanation is genetic Some of the homozygous genes will be deleterious recessives which would normally be shielded by a dominant allele Also there are some loci where the heterozygote is inherently fitter than either homozygote If so inbreeding will automatically cause a loss of vigourp103

Many plant species self fertilise in the wild but the great majority have occasional outcrossing This provides them with sufficient variety for their survival

Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a book written by Mark Twain published in 1884 It is a sequel to his earlier book Tom Sawyer 

After The Adventures of Tom Sawyer Huck was adopted by the widow Douglas who wants to civilize him and so he joined Toms band of robbers

One day Hucks father Pap a violent drunkard appears in St Petersburg When a new judge arrives Pap gains custody of his son and moves to a cabin on the other side of the river Huck is kept locked but fakes his own death and hides on Jacksons Island a small island on the river There he meets Miss Watsons black slave Jim who ran away

When they find a raft they decide to go to a free state After a storm a house is floating down the river and they enter it and grab what they can Inside there is a dead man shot in the back and Jim prevents Huck from seeing the dead mans face

Huck dresses as a girl and returns to town because he wants to hear whats going on in town A woman tells that Jim is considered to be Hucks murderer Moreover she is suspicious about Hucks true sex and reveals that he is a boy Huck returns to the island and together with Jim he flees downriver

After some time on the river they are separated by a passing steaming boat and Huck meets the Grangerfords a rich family He befriends with Buck Grangerford who is about his age The Grangerfords are in a 30 year feud against the Shepherdsons another rich family along the Mississippi When a conflict breaks out all Grangerford males are killed Huck can escape and reunites with Jim Together they float further downriver

Later they rescue two con men who join the boys on their journey They pull several scams along the river Once they pretend to be a dead mans brothers and escape after their true identities are revealed

Later the elder one sells Jim Huck finds out that Jim is now owned by the Phelps He decides to free him and pretends to be the Phelps nephew Tom Sawyer When the real Tom arrives he plays along

Jim is held in a shed and Tom has a risky escape plan As they carry out their plan Tom is shot in the leg While Huck gets help Jim remains with Tom When they return to the farm Jim is recaptured while Tom is unconscious

When Tom awakes he reveals that Jim had been free for weeks after his owner died two months ago He did not tell Huck because he wanted a risky plan to rescue Jim Furthermore Toms Aunt Polly arrives and reveals Hucks and Toms real identities Moreover Jim tells that Pap was the dead man on the floating house Finally Huck decides to go West

Adventures of Huckleberry Finn received often good reviews but the novel was controversial from the beginning When the American edition came out in 1885 some libraries banned it Today many people feel that the book attacks racism and shows that it is bad Others criticize the book because it shows things like slavery and uses words like nigger They also think that although Jim is not meant to be a bad character he has some stereotypes of that time

Typical measurement units for the equation are

In mathematics two things are equal when they are the same That is they have the same value and the same mathematical properties Mathematicians use the equals operator to say this x y is obviously the same as y x Equations are equal Inequalities are unequal   In mathematical logic the equivalence relation is defined as follows Given any logic predicate P x y only if P P In other words if you find a predicate that has a different truth value when it is applied to either the variable x or the variable y then the two cannot be equal 

Since a predicate is a way of describing something that is true another way to say this is that if you can find something that is true about one variable but not true about the other variable then they are not equal as far as mathematical logic is concerned

Here is a simple way of saying that if two things are equal anything that is true about one of them has to be true about the other one    In geometry the word congruence is often preferred Numbers are equal geometrical objects are congruent Two shapes are congruent if one can be moved or rotated so that it fits exactly where the other one is If you have to shrink or enlarge one of the two objects they are not congruent They are called similar   In Computer Science usually the mathematical definition is used Very often the comparison is written In object oriented languages or languages which have pointers there is an additional problem Those languages contain references If two such references do not reference exactly the same object they are different a b will be false for this case

For this reason many such languages have introduced another operator This operator compares the actual values of the objects not where the variables that reference them point to

   In social sciences two people are equal if many of the same things are true about them Two people who have the same amount of education and money and are the same age usually think of each other as equals Another name for a person who is equal to another person is a peer

Radioactive decay is the process where the nucleus of an atom changes into another type of nucleus and produces a particle at the same time Nuclei which change like this are called radioactive or unstable This change happens to the nucleus of an atom Most atoms on earth are not radioactive but atoms with more or less neutrons than a stable atom that is different isotopes of the same element can be radioactive For example most carbon atoms in the world have six protons and six neutrons in their nucleus This carbon is called carbon 12 because 12 is the number of protons and neutrons Carbons atomic weight is 12 If two more neutrons are added to carbon 12 it becomes carbon 14 Carbon 14 is still chemically carbon because carbon is defined by having six protons which it still does even after the addition of more neutrons In fact carbon 14 exists in all living things that contain carbon such as animals and plants However it is radioactive 

Radioactive decay always changes the type of atom from an isotope that has higher energy inside its nucleus to an isotope with lower energy in its nucleus The difference in energy between the nucleus before and after the decay is given to the particles created in the decay to increase their speed or kinetic energy Energy is never created or destroyed in radioactive decay

Alpha decay beta decay and gamma decay are the most common types of radioactive decay They are different from each other because different types of decay produce different particles The starting radioactive nucleus is called the parent nucleus and the nucleus that it changes into is called the daughter nucleus The high energy particles produced by radioactive materials are called radiation 

Beta plus decay happens inside the sun and in some types of particle accelerators

Gamma decay happens when a nucleus produces a high energy packet of energy called a gamma ray Gamma rays do not have electrical charge but they do have angular momentum Gamma rays are usually emitted from nuclei immediately after other types of decay Gamma rays can be used to analyze radioactive materials to kill bacteria in food to find some types of disease and to treat some kinds of cancer Gamma rays have the highest energy of any electromagnetic wave and gamma ray bursts in space are the most energetic releases of energy known to people even more than supernovas

Nicotine is a drug found in tobacco cigarettes cigars pipe tobacco and chewing tobacco Nicotine is an addictive stimulant that causes the heart to beat faster and makes blood pressure rise It can also make a person feel less hungry and speeds up the metabolism These effects can be very unhealthy Many people who use tobacco products want to quit but have a hard time quitting

Nicotine is a substance found in most members of the Nightshade family of plants Small quantities of it can also be found in tomatos potatoes aubergines and green pepper Nicotine is also present in the Coca plant In higher quantities it is a very efficient poison It acts on the nerves It is a stimulant in lower quantities It is one of the main reasons people are addicted to smoking 

Nicotine is named after Jean Nicot Nicot was an French ambassador in Portugal He had some tobacco seeds sent to Paris for analysis

Besides the treatment of nicotine dependency it seems that the drug can also be used to treat special forms of epilepsy as well as some other diseases 

Normally one cigarette contains 07mg of nicotine ImageNicotine 2D skeletalpngNicotine schematic ImageNicotinequtemolpng nicotine molecule might look like this 

Addiction is when the body or mind badly wants or needs something in order to work right When you have addiction to something it is called being addicted or being an addict People can be addicted to drugs cigarettes alcohol caffeine and many other things 

When somebody is addicted to something they can become sick if they do not get the thing they are addicted to But taking more of the thing they are addicted to can also hurt their health Some people who are addicts need to go to a doctor or hospital to cure the addiction so they no longer crave the drug

Addiction takes place when the addictive element enters the body The blood stream moves the element around the body so that it gets to the brain and makes the person feel that they are enjoying it then they want more of that substance This takes place remarkably fast for some addictions such as hashish and cocaine but all of them control the consumer Once under this control the consumer does not have a completely free will and listens to the addictions bidding

People can also be addicted to other things which are not drugs You may hear people talk about being addicted to the Internet or addicted to chocolate This means that they get into a habit of enjoying that thing so if they have to go without it for a while they miss it a lot 

Secession usually means when part of one country breaks away or leaves that country to start a new country During the American Civil War eleven southern states declared their secession from the United States

New England is a part in the north of the United States It is a region in the northeast part of the US There are six states in the New England region These states are Maine Vermont New Hampshire Massachusetts Connecticut and Rhode Island In the early days their economy was mostly made of fishing New England is not a official group of states

Rockville is a small town in the US state of Virginia It is located in Hanover county near Richmond Virginia Rockville is mainly a farming town It got its name from nearby rock quarries

An Intelligence quotient or IQ is a number This number is the score of one of several standardized tests designed to assess the intelligence of an individual The term IQ comes from the German word Intelligenz Quotient It was coined by the German psychologist William Stern in 1912 as a proposed method of scoring Intelligence tests for children developed in the early 20th century Alfred Binet and Thodore Simon proposed this method The term IQ is still in common use but modern IQ tests use a different method of scoring The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale for example is based on the projection of the subjects measured rank on the Gaussian bell The bell curve used has a center value of 100 and a standard deviation of 15 other tests may have different standard deviations 

It could be shown that IQ scores have an association with other factors such as morbidity and mortality the social status of the parents and to a big degree parental IQ While its inheritance has been investigated for nearly a century controversy remains as to how much is inheritable and the mechanisms of inheritance are still a matter of some debate

IQ scores are used in many contexts as predictors of educational achievement or special needs by social scientists who study the distribution of IQ scores in populations and the relationships between IQ score and other variables and as predictors of job performance and income 

The average IQ scores for many populations have been rising at an average rate of three points per decade since the early 20th century with most of the increase in the lower half of the IQ range a phenomenon called the Flynn effect It is disputed whether these changes in scores reflect real changes in intellectual abilities or merely methodological problems with past or present testing

There are a number of problem with Intelligence Quotients They relate to different fields of the subject The problems can be grouped

Alfred Bineta French psychologist who had designed one of the first such tests in 1905 had this opinion He used the test to see which pupils would need special help with the school curriculum He believed that the test scales were not able to measure intelligence

He argued that with good education programs most students could catch up and perform quite well in school This was independent of the background of the pupil He did not believe that intelligence was a measurable fixed entity

Binet cautioned

Some scientists dispute psychometrics entirely Harvard professor and paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould argued that intelligence tests were based on faulty assumptions and showed their history of being used as the basis for scientific racism He wrote

In his opinion the General intelligence factor g is simply a mathematical artifact

According to Dr C George Boeree of Shippensburg University intelligence is a persons capacity to acquire knowledge apply knowledge and engage in abstract reasoning It is the power of ones intellect and as such is clearly a very important aspect of ones overall well being Psychologists have attempted to measure it for well over a century

Several other ways of measuring intelligence have been proposed Daniel Schacter Daniel Gilbert and others have moved beyond general intelligence and IQ as the sole means to describe intelligence

The American Psychological Associations report Intelligence Knowns and Unknowns states that IQ tests as predictors of social achievement are not biased against people of African descent since they predict future performance such as school achievement similarly to the way they predict future performance for European descent

However IQ tests may well be biased when used in other situations A 2005 study stated that differential validity in prediction suggests that the WAIS R test may contain cultural influences that reduce the validity of the WAIS R as a measure of cognitive ability for Mexican American students indicating a weaker positive correlation relative to sampled white students Other recent studies have questioned the culture fairness of IQ tests when used in South Africa Standard intelligence tests such as the Stanford Binet are often inappropriate for children with autism and dyslexia the alternative of using developmental or adaptive skills measures are relatively poor measures of intelligence in autistic children and have resulted in incorrect claims that a majority of children with autism are mentally retarded

A 2006 paper argues that mainstream contemporary test analysis does not reflect substantial recent developments in the field and bears an uncanny resemblance to the psychometric state of the art as it existed in the 1950s It also claims that some of the most influential recent studies on group differences in intelligence in order to show that the tests are unbiased use outdated methodology

Some argueWhodateAugust 2009 that IQ scores are used as an excuse for not trying to reduce poverty or otherwise improve living standards for all Claimed low intelligence has historically been used to justify the feudal system and unequal treatment of women In contrast others claim that the refusal of high IQ elites to take IQ seriously as a cause of inequality is itself immoral

In response to the controversy surrounding The Bell Curve the American Psychological Associations Board of Scientific Affairs established a task force in 1995 to write a consensus statement on the state of intelligence research which could be used by all sides as a basis for discussion The full text of the report is available through several websites

The APA journal that published the statement American Psychologist subsequently published eleven critical responses in January 1997 several of them arguing that the report failed to examine adequately the evidence for partly genetic explanations

Dead Calm is a novel that was written in 1963 It is also a movie released in 1989 that starred Sam Neill Nicole Kidman and Billy Zane

The melting point of a substance is the temperature at which this substance goes from the solid state to the liquid one at a normal pressure 

When looking at when a liquid substance becomes solid most people call this the freezing point For most substances like water this is the same as the melting point There are substances where this is not the case Agar seems to melt at 85 Celsius but freeze at between 35C and 40C Physicists call this phenomenon hysteresis For water this is 0 Celsius

If you add sugar salt or any other impurities to the water it will usually make the melting point lower An exception is alcohol which will have a higher melting point

Michael Hayden became the head of the CIA in America in 2006 On 24 May 2006 he was voted as the new head of the CIA by the United States Senate He was the director of the NSA from 1999 to 2005 The NSA and CIA are both spy agencies He has worked as a spy since 1970

Wittenberg is a town in Germany It lies in the eastern part of Saxony Anhalt Wittenberg became one of the most important German towns of political cultural historical and artistic advances in the 16th century The famous reformation places in the old town and the buildings developed in different epochs make up the architecture of the town Many people travel to Wittenberg because of its past and its connection to Martin Luther who worked there

Wittenberg has about 46000 inhabitants Its geographical coordinates are 51 52 N 12 39 E

Cyber stalking is when someone is using the Internet to stalk or harass someone Cyber stalking is illegal in some countries

Stalking is following someone around in a way that makes them feel hunted or not safe in some other way It is not just one event but an ongoing process that threatens or makes that person feel scared Someone who does this is called a stalker The stalker may do this because they want to be involved in that persons life or because they want to have power over that persons life The stalker can hurt that persons feelings by making them scared They may feel they do not have the power to stop the stalker Psychologists say stalking is a way of hurting someones mind with serious effects Sometimes a stalker may go on to hurt that persons body by assaulting raping or murdering that person

Cyber stalking is when the stalker uses the Internet to contact or follow that person The stalker may make direct contact with that person they may send nasty messages to that person or spread lies about them to others Sometimes stalkers use the Internet to learn more about the other person They might find their address phone number workplace or photograph Then they might use this information to do more stalking or find other ways to hurt that person on the Internet or hurt their body

The person who is stalked on the Internet may feel they have more power if they can simply delete emails or turn their computer connection off Or they may feel they have less power if they do not know who the stalker is

Current could mean

Voltage is the change in electric potential between two positions The voltage is always measured between two points for example between the positive and negative ends of a battery or between a wire and ground It is measured in volts 

It was named after an Italian physicist Alessandro Volta who made the first chemical battery Many other languages uses a word that means electric tension for voltage

The voltage can be seen as the pressure on the electrons to move out of the source the higher the voltage the higher the pressure for example a battery of 3 volt will push on the electrons twice as hard as a battery of 15 volt

The voltage can push the electrons into a component for example a resistor creating a current Usually the voltage and the current are related by a formula for example in a resistor when the voltage doubles the current also doubles

Note that there must both voltage and current to get power for example a wire can have a high voltage on it but unless its connected nothing will happen

There are two types of voltage DC or AC The DC voltage always have the same polarity for example in a battery The AC voltage alternate between positive and negative for example the voltage from the wall socket changes polarity 60 times per second The DC is typically used for electronics and the AC for motors

Some of the tools for measuring the voltage are the voltmeter and the oscilloscope

The voltmeter measures the voltage between two points and can be set to the DC mode or the AC mode The voltmeter can measure the DC voltage of a battery for example or the AC voltage from the power socket on the wall

For more complex signals an oscilloscope can be used the measured the DC andor AC voltage for example to measure the voltage across a speaker

An hourglass also known as a sandglass or sand timer is a tool for the measurement of time

A stopwatch is a tool used to measure the amount of time something takes For example to learn how soon a car can reach 60 miles per hour or how much time it takes a runner to run 40 yards These days stopwatches are even installed in digital watches You press a button to start the time and press it again to stop the time The time is displayed on the screen of it It even tells you the millisecond

Notes

Macro sociology is a way of looking at the world of people in a broad way It studies mass of many peoples It is about concerned with human societies Macrosociology is considered one of the main foundations of sociology 

In sociology there are different levels of analysis Macro sociology is the analysis of either large collectivities or more abstractly of social systems and social structures

With the perspective of macro sociology it is possible to better understand societies culture groups and organizations

Important representatives of macro sociological theories are

The flag of Poland is rectangular divided into two stripes white above red It was created in its modern form in 1921 The colors white and red were earlier declared the official national colors in 1831 by the Polish Parliament in 1831

For many centuries the Polish flag was a white eagle on a red background

The ratio of height to width is 5 to 8 The two horizontal stripes are of equal height

There is a second version which has a coat of arms in the upper half The use of this flag is legally restricted

If the flag is shown hanging vertically the white should be on the left

Polish flag day is May 2

The exact color of the red was not clearly stated originally and has changed through the years In 1919 the official act did not clearly define the red In 1921 the Polish Ministry of Military Affairs used crimson as the shade of red in publications In 1928 the president of Poland said the red should be vermilion That was used until 1980 when people needed to specify the red more scientifically

The same flag design is used in the German region Thuringia and the Spanish region Cantabria

Both Indonesia and Monaco have flags that are the same colors but upside down

Quantum Computation is a way of computation that is very different from todays computers Todays computers called classical computers store information in bits each bit is either on or off Quantum computation use qbits which can in addition to being possibly on or off can be in between on and off Only very simple quantum computers have been built although larger designs have been invented It uses a special type of physics quantum physics 

Quantum computers are a lot more powerful than any classical computerAny classical computer does one computation per step but a Quantum computer can do 2n computations per step

Elastic potential energy is stored in objects that are stretched compressed bent or twisted It is the energy that represents the elastic distortion of a solid or a fluid It is mainly used in physics

Examples of everyday objects that have Elastic potential energy would be elastic bands springs bungee cords car shocks etc Hookes Law is one of the primary concepts needed to understand how Elastic Potential Energy works Any spring that obeys Hookes law is called an ideal spring  

Hookes Law  the magnitude of the force exerted by a spring is directly proportional to the distance the spring has moved from equilibrium

Ideal spring  a spring that obeys Hookes law because it experiences no internal or external friction

For example Consider a spring at its equilibrium position that has one end attached to a wall If the spring is then stretched away from the wall the force exerted by the spring pulls the spring back towards the wall On the other hand if the spring is compressed towards the wall the force exerted by the spring is working in the opposite direction of the applied force and pushes away from the wall This is what Hookes law is trying to explain  

Equilibrium position  The position at which the spring rests

where 

The force constant is the proportionality constant of the spring Springs that require a large force to stretch or compress them have large k values 

Note Hookes law applies to any elastic device that follows its conditions It is not specifically dependent on just springs The equation for the Force exerted by the spring is different than the energy being stored by the spring

where Ee is the elastic potential energy x is the position of the spring relative to the equilibrium position and k is the force constant for the spring

Note The Elastic Potential Energy equation is very similar to Hookes Spring Force equation Hookes Spring Force equation is actually used to derive the Elastic Potential Energy equation

The Transrapid is a high speed train developed in Germany It uses magnetic levitation It can go very fast up to 500kmh Since now it is only used in Shanghai It is developed by the company TRANSRAPID INTERNATIONAL GmbH Co KG a company of the Siemens AG and the ThyssenKrupp AG 

The most basic definition of torque in physics is a turning or twisting force If a force is used to begin to spin an object or to stop an object from spinning a torque is made

The force applied to a lever multiplied by the distance from the levers fulcrum is described as torque 

Fulcrum is the axis of rotation or point of support on which a lever turns in raising or moving something

The equation for torque is

 r x F 

where F is the force vector and r is the vector from the axis of rotation to the point where the force is acting 

Note The SI unit of torque is the newton metre The most common English unit is the foot pound

Scalar  quantities with magnitudes Vector  quantities with magnitudes and direction

Warm is the opposite of cool

When objects get warm more energy is stored in them When an object is heated its molecules move faster Heat always goes from a warmer object to a colder object it never goes in the oppoiste way A person usually feels good when they are warm but they do not like to be too warm as this may become uncomfortable

The University of Leeds is a university in Leeds West Yorkshire UK It first started in 1831 with the opening of a school to teach medicine which was one of the first outside of London Oxford and Cambridge

Today Leeds is the most popular university in the UK and one of the countrys leading universities The university is one of two in the city the other being Leeds Metropolitan University The main campus is in the Woodhouse area of Leeds close to Leeds City Centre

The main campus is situated in the Woodhouse area of Leeds which is about half a mile from the city centre The campus has many older Victorial buildings such as the Great Hall as well as some mid twentieth century buildings such as the Parkinson Building There are also many brutalist building on campus sich as the Roger Stevens Building and the Edward Boyle Library In recent years newer buildings have been added such as the Marjorie and Arnold Ziff Building

Leeds is a city in the county of West Yorkshire in the centre of England It is one of the largest cities in the United Kingdom and about 443247 people live here Leeds has two universities University of Leeds and Leeds Metropolitan University Leeds is on the River Aire

In Roman times Leeds was called Loidis which means People of the flowing river

Leeds grew into a large city mainly during Victorian times many factories were built in the city producing cloth as well as other products Most of these factories have now closed

With the building of many of the factories and mills in Leeds many canals and railways were built in the city as well 

Leeds used to have a tram system but this was removed in 1959 There has been plans to bring it back Trolleybuses have also been considered

Marks and Spencers started with a market stall in Leeds Market Marks and Spencers now have shops throughout the city with their largest one being on Briggate

Much of Leeds was rebuilt in the 1960s and 1970s as the old Victorian buildings were mostly run down and unsuitable for modern use Many new council houses and flats were built around the city

In the 1970s the council used the moto Motorway City of the 1970s to try promote the city This is because the Leeds Inner Ring Road is a motorway

Today Leeds still has many factories and offices for large companies The City Centre has attracted many shops offices pubs restaurants and bars Leeds now has some skyscrapers such as Bridgewater Place Leeds and Manchester are the most important cities for business in the North of England Many banks have their offices in Leeds

Many flats have also been built in the city centre Leeds has some expensive areas to live like Chapel Allerton Headingley Kirkstall Horsforth Roundhay and Alwoodley but it also has some cheap places to liver where crime is high like Harehills Chapeltown Seacroft and Beeston There has been riots in Harehills and Chapeltown before

Tetleys Bitter is made at a brewery in Leeds This is sold in many pubs and shops in Britain Tetleys also used to have many pubs in Yorkshire but have sold many although Tetleys Bitter is still sold there

ASDA is Britains second biggest supermarket and started in Leeds it still has its headquarters in the city

Leeds has a large railway station in the City Centre as well as many smaller ones in suburbs There is also an airport near the city called Leeds Bradford International Airport There are many motorways in and around the city as well Leeds has a bus station with 26 stands and more stands for National Express services going to other cities it is however too small to cope with internal buses and so they stop at bus stops along the streets Leeds has an outer ring road and an inner ring road which is a motorway and goes through many tunnels to avoid buildings

Leeds is famous for its sport too It has a Rugby league team called Leeds Rhinos and a Rugby union team called Leeds Tykes It also has a football team called Leeds United Yorkshire Cricket play in Leeds too The forth test of the 2009 Ashes was hoasted at the Headingley Stadium in Leeds

Leeds City Council are the council for Leeds as well as other nearby towns that are part of the City of Leeds borough such as Wetherby Otley Yeadon Garforth and Rothwell

The Yorkshire Evening Post is the local newspaper for Leeds and is published every evening BBC Yorkshire Yorkshire Television and Leeds Television both have their studios in Leeds The Yorkshire Television studios are currently in the process of being downsized as ITV looks to reduce costs

The strong interaction one of the four basic forces is a force that acts between particles in the nucleus of an atom It is what holds the nucleus together Under the new theory called QCD the strong force is carried by a particle called the gluon The strong force is about 167 trillion trillion trillion times as strong as gravity and works over 1 trillionth of a millimeter There are two types of strong force left over and basic

Fundamental or color strong force is the nuclear force that acts between the three quarks that a proton or neutron is made of It is called the color strong force because like the electomagnetic force the strong force has charges The major difference though is that while the electromagnetic force has two types of charges the strong force has three These three types of charges are named after colors they are red blue and green Like the electromagnetic force opposite colors attract and the same colors repel Some particals that have color charge are quarks and antiquarks The type of quark is not related to that quarks color charge at all Quarks are one of the smallest particles currently known to humans they take up no space because they are points and the only particles that we have not been able to break apart from other particles yet The force carrier of the strong force is the gluon The gluons also have color charge Both quarks and gluons have properties that make them unique from other particles

Residual strong force is the type of strong force that acts between hadrons It is what holds the nucleus of an atom together Alpha decay is a result of the residual strong force This force is carried by pions which are made of one quark and one antiquark Protons and neutrons are some of the particles that experience it Each of these three particles has unique properties as well

Neuwied is a German town in Rhineland Palatinate It is on the northwest side of the Rhine River about convert10kmmi1lkonabbron northwest from Koblenz About 70000 people live there

The 865 square kilometres of area are divided in the districts of

Neuwied is connected to the German network of Bundesstraen The Autobahnen A3 A48 and A61 are quickly reachable from Neuwied Using the Koblenz main station all rhine railways and the Intercity network of Germany are available

There is a lot of industry in Neuwied for example the production of building materials metals and big sized machines

Brittany is a region in Northwest France In Breton it is called Breizh and in French Bretagne Today the official administrative region has 4 departments

Before 1941 a fifth dpartement was part of Brittany Loire Atlantique The five departements are called historical Brittany

Brittany is situated in the West of France and its coastline juts out into the Atlantic Warmed by the Gulf Stream Brittany has a mild and temperate climate with warm summers and wet winters

Three languages are traditionally spoken in Brittany

The capital of Brittany is Rennes a lively city in the Ille et Vilaine department

Brittany is the home of the worlds largest collection of standing stones in one place the Carnac stones

The Standard Model of physics is a theory of the elementary particles which are either fermions or bosons It also explains three of the four basic forces of nature The Model uses the parts of physics called quantum mechanics and special relativity and the ideas of physical field and symmetry breaking Some of the mathematics of the Standard Model is group theory and also as equations that have biggest and smallest points called Lagrangians and Hamiltonians

  

Fermions are particles that join together to make up all matter we see Examples of groups of fermions are the proton and the neutron Fermions have properties such as charge and mass which can be seen in everyday life They also have other properties such as spin weak charge hypercharge and colour charge whose effects do not usually appear in everyday life These properties are given numbers called quantum numbers 

Fermions are particles whose spin numbers equal an odd positive number times one half 12 32 52 etc We say that fermions have half integer spin

An important fact about fermions is that they follow a rule called the Pauli exclusion principle This rule says that no two fermions can be in the same place at the same time because no two fermions in an atom can have the same quantum numbers at the same time Fermions also obey a theory called Fermi Dirac statistics The word fermion honors the physicist Enrico Fermi

There are 12 different types of fermions Each type is called a flavor Their names are

Quarks are grouped into three pairs Each pair is called a generation The first quark in each pair has charge 23 and the second quark has charge 13 The three kinds of neutrino have a charge of 0 The electron muon and tau have charge 1

Matter is made of atoms and atoms are made of electrons protons and neutrons Protons and neutrons are made of up and down quarks You can find one lepton by itself but you can never find quarks alone This is because quarks are held together by the color force

Bosons are the second type of elementary particle in the Standard Model All bosons have an integer spin so many of them can be in the same place at the same time There are two types of bosons gauge bosons and the Higgs boson Gauge bosons are what make the fundamental forces of nature possible Every force that acts on fermions happens because gauge bosons are moving between the fermions carrying the force Bosons follow a theory called Bose Einstein statistics The word boson honors the Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose

The Standard Model says that there are

These particles have all been seen either in nature or in the laboratory The Standard Model also predicts that there is a Higgs boson The Standard Model says that fermions have mass because Higgs bosons travel back and forth between them The Higgs boson is the only elementary particle in the Standard Model that physicists have not yet found

There are four basic known forces of nature These forces affect fermions and are carried by bosons traveling between those fermions The Standard Model explains three of these four forces

The strong and weak forces are only seen inside the nucleus of an atom and they only work over very tiny distances distances that are about as far as a proton is wide The electromagnetic force and gravity work over any distance but the strength of these forces goes down as the affected objects get farther apart The force goes down with the square of the distance between the affected objects for example if two objects become 2 times as far away from each other the force of gravity between them becomes 4 times less strong

Moldovan is the official language of the Republic of Moldova It is the same as the Romanian language The main difference is that Moldavan is sometimes written in Cyrillic alphabet because the Moldavian SSR was part of the Soviet Union until 1989 In 1989 Moldova became its own country and they started to use the Latin alphabet just like in Romania Still the Moldovan government officially calls the language Moldovan and the rules for the language are decided by a different University than in Romania

Dependent areas are territories and overseas territories that do not possess full independence or sovereignty as statescountries There are varying degrees and forms of such a dependence They are commonly distinguished from subnational entities in that they are not considered to be part of the motherland or mainland of the governing state and in most cases they also represent a different order of separation A subnational entity typically represents a division of the country proper while a dependent territory might be an overseas territory that enjoys a greater degree of autonomy For instance many of them have a more or less separate legal system from the governing body

All these are as such or as part of a Commonwealth state in personal union under the same British Monarch

The smallest island entities belong to the United States Minor Outlying Islands

Electrical resistance is the repulsion of a current within a circuit It explains the relationship between voltage and ampere 

Electromagnetic induction is where a current is produced in a conductor through a changing magnetic flux

The changing magnetic flux generates an electromotive force This force then pushes free electrons in a certain way which in turn creates a current

where

N is the number of loops in the solenoid

The negative sign in both equation above is a result of Lenzs law named after Heinrich Lenz His law states that the electromotive force produces a current that opposes the motion of the changing magnetic flux

The Proms are concerts which are part of a big music festival Proms is short for Promenade Concerts The Proms are organized by the BBC so they are called the BBC Proms They take place in the Royal Albert Hall in London from mid July to mid September every year

The Proms started more than 100 years ago in 1895 Concerts were expensive in those days and not many people had enough money to go and hear good music Most people were only able to hear good music when they went for walks in the London parks where there were Promenade concerts Orchestras and bands played in bandstands Most of the music was popular and easy to listen to People could enjoy the music while they walked about

In the centre of London there was a building called the Queens Hall A man called Robert Newman organized concerts there He had an idea He wanted to start a series of concerts which ordinary people could afford to go to He wanted to start a series of promenade concerts The idea was that people could have standing places which would not cost much money There would also be seats for people who could afford to pay more

Robert Newman knew a very good young conductor Henry Wood He asked him to be the conductor of the Proms A man called Dr Cathcart gave them enough money to get an orchestra together On 10 August 1895 the first Promenade Concert took place in the Queens Hall The price of a promenade ticket was one shilling 

The Promenade Concerts were a big success and soon became known as the Henry Wood Promenade Concerts Wood conducted both popular music and the classical works of Mozart Beethoven Mendelssohn Tchaikovsky Brahms and Wagner as well as some English composers Wallace and Cowan popular then have today faded from the scene although Elgar and Delius have survived due to Woods Proms This broke the convention that famous composers conductors and singers could not be English 

Some of the music Wood conducted was very new indeed In 1912 he conducted a piece called Five Orchestral Pieces by an Austrian composer Arnold Schoenberg Its initial lack of appreciation was overcome by inviting Schoenberg to come to England and conduct it himself in 1914 

Henry Wood conducted almost all of the Proms for fifty years until just before his death in 1944 His innovations with the orchestra staff were to abolish deputies Forty members of the orchestra were offended by that decision and broke away to form what is now the London Symphony Orchestra In 1913 Wood was also the first English conductor to appoint women to play in his orchestra

In 1927 the BBC started to fund Proms The radio was a new invention Radio broadcasts increased interest in attending live concerts In 1930 the BBC Symphony Orchestra was formed playing at a majority of Prom concerts

In 1941 during World War II the Queens Hall was destroyed by bombs The Proms continued to take place in the Royal Albert Hall Then it became too dangerous in London and the Proms were held in Bristol and then Bedford After the War the Proms went back to the Royal Albert Hall They have been held there ever since From the 1940s to the late 1960s the BBC Symphony Orchestra played at most of the concerts under the very popular conductor Sir Malcolm Sargent whose Last Night speeches became legendary for their wit

Today the Proms are very different from when they started It is much more international The BBC Symphony Orchestra play several concerts each season but there are lots of other orchestras from all over the world who come to play People can hear different kinds of music at the Proms not just classical music but jazz and music from far away countries In 2005 the famous Indian musician Ravi Shankar played the sitar at one of the Proms In 2008 the violinist Nigel Kennedy played the Violin Concerto by Edward Elgar with the BBC Concert Orchestra then came back an hour later to give a Late Night Prom of jazz music with the Nigel Kennedy Quintet

The Proms also include special activities for children The television programme Blue Peter put on a Blue Peter Prom which is given twice during the weekend at the beginning of the school holidays in late July In the 2007 season they organized a special Brass Day where children could take part with their instruments BBC Music Intro put on workshops in the late afternoon for children and their families to learn about music In 2008 there was a Dr Who prom which was extremely popular especially with children This theme will be repeated in 2010

Henry Wood encouraged composers to write new music by performing it at the Proms Today this tradition continues as the BBC often commission composers to write new music for the Proms Some pieces which had their first performance at the Proms have become very well known eg The Confession of Isobel Gowdie by James MacMillan or John Taveners The Protecting Veil

For many years now every Prom has been broadcast live on BBC Radio 3 Some of them are shown on television either on BBC2 or on BBC4 where viewers can if they wish read comments about the music as it is played People can also listen to the Proms for several days afterwards on the Proms website

There is a Prom every night for two months during the summer The last concert is called the Last Night of the Proms It is very famous and millions of people can watch it on television in lots of countries all over the world Some people who go to the Last Night dress up in funny clothes and wave flags They hear a piece of music called Fantasia on British Sea Songs written by Henry Wood in 1905 It is based on sailors sea shanties including a hornpipe The dance that gets faster and faster and the audience clap along trying to keep up with the orchestra It includes the song Rule Britannia The orchestra always play Edward Elgars Pomp and Circumstance March no 1 which has the tune Land of Hope and Glory The concert finishes with Parrys hymn Jerusalem The conductor also makes a speech 

Since 1996 there have been Proms in parks in other towns in the United Kingdom to which thousands of people can go These all take place on the same night and there is interactive communication between them and the Prom in the Royal Albert Hall 

One way to go to the Proms is to buy a ticket for a seat just like any other sort of concert But many people think the best way to go to the Proms is to be a promenader This means having a standing place There are two places to prom downstairs in the arena and upstairs in the gallery The Royal Albert Hall is round and looks like an old Roman amphitheatre That is why the floor downstairs is called the arena like in an amphitheatre The promenaders who stand downstairs are near the orchestra especially the front rows But it can be quite a squash when there are lots of people and small children need to be near the front to see properly The other place to promenade is upstairs in the gallery There is more room there and it is easy to see and easy to sit down or even lie down when one feels tired 

A ticket to promenade costs 5 People who want to be a promenader have to wait in a queue outside and buy their ticket as they go in Anyone who wants to be near the front should join the queue early especially for the very popular concerts and at the weekend Some people queue for hours They pass the time by talking to one another reading or playing games It is all good fun and part of enjoying being at the Proms

Mount Merapi is a volcano in Indonesia It is located on the island of Java It is conical in shape It is the most active volcano of Indonesia In Indonesian the name means mountain of fire The volcano has erupted 68 times since 1548 Many people have died during its eruptions 

In 2006 scientists believed that the volcano would erupt soon An earthquake occurred in that region on May 27 2006 and killed about 6200 people On June 6 super hot gas and ash poured down the mountain These hot gases are known as a pyroclastic flow Two people were killed and 15000 people rushed to safety

On 25 October 2010 the Indonesian government warned villagers living near the mountain to move to safer ground Officials said hundreds of volcanic earthquakes had been recorded on the mountain over the weekend of 2324 October and that the magma had risen to about 1 kilometre below the surface due to the seismic activity People living within a 20 km zone were told they must leave 

On the afternoon of 25 October 2010 lava erupted from the southern and south eastern slopes of Mount Merapi Many more followed over the next two weeks There were also pyroclastic flows 

The Indonesian National Disaster Management Agency said on 11 November that since the first eruption on October 26 at least 194 people had died three quarters of those from searing heat blasts during the biggest eruptions and included deaths from breathing problems heart attacks and other illnesses related to the eruptions

After the recovery of more bodies an official in disaster management said the death toll reached 273 up to 18 November

A conductor is a material which electricity can flow through Most metals like iron and copper are conductors These metals are used to make wires Plasma is an excellent conductor of electricity and more uses for this property are being discovered every day

Some materials are semi conductors This means that electricity can flow through them but not very well

Some materials are resistors This means that they make it very hard for electricity to flow through them

Some materials are insulators This means that they stop electric current completely Wires are covered with insulators like plastic to stop the electricity from leaving the wire

The Michelson interferometer is the tool used for optical interferometry

It was invented by Albert Abraham Michelson famous for proving the inexistence of luminiferous aether in the Michelson Morley experiment

There are two mirrors in the interferometer one fixed and the other is movable through a micrometer 

There is also a beam splitter that separates the laser or light beam and a screen that shows the interference pattern

A wide laser or light beam is first shot at the beam splitter Reflection takes place as the beam hits the beam splitter part of it reflects towards mirror 1 while the rest towards mirror 2 The two beams again reflect off mirror 1 and 2 and travel back to the beam splitter the two beams that goes through the beam splitter will combine and form an interference pattern at the screen

The interference pattern will appear as bands and each band represents 2 path length difference or 1 wavelength that is because the crest of wave 1 has caught up with the crest of wave 2 causing a constructive interference If given the change in distance of the movable mirror and number of bands on the screen we can easily calculate the wavelength of the light source

The Gods Must Be Crazy is a 1980 movie directed by Jamie Uys and released in the United States by 20th Century Fox

Conducting in the musical sense means beating time to help a group of musicians to play well together

If a large orchestra is playing music it is important that they all play exactly together They need to know exactly when to start what speed to go how loud or quietly to play and what the mood of the music should be If two three or four people play music together they can talk about this amongst themselves and one person can nod with hisher head or with a violin bow or flute to help the group to start and finish together With an orchestra there are so many people that they need a conductor

In the 17th century orchestras were very small so they did not need a conductor But as orchestras grew in size it became more and more necessary to have someone in front to lead The French composer Lully used to beat time by banging a big stick on the floor to the time of the music One day he banged his stick very hard and it went through his foot and he became ill and died

Conducting as we know it had become normal by the 19th century The composer Mendelssohn was a very good conductor Some conductors in Victorian times were very conceited and behaved like showmen The conductor Louis Antoine Jullien was a French conductor who often came to England He wore white kid gloves which were presented to him on a silver tray at the start of the concert He dressed in expensive clothes and his long black hair waved all over the place as he conducted His success was immense in France at first in the UK afterwards and then even in the US where he worked with the showman PT Barnum His concerts were a mix of dance and classical music always with the best musicians his life is so peculiar that a biography has been published The conductor Sir Henry Wood who was famous for conducting The Proms was a well liked man who was respected and loved by orchestras and audiences

Conductors usually beat time with their right hand This leaves their left hand free to show the various instruments when they have entries or to show them to play louder or softer Most conductors have a stick called a baton It makes it easier for people at the back of large orchestras or choirs to see the beat Other conductors prefer not to use a baton A conductor stands on a small platform called a rostrum

To be a good conductor is not easy It is not just a question of giving a steady beat A good conductor has to know the music extremely well so that they can hear any wrong notes They need to be able to imagine exactly the sound they want the orchestra to make They also have to communicate this to the orchestra so that they know what the conductor wants Some conductors speak very little during their rehearsals They make everything clear through the way they conduct

Some of the most famous conductors of the past were Gustav Mahler Hans Richter Arthur Nikisch Arturo Toscanini Bruno Walter Wilhelm Furtwngler Herbert von Karajan Leopold Stokowski Georg Solti John Barbirolli Otto Klemperer George Szell and Leonard Bernstein

Some of the most famous conductors today are Claudio Abbado Marin Alsop Vladimir Ashkenazy Sir Colin Davis Sir Andrew Davis Valery Gergiev and Bernard Haitink

The main conductor who is in charge of an orchestra is often given the title musical director This will usually mean that he has a lot of power in the organization of the orchestra Orchestras may give honorary titles to their conductor such as conductor laureate A guest conductor is one who conducts an orchestra regularly but is not the main conductor An assistant conductor will often be a young conductor who helps the main conductor and gets the chance to conduct some of the concerts

The Norwegian language is the official language of Norway It is spoken by over four and a half million people and it belongs to the group of North Germanic languages which are spoken in Scandinavia These include Swedish Danish Icelandic and Faeroese

Two forms of the language exist bokml and nynorsk

Old Norse is the language that was spoken hundreds of years ago in Scandinavia at the time of the Vikings It is very similar to todays Icelandic language This is because many Vikings sailed from Norway to Iceland in order to escape from the rule of the Norwegian kings who were making people pay lots of tax

During the 13th century the Black Death killed two thirds of the population of Norway The Danish kings and queens noticed that Norway was weak and defenceless so they annexed Norway For hundreds of years Norway was ruled by the Danes All the rulers priests estate owners and noblemen were Danish Many of them settled in Norway This is why todays standard Norwegian is similar to Danish Norwegians were not allowed to print books in Norwegian Anyone wanting to study had to go to Denmark or Germany

In 1814 Denmark lost a war and had to give Norway to Sweden Then the Norwegians were allowed to have their own university Gradually the Danish language was mixed up with the Norwegian dialects and became todays Norwegian language Norwegian and Danish look very similar when they are written but when they are spoken they sound different In Danish a lot of the sounds are swallowed

During the 19th century a slightly different form of Norwegian was made up by several people This eventually became known as Nynorsk It was based on old forms of Norwegian and dialects During the 20th century some attempts were made to join Bokml and Nynorsk into one language but they did not succeed Today about one person in nine or ten in Norway writes Nynorsk Children in school have to learn both forms

The Norwegian alphabet has 29 letters These are the same letters as the English alphabet plus three extra vowels  

The letters c q w x and z are only used for words that have been borrowed from other languages

The country is made up of several groups of Polynesian islands The most well known is Tahiti the most populous island which is located in the Society Islands group It is also where the capital of the territory Papeete can be found

Although it does not really belong in the territory French Polynesia is in charge of affairs for Clipperton Island

Other island groups include

Aside from Tahiti some other important atolls islands and island groups in French Polynesia are Ahe Bora Bora Hiva Oa Huahine Maiao Maupiti Mehetia Moorea Nuku Hiva Raiatea Tahaa Tetiaroa Tubuai and Tupai

Econometrics is a branch of economics It is the use of statistical and mathematical methods to describe the relation between economic forces such as capital interest rates and labor

Much of econometrics is making models which are simple pictures of the real world These models then can be used to predict what will happen in the real world

An example of econometrics would be looking at the prices of houses in a town An economist can try to make a simple picture of the house prices in the town This picture might show that houses close to the market are worth more An economist could then say that if a new market is made in another part of the town home prices there might go up The economist also might say that the new market could make prices less than before near the old one because the new market will make it so that more houses are near a market This would make the people who sell houses near a market sell them for less since there could be more sellers than buyers

A capacitor is an electronic device that stores electric energy It is similar to a battery but is smaller lightweight and charges up much quicker Capacitors are used in many electronic devices today and can be made out of many different types of material

Capacitors are usually made with two metal plates that are on top of each other and near each other but that do not actually touch When powered they allow energy to be stored inside an electrical field Because the plates need a lot of area to store even a small amount of charge the plates are usually rolled up into some other shape such as a cylinder Sometimes other shapes of capacitors are used for special purposes A capacitor like effect can also result just from two conductors being close to each other whether you want it to exist or not

The type of capacitor used depends on the application Capacitors come in many sizes They can be as small as an ant or as large as a dustbin

All capacitors have two connections or leads Most kinds of capacitors can be changed around easily by someone who has basic skills in electronics However one of the more powerful types  the electrolytic capacitor  must be used the correct way or they can explode violently

While capacitors do have similarities to batteries in that they can store energy  as mentioned earlier  capacitors can also release all their stored energy very quickly even faster than a second Batteries on the other hand release their energy slowly

A charging and discharging defibrillator for heart attacks is a good example of how a capacitor gradually charges up until it can not be filled any more and then quickly discharging its stored power to another area that needs it to function

In Computer science a Design pattern is an abstract solution to a certain problem Design patterns are used in object oriented programming They give a possible solution to a problem of designing software

Design patterns became popular around the year 1995 They also simplify the language between computer scientists Ideally a design pattern should be reusable many times It is like a brick of a house it can be used for many different problems One can also build bridges with bricks not only houses

These examples are actual examples of design patterns as they are in use They have not been simplified It is only the language used to describe them that has been made simpler

The flyweight design pattern is used to minimize the use of many similar objects In a text processing system each letter can have some attributes like formatting typeface and size While it would be possible to create a new object for each character in the document and give it these attributes it is extremely expensive

Instead it would be better to create one object for each type of formatting and link the letter to that information That needs a lot fewer objects The only extra information that would need to be stored is the word or letters position in the document All similar letters would use the same object to define font size and other properties

Another easy to understand pattern is called Singleton It is used when there can only be one instance of a given class That class usually has some static method which returns a new instance It also saves the instance internally So if it already created the instance it can simply return it

A round in music is a song which can be sung by two or more groups of people  One group starts off and the next group start to sing the same song a bit later It should sound nice together When a group gets to the end of the song they start again They can go round and round singing it several times

Usually rounds are in 2 3 or 4 parts When a group of people sing or play a round they usually sing it an agreed number of times This means that the group which starts last also finishes last

Frre Jacques is a famous French round Londons Burning is an English round Both those rounds can be sung in 4 parts

The oldest round that we know is Sumer is icumen in This is a very famous piece of music because it is the oldest piece of music we know that was written down It was written around 1250 by a monk It can be sung in 4 parts with 2 bass drones

Writing music by making one part imitate another is called canonic writing Rounds are a kind of canon

The gallbladder is a pear shaped organ in your abdomen that stores about 50 ml of acidic liquid until the body needs it for digestion The gallbladder is about 7 10cm long in humans and is dark green in color because of the bile in it not its tissue It is connected to the liver and the duodenum by the biliary tract

Koalas are herbivore marsupials that live in eastern Australia They are the only species of the family Phascolarctidae

The koala is also often called the koala bear because it looks like a small bear or teddy bear However it is not a bear Its name is just koala

Koalas have brownish grey or silver grey fur and a big pink andor black nose They have sharp claws which help them to climb They can hear and smell very well but they cannot see very well at all

Koalas are mostly active at night They live in trees and they do not like to be on the ground They mostly eat leaves bark and fruit of some Eucalyptus trees Koalas do not drink often they get most of their water from the leaves they eat

Koalas live alone most of the time but they have a social hierarchy with the other koalas who live near

After a pregnancy of 35 days the newly born koala is about a quarter of an inch long and is born with no ears eyes or hair It crawls into its mothers pouch on its own After 12 months the young koala is old enough that it does not go into its mothers pouch or need milk anymore The female koala can have another baby then Young koalas usually leave their mothers when they are 18 months old but if their mother does not have another baby they sometimes stay for up to three years Koalas become mature when they are about two years old but they often have their first baby after another two years

The koala is not an endangered species but it is a near vulnerable species One reason is the loss of habitat which means that koalas have less space to live In some places there are very few koalas left But there are also places such as French Island with too many koalas that eat too much Because of this the eucalyptus trees and other animals are in danger A study looking at koala numbers at 1800 sites for 20 years shows that the number of koalas is falling The study by the Australian Koala Foundation estimates that there are only about 50000 koalas left

Most groups of koalas in Australia have the disease chlamydia This is also affecting the survival of the species Koalas on French Island do not have the disease and so groups of them are often moved to the mainland to repopulate some areas The disease can cause blindness pneumonia urinary tract infections and reproductive tract infections

John Coolidge Adams is an American composer He was born in 1947 His music is often very exciting using minimalism with large orchestras and lots of different sounds 

He studied music at Harvard University After he had graduated he packed all his belongings into his Volkswagen and drove all the way across the United States to California where he got a job as a fork lift operator Soon he became part of the musical scene of San Francisco He listened to the music of minimalist composers like John Cage Terry Riley and Morton Feldman By the mid 1980s he was earning a living as composer and conductor The piece that made him famous was called Harmonium At times the music is made to sound like a harmonium instrument but the title also refers to harmony showing that he is writing tonal music unlike some modern composers at the time whose music was getting harder and harder to understand because it was not in any key

Adams wrote several short pieces such as Short Ride in a Fast Machine and The Chairman Dances This last piece is music from his opera Nixon in China which was widely performed but made some people angry because the Chinese leaders Chou En lai and Mao Tse tung are shown as human beings who deserve a certain amount of sympathy

Adams Violin Concerto has been performed over 100 times by many of the worlds famous violinists

Handcuffs are a type of restraint mainly used by police to prevent suspects from escaping or hurting anyone They are usually metal 

There are also some handcuffs that are made of plastic that are disposable

A flashlight or torch is a small portable spotlight Its function is a beam of light which helps to see It usually requires batteries

A torch or at least the part that projects the light will work the same way as a light bulb because that is all a torch is a light bulb that you can hold and carry around However some torches use LEDs which work slightly differently and are often more powerful but give the same effectIn 1896 the first dry cell battery was invented Unlike previous batteries it used a paste electrolyte instead of a liquid This was the first battery suitable for portable electrical devices as it did not spill or break easily and worked in any orientation

Hundreds of years ago people used candles for all indoor light This was expensive and once the candle was gone you would have to buy a new one or be stuck in the dark When electricity was discovered and the light bulb invented one particularly clever person came up with the idea of a light bulb that you could take with you anywhere you wanted to go Thus the torch was invented 

Discrimination is literally when something or someone is distinguished from someone or something Discrimination against is when a person is treated unfairly or badly because of something about that person The Universal Declaration of Human Rights affirms that all persons must be protected any kind of discriminations and even its inciting

A person might be discriminated against because of their racesex sexual orientation gender identity religion the way they look a past criminal record the persons lifestyle their choice of clothing their age or their disabilities whether they are a member of or fit in with a social clique social class social status or caste and many other reasons

Discrimination against can take many forms It can include being fired from a job not being able to be hired for a job being paid less money than others at the same job being refused a home or apartment teasing harassment or simply being treated differently than other people A law was introduced called Equal Opportunities which promises not to employ someone because of their race age sex or religion and lacking reasonable care for persons with disabilities or accessibility Two people in the same position must be paid the same wage if they have identical responsibilities

In some countries discrimination against somebody on the basis of race sex or religion is illegal for jobs or housing Even in those countries where discrimination against somebody unlawful it still takes place for other reasons not covered by the law In some other countries discrimination against somebody is legal or even official government policy This especially takes place in countries in which there is an official religion and people of other religions are discriminated against Discrimination is also widespread in countries which have a culture in which castes or social classes are widely recognized

Ernest Rutherford 1st Baron Rutherford of Nelson OM PC FRS was a New Zealand scientist who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1908 for his work on nuclear physics and for the theory of the structure of the atom

Rutherford was one of the first researchers in nuclear physics after the discovery of radiation by a French physicist by the name of Antoine Henri Becquerel in 1896 Rutherford discovered the three parts of radiation which he named Alpha Beta and Gamma Rutherford also discovered that alpha particles were helium nuclei Rutherfords GeigerMarsden experiment led to what we know today about the atomic structure where the atom is a nucleus and electrons orbit around it

In 1919 Rutherford made the worlds first broken wikt linkartificalartificial nuclear reaction where he put alpha particles with nitrogen gas and created particles of oxygen isotopes and protons The important thing about the experiment was the fact that he changed nitrogen gas into oxygen gas

Rutherford was the leader of the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge He proved the existence of the nucleus and that is was composed of protons and neutrons In 1932 James Chadwick made an experiment at the Cavendish Lab that showed Rutherford was right

Rutherford College a school in Auckland New Zealand was named after him

Serialism is a way of composing music using a series of notes in a particular order and using this to build up a whole piece of music These series and patterns can also be applied to other parts of music

To show how serialism works we can take a very simple example Let us use just five notes from the white notes of a keyboard We can use the notes A B C D and E We are going to make a tune using all these five notes but not repeating any until all five have been used

For example we might have D C A A A A B E This is what we call our row or series although usually one would expect a row of twelve different notes It is the one we start off with so we can call it our tone row

We can change the tone row by playing it backwards This is called retrograde So we now get E B A A A A C D

We can also change it by playing it upside down This means that instead of going up one step we go down one step or instead of going up two steps we go down two steps etc If we start on the same note D we now get D E G G G G F C This is called inversion We can make it go backwards and upside down So we get C F G G G G E D This is called retrograde inversion

We now have four ways of playing our row tone row retrograde inversion retrograde inversion

These can now be transposed to create many more options

In 1923 the composer Arnold Schoenberg developed what he called the twelve tone system Instead of using just five notes as in our example he used all 12 notes in the octave Most music we listen to is in a particular key This is called tonal music For example if we start Twinkle twinkle little star on a C we finish on a C at the end and the piece sounds finished It is tonal In twelve tone music all 12 notes are equal there is no key note This makes the music very hard to understand and it took people a long time to get used to the sound of Schoenbergs new music

Schoenberg was not the only composer to use this way of composing His pupils Alban Berg and Anton Webern also wrote twelve tone music Schoenberg Webern Berg are sometimes called the Second Viennese School The first was Haydn Mozart and Beethoven a hundred years before The composers Igor Stravinsky and Aaron Copland started to write twelve tone music when they were quite old Composers such as Benjamin Britten used it occasionally often putting it together with music which was tonal When contrasted with tonal music in this way it can be very beautiful

In the 1950s and 1960s some composers like Pierre Boulez and Karlheinz Stockhausen wrote music which was not only twelve tone but serial in other ways as well For example they organized levels of dynamics in a series and the lengths of notes and even timbre By combining all these things their music became very complicated indeed When all these things were used for the whole piece of music it was called total serialism Boulezs Structures I is an example of a piece which uses total serialism A lot of people criticized this music saying that it was too mathematical instead of being expressive Such music can be hard to understand 

Frdric Chopin was a Polish virtuoso pianist who composed some of the greatest piano music ever performed He is the most important composer from Poland Some of his music for the piano is very difficult to play but it is admired as some of the most poetic music ever written He planned to have a Paris concert on New Years Day 1850 but he died before he could perform on this special day

Chopin was born in the village of elazowa Wola 60 km from Warsaw However his correct birthday remains enigma to this day Chopin himself claimed he was born on March 1 Some sources paintings give 1809 as his correct birth year New evidence points out that he was really born on February 29 1808 leap year His father Mikoaj Chopin was French He moved to Poland in 1787 where he married Tekla Justyna Krzyanowska They named their son Fryderyk Franciszek Sometimes Chopins date of birth is given as February 22 because this is what his birth paper says but this was written by the priest at Chopins christening eight weeks later and was probably a mistake Chopin and his family always celebrated his birthday on March 1

Chopins musical ability was clear when he was very young and newspapers in Warsaw described him as a second Mozart He was given private music lessons by several important musicians

In 1829 Chopin heard the violinist Niccol Paganini play and met the pianist Johann Nepomuk Hummel He also visited Vienna where he played a couple of concerts In December he performed his piano concerto in E minor He first performed his other piano concerto in F minor in March 1830

In 1830 he visited Vienna again and when he heard of the troubles of the November Uprising back home he decided not to go back to Poland He went to Paris instead and made his home there He started calling himself by the French version of his name Frdric Franois In Paris he made friends with some other important composers including Hector Berlioz Felix Mendelssohn Charles Valentin Alkan and Vincenzo Bellini

In 1836 Chopin was going to be married to a Polish girl called Maria Wodzinska Her family did not like Chopin very much Her mother made the couple keep their love secret and finally stopped them from getting married At about this time Chopin met the woman writer Amandine Aurore Lucile Dupin the Baroness Dudevant better known as George Sand Eventually Chopin started a relationship with her that lasted until 1847 They visited Mallorca together in the winter of 1838 1839 where the bad weather and damp rooms made Chopin ill He had breathing problems before but this was so bad that they had to come home He never got completely better

In 1847 Chopin and Sand split up In 1848 he visited England and Scotland to play in concerts but he was very ill and had to return home He died in Paris at about 2 oclock in the morning on October 17 1849 surrounded by loved ones 

Nearly all of the pieces of music written by Chopin are only for the piano and many of the rest have the piano as their main instrument He wrote piano sonatas two piano concertos studies ballades nocturnes mazurkas polonaises waltzes and a set of preludes His music was praised in his lifetime Robert Schumann once wrote about Chopin Hats off gentlemen A genius Schumann was a great admirer of Chopin

Today Chopin has a reputation among pianists as the composer of some of the most beautiful romantic and difficult music for that instrument His music is used in many movies

Mikhail Ivanovich Glinka was a Russian composer regarded as the first to become very famous

Russia is a very large country In the 18th century there was a lot of music in Europe but Russian people had not yet heard it A lot of them were very poor and modern transport did not exist By the time Glinka was born Russian people in the large towns like Saint Petersburg were becoming very interested in European music

Mikhail Glinka was born in a little village called Novospasskoye His father was a rich landowner Glinka was brought up by his grandmother who looked after him very carefully She was always afraid he would be cold so she wrapped him up in a fur coat in a room which was kept at 77 F He was not often allowed to play in the fresh air Later in his life Glinka was always worrying about his health

It was a long way to the big cities from where the child lived There was no radio in those days and no CDs The only music he heard was the church bells and the singing of the peasants They sang folksongs and made up harmony underneath the tunes

After his grandmother died he was allowed to travel 6 miles to his uncles home His uncle had a group of musicians who played music by European composers like Haydn Mozart and Beethoven He had never heard such music before

When he was 13 he went to school in St Petersburg Now he could hear lots of music and meet some good musicians He had piano lessons and spent a lot of time at parties He started to compose some songs 

In 1830 he went to Italy Italy was famous for its music especially for opera Glinka met famous composers like Mendelssohn and Berlioz as well as Italian composers like Donizetti and Bellini He like their music and decided he wanted to write opera as well but he wanted to make his music sound very Russian

Glinka went back to Russia He wrote two great operas The first one was called Ivan Susanin The story of the opera set in 1612 is about a poor peasant Ivan Susanin who dies to save the life of the Tsar The Tsar liked the opera and thought that it should be called A Life for the Tsar It was a big success when it was first performed in 1836

He soon wrote his second opera Ruslan and Lyudmila The story comes from a tale by the famous Russian poet Pushkin The man who wrote the words for him did it very quickly while he was drunk so the story is a bit muddled but the music is wonderful It is a fairy tale about a nasty dwarf Chernomor who has taken away a princess called Lyudmila In the end Ruslan the hero rescues her Some of the music sounds quite oriental The overture that starts the opera is very famous

Glinka also wrote piano music songs and chamber music

Glinkas music is important because he was the first Russian composer to write music that sounded Russian Later composers like Tchaikovsky were influenced by his music

Liancourt Rocks are a group of small islands in the Sea of Japan the sea between South Korea and Japan The islands are currently under the South Korean police South Korea call them Dokdo North Korea refers to them as Tok Islet in the English language but in Korean both Korean states use the same term The name Liancourt Rocks comes from the French whaling ship Liancourt The people on the Liancourt made a map of the islands in 1849 The islands have been in dispute for some time by both Japan and Korean

Tok To consists of two islets that are 150 metres apart These small islands are called West Islet and East Islet The western islet is the larger of the two islets Altogether there are about 90 islets and reefs The islands and rocks have a volcanic nature A total of 37 of these islets are recognized as permanent land The eastern islet formed 45 million years ago Ulleungdo formed 2 million years later Both are quickly eroding and weathering 

The total area of the islets is about 187450 square meters Their highest point is 169 meters on the western islet The western islet is about 88640 square meters in area the eastern islet about 73300 square meters Liancourt Rocks is at about 13152 East longitude and about 3714 North latitude The western islet is at coor dms371431N1315155E and the eastern islet is at coor dms371427N1315210E The main islands coast lines are 217 km apart from mainland Korea and 212 km apart from main islands of Japan The nearest Korean territory is 87 km away and can be visible on fair days the nearest Japanese territory is 157 km away 

The western islet is made of a single peak It has many caves along the coastline The cliffs of the eastern islet are about 10 to 20 meters high There are two caves giving access to the sea as well as a crater

40 people are staying on the islandsFactsubst122408 several Korean telecom service providers have also installed stations on Liancourt Rocks to cover the islets in the South Korean wireless telephone networkFactsubst122408 There is also regular ferry service from Ulleung do

Although the islets themselves are barely habitable the Exclusive Economic Zone surrounding them has rich fishing grounds and possible reserves of natural gas As of 2006 the expected reserves have not been found A wide variety of fish as well as seaweed kelp sea slugs and clams live around the islets Major fishery catches in the area are squid Alaskan pollock codfish and octopus There are 102 species of seaweed although many of these have no economic value

This area used to be one of the largest breeding grounds of sea lions and a good spot for hunting them and also a spot for obtaining abalone at the end of the Meiji period Until the 1950s sea lions were observed on the islets by the voluntary guards

There are approximately 37 South Korean police that guard the islets also there are Ministry of Maritime Affairs Fisheries personnel a married Korean couple and three lighthouse keepers living on the isletsFactsubst122408 In the past several fishermen also lived there

Because they are classified as a nature reserve special permits are required for tourists to land on the islets rather than just circling them There were 1507 and 1597 recorded tourists in 2003 and 2004 respectively Visitors generally come by boat from Ulleung do

In 2005 the first wedding ceremony was held on the islets The South Korean couple chose the location to protest against Japanese territorial claims

Liancourt Rocks can have harsh weather conditions This is because of its location and small size Sometimes ships are unable to dock because of strong northwestern winds in winter The climate is warm and humid It is heavily influenced by warm sea currents There is a lot of rain throughout the year with occasional snowfall Fog is a common sight In the summer southerly winds dominate The water around the islets is about 10 degrees Celsius in spring when the water is coolest It warms to about 25 degrees Celsius in August

Like Ulleung do the islets are volcanic rocks with only a thin layer of soil and moss About 80 species of plants over 22 species of birds and 37 species of insects have been recorded on the islets in addition to the local maritime life

Since the early 1970s trees and some types of flowers were planted along with the indigenous flora and fauna

Liancourt Rocks was declared Natural Monument 336 by South Korea in the 1990s Some birds actually live on the islands but most are just using them as a stopover to fly elsewhere The fork tailed petrel streaked shearwater and black tailed gulls live on the islands The population of breeding birds counted on the rocks however has been declining in recent years 

In 1999 the islets were designated a special environmental protected area by the South Korean government They are older than any other Korean volcanic islands including Ulleung do

It was announced in 2005 that three new genera and five new species of bacteria had been identified by ROK scientists in the waters off the islets The genera are Dokdonella koreensis Dokdonia donghaenensis and Donghae dokdoensis The newly identified species are Virgilbacillus dokdoensis Maribacter dokdoensis Marimonas dokdoensis Polaribacter dokdoensis and Porphyrobacter dokdoensis

The islets are of importance not only for economic reasonsFactsubst122408 but also for military onesFactsubst122408 They have occasionally served as a military base most notably during the Russo Japanese War The South Korean government has built a radar station and helicopter landing pad on the islets enabling it to track foreign naval forcesFactsubst122408 The 37 police on the islets serve as armed guards The dispute between South Korea and Japan over the islands has gained heat in 2008 with new Japanese school books mentioning the islands and a visit by the South Korean Prime Minister in July Ten years ago no people lived on the islands But South Korea started to populate the island to make its claim stronger

South Korea actually own the Islets since about nearly 2000 years ago 

A pentacle is a five pointed star with all lines the same length and all angles the same Also pentacle can mean any object that protects its owner which can be a pentagram

A pentagram is a pentacle drawn in a circle so the points touch the circle

The pentagram has many meanings To some people it means peace harmony and tranquility As a religious symbol it is associated with Wicca but other religions use too To some people it means the five wounds of Jesus Christ In Taoism a pentagram shows how the religious elements are related But pentacles and pentagrams have many meanings

A Pentacle is on the flag of Morocco

In old times the pentagram was a symbol for good and for protection against evil In modern times people often mistakenly think that the pentagram itself symbolizes evil Some people also use an upside down pentagram to mean bad magic evil and the Devil some people think all pentagrams mean this Satanists use this kind pentagram to mean their religion Satanists call an upside down pentagram with a goat head a Baphomet without the goat head its a very distant symbol used by wiccans This Pentagram or Pentcle in Wicca stands for the second the degrees and when its right side up it stands for fire water earth air and spirit In Sir Gawain and The Green Knight the pentagram is mentioned as a symbol for Gawains good character and truth

Benzene also known as benzol is an organic chemical compound with the formula C6H6 It is a colorless and flammable liquid with a sweet smell Benzene molecules are a ring of six carbon atoms that are each bonded to one hydrogen atom It is an aromatic compound meaning the ring has alternating double bonds 

Benzene is carcinogenic which means it can cause cancer It has many real world uses It is used as an additive in gasoline plastics synthetic rubber dyes and it is an industrial solvent which means it can dissolve many other chemical molecules Benzene is also a natural part of crude oil and is therefore present in gasoline Many medicines contain parts made from benzene

Benzene has special properites called aromaticity All six carbon atoms in the ring are on the same flat plane To account for all the bonds on a six carbon ring there must be alternating double carbon bonds

If benzene had three double bonds three sides of its ring would be shorter than the other three sides X ray diffraction shows that all of six carbon carbon bonds in benzene are of the same length of 140 picometres The CC bond lengths are greater than a double bond but shorter than a single bond This intermediate distance is consistent with electron delocalization the electrons for CC bonding are distributed equally between each of the six carbon atoms The molecule is planar One representation is that the structure exists as a superposition of so called resonance structures rather than either form individually The delocalization of electrons is one explanation for the thermodynamic stability of benzene and related aromatic compounds It is likely that this stability contributes to the peculiar molecular and chemical properties known as aromaticity To indicate the delocalized nature of the bonding benzene is often depicted with a circle inside a hexagonal arrangement of carbon atoms

As is common in organic chemistry the carbon atoms in the diagram above have been left unlabeled Realizing each carbon has 2p electrons each carbon donates an electron into the delocalized ring above and below the benzene ring It is the overlap of p orbitals both above and below the ring that produces the pi clouds

In 1986 some chemists disputed the delocalized view of benzene in an article published in the journal Nature They showed that the electrons in benzene are almost certainly localized to particular carbon atoms They showed the aromatic properties of benzene come from spin coupling rather than electron delocalization Other scientists wrote articles to support this view in Nature in 1987 But chemists are slow to switch from the delocalized electrons view

Derivatives of benzene occur sufficiently often as a component of organic molecules that there is a Unicode symbol in the Miscellaneous Technical block with the code U232C to represent it with three double bonds and U23E3 for a delocalized version

The Tasmanian Devil is a meat eating mammal It is also a marsupial which means they have a small pouch to carry their babies It is the largest meat eating marsupial in the world They are nocturnal which means they sleep during the day and are awake during the night They now live only in Tasmania an island state of Australia

The devil is the same size as a small dog with a wide head and a short tail Male devils can weigh 12 kg and be 30 cm tall It has black fur and makes a loud and very scary screeching noise It will hunt other animals and also feed on dead animals The devil has strong teeth and jaws and will eat all its prey even bones and fur

The Tasmanian Devil became extinct on the Australian mainland about 400 years before European settlement in 1788 They were hunted in Tasmania in the 1930s the Van Diemans Land Company offered 25 cents for each male and 35 cents for each female killed In 1941 they became officially protected 

In 1996 the devils began to get very sick and then die with large tumours on their faces Devil facial tumour disease has greatly reduced the number of devils and now threatens their survival In some areas 85 of devils have been found with the disease In the places where the tumours were seen first devil numbers have dropped by 95 The tumour is spread by biting Because the devils are all closely related the tumour cells are not seen as new so the devils immune system does not fight it In May 2008 the Tasmanian Devil was listed as endangered Programs are being tried by the Tasmanian government to reduce the impact of the disease About 60 devils without the disease have been captured and are to be kept as a tumour free group for rebreeding Scientists have been looking at ways to give the devils immunity but so far this has not worked

New research is showing the devils are having babies earlier they use to breed at two years but now are breeding at one year old Devils used to have babies every year for three years but they are now dying before they can produce a second litter

The devils have a low genetic diversity which is consistent with a founder effect What this means is a small number colonised Tasmania from Australia at some stage So their genetic variety was much less than the parent population Disease like the present may have happened before and reduced the population to a small number These events are called population bottlenecks A small population which carries less variation is always vulnerable to extinction because none of the animals may be resistant to the infection

Its genome was sequenced in 2010 by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute There is some hope for their survival because since 2005 three females have been found that are partially resistant to the disease

Joseph Haydn was an Austrian composer He was born on March 31 or April 1 1732 and died on May 31 1809 He was one of the most famous composers in the Classical music period He is often called the Father of the Symphony 

We do not know much detail about his life Mozart who lived at the same time wrote lots of letters to his family so we know a lot about what he did and thought The only letters of Haydn that we still have were business letters so we do not know much detail about how he lived

Haydn was born in 1732 in a small village called Rohrau in Austria near the border with Hungary His father was a wheelwright His parents liked music and wanted their son to be musical so they sent him to a boarding school several miles away when he was only six Two years later the school was visited by a man called Georg von Reutter He was travelling round the country looking for boys who could sing well because he wanted them for the choir of the cathedral in Vienna He was very impressed with Haydn and so young Joseph was taken to Vienna where he spent the rest of his childhood in the cathedral choir He was taught music there and learned the harpsichord and violin He does not seem to have been taught any music theory Haydn had to teach himself how to compose

Haydns treble voice broke when he was about 17 or 18 so he had to leave school For the next ten years he did not have much money He lived in an attic room and gave music lessons to young pupils He started to compose writing short pieces for his pupils to play He also played in bands and orchestras It was probably in 1757 that he got a good job he became music director for Count Karl von Morzin He had to conduct the orchestra and write symphonies for them Then in 1761 he got a very good job as assistant Director of Music for Prince Esterhazy

Haydn spent 30 years working for Prince Esterhazy who was one of the most important princes in the Austrian Empire A lot of princes and other noblemen kept orchestras at their palaces just to show off but Prince Esterhazy really was musical and played an instrument called the baryton which looked a bit like a cello with lots of strings In 1766 Haydn was made Kapellmeister

Like all the other musicians at the princes court Haydn was a servant and had to wear livery In the winter the prince liked to be in his palace in Vienna but in the summer he liked to go to his new palace in the country in what is now Hungary Haydn had a busy job He had to compose music whenever the prince wanted it He had to conduct and organize the orchestra play in small instrumental groups and even put on operas These operas were often performed with puppets Haydn was not really interested in writing music for puppet operas but he had to do what he was told His best pieces were his symphonies and string quartets

Haydn wrote at least 104 symphonies These are pieces of music for orchestra usually with four movements He also wrote lots of string quartets pieces for two violins viola and cello Haydn is often known as the Father of the Symphony and even Father of the String Quartet He did not invent them but he was the first really great composer who wrote them

Many of his symphonies and string quartets have nicknames Symphony no 45 is called the Farewell Symphony The reason was that one autumn the musicians were fed up with being in the country palace and wanted to go back to Vienna to see their families The prince wanted to stay on So Haydn wrote a symphony in which towards the end the musicians stop playing one by one blow out their candles and walk off the stage The prince took the hint and ordered everyone to return to Vienna Another symphony is called the Surprise symphony Haydn was playing a trick on the people in the audience who often fell asleep during the music The music is very quiet indeed then suddenly there is a very loud chord

One of his string quartets has a tune which became the Austrian national anthem

Haydn married in 1760 but his wife did not like music They never had children and Haydn often felt lonely He had a lady friend a singer called Luigia Polzelli and he often wrote to her when he was on his travels

Around 1781 Haydn became friendly with Mozart Mozart was 24 years younger than Haydn but they learned a lot from one another They often played string quartets together with two friends

In 1790 Prince Nikolaus died and his son became prince His son was unmusical and a lot of the musicians lost their jobs Haydn was put on a pension This had a good side he was free to travel whenever he wanted He went to England and stayed in London where he wrote twelve symphonies during two visits He was greatly admired by the British audiences

Haydn nearly stayed in England to live like Handel had done almost a century earlier In the end he decided to retire to Vienna There he spent his last years writing religious works for chorus and orchestra He wrote The Creation and The Seasons which are both oratorios

He died in 1809 while Vienna was being attacked by the French army under Napoleon

When we make tunes we use musical notes of different pitches some high and some low A scale can be referred to as a series of notes in order going up or down in pitch 

On a piano there are white keys and black keys If we start on the note C and play each white key going up until we come to the next C we have played the C Major scale There were eight notes In order going up they are C D E F G A B and C or can be octaves higher or lower Scales can also go up then down like C D E F G A B C B A G F E D C

Click below to listen to a C major scale

Sometimes the major scale is sung to the words doh reh mih fah soh lah tih doh In the film The Sound of Music Maria teaches the children to sing by teaching them a song called Doe a deer a female deer Each line starts on the next note of the scale

One can start a major scale on any note There are twelve possible starting notes

However the distances between the notes must be the same as they were for the scale on C For example from C to D was a tone because there was a note between From E to F is a half tone as there was no note in between The pattern for a major scale has this set of steps

Note 1 2 tone Note 2 3 tone Note 3 4 semitone Note 4 5 tone Note 5 6 tone Note 6 7 tone Note 7 8 semitone

For example a major scale starting on D would go D E F G A B C D and a major scale starting on E E F G A B C D E

A minor scale sounds rather sad The pattern of tones and semitones is different There are two main sorts of minor scales harmonic and melodic

There are also chromatic scales and whole tone scales

Practising scales is important for people who play instruments or sing It helps fingers to be strong and energetic It also helps get used to lots of fingering patterns which will help to play pieces

Orthology is the study of the right use of words in language The word comes from Greek ortho and logy This science is a place where psychology philosophy linguistics and many other fields of learning come together The most noted use of Orthology is for the selection of words for the language of Basic English by the Orthological Institute

The book The Meaning of Meaning by Charles Kay Ogden and I A Richards is an important book dealing with orthology The term Orthology comes from the book The Grammar of Science by Karl Pearson

Toei is a Japanese company that makes cartoons and movies Some of their cartoons for example Sailor Moon are watched in many countries

Naoko Takeuchi born March 15 1967 is a manga artist from Japan She lives in Tokyo She wrote the manga Sailor Moon which was so popular it was made into an anime musicals video games and more Her husband Yoshihiro Togashi is the creator of YuYu Hakusho and Hunter Hunter

Kimi Ga Yo is the national anthem of Japan The name of the song roughly means Imperial Reign in English The anthem is based on a poem written by an unknown poet from Japan about one thousand years ago The music was written more recently and was then rewritten shortly afterwards because the original tune was unpopular

Although popular for a long period and sung in situations where people from other countries would usually sing their countrys national anthem Kimi Ga Yo was only considered as Japans official national anthem in 1999 The law that stated this also defined the Flag of Japan in a similar way

Interestingly Kimi Ga Yo is one of the shortest known national anthems of any country It is only 56 seconds long

Baroque music is an era and a set of styles of European classical music which were in use between about 1600 and 1750 

The word Baroque is used in other art forms besides music we talk about Baroque architecture painting sculpture dance and literature The Baroque period comes between the Renaissance and the period of Classicism

Musicians think of the Baroque period as starting around 1600 The famous Renaissance composers Palestrina and Lassus had died a few years earlier Opera was being invented It was a time of musical change

The change from writing music in the Baroque style to the Classical style was much more gradual 1750 is the year that Bach died so it is an easy date to choose for the end of the Baroque period

The Baroque was a time when people liked large spaces and a lot of ornamentation This can be seen in the architecture of famous buildings such as St Peters Basilica Rome or St Pauls Cathedral London They were built at this time In Venice there were churches with galleries on either side of the church Composers liked to write music for two groups of musicians placed in opposite galleries Giovanni Gabrieli wrote a lot of music like this

The idea of two contrasting groups was used a lot in Baroque music Composers wrote concertos These were pieces for orchestra and a solo instrument Sometimes a concerto contrasted a group of soloists with the rest of the orchestra These are called by the Italian name Concerti Grossi Bachs Brandenburg Concertos are good examples

Organs and some harpsichords had at least two manuals The player could change from one manual to the other contrasting two different sounds

Baroque music was often a melody with a bass line at the bottom This could be for example a singer and a cello There was also a harpsichord or organ that played the bass line as well and made up chords in between Often the composer did not bother to write out all the chords but just showed some of the chords by figures leaving it to the performer to decide exactly which notes to play This is called figured bass or basso continuo The soloist who played or sang the melody on top often put in lots of ornamental notes Again the composer did not write this all down but left it to the performer to improvise something nice around the notes he had written

Because composers were now writing opera it was important for the audience to hear the words clearly In the Renaissance the groups of a choir were often singing several different words at once This was called polyphony It sounded beautiful but was no good for opera which is telling a story

When a soloist in an opera sings a song the aria is in a particular mood They called this affection There were several affections or moods there were arias about revenge jealousy anger love despair peaceful happiness etc Each movement in a concerto also had one particular mood Music from later periods is different For example Haydn in the Classical Period would often change its mood during a piece

Here are a few of the most important composers of the Baroque period

Italy Giovanni Gabrieli Claudio Monteverdi Antonio Vivaldi Arcangelo Corelli Domenico Scarlatti

Germany Heinrich Schtz Johann Sebastian Bach

England Henry Purcell George Frideric Handel

France Franois Couperin Jean Philippe Rameau

Music in the Baroque Era Manfred Bukofzer JMDent 1948

A canyon is a big crack in the ground Many canyons are made by rivers and earthquakes They can be big like the Grand Canyon or small

Canyons can be formed by running water which will take sediment away and create a trench getting deeper until it forms a canyon

Pattern language is used to mean a system of patterns that have a certain meaning other than just the pattern

The pattern can be a pattern which has a hidden meaning shown through any sense like sight sound touch taste and smell

The most obvious form of sight based pattern language comes in the form of writing Nearly every language has a unique written form which grammatically follows the spoken form

In the United States National Maritime Day is held every May 22 to honor people who have served in the United States Merchant Marine service

The first National Maritime Day was May 22 1933 based on a joint resolution passed by the United States Congress on May 20 1933 Franklin D Roosevelt was the first President to issue a proclamation about the day

The biggest National Maritime Day celebration was in 1946 the first National Maritime Day after the Allied Powers won World War II That year governors of many US states also officially named the day National Maritime Day or Maritime Day for their state The first National Maritime Day after the end of the Korean War in 1954 was also more widely celebrated than most

In the 2006 annual proclamation by president George W Bush he made special mention of the Merchant Marine services hurricane aid work following Hurricane Katrina and the other hurricanes of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season

The Classical music period is the time from about 1750 to 1820 when Haydn Mozart Beethoven and Schubert were the most famous living composers 

We often talk about classical music meaning European music which is not pop music or jazz or folk music It is music which has been written by composers who have studied the art of composition The article Classical music talks about classical music in this sense

This article is about Classical music in the late 18th century and the early 19th century The word classical is often used to refer to the arts of Ancient Greece and Rome It has also come to mean any art form which has become very famous and is remembered for centuries afterwards In music the Classical period comes between the Baroque and the period of Romanticism

In some ways Classical music is often simpler than the music of the Baroque composers There is often a tune with a simple accompaniment using broken chords called an Alberti bass For classical composers the form of the piece was very important Composers started their work with a tune and this tune would be developed in different ways put in different keys changed from a fast to a slow tune changed from major to minor or from minor to major

Some of the most famous composers of the Classical period in music are

Spotlight is a magazine in German and English It is published by the Spotlight publishing company The first issue was made in 1981 It comes out monthly and has themes like politics and travelling in the English language The articles are in simple English and should help people to understand the language The magazine is written for Germans Translations of difficult English words into German are found in the magazine

Nuclear fusion is the process of making a single heavy nucleus from two lighter nuclei This process is called a nuclear reaction It releases a large amount of energy 

The nucleus made by fusion is heavier than either of the starting nuclei However it is not as heavy as the combination of the original mass of the starting nuclei This lost mass is changed into lots of energy This is shown in Einsteins famous Emc2 equation

Fusion happens in the middle of stars like the Sun Hydrogen and helium are fused together This releases lots of energy This energy powers the heat and light of the star Not all elements can be joined Heavier elements are less easily joined than lighter ones Iron cannot fuse with other atoms This is what causes stars to die Stars join all of their atoms together to make heavier atoms of different types until they start to make iron The iron nucleus cannot fuse with other nuclei The reactions stop The star eventually will cool down and die 

On Earth it is very hard to start nuclear fusion reactions that release more energy than is needed to start the reaction The only successful approach so far has been in nuclear weapons The hydrogen bomb uses an atomic bomb in order to start fusion reactions For over 50 years scientists and engineers have been trying to find a safe and working way of controlling and containing fusion reactions that can generate electricity They still have many challenges to overcome before it can be used as a clean source of energy

 The chromosomes of a cell are in the cell nucleus They carry the genetic information Chromosomes are made up of DNA and protein combined as chromatin Each chromosome contains many genes Chromosomes come in pairs one set from the mother the other set from the father Cytologists label chromosomes with numbers

Chromosomes are present in every cell nucleus with very few and special exceptions This means they are found in all eukaryotes since only eukaryotes have cell nuclei When eukaryote cells divide the chromosomes also divide When a somatic cell divides the process is called mitosis Before mitosis the cell copies all the chromosomes and then it can divide When they duplicate chromosomes look like the letter X They are called chromatids when they are doubled 

There are 46 chromosomes in a human 23 pairs Everyone has a set of chromosomes from their father and a matching set from their mother They include a pair of sex chromosomes The mothers eggs always contain an X chromosome while the fathers sperm contains either a Y chromosome or an X chromosome That determines the sex of the child To produce sex cells the stem cells go through a different division process called meiosis This reduces the 23 pairs to 23 singles These when combined by fertilisation produce the new set of 23 pairs

Different animals have different numbers of chromosomes If a person does not have the usual number of chromosomes they may die or have one or more peculiarities For example they might get a genetic disorder like Down syndrome and Klinefelters syndrome Some genetic disorders are more common than others

Giovanni Gabrieli was an Italian organist and composer He was very famous in his day and composed a great deal of church music motets and madrigals He lived at the end of the Renaissance period and beginning of the Baroque About 1575 Giovanni began working for Orlando di Lasso at the Bavarian court as his uncle Andres Gabrieli had before him Little is known of his time in Munich and he left in 1579 after the death of his patron Duke Albrecht There is no record of Gabrielis activities until 1584 when hed returned to Venice That year he replaced organist Claudio Merulo at Basilica di San Marco church of Venices patron saint Due to Merulos resignation a contest was eventually held January 1 1585 to fill his post which Gabrieli won having already occupied the position anyway Giovanni and his uncle who had raised him and taught him music worked together only a short time at the church before Andres died in August 1585 Giovanni held his post until he died in 1612

Henry Purcell was an English composer Most musicians think he is the greatest English composer of all times Although he only lived until he was 36 he wrote a very large amount of music His compositions include church music instrumental music music for the theatre even popular drinking songs He wrote the first English opera He lived in the time called the Baroque period He liked Italian and French music and combined those styles to make something that was typically English

We do not know very much about Purcells childhood In 1664 his father died and Henry went to live with his uncle Thomas Purcell who was very kind to him Thomas Purcell was a gentleman of the Chapel Royal which meant that he sang in the kings choir Soon Henry was singing in the Chapel Royal This was the best musical training a boy could have in England His teachers were Captain Henry Cooke and then Pelham Humfrey Henry sang in the choir until his voice broke in 1673 He was then given the job of looking after the kings musical instruments 

Purcell may have been composing already when he was nine We know that he wrote an ode for the Kings birthday in 1670 When Humfrey died Purcell studied with the famous composer John Blow He went to Westminster School In 1676 he was made organist at Westminster Abbey He started writing music for the theatre He also wrote church music including an anthem for a singer called John Gostling who had a very good deep bass voice Purcell wrote several anthems for him during his life One is called They that go down to the sea in ships It goes down to a low D

In 1680 Blow who had been made organist of Westminster Abbey in 1669 resigned so that the 22 year old Purcell could have his job Purcell then spent the next six years just writing sacred music Later he went back to writing music for the theatre including the first English opera Dido and Aeneas

In 1682 Purcell became organist of the Chapel Royal He did this job as well as being organist at Westminster Abbey His first printed composition Twelve Sonatas was published in 1683 Music printing was expensive in those days so it was unusual to have something printed He continued to write music including odes to the king and royal family In 1685 he wrote two of his finest anthems I was glad and My heart is inditing for the coronation of King James II

In 1687 he wrote more theatre music Sometimes this music was for masques sometimes it was music for tragedies eg plays by Dryden In 1691 he wrote King Arthur also written by Dryden In 1692 he composed songs and music for The Fairy Queen Purcells music for this was lost for many years and was rediscovered and published in 1901 In these works the characters in the plays do not sing they speak their lines

Purcells Te Deum and Jubilate was written for Saint Cecilias Day 1693 the first English Te Deum ever composed with orchestral accompaniment He composed an anthem and two elegies for Queen Mary IIs funeral

He was very famous when he died in 1695 possibly from tuberculosis His wife and three of his six children survived him 

Purcell is buried next to the organ in Westminster Abbey His epitaph reads Here lyes Henry Purcell Esq who left this life and is gone to that blessed place where only his harmony can be exceeded

Purcell wrote a lot of music for the theatre He was born one year before the time known in England as the Restoration Before the Restoration Oliver Cromwell had been ruling England for nearly 20 years Most music had been banned People were therefore very glad to be able to make music again and they wanted lots of songs and instrumental music in their plays Opera however was not wanted In Europe opera was very popular in countries such as Italy Germany and France but it did not become popular in England until Handel came to England in 1709 and introduced Italian opera

Dido and Aeneas is an exception because it is a real opera everything is sung and the words are in English It was written for a performance at a girls school It is quite short lasting just one hour It contains the famous lament When I am laid in earth sung by Dido

Purcell wrote a very large amount of music for the church This includes anthems and service settings Although he was an organist he wrote very little for organ He wrote chamber music including some very beautiful fantasias for viols

Although Purcell was recognized as a great composer at the time he did not have much influence on other composers after his death He was the last in a line of great English musicians in the 16th and 17th centuries After his death English music was not as important as it had been In the 18th century the music heard in England was largely imported from the continent eg Italian opera 

Much later in the 20th century English composers were often inspired by Purcells music Benjamin Britten wrote a piece called The Young Persons Guide to the Orchestra which is based on a tune from Purcells Abdelazar The aria I know a bank from Brittens opera A Midsummer Nights Dream is inspired by Purcells aria Sweeter than Roses Sir Michael Tippett loved Purcells harmonies and rhythms and they influenced him in his compositions
