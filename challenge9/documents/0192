Bone fractures happen when a bone is damaged by stress The bone can be fractured in many different ways 

The main types of fractures are

A phase is one part of a cycle or change that goes in a circle For example the moon has phases 

The seasons of the year spring summer fall and winter are also phases Graphs can be made for things that have phases Things that have phases change in some regular way from time to time For example a pendulum in a clock moves from some position x to the bottom and then to some position x Two pendulums may have the same length but unless they begin swinging at the same time and place they will not move together One may be swinging left while the other swings right When something like that happens the two vibrations are not in phase

Los Alamitos Army Airfield Airport codesKSLISLI is a military airport located one mile southeast of central Los Alamitos and within its city limits in Orange County California USA

Los Alamitos Army Airfield has two runways

In the 1930s the Long Beach Airport was owned by that city and was also used as a Naval Reserve air station In the late 1930s and early 1940s the United States Navy perceived as a hostile attitude on the part of the City of Long Beach regarding improvements and maintenance of Long Beach Airport Without telling the Long Beach officials the Navy began looking for a new place for its flight operations Admiral Ernest J King then the Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics and Admirals William D Leahy Joseph K Taussig and Allen E Smith pointedly requested that the city of Long Beach repair the runways and reminded the city that the Pacific Fleet then laying offshore in both Long Beach and San Pedro harbors had a payroll of more than 1 million a month Eventually the city complied with the Navys requests

Still the city continued to show a hostile attitude toward approving a lease on any additional land that the Naval Reserve required

The Navy was fed up with the city of Long Beach It decided upon the purchase of some property owned by Susanna Bixby Bryant a fact made known by the commander of the base Commander Thomas A Gray to the Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics Admiral John H Towers The circumstances behind the purchase were revealed to James V Forrestal Under Secretary of the Navy and by him to the House Naval Affairs committee who approved the purchase Although Comdr Gray had offered Mrs Bryant 350 an acre in the best patriotic spirit she sold the property at 300 an acre The land is 4 miles east of the Long Beach Airport

With the site acquired in 1941 construction funds soon followed and Naval Reserve Air Base Los Alamitos began to take shape The new base provided many jobs and spurred modest growth On 1 June 1941 operations physically relocated from Long Beach to Los Alamitos

By May 1942 Los Alamitos was operating with a complete physical plant including administrative office sick bay a synthetic training facility central files classroom and an assembly repair department With a station complement of approximately 2500 officers and men the initial aviation cadets began their training The first graduating class numbered 729 cadets 180 having washed out By the end of the year the bases 36 planes had increased to 140 and in 1943 five outlying fields were acquired Training was carried out mostly in plywood planes When changed from the command of the Naval Primary Training Command to that of Naval Air Center Eleventh Naval District on 15 August 1943 it was used to station carrier air groups Renamed a naval air station its flight operations were conducted by a Fleet Air Detachment with station complement dropping from about 250 officers and 2000 men to 40 officers and 500 men and the Assembly and Repair Department discontinued but still used by the CASU on board Many CASUs and ARGUSs were formed at and dispatched from Los Alamitos during the war With additional construction undertaken after mid 1943 the total investment at the station to 1 January 1945 was 482701464 Growing from one officer one man and one plane in 1928 Los Alamitos in 1945 had become one of the Navys most important air stations 

On 15 August 1943 it became an operational training base for training of fleet units and was reclassified as a Naval Air Station In addition to providing training the base serviced aircraft from the battle fleet including carrier air groups from USS Lexington Saratoga and Langley

NRAB Los Alamitos was initially under the command of the naval operating base at San Pedro California Like other Naval Reserve Air Bases established during the 1930s it fell under the command of the Naval Air Primary Training Command on 1 October 1942 Naval Air Center Eleventh Naval District San Diego on 15 August 1943 and finally Naval Air Bases Eleventh Naval District on 10 August 1944 As an NRAB the mission of Los Alamitos was to instruct train and drill Naval Reserve aviation personnel living in the Eleventh Naval District

Many former military personnel chose to stay on in the City of Los Alamitos after the war living in such neighbourhoods as Carrier Row where streets are named for World War II aircraft carriers 

As was the case with other naval air stations retained in operating status following the war Los Alamitos suffered a period of transitions and changes Under the command of the Chief of Naval Air Training at NAS Pensacola its missions were to train reservists and service the fleet On 1 March 1946 while it provided training CASU 33 supported Air Group 98 but the devotion of activity could be measured by the fact that as of 28 February 1946 it had only ninety seven V 6 personnel on active duty as station keepers yet until the end of September this group provided proficiency flying for more than 1500 inactive reserve pilots Meanwhile CASU 706 supported Patrol Squadron 908 Escort Carrier Air Groups 779 and 778 and Carrier Air Group 716 On 16 August 1946 the first group of aviation cadets in the Selective Training Program came on board and after 1 September the station would be used by the Naval Air Transport Service On 13 October the record making Truculent Turtle which had flown nonstop for almost 4500 miles paid the station a visit By the end of 1946 with 243 reserve pilots 1375 volunteer reserve pilots 255 inactive reserve enlisted men and 368 active duty station keepers Los Alamitos was one of the busiest Naval Air Reserve Stations Between January and March 1947 the station became the largest in the entire Naval Reserve air training program 

On 17 May 1947 the administration of NAF Litchfield Park southwest of downtown Phoenix Arizona was placed under Los Alamitos to serve volunteer reserve aviation personnel in the Phoenix Tucson area With 1300 organized reservists 1682 inactive reservists 12 over aged reservists 7 women reservists and 583 station keepers Los Alamitos remained the largest Naval Air Reserve Station in the United States

On board during the first quarter of 1948 were a light carrier aircraft group two carrier air groups two escort carrier air groups two patrol plane squadrons three transport squadrons four fleet aircraft service squadrons two Marine fighting squadrons and a Marine ground control interceptor unit two volunteer units one at Litchfield one on the station proper a NATS Unit GCA and an all weather station Until it was decided that there were not enough personnel to continue associated volunteer units at Bakersfield Municipal Airport and Santa Barbara Los Alamitos assumed administrative responsibilities for them At the station full operations were carried on for five days a week from 0730 to 1630 Saturday night was reserved for night flying Operations were limited on Mondays and Thursdays weekends were madhouses as the weekend warriors came on board 

On 7 November 1949 Los Alamitos received its first jet aircraft an FJ 1 Fury With all FGs replaced with F6F Hellcats a reorganisation occurred on 1 December 1950 in which there was provided a wing staff with twenty five squadrons During the summer of 1950 105 midshipmen from the United States Naval Academy reported for four days of an air cruise and 112 seamen reported for eight weeks of training duty Meanwhile there was a waiting list for pilots and ground officers When the naval aviation cadet programme which had opened on 1 July closed on 25 October 1950 Los Alamitos had obtained a tenth of the cadets recruited in the entire nation Meanwhile in answer to President Trumans request for reservists to volunteer for duty during the Korean War VG 781 requested mobilization as a complete unit and was accepted the first squadron in the nation to do so Three Marine Corps Organized Reserve units were ordered to active duty and so was VP 772 To speed up training on 6 March and again on 16 May 1951 ninety day trainees reported on board The third group of trainees came on board for training 16 June and many of them and station personnel helped saved lives and property during heavy rains and floods that damaged the nearby town of Los Alamitos On 15 January 1952 the first helicopter unit came to the base Also in 1952 a reserve air intelligence unit came to the base

On 16 July 1957 then Major John H Glenn Jr USMC set the Transcontinental air speed record flying a F8U 1 Crusader from NAS Los Alamitos to Floyd Bennett Field New York in 3 hours 23 minutes and 84 seconds Project Bullet as the mission was called provided both the first transcontinental flight to average supersonic speed and the first continuous transcontinental panoramic photograph of the United States Glenn was awarded his fifth Distinguished Flying Cross for the mission

For the next decade operations at Los Alamitos were routine In 1970 however the Navy closed the station as a Naval Air Reserve training facility and let it serve merely as a Naval Air Station In 1972 helicopter elements of both the California Army National Guard and United States Army Reserve relocated from leased facilities at commercial airports to NAS Los Alamitos Following approval of an environmental impact statement filed in August 1973 the base was designated an Armed Forces Reserve Center for which the Navy was designated host and the California Army National Guard was charged with operating the airfield

The senior command on post is the 40th Infantry Division headquartered in the large prominent building facing the flagpole and main entrance artery

On 23 August 1977 ownership of the base was transferred from the US Navy to the US Army The US Army licensed the operation of the base to the California Army National Guard The base was commanded by BG James Benson Los Alamitos Army Airfield was commanded by LTC James C Ghormley III

In July 2000 Los Alamitos Armed Force Reserve Center was renamed Los Alamitos Joint Forces Training Center

This place served as the starting line for the 14th season of the hit CBS Reality TV Show The Amazing Race The bases status as an alternate landing area for Air Force One was mentioned in a West Wing episode

Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility commonly called Jefferson Lab or JLab is a US national laboratory in Newport News Virginia It is near exit 256 of Interstate 64 Since June 1 2006 it has been operated by Jefferson Science Associates LLC a joint venture between Southeastern Universities Research Association Inc and CSC Applied Technologies LLC Until 1996 it was known as the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility This name is still used a lot for the main accelerator

Founded in 1984 JLab employs over 675 people Over 2000 scientists from around the world have conducted research using the facility Its mission is to provide forefront scientific facilities opportunities and leadership essential for discovering the fundamental structure of nuclear matter to partner in industry to apply its advanced technology and to serve the nation and its communities through education and public outreach

The facility is being rebuilt to increase its energy from 6 GeV to 12 GeV To do this more powerful magnets and power supplies are added to the accelerator Also a new experimental hall will be added The CEBAF is shut down from May to December 2011 for installation and construction will be completed by 2013 Full operations will begin in 2015

The laboratorys main research facility is the CEBAF accelerator which consists of a polarized electron source and injector and a pair of 78 mile long superconducting RF linear accelerators The ends of the two linear accelerators are connected to each other by two arc sections with magnets that bend the electron beam in an arc So the beam path is a race track shaped oval As the electron beam makes up to five successive orbits its energy is increased up to a maximum of 6 GeV Effectively CEBAF is a linear accelerator like SLAC at Stanford that has been folded up to a tenth of its normal length It acts as if it were a 78 mile long linear accelerator

The design of CEBAF allows the electron beam to be continuous rather than the pulsed beam typical of ring shaped accelerators The electron beam is directed onto three potential targets One of the distinguishing features of JLab is the continuous nature of the electron beam with a bunch length of less than 1 picosecond Another is JLabs use of superconducting RF technology which uses liquid helium to cool niobium to approximately 4 K removing electrical resistance and allowing the most efficient transfer of energy to an electron To achieve this JLab uses the worlds largest liquid helium refrigerator and was one of the first large scale implementators of SRF technology The accelerator is built 8 meters or approximately 25 feet below the Earths surface and the walls of the accelerator tunnels are 2 feet thick 

The beam ends in three experimental halls called Hall A Hall B and Hall C Each hall contains a unique spectrometer to record the results of collisions between the electron beam and a stationary target This allows physicists to study the structure of the atomic nucleus specifically the interaction of the quarks that make up protons and neutrons of the nucleus

Each time around the loop the beam passes through each of the two LINAC accelerators but through a different set of bending magnets The electrons make up to five passes through the LINAC accelerators

When a nucleus in the target is hit by an electron from the beam an interaction or event occurs scattering particles into the hall Each hall contains an array of particle detectors that track the physical properties of the particles produced by the event The detectors generate electrical pulses that are converted into digital values by analog to digital converters time to digital converters and pulse counters 

This digital data must be gathered and stored so that the physicist can later analyze the data and reconstruct the physics that occurred The system of electronics and computers that perform this task is called a data acquisition system

As of June 2010 construction has begun an additional end station Hall D on the opposite end of the accelerator from the other three halls as well as an upgrade which doubles the beam energy to 12 GeV Concurrently an addition to the Test Lab is being constructed

JLab houses the worlds most powerful tunable free electron laser with an output of over 14 kilowatts The United States Navy funds this research to develop an laser that could shoot down missles Because the lab does classified military research it is closed to the public except for an open house held once every two years

The JLab free electron laser uses an energy recovery LINAC Electrons are injected into a linear accelerator The fast moving electrons then pass through a wiggler which produces a bright laser light beam The electrons are then captured and steered back to the injection end of the LINAC where they transfer most of their energy to a new batch of electrons to repeat the process By reusing the electrons and most of their energy the free electron laser requires less electricity to operate The JLab is the first energy recovery LINAC to produce ultravoliet light Cornell University is now trying to build one to produce X rays

Since CEBAF has three complementary experiments running simultaneously it was decided that the three data acquisition systems should be as similar as possible so that physicists moving from one experiment to another would find a familiar environment To that end a group of specialist physicists was hired to form a data acquisition development group to develop a common system for all three halls CODA the CEBAF Online Data Acquisition system was the result 

CODA is a set of software tools and recommended hardware that helps build a data acquisition system for nuclear physics experiments In nuclear and particle physics experiments the particle tracks are digitized by the data acquisition system but the detectors are capable of generating a large number of possible measurements or data channels

The ADC TDC and other digital electronics are typically large circuit boards with connectors at the front edge that provide input and output for digital signals and a connector at the back that plugs into a backplane A group of boards are plugged into a chassis or crate that provides physical support power and cooling for the boards and backplane This arrangement allows electronics capable of digitizing many hundreds of channels to fit into a single chassis

In the CODA system each chassis contains a board that is an intelligent controller for the rest of the chassis This board called a ReadOut Controller configures each of the digitizing boards upon first receiving data reads the data from the digitizers and formats the data for later analysis

Sir William Golding was a British novel writer He is famous for his novel Lord of the Flies He received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1983 In 2008 The Times ranked Golding third on its list of The 50 Greatest British writers since 1945

Golding was born in Cornwall England on 19 September 1911 His father Alec Golding was a school master at Marlborough Grammar School Golding and his older brother Joseph went to their fathers school In 1930 Golding went to Brasenose College at the University of Oxford He studied Natural Sciences and then English Literature there Golding graduated in 1935

Golding then worked as an actor producer and a writer Then he became a teacher at Bishop Wordsworths School Salisbury Golding joined the Royal Navy in 1940 When World War II ended Golding continued teaching and writing He left Bishop Wordsworths School in 1961 and began writing full time

Goldings first published novel was Lord of the Flies Golding used his experience of the Second World War and his teaching knowledge of children to write the book He was appalled at what people did to one another during the World War II He wanted to show how he thought about human nature Golding believed that people are innately evil Lord of the Flies is a story about a group of school boys who are trapped on a desert island The children quickly become savages and begin to murder each other The novel gained widespread interest because of its political message Golding went on to write many more books including The Inheritors Rights of Passage and many others

Golding was knighted for his work in 1988 He died five years later on 19 June 1993 of heart failure in Cornwall

Homesickness is a feeling of unhappiness a person may have when away from home or from familiar surroundings or people It has a similar meaning to the word nostalgia

People sometimes become homesick when they travel They miss their own home and desperately want to go back Children may often feel homesick especially when they are away from their parents for the first time Usually these feelings will go away as one gets used to the new environment but sometimes homesickness can make a person depressed

People may easily feel homesick if they travel to an environment in which the culture is very difficult to what they are used to and especially if a foreign language is being spoken  Children who are sent away to boarding school will very often feel homesick

A good way to help children overcome homesickness is to start with being away from home just for short periods staying with people they know well eg grandparents or good friends

George Crabbe was an English poet and naturalist His poem The Borough which describes life in a small town in Suffolk inspired Benjamin Britten to compose his opera Peter Grimes

George Crabbe was born in Aldeburgh Suffolk His father was a tax collector As a child he loved poetry In 1768 he was apprenticed to a local doctor but he did not learn much from him  In 1771 he changed masters and moved to Woodbridge There he met Sarah Elmy who was to become his wife She had the patience to wait until he had finished his medical studies before marrying him She encouraged him in his verse writing In 1775 he published his first work Inebriety In 1780 he decided to give up being a doctor He borrowed some money and went to London where he tried to become known as a poet It took several years during which time he became a clergyman He became chaplain to the Duke of Rutland at Belvoir Castle in Leicestershire

Crabbe became well known when he wrote a poem called The Village It was a long poem which described life in the country as he had known it In 1783 he married Sarah In 1814 he became Rector of Trowbridge in Wiltshire where he stayed  Now that he had a family he did not feel any more need to write poetry and so he wrote nothing for 22 years He then wrote more poems about the village community including The Borough By the time of his death he was well known and a friend of William Wordsworth Sir Walter Scott and other important literary figures of the time

Crabbe also knew a lot about insects and made a detailed study of beetles

Like George Crabbe the composer Benjamin Britten also came from Aldeburgh When he was in America during World War II he read Crabbes poem The Borough It made him homesick and he decided to return to England He wrote an opera Peter Grimes which was based on Crabbes poem It is one of the greatest operas of the 20th century

A free electron laser or FEL is a laser that produces a very bright beam of light It shares the same optical properties as conventional lasers such as emitting a beam consisting of coherent electromagnetic radiation which can reach high power The FEL used operating principles to form the beam that are very different operating principles of a conventional laser Unlike gas liquid or solid state lasers such as diode lasers in which electrons are excited while bound to atoms FELs use a relativistic electron beam as the lasing medium which moves freely through a magnetic structure hence the term free electron The free electron laser has the widest frequency range of any laser type and can be widely tunable currently ranging in wavelength from microwaves through terahertz radiation and infrared to the visible spectrum to ultraviolet to X rays

Freeelectron lasers were invented by John Madey in 1976 at Stanford University The work builds on research done by Hans Motz and his coworkers who made the first undulator at Stanford in 1953 using the wiggler magnetic configuration which is at the heart of a free electron laser Madey used a 24 MeV electron beam and 5 m long wiggler to amplify a signal Soon afterward other laboratories with accelerators started developing such lasers

Free electron lasers use a lot of electricity when they operate To reduce the energy needed to keep them operating scientist use an energy recovery linear accelerator to recycle the high energy electron beam that activates the laser

Hello all

I have just had a look According to our Announcements page we had 55 Good and 39 Very Good articles in February 2011 It turns out we currently are at 54 Good and 37 Very Good articles I know that strength does not lie in numbers in this case but I still think we should do more in this regard In the same time period about 9000 articles were created Personally I think we should work more on quality than on quantity As far as I know the only objective measure we have are these numbers So

I am sorry to spoil your chrismas mood but if something is to be done we had better start now  Eptalon 1015 18 December 2011 As big an advocate I am of theGA processes DJSasso has a point that cannot be denied GAs are a lot of work and the question must be asked if this could be better spent And for the most part I believe the answer to be both yes and no Let me explain

The people who use theGA processes can largely be grouped into two categories  the users and the abusers  the latter the ones who do not use the processes as I feel they were intended It is in this way that the processes appear to the outsider to be an awful lot of red tape bureaucracy and hard work And it is here where I can understand and completely agree with DJSassos argument  it takes up a lot of time from a lot of different editors  the nominators the reviewers the commentators  to get an article toGA status when it is clearly far far far from that point The process is designed to recieve quality well written articles which require very little work to satisfy the requirements and promote them officially to the status yet in practice it recieves articles that are incomplete poor and certainly not the nearly there articles that we should have and this can be clearly seen in the archives from the number of failed nominations It is nothing about lack of input as those using the process correctly will ultimately reap the rewards

When I write an article I do write it with a view to it becoming a good or very good article at some point and when it gets nominated it generally meets all the criteria by simply being a quality article Yes theres always bits to improve and get pciked up on but the wiki is never finished so this is perhaps a good thing It takes just a little more effort on my part to do this before the article then tends to get promoted ahead of when the discussion is scheduled to close Regulars may also notice that I tend to revisit most of my currentGAs to ensure that they remain up to date too This would be the same even if an article was not aGA I can assure you I know of other writers that haveGA experiences largely the same as mine

The issue withGA being counter productive comes from those that do not do this  they write articles that are to put it bluntly crap and then expect nay demand that the reviewers are the ones to fix them This is whereGA becomes labourious  for both parties  and where I feel some ill feeling comes from

Anyway Im now slightly digressing from the main point of this discussion so I will curtail this particular point here I think To finish in response to Eptalons comments there is no reason to change or abolish the process or add a third tier of articles Equally though people should not be pushing everyone to writeGAs as DJSasso rightly states some are not suited to it and its not a useful thing to do

Ok  moving on Ive got two more trains of thought to put out there before finishing up Quality over quantity  there are two ways of interpreting this statement and it really isnt appropriate for what this discussion is about

An article DOES NOT have to be aGA to be quality At all Ever And this is where DJSasso and the IP hit the money yet Eptalon falls extremely short There are many quality articles out there and its perfectly possible to have both quality and quantity without aGA process ever existing To be totally honest this is where we should be aiming

The issue that we have is that a large amount of articles are crap There is no other way to put that Weve done a lot to reduce this number through mass deletion in recent times but there are still an awful lot of them out there and this needs to change It will eventually but it also requires more people to be more vigilant at fixing and removing things as appropriate Note Im not suggesting we QDRfD anything thats below a standard as short blue links can be equally helpful to getting new users Its just a case of expanding articles even if only slightly when they are stumbled upon

Numbers lie  they always will  and arent a true representation of the wiki In short we shouldnt take any notice of them and most of our readers will completely ignore them  they want the information they came for and if its not there then thats why theyll get upset For reasons mentioned above theGA count will never truly reflect the amount of quality content on the wiki whilst the full article counts are also relatively useless as they also dont give a good count of the comprehensiveness of the wiki either And its this thats largely spawned my third and final key point

Eptalon As much as we all respect your viewpoints and input on the wiki the same as we do any other users but perhaps with a little extra due to the fact youve been here largely since the early days youre not in charge and length of service really counts for nothing I believe Ive brought this up before so this should come as a shock to no one This isnt the first pointless thread that youve started along these lines and sadly I doubt it will be the last Its something that we cannot worry about and isnt really of any importance to the wiki in the Grand Scale of Things Dont take this the wrong way please I mean it in the nicest possible way and you do a sterling job on content for the wiki and are a useful asset to the team Just think of the drama that this thread will undoubtably cause as it grows and if its really of any importance before posting Please And everyone else Eptalons just another user like me you or anyone else Can we please bare this in mind

Anyway this is much longer than I intended it to be so my apologies for that Likewise apologies if anythings unclear or confusing Ive gone through a few times to try and clear everything up but just ask if it needs clarification

Whether my third point is appropriate for this thread or not I dont know but I felt it needed saying Ive been as polite about it as I possibly can but as you all know Im not known for pussy footing around issues and I havent this time  the key difference is that as I mentioned in my brackets Eptalon wants whats best for the wiki whereas most who I berate are here only to use it as their own personal playground and seek to piss off as many of us as possible

The current process is too inefficient I believe that the En Wikipedia model is better have one person volunteer to do the GA review and then have a larger participation for the VGA review In this manner the article author can work one on one with the GA reviewer over tweaks and obvious things Once the article reaches the GA level when it is nominated for VGA the obvious things would have already been addressed without taking the time of a dozen different people We need to focus on both the problem and the solution The two problems are lack of incentives for improving article quality and a shortage of volunteers The solution is to have an attainable ladder of article quality ratings and an efficient method for evaluating articles Redoubling our current efforts without redesigning the process will not lead to better results Thanks Racepacket 1930 18 December 2011

Im new here but Im currently engaged in clearing up the unsourced articles backlog Has the idea of a bot to date maintenance tags ever been floated around Itd help to have all tagged articles categorised by month

At the moment articles tagged without a date set are being added to CategoryAll articles lacking sources but not to the monthly subcategories workload which means the problem may never get looked at Osiris 0348 13 December 2011

Given the current situation I propose to have a tag maintinence bot created Shakinglord 1814 13 December 2011 

I also see that it used to be a task of UserSoxBot but it doesnt seem to do it anymore Osiris 0937 15 December 2011

When editing there is a box for marking small changes In a watchlist such edits show up with the m marking for minor same as on ENWP This seems to me like a pointless inconsistency Is this a built in system thing or would it be at feasible to change the marking to s for the small change terminology that simple uses PrincessofLlyr talk 1926 18 December 2011

I think we need to be more consistent in the capitalization of article titles and category titles For example CategoryRapid Transport Systems probably should be all lower case We also have Infobox templates some with all words capitalized and others with lower case This can be very confusing to editors How hard would it be to write a PHP script to make them all lower case and also change all references to them Thanks Racepacket 1218 21 December 2011

How can AWB not do it We rename the cat then run AWB through the articles in the cat Normandy 1912 21 December 2011

Id support this Ive also redirected quite a few templates like Osiris has Id also be willing to help if you need another hand  Auntof6 1925 21 December 2011

Categories cannot be renamed unless something has changed since I last had the mop Create a new one alter the articles then delete the old Goblin 2306 21 December 2011 I Orashmatash

Our capitalization standards are the same as ens If you see something that isnt right then be bold and fix it DJSasso 2314 21 December 2011

Kirkpatrick Sale is an independent scholar and author who has written about political decentralism environmentalism luddism and technology People say he has a philosophy unified by decentralism and as being a leader of the Neo Luddites an anti globalization leftist and the theoretician for a new secessionist movement

Sale grew up in Cayuga Heights Ithaca New York and would later say of the village that he spent most of my first twenty years there and that has made an imprint on meon my philosophy social attitudes certainly on my politicsthat has lasted powerfully for the rest of my life He graduated from Cornell University majoring in history in 1958 He served as editor of the student owned and managed newspaper the Cornell Daily Sun Sale was one of the leaders of the May 23 1958 protest against university policies forbidding male and female students fraternizing and its in loco parentis policy Sale and his friend and roommate Richard Farina and three others were charged by Cornell The protest was described in Farinas 1966 novel Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me

In 1958 he collaborated with Thomas Pynchon on an unproduced futuristic musical called Minstrel Island

Upon graduating in 1958 Sale married Faith Apfelbaum She later worked as an editor with Thomas Pynchon Kurt Vonnegut Joseph Heller and Amy Tan Faith died in 1999

Sale worked initially in journalism for the leftist journal New Leader a magazine founded in 1924 in part by socialists Norman Thomas and Eugene Debs and the New York Times Magazine He then became a freelance journalist He spent time in Ghana and wrote his first book about it His second book SDS was about the radical 1960s group Students for a Democratic Society of which he was a founder The book is still considered one of the best sources on the youth activist organization that helped define 1960s radicalism In 1968 he signed the Writers and Editors War Tax Protest pledge vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War Subsequent books explored radical decentralism bioregionalism environmentalism the Luddites and similar themes He has been a regular contributor to progressive magazines like Mother Jones and The Nation for the better part of his writing career and has continued to write for those publications as well as for The American Conservative CounterPunch The New York Review of Books and the Utne Reader Sale presented public affairs programming for WBAI in the early 1980s and has made appearances on alternative radio over the years

In his 1990 book The Conquest of Paradise Christopher Columbus and the Columbian Legacy Sale argued that Christopher Columbus was an imperialist bent on conquest from his first voyage In a New York Times book review historian and member of the Christopher Columbus Quincentenary Jubilee Committee William H McNeill wrote about Sale he has set out to destroy the heroic image that earlier writers have transmitted to us Mr Sale makes Columbus out to be cruel greedy and incompetent and a man who was perversely intent on abusing the natural paradise on which he intruded The book Taking Sides Clashing Views on Controversial Issues in American History presents a debate between Sale and Robert Royal vice president for research at the Ethics and Public Policy Center who insisted that Columbus was a courageous risk taker who advanced knowledge about other parts of the world

Sale has written extensively and skeptically about technology and has said he is a great admirer of anarchoprimitivist John Zerzan He has described personal computers as the devils work and in the past started public speeches by smashing one

Sale has said that he does not care much for popular music outside some of the Tin Pan Alley era tunes of the early 20th century For example he once heard a racket in a nightclub during the 1960s from some young man everyone told him was a big deal That young man turned out to be Bob Dylan Kirk recalls that hed never heard anything so awful in his life

In 1995 Sale agreed to a public bet with Kevin Kelly that by the year 2020 there would be three disasters global currency collapse significant warfare between rich and poor and environmental disasters of some significant size The bet was turned into a claim on the FX prediction market where the probability has hovered around 25

Sale believes that people should be able to break apart large nation states into small pieces Sale has been called one of the intellectual godfathers of the secessionist movement He argues that the major theme of contemporary history from the dissolution of the Soviet Union to the expansion of United Nations membership from 51 in 1945 to UNnum nations today is the breakup of great empires People on both left and right call for smaller less powerful government

In 2004 Sale and members of the Second Vermont Republic formed the Middlebury Institute which is dedicated to the study of separatism secession and self determination Sale is director of the institute In 2006 Middlebury sponsored the First North American Secessionist Convention which attracted 40 participants from 16 secessionist organizations and was described as the first gathering of secessionists since the American Civil War Delegates issued a statement of principles of secession which they presented as the Burlington Declaration

In October 2007 the New York Times interviewed Sale about the Second North American Secessionist Convention co hosted by the Middlebury Institute Sale told the interviewer The virtue of small government is that the mistakes are small as well He went on to say If you want to leave a nation you think is corrupt inefficient militaristic oppressive repressive but you dont want to move to Canada or France what do you do Well the way is through secession where you could stay home and be where you want to be The convention received worldwide media attention

News stories about the Second North American Secessionist Convention in 2007 mentioned the controversial Southern Poverty Law Centers allegations that the other co sponsor The League of the South was a racist hate group Sale responded They call everybody racists There are no doubt racists in the League of the South and there are no doubt racists everywhere The Southern Poverty Law Center later criticized the New York Times October 2007 Peter Applebombe interview of Sale for not covering its allegations

Sale wrote the foreword to Thomas Naylors 2008 book Secession How Vermont and all the Other States Can Save Themselves from the Empire Sale continues to speak on secession and other issues around the nation

The Big Weekend is an informal event held over a weekend that focuses editing on a particular topic The basic idea is to get a group of editors working together to increase and improve articles Being informal there is no need to register or to commit to anything You can do as much or as little as you have time for The topics for the Big Weekend are broad enough so that everyone can find something of interest to write about

A Big Weekend needs to be long enough to allow editors from around the world to take part within their own time zones The times also need to be flexible enough to allow articles to be completed Experience from the first two Big Weekends showed that a time period of about five days was quite suitable

The success of a Big Weekend can be measured by the number and quality of edits made to the target topic Other edits such as to relevant templates and categories linking etc also add to the success of the weekend All relevant edits help so some editors may be part of a big weekend without even knowing At the moment the edits have been manually counted This was easy when the target was to create new articles much harder when it was adding to existing articles The adding of a code such as BW in the editing summary made the counting easier The focus needs to be on article creation and improvement not on lists or edit counts As there is no prize or glory a rough total count is fine to measure the success And one edit is one more than there was at the start so success is easy 

This articles talk page is a good place to plan the next Big Weekend

The task was create articles from the Deaths in 2011 list Over the weekend there were 48 new articles on biography created Some were short bio stubs but many were more extended This involved 15 editors and one IP

The task was to make sure the SEWP had articles on all the worlds capital cities These included ancient and provincial capitals too Over the weekend there were 394 edits to capital cities and related articles

Graphene is one of the forms of carbon Like diamonds and graphite the forms of carbon have different crystal structures and this gives them different properties Graphene is the basic 2D form of a number of 3D allotropes such as graphite charcoal fullerene and carbon nanotubes

The term graphene was coined as a combination of graphite and the suffix ene by Hanns Peter Boehm who described single layer carbon foils in 1962 Graphene is like a honeycomb or chicken wire structure made of carbon atoms and their bonds Graphite is many graphene sheets stacked together

A stack of three million sheets graphene sheets stacked to form graphite would be only one millimeter thick 

The Nobel Prize in Physics for 2010 was awarded to Sir Andre Geim and Sir Konstantin Novoselov for groundbreaking experiments regarding the two dimensional material graphene

Rory Williams is a fictional character in the British science fiction television series Doctor Who He was played by Arthur Darvill Rory was first seen at the start of the 5th series He joined the Eleventh Doctor as a companion in the middle of Series 5 Rory began as Amy Ponds fianc He was uncomfortable around the Doctor at first This was because he believed that Amy cared more for the Doctor than she did for him Later he shows that he is truly a hero Amy learns that she has always loved him and they get married They conceive Melody Pond inside the TARDIS while it is travelling through time Their baby is kidnapped at birth Rory and Amy learn that their daughter is River Song and become related to the Doctor when he marries River in The Wedding of River Song

Rory Williams has been a close friend of Amelia Amy Pond since they were children They grew up in Leadworth a fictional village near Gloucester in South West England along with their friend Mels Mels secretly knows that she is their future daughter Melody and is oddly enough who Melody is named after The kids often played dress up Amy makes Rory dress as her imaginary friend the Raggedy Doctor 

Amelia first kisses Rory while dancing the macarenaAmelia grew up thinking of herself as counting as a boy and Rory was afraid to ever tell her his feelings toward her She never thought that Rory was in love with her Because he had never shown any romantic interest in other girls she thought he was gay Because of this she never acted on her own feelings towards him A year or two before the Doctor returns to Leadworth Mels tells Rory and Amy that they have feelings for each other This starts their relationship and in the end causes herself to actually be born

Rory is first seen in The Eleventh Hour At this point he is in a romantic relationship with Amy In 2008 he works as a nurse at the local hospital He is curious about coma patients that he sees in the village He is shocked to meet Amys imaginary Raggedy Doctor Although meeting him is confusing he know it is the Doctor without being told

During the next two years the Rory and Amy decide to get married The Doctor returns the night before Rory and Amys wedding She travels in time with him but only after the Doctor promises to return her before the next morning After Amy tried to seduce the Doctor the Doctor takes her and Rory to 1580s Venice to fix the couples relationship Rory has always a problem with the Doctor because of his connection with Amy and her interest in him He grows more annoyed and even paranoid with the relationship It gets worse when the Doctor tells Rory that she kissed him When Rory says that they should go back to Leadworth Amy asks him to travel with them The Doctor agrees and Rory accepts In the episode Amys Choice They have a shared dream in which they are married and Amy is pregnant As Rory is about to die he tells Amy to look after their baby This causes Amy to see how much she loves him Rory travels with the Doctor and Amy until Cold Blood In that episode he is shot dead after saving the Doctor He is then absorbed by a crack in time and space The crack removes him all of time As he is a part of Amys history she does not remembers him any more because he never existed He was removed from existence completely

He is seen again in The Pandorica Opens He is a Roman soldier in AD 102 It is shown that it is not really him but a plastic duplicate with Rorys memories He tried to fight his programming but still shoots Amy In the last episode of series 5 The Big Bang the false Rory frees the Doctor from the Pandorica He puts Amy inside the Pandorica to keep her safe The Pandorica is said to be the greatest prison It was built to keep the person inside it healthy forever The fake Rory guarded the Pandorica for 1894 years He became known as the Last Centurion He guarded the Pandorica wherever it was taken He moved it to safety when the warehouse in London it was being kept in was destroyed during The Blitz Finally he helped a young Amy open the Pandorica and set free the adult Amy who had been fully healled over time The Auton Rory helped the Doctor Amy and River Song save the universe from the explosion that caused the cracks in time

After the cracks were fixed Rory was returned to his timeline Everyones memories were returned and he and Amy got married When the Doctor went to the reception he called Rory Mr Pond Rory did not like the name at first but accepted that is basically the truth The Doctor left Rory and Amy for their honeymoon

In series 6 Rory is a full time companion After the Doctor saves the cruise ship they were on during their honymoon from crashing Rory and Amy join him again in the TARDIS After some time travelling with the Doctor Rory and Amy return to Leadworth for two months

Rory and the Doctor are friends but their relationship is troubled by Rorys feelings that Amy may love the Doctor more than him In Day of the Moon he thinks that some of the things he hears Amy say are about the Doctor and not about him He later learns that the comments were about him He also gets concerned when he hears Amy tell to the Doctor that she never told Rory that she thought she was pregnant He forgives this when he learns that she was worried that would be a problem with the baby because of traveling in the TARDIS so much

Sometime before The Rebel Flesh the Doctor learns that the Amy with them is not the real Amy She is a Flesh avatar The real Amy had been kidnapped At the end of The Almost People Rory did not know it was not the real Amy When the Doctor tells him to move away from Amy Rory does not want to but finally trusts the Doctor Rory lets the Doctor destroy the false Amy just as the real Amy begins to give birth to her baby Amy gives birth to their daughter Melody Pond between The Almost People and A Good Man Goes To War The baby is kidnapped and replaced by a Flesh version as Rory and the Doctor fight to get to them Rory shows courage against a group of Cybermen He destroys their fleet with help from the Doctor Rorys memories of being a centurion in the alternate timeline help him to fight the Headless Monks After the battle Rory helps a dying Sontaran nurse In his final words the Sonaran speaks of Rory and himself both being a warrior and a nurse At the end of the episode River Song appears and it is learned that she is the daughter of Amy and Rory In the alien language of the people who raised her there are no words for Melody or Pond The closest translation of Melody and Pond is River and Song In Lets Kill Hitler it is learned that Rory and Amy named their daughter Melody after their childhood friend Mels Rory and Amy later learn that Mels is also Melody They also see her regenerate into River Song 

As they travel Rory sees that it can be dangerous to be on the TARDIS He gets to the point in his travels that he tells the Doctor he does not want to travel any more if they are going to always be as risk 

In The God Complex Rory is the only person on the TARDIS is not hunted by the creature that feeds on faith The Doctor thinks this is because Rory has no faith of his own Rory also says that after traveling in the TARDIS there was very few things he was afraid of any more The Doctor sees the danger he is putting his friends in He takes Amy and Rory back to Earth and gives them a house and a car as a gift

When River creates an alternate reality by not killing the Doctor at Lake Silencio Rory is now Captain Williams He is a soldier working for Amy Pond They are not a couple in this version of history but Rory is still in love with Amy He almost dies fighting the Silence but is saved by Amy The two are at Rivers marriage to the Doctor In the now fixed timeline Rory and Amy are still married and Amy has become a modelspokeswoman for a line of perfume They are visited by their daughter River who tells them that the Doctor is still alive

The fact that Rory dies often has been criticized Digital Spy reviewer Morgan Jeffery wrote One of the key elements in Doctor Who is obviously the sense of danger and the lingering presence of death but Rorys repeated demises and resurrections are now becoming so frequent that comparisons to South Parks Kenny seem almost inevitable SFX gave Rory the third spot in the top 10 resurrections of science fiction TV It said its becoming a clich But its not one we mind too much mainly because its always done with such gusto Except perhaps in the pirates episode which was a fairly gusto free zone all round

However critics have liked that Rory has had many times to be heroic in series 6 After A Good Man Goes to War as broadcast io9s Charlie Jane Anders compared the character to Wesley Wyndam Pryce That characters story in American television programmes Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel showed him changing from comic relief to a warrior Anders said Yes were thrilled that Rory is getting his Wesley Wyndam Pryce on Badass Rory is as we already observed totally badass But this episode exemplified the recent trend towards Amy being reduced to a bystander victim or worse Rorys change into a heroic character has also led to a series of Rory Williams Facts in the style of the popular Chuck Norris Facts internet meme

A rhythmite consists of layers of sediment or sedimentary rock which are laid down in a repeated pattern

These patterns may be made by annual processes or by longer term processes such as periodic floods Patterns caused by annual changes are called varves

Rhythmites can show long term prehistoric events such as sea level changes glaciation changes earths orbital variations and other causes of climate change

Many rock formations show repeating patterns of strata For example clay layers may alternate with sandstone layers or carbonate layers alternate with shales This is usually caused by repeating cycles of climate In warmer times the sea rises and carbonate rocks are deposited in shallow subtropical seas Later ice builds up at the poles and the sea level drops Then the same area is close to shore and gets sand and mud washed down by rivers 

Deposits on land show patterns for similar reasons A low lying area will be a lake or a swamp during hot wet periods and maybe a desert or a mud flat during dry periods Erosion takes place during the dry periods and deposition takes place during the wet periods 

However temperature and sea level changes are not the only causes of rhythmites In volcanic areas a pattern of deposition in lakes may be regularly interrupted by eruptions of volcanic ash so that in the record of the rocks shales and mudstone alternates with tuff

A sundown town is a town that is or was purposely all white The term is widely used in the United States in areas from Ohio to Oregon and well into the South The term came from signs that were allegedly posted stating that people of color had to leave the town by sundown The minority people could not visit after sunset or spend the night in the town Such towns are also sometimes called sunset towns or gray towns

Some towns placed signs at the towns borders with statements similar to the one posted in Hawthorne California which read Nigger Dont Let The Sun Set On YOU In Hawthorne in the 1930s

In some cases keeping minorities out was official town policy through restrictive covenants written in land deeds or by agreement between the real estate agents of the community In others the policy was enforced through intimidation For example law enforcement officers could stop all minorities found after sunset

Though no one knows the number of sundown towns in the United States the largest estimate was that the nation had several thousand The highest proportion of confirmed sundown towns are in the state of Illinois It is difficult to confirm sunset towns because the towns did not keep or do not want to show official documents stating their status as sundown towns For example One Hundred Years of Progress The Centennial History of Anna Illinois although more than 400 pages long never mentions Annas 1909 expulsion of African Americans the sundown signs at the northern and southern city limits in 1954 or anything else about race 

Since the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s and especially since the Civil Rights Act of 1968 prohibited racial discrimination concerning the sale rental and financing of housing the number of sundown towns has decreased However as sociologist James Loewen writes in his book on the subject it is impossible to precisely count the number of sundown towns at any given time because most towns have not kept records of the ordinances or signs that marked the towns sundown status His book Sundown Towns A Hidden Dimension of American Racism notes that hundreds of cities across America have been sundown towns at some point in their history

Loewens book mentions that sundown status meant more than just African Americans not being able to live in these towns Essentially any African Americans who came into sundown towns after sundown were subject to harassment threats and violent actsup to and including lynching

In addition to the expulsion of African Americans from some small towns Chinese Americans and other minorities were also driven out of some of the towns where they lived Loewen says one example is that in 1870 Chinese made up one third of the population of Idaho Following a wave of violence and an 1886 anti Chinese convention in Boise almost none remained by 1910 The town of Gardnerville Nevada is said to have blown a whistle at 6 pm daily alerting Native Americans to leave by sundown In addition Jews were excluded from living in some sundown towns such as Darien Connecticut

James Loewens book Sundown Towns describes sundown towns Several other books also show the existence of sundown towns Sundown towns are mentioned in Following the Color Line by Ray Stannard Baker Free But Not Equal by V Jacque Voegeli Black Ohio and the Color Line by David Gerber The Negro in Indiana by Emma Thornbrough Mobile Americans Residential and Social Mobility in Omaha by Howard Chudacoff Race and Kinship in a Midwestern Town by James DeVries The Sociogenesis of a Race Riot by Roberta Senechal Visual treatments include Robby Heason Trouble Behind and Marco Williams Banished

Justus Liebig was a German chemist who made major contributions to agricultural and biological chemistry and worked on the organization of organic chemistry 

Liebig was one of the greatest chemistry teachers of all time At 21 he was appointed professor of chemistry at Giessen recommended by Alexander von Humboldt There he established the worlds first major school of chemistry He invented the chemical laboratory and used it for teaching He founded and edited the Annalen der Chemie the leading German language journal of chemistry

Liebig invented new methods for the analysis of organic materials He showed that to grow plants need carbon dioxide minerals and nitrogen compounds He discovered that nitrogen was an essential plant nutrient and invented the first nitrogen based fertiliser His Law of the Minimum stated that a plants development is limited by the one essential mineral that is in the shortest supply He described the effect of individual nutrients on crops 

Where others thought that organic chemicals were entirely separate fron inorganic ones Liebig thought diffferently

In 1835 he invented a process of silvering that greatly improved the quality of mirrors

Liebig also developed a manufacturing process for beef extracts and founded a company Liebig Extract of Meat Company that later trademarked the Oxo brand beef cube

Liebigs work was closely followed in Britain and he was awarded the Royal Societys Copley Medal in 1840 His own country made him a Baron in 1845

A microbial cyst is a resting or dormant stage of a microorganism usually a bacterium or a protist or rarely an invertebrate animal that helps the organism to survive in unfavorable environmental conditions It can be thought of as a state of suspended animation in which the metabolic processes of the cell are slowed down and the cell ceases all activities like feeding and locomotion Encystment also helps the microbe to spread easily from one host to another or to a better environment When the encysted microbe reaches an environment good for its growth and survival the cyst wall breaks down by a process known as excystation

Unfavorable environmental conditions trigger the making of a cyst These include the lack of nutrients or oxygen extreme temperatures lack of moisture and presence of toxic chemicals which are not good for the growth of the microbe 

Different organisms have cyst walls made of different things The cyst walls of bacteria are formed by the thickening of the normal cell wall with added peptidoglycan layers The walls of protozoan cysts are made of chitin a type of glycoprotein Nematode cyst walls are made of chitin reinforced by collagen

The Pentium F00F bug is a hardware bug found in most original Pentium computer processors The bug allows a malicious program to crash the computer by running the instructions F00FC7C8 In assembly language this represents lock cmpxchg8b eax If the system has crashed because of this bug the only way to fix it is to reboot the computer usually by unplugging it and plugging it back in It does no permanent damage to the computer but it may cause data loss The bug was discovered in November 1997 Many operating systems made since 1997 have protection against this bug

A locker is a small compartment that is used to store things such as books coats etc They are commonly found in schools They are usually locked with a padlock or a built in lock Usually there is an array of lockers Each user has hisher own key and can not open other peoples lockers There is sometimes a master key used only by the building owner which can open all of the lockers

Master keying is the process of setting up a series of locks that can be each opened with their own key that only opens that particular lock but also having a master key that can open all of the locks in the set For example in an office building each employee would have a key that only opens hisher office and the manager or owner would have a key that opens all of the offices in that building More complicated setups are also possible For example if there are janitors in the office building and each janitor only cleans a particular floor the janitor for a particular floor could have a sub master key that opens only the offices on that floor while each employee still has a key that opens only hisher office and the manager still has a key that opens all of the doors The exterior doors might also be configured so that they can be opened by any employee key janitor key or the managers master key The more complicated the setup the more important it is to use locks that have a large number of key possibilities Disc detainer locks are especially suitable for master keying due to their large number of key possibilities

A patent attorney is an attorney who has the specialized skills and training necessary for representing clients in obtaining patents and acting in all matters and procedures relating to patent law and practice For example the patent attorney can not only file an application for a new patent but he can also try to stop the patent office from giving the patent to somebody else The term is used differently in different countries and thus may or may not require the same legal qualifications as a general legal practitioner

The titles patent agent and patent lawyer are also used in some jurisdictions In some jurisdictions the terms are interchangeable In other countries a patent lawyer must also be qualified as a lawyer

Each patent office regulates the people who make filings Patent attorneys can do this but the patent office will not accept filings from other attorneys Each patent office has its own rules about what a person has to do to become a patent attorney

In Europe requirements for practicing as patent attorney before national patent offices differ from those needed for practicing before the European Patent Office On the national level the requirements are not harmonized across the European Union except that the EU makes sure that respective professional qualifications are mutually recognized to some degree In the United States the patent attorney must pass a special examination to test his knowledge of patent office procedures Some countries allow lawyers who are not citizens to practice Some countries will allow lawyers from a second country to make filings if the second country will do the same for lawyers from that first country Many times a patent attorney from a foreign country will work with a local attorney to make sure that the patent application for that country is filed correctly and quickly

Surface tension is a property of the surface of a liquid that allows it to resist an external force It is revealed for example in floating of some objects on the surface of water even though they are denser than water and in the ability of some insects to run on the water surface This property is caused by cohesion of similar molecules and is responsible for many of the behaviors of liquids

Surface tension has the dimension of force per unit length or of energy per unit area The two are equivalentbut when referring to energy per unit of area people use the term surface energywhich is a more general term in the sense that it applies also to solids and not just liquids

In materials science surface tension is used for either surface stress or surface free energy

The cohesive forces among the liquid molecules cause surface tension In the bulk of the liquid each molecule is pulled equally in every direction by neighboring liquid molecules resulting in a net force of zero The molecules at the surface do not have other molecules on all sides of them and therefore are pulled inwards This creates some internal pressure and forces liquid surfaces to contract to the minimal area

Surface tension is responsible for the shape of liquid droplets Although easily deformed droplets of water tend to be pulled into a spherical shape by the cohesive forces of the surface layer In the absence of other forces including gravity drops of virtually all liquids would be perfectly spherical The spherical shape minimizes the necessary wall tension of the surface layer according to Laplaces law

Another way to view it is in terms of energy A molecule in contact with a neighbor is in a lower state of energy than if it were alone The interior molecules have as many neighbors as they can possibly have but the boundary molecules are missing neighbors So the boundary molecules have a higher energy For the liquid to minimize its energy state the number of higher energy boundary molecules must be minimized The minimized quantity of boundary molecules results in a minimized surface area

As a result of surface area minimization a surface will assume the smoothest shape it can Any curvature in the surface shape results in greater area and a higher energy So the surface will push back against any curvature in much the same way as a ball pushed uphill will push back to minimize its gravitational potential energy

Studying water shows several effects of surface tension

A Rain water forms beads on the surface of a waxy surface such as a leaf Water adheres weakly to wax and strongly to itself so water clusters into drops Surface tension gives them their near spherical shape because a sphere has the smallest possible surface area to volume ratio

B Formation of drops occurs when a mass of liquid is stretched The animation shows water adhering to the faucet gaining mass until it is stretched to a point where the surface tension can no longer bind it to the faucet It then separates and surface tension forms the drop into a sphere If a stream of water were running from the faucet the stream would break up into drops during its fall Gravity stretches the stream then surface tension pinches it into spheres

C Objects denser than water still float when the object is nonwettable and its weight is small enough to be borne by the forces arising from surface tension For example water striders use surface tension to walk on the surface of a pond The surface of the water behaves like an elastic film the insects feet cause indentations in the waters surface increasing its surface area

D Separation of oil and water is caused by a tension in the surface between dissimilar liquids This type of surface tension is called interface tension but its physics are the same

E Tears of wine is the formation of drops and rivulets on the side of a glass containing an alcoholic beverage Its cause is a complex interaction between the differing surface tensions of water and ethanol It is induced by a combination of surface tension modification of water by ethanol together with ethanol evaporating faster than water

Surface tension is visible in other common phenomena especially when surfactants are used to decrease it

Pouring mercury onto a horizontal flat sheet of glass results in a puddle that has a perceptible thickness The puddle will spread out only to the point where it is a little under half a centimeter thick and no thinner Again this is due to the action of mercurys strong surface tension The liquid mass flattens out because that brings as much of the mercury to as low a level as possible but the surface tension at the same time is acting to reduce the total surface area The result is the compromise of a puddle of a nearly fixed thickness

The same surface tension demonstration can be done with water lime water or even saline but only if the liquid does not adhere to the flat surface material Wax is such a substance Water poured onto a smooth flat horizontal wax surface say a waxed sheet of glass will behave similarly to the mercury poured onto glass

where

For mercury on glass Hg 487 dyncm Hg 135 gcm3 and  140 which gives hHg 036 cm For water on paraffin at 25 C  72 dyncm  10 gcm3 and  107 which gives hH2O 044 cm

The formula also predicts that when the contact angle is 0 the liquid will spread out into a micro thin layer over the surface Such a surface is said to be fully wettable by the liquidclearright

In day to day life we all observe that a stream of water emerging from a faucet will break up into droplets no matter how smoothly the stream is emitted from the faucet This is due to a phenomenon called the PlateauRayleigh instability which is entirely a consequence of the effects of surface tension

The explanation of this instability begins with the existence of tiny perturbations in the stream These are always present no matter how smooth the stream is If the perturbations are resolved into sinusoidal components we find that some components grow with time while others decay with time Among those that grow with time some grow at faster rates than others Whether a component decays or grows and how fast it grows is entirely a function of its wave number and the radii of the original cylindrical stream

Atmospheric chemistry is a branch of atmospheric science in which the chemistry of the Earths atmosphere and that of other planets is studied It is a multidisciplinary field of research and draws on environmental chemistry physics meteorology computer modeling oceanography geology and volcanology and other disciplines Research is increasingly connected with other areas of study such as climatology

Studying the composition and chemistry of the atmosphere is important for several reasons It includes studying the interactions between the atmosphere and living organisms The composition of the Earths atmosphere changes as result of natural processes such as volcano emissions lightning and bombardment by solar particles from corona It has also been changed by human activity Some of these changes are harmful to human health crops and ecosystems Examples of problems which have been addressed by atmospheric chemistry include acid rain ozone depletion photochemical smog greenhouse gases and global warming Atmospheric chemists study the causes of these problems Atmospheric chemists offer theories about these problems then test the theories and possible solutions Atmospheric chemists also evaluate the effects of changes in government policy

Notes the concentration of CO2 and CH4 vary by season and location The mean molecular mass of air is 2897 gmol

The ancient Greeks regarded air as one of the four elements but the first scientific studies of atmospheric composition began in the 18th century Chemists such as Joseph Priestley Antoine Lavoisier and Henry Cavendish made the first measurements of the composition of the atmosphere 

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries interest shifted towards trace constituents with very small concentrations One particularly important discovery for atmospheric chemistry was the discovery of ozone by Christian Friedrich Schnbein in 1840

In the 20th century atmospheric science moved from studying the composition of air to a consideration of how the concentrations of trace gases in the atmosphere have changed over time and the chemical processes which create and destroy compounds in the air Two particularly important examples of this were the explanation by Sydney Chapman and Gordon Dobson of how the ozone layer is created and maintained and the explanation of photochemical smog by Arie Jan Haagen Smit Further studies on ozone issues led to the 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry award shared between Paul Crutzen Mario Molina and Frank Sherwood Rowland

In the 21st century the focus is now shifting again Atmospheric chemistry is increasingly studied as one part of the Earth system Before scientists focused on atmospheric chemistry in isolation Now scientists study atmospheric chemistry as one part of a single system with the rest of the atmosphere biosphere and geosphere A reason for this is the links between chemistry and climate For example changing climate and the recovery of the ozone hole affect each other Also the composition of the atmosphere interact with the oceans and terrestrial ecosystems

Observations lab measurements and modeling are the three central elements in atmospheric chemistry All three methods are used together For example observations may tell that more of a chemical compound exists than previously thought possible This will stimulate new modelling and laboratory studies which will increase scientific understanding to a point where the observations can be explained 

Observations of atmospheric chemistry are important Scientist record data about the chemical composition of air over time to watch for any changes One important example of this is the Keeling Curve  a series of measurements from 1958 to today which show a steady rise in of the concentration of carbon dioxide Observations of atmospheric chemistry are made in observatories such as that on Mauna Loa and on mobile platforms such as aircraft ships and balloons Observations of atmospheric composition are increasingly made by satellites giving a global picture of air pollution and chemistry Surface observations have the advantage that they provide long term records at high time resolution but provide data from a limited vertical and horizontal space Some surface based instruments such as LIDAR can provide concentration profiles of chemical compounds and aerosol but are still restricted in the horizontal region they cover Many observations are shared on line in Atmospheric chemistry observational databases

Measurements made in the laboratory are essential to our understanding of the sources and sinks of pollutants and compounds found in nature Lab studies tell which gases react with each other and how fast they react Scientists measure reactions in the gas phase on surfaces and in water Scientists also study photochemistry which quantifies how quickly molecules are split apart by sunlight and what the products are Scientists also study thermodynamic data such as Henrys law coefficients

 Modeling  Scientists use computer models to synthesize and test theoretical understanding of atmospheric chemistry Numerical models solve the differential equations governing the concentrations of chemicals in the atmosphere The models can be very simple or very complicated Model designers must trade off between the number of chemical compounds and chemical reactions modelled versus the representation of transport and mixing in the atmosphere For example a box model might include hundreds or even thousands of chemical reactions but will only have a very crude representation of mixing in the atmosphere In contrast 3D models represent many of the physical processes of the atmosphere but due to constraints on computer resources will have far fewer chemical reactions and compounds Models can be used to interpret observations test understanding of chemical reactions and predict future concentrations of chemical compounds in the atmosphere Atmospheric chemistry modules are used as one part of larger earth system models in which the links between climate atmospheric composition and the biosphere can be studied 

Sometimes model builders use automatic code generators to help write the equations used in computer programs In this approach the scientist choses a set of chemical compounds and the automatic code generator will then select the reactions involving those constituents from a set of reaction databases Once the reactions have been chosen the computer builds the ordinary differential equations that describe their time evolution

Alfred Henry Maurer was an American modernist painter He exhibited his work in avant garde circles during the early 20th century

Maurer was born in New York City the son of a German lithographer At age sixteen Maurer quit school to work at his fathers lithographic firm In 1897 Maurer left for Paris where he stayed the next four years joining a circle of American and French artists At the time Maurers style was realist 

Briefly returning to New York he was determined to show his skeptical father that he could paint Maurer painted what arguably is his most famous painting An Arrangement using a woman next door as a model and completing the work in a matter of hours The painting received first prize at the 1901 Carnegie International Exhibition Other awards received by Maurer included the Inness Jr prize of the Salmagundi Club in 1900 and a bronze medal at the Pan American Exposition at Buffalo New York in 1901 In 1905 he won the third medal at the Lige International Exposition and a gold medal at the International Exposition in Munich 

At age thirty six in Paris Maurer changed his methods sharply From that point on he painted only in the cubist and fauvist manner By 1909 he was an important American avant garde painter He had a two man exhibition with John Marin in New York City at the 291 Gallery Four of his paintings were included in the Armory Show of 1913

Leaving Paris shortly before World War I he returned to his fathers house but was denied support For the next 17 years Maurer painted in a garret in his fathers house and gained no critical acclaim However he took part in exhibitions at the Anderson Galleries and others He exhibited regularly at the New York Society of Independent Artists and was elected their director in 1919 In 1924 the New York dealer Erhard Weyhe bought the contents of Maurers studio and represented the artist for the remainder of his career

Manierre Dawson was an avant garde painter and sculptor He was born and raised in Chicago but lived most of his life in Michigan 

The case of Manierre Dawson is very interesting During a tour of Europe in 1910 he started painting true abstract works Back in America he became convinced that he could not earn a living at art and became a farmer He was forgotten until a rediscovery in 1963 He may have been the first person to paint a completely abstract work He was probably the earliest American abstract artist slightly ahead of Arthur Dove 

After working for a year with a firm of architects he was granted a six month leave of absence for an educational tour of Europe He departed in mid June 1910 for his only trip abroad He made his way across England to France south through Germany across Switzerland to Italy back north for a second stay in Paris and around northern Germany before embarking from Bremerhaven in late November In Sienna he met and exchanged ideas on painting with John Singer Sargent During his return visit to Paris he attended a Saturday evening soire at the apartment of Gertrude Stein and he saw paintings by Paul Czanne in the gallery of Ambrose Vollard

1911 through 1914 were the most productive years of his career In 1914 Dawson participated in two group exhibitions Summers spent at the familys retreat in Mason Country Michigan were his most productive periods during his early career and provided rudimentary knowledge of growing and marketing fruit He met Lilian Boucher the daughter of a local farmer and fell in love They married in July 1915 and three children were born over the next five years

Living in rural Michigan and struggling financially he made art from what was available Sheets of composite wood were laminated together for thickness and carved into freestanding sculptures 

The first real recognition of his work began in 1966 with a retrospective exhibition mounted by the Grand Rapids Art Museum An exhibition organized by the John and Mable Ringing Museum in Sarasota and shared with the Norton Gallery in West Palm Springs followed a year later This exhibition brought Dawson to the attention of Robert Schoelkopf who showed his work in New York in April 1969 and March 1981  When Dawson was diagnosed with cancer in 1968 he sold the Michigan farm and moved to Sarasota permanently He died on August 15 1969

Infinitesimals are objects too small to measure 

Newton and Leibniz developed the calculus based on an intuitive notion of an infinitesimal In 1870 Karl Weierstrass provided the first rigorous treatment of the calculus using the limit method But in 1960 Abraham Robinson found that infinitesimals also provide a rigorous basis for the calculus Many calculus courses still begin with the difficult limit concept but others now adopt the easier to understand infinitesimal concept

In differential calculus in both the limit and infinitesimal versions the velocity of a particle is represented by dsdt where s is the position of the particle and t the time at which the velocity is measured In infinitesimal calculus ds and dt are simply very small quantities

Assume that s t2 therefore at time t dt s ds 2 From these equations we can determnine ds in terms of dt using simple algebra and moderate rigour as follows

and

Because dt is infinitesimal you can just ignore it so the instantanous velocity is v 2t You get the same result using the limit version with greater rigour The infinitesimal derivation can also be made more rigorous

A National Historic Landmark is a building site structure object or district with historical importance The United States government marks them as NHLs only if they have high historical significance Out of more than 80000 places on the National Register of Historic Places only about 2430 are NHLs

A National Historic Landmark District is a historic district that is recognized as an NHL It may include contributing properties that have buildings structures sites or objects and it may include non contributing properties

On October 9 1960 Secretary of the Interior Fred Andrew Seaton announced 92 properties as NHLs The first of these was a political nomination Sergeant Floyd Grave and Monument in Sioux City Iowa as officially designated on June 30 of that year but for various reasons the public announcement of the first several NHLs was delayed

NHLs are designated by the United States Secretary of the Interior because they are

Of the 2442 or so current NHLs 3 states Pennsylvania Massachusetts and New York account for nearly 25 percent of the nations NHLs In addition to these states cities within these states Boston Philadelphia and New York City alone have more NHLs than 40 out of the 50 states There are NHLs in all 50 states There are 74 in the District of Columbia 15 in Puerto Rico and other US commonwealths and territories five in US associated states such as Micronesia and one in Morocco

There are 128 ships or shipwrecks that are NHLs

About half of the National Historic Landmarks are privately owned The National Historic Landmarks Program relies on suggestions for new designations from the National Park Service which also assists in maintaining the landmarks The National Historic Landmark Stewards Association is a friends group of owners and managers who works to preserve protect and promote National Historic Landmarks

If not already listed on the National Register of Historic Places an NHL is automatically added to the Register upon designation About three percent of Register listings are NHLs

In the CGS system there are several different sets of electromagnetism units of which the main ones are ESU Gaussian and EMU Among these there are two alternative units of magnetic dipole moment in CGS

and

The ratio of these two non equivalent CGS units is equal exactly to the speed of light in free space expressed in cms

All formulas in this article are correct in SI units but in other unit systems the formulas may need to be changed For example in SI units a loop of current with current I and area A has magnetic moment IA but in Gaussian units the magnetic moment is IAc

The Rockefeller family is the Cleveland family of John D Rockefeller and his brother William Rockefeller It is an American industrial banking and political family that originally came from Germany It made one of the worlds largest private fortunes in the oil business during the late 19th and early 20th century This was mainly through the Standard Oil Company

The family is also known for its long association with and financial interest in the Chase Manhattan Bank now JP Morgan Chase People see them as one the most powerful groups inside the United States and are well connected to the banking industry Their ancestor Johann Peter Rockefeller moved to North America in 1723 from what is today Westerwald Rhineland Palatinate Germany

The family was heavily involved in many real estate construction projects in the US during the 20th century Chief among them

Beginning with Rockefeller Senior the family has been a major force in land conservation Over the generations it has created more than 20 national parks and open spaces including the Cloisters Acadia National Park Forest Hill Park the Nature Conservancy the Rockefeller Forest in Californias Humboldt Redwoods State Park and Grand Teton National Park among many others Rockefeller Jr and his son Laurance were particularly prominent in this area 

The National Audubon Society honored the family for its conservation efforts in November 2005 Over 30 family members attended the event At the event the societys president John Flicker said Cumulatively no other family in America has made the contribution to conservation that the Rockefeller family has made

The family has been awarded the annual UNA USAs Global Leadership Award along with other recipients over time including Bill Clinton and Michael Bloomberg Members of the Rockefeller family into the fourth generation have been heavily involved in international politics and have donated money established or been involved in the following major international institutions

The Rockefeller Archive Center an independent foundation that was until 2008 a part of Rockefeller University is a vast three story underground bunker built below the Martha Baird Rockefeller Hillcrest mansion on the family estate at Pocantico Along forty foot long walls of shelves on rails maintained by ten full time archivists is the entire repository of personal and official papers and correspondence of the complete family and its members along with historical papers of its numerous foundations as well as other non family philanthropic institutions These include the Commonwealth Fund Charles E Culpeper Foundation Lucille P Markey Charitable Trust and the John and Mary R Markle Foundation

In total it holds over 70 million pages of documents and contains the collections of forty two scientific cultural educational and philanthropic organizations

Only the expurgated records of deceased family members are publicly available to scholars and researchers All records pertaining to living members are closed to historians However as Nelson Rockefellers researcher Cary Reich discovered in the case of Nelsons voluminous convert3247cuftm3 of papers only about one third of these files had been processed and released to researchers up to 1996 He reports that it will be many years before all the papers will be open to the public despite Nelson having died in 1979

The Center maintains that this repository of records covering 140 plus years of the records of the family in addition to non Rockefeller philanthropic collections gives unique insights into United States and world issues and social developments in both the 19th and 20th centuries

Records in the collection are only available up until the early 1960s generally 1961

The combined wealth of the family their total assets and investments plus the individual wealth of its members has never been known with any precision The records of the family archives relating to both the family and individual members net worth is closed to researchers

From the outset and even today the family wealth has been under the complete control of the male members of the family through the family office Despite strong willed wives who had influence over their husbands decisions such as the pivotal female figure Abby Aldrich Rockefeller wife of Junior in all cases they received allowances only and were never given even partial responsibility for the family fortune

Much of the wealth has been locked up in the notable family trust of 1934 and the trust of 1952 both administered by the Chase Manhattan Bank These trusts have consisted of shares in the successor companies to Standard Oil and other diversified investments as well as the familys considerable real estate holdings They are administered by a trust committee that oversees the fortune It has consisted over time of high profile individuals who have included Paul Volcker William G Bowen and John C Whitehead

Management of this fortune today also rests with professional money managers who oversee the principal holding company Rockefeller Financial Services It controls all the familys investments The family sold Rockefeller Center in 1989 and the money made from selling it has been reinvested The present chairman is David Rockefeller Jr

In 1992 it had five main arms

Over the generations the family members have resided in some notable historic homes A total of 81 Rockefeller homes are on the National Register of Historic Places Not including all homes owned by the five brothers some of the more prominent of these are

A trademark of the dynasty over its 140 plus years has been the remarkable unity it has maintained despite major divisions that developed in the late 1970s and unlike other wealthy families such as the DuPonts and the Mellons A primary reason has been the lifelong efforts of Junior to not only cleanse the name from the opprobrium stemming from the ruthless practices of Standard Oil but his tireless efforts to forge family unity even as he allowed his five sons to operate independently This was partly achieved by regular brothers and family meetings but it was also because of the high value placed on family unity by first Nelson and John 3rd and later especially with David

Regarding achievements in 1972 on the 100th anniversary of the founding of Andrew Carnegies philanthropy the Carnegie Corporation which has had a long association with the family and its institutions released a public statement on the influence of the family on not just philanthropy but encompassing a much wider field Summing up a predominant view amongst the international philanthropic world albeit one poorly grasped by the public one sentence of this statement read The contributions of the Rockefeller family are staggering in their extraordinary range and in the scope of their contribution to humankind

John D Rockefeller gave away US540 million over his lifetime and became the greatest lay benefactor of medicine in history His son Junior also gave away over 537 million over his lifetime bringing the total philanthropy of just two generations of the family to over 1 billion from 1860 to 1960 Added to this the New York Times declared in a report in November 2006 that David Rockefellers total charitable benefactions amount to about 900 million over his lifetime

The combined personal and social connections of the various family members are very great both in America and throughout the world The family members know the most powerful politicians royalty public figures and chief businessmen Notable figures through Standard Oil alone have included Henry Flagler and Henry H Rogers Contemporary figures include Henry Kissinger Nelson Mandela Richard Parsons C Fred Bergsten Peter G Peterson and Paul Volcker

In 1991 the family was presented with the Honor Award from the National Building Museum for four generations worth of preserving and creating some of the USs most important buildings and places David accepted the award on the familys behalf The ceremony coincided with an exhibition on the familys contributions to the built environment including John Srs preservation efforts for the Hudson River Palisades the restoration of Williamsburg Virginia construction of Rockefeller Center and Governor Nelsons efforts to construct low and middle income housing in New York state

The Rockefeller name is imprinted on numerous places throughout the United States most notably in New York City but also in Cleveland where the family originates

John D Junior through his son Nelson purchased and then donated the land upon which sits the UN headquarters in New York in 1946 Earlier in the 1920s he had also donated a substantial amount towards the restoration and rehabilitation of major buildings in France after World War I such as the Rheims Cathedral the Fontainebleau Palace and the Palace of Versailles for which he was later awarded Frances highest decoration the Grand Croix of the Legion dHonneur

He also funded the notable excavations at Luxor in Egypt as well as establishing a Classical Studies School in Athens In addition he provided the funding for the construction of the Palestine Archaeological Museum in East Jerusalem  the Rockefeller Museum

The family with its far reaching philanthropy as well as its oil real estate banking and international institutions remains a benchmark for extreme wealth as Senior is still regarded as the wealthiest man who has ever lived worth over 300 billion in todays figures easily surpassing Bill Gates in terms adjusted by inflation indexing

The members of the Rockefeller family are noted for their philanthropy a Rockefeller Archive Center study in 2004 documents an incomplete list of 72 major institutions that the family has created andor endowed up to the present day Historically the major focus of their benefactions have been in the educational health and conservation areas

Family leaders in both philanthropy and business have included John D Sr John D Jr John D III Laurance Rockefeller and David Rockefeller who is the familys current patriarch Several family members have held high public office including Vice President of the United States United States Senator state governor and lieutenant governor Another noted family member was Michael Rockefeller son of Nelson Rockefeller an anthropologist who came to media attention after he was presumed killed in New Guinea in 1961

The corporate financial and personal affairs of the family  numbering around 150 blood relatives of John D Rockefeller  are run from the family office Room 5600 known officially as Rockefeller Family and Associates It comprises three floors of the GE Building in Rockefeller Center All private family legal matters are handled by the family associated New York law firm of Milbank Tweed Hadley McCloy Room 5600 is also the base of the current family historian Peter J Johnson who assisted with David Rockefellers Memoirs published in 2002

To distinguish the generations and facilitate communication the fourth generation is generically known as The Cousins and the younger family members are known as the FifthSixth generation Many if not all of these family members are involved in institutionalized philanthropic pursuits Family links are solidified through the practice of ritualized family meetings  which started with the regular brothers meetings held in Room 5600 or in their respective private residences beginning in 1945 Family get togethers are held today at the Playhouse in the Westchester County family estate of Pocantico in June and December of each year

To the sixth generation with 21 still living in the fourth The total number of blood relative descendants as of 2006 is about 150

An article in the New York Times in 1937 stated that William Rockefeller had at that time exactly 28 great grandchildren

Hallucigenia is an extinct genus of animal found as fossils in the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale formation of British Columbia Canada Another species is found in the Lower Cambrian Maotianshan shale of China 

Hallucigenia was thought by Stephen Jay Gould to be unrelated to any living species but most palaeontologists now believe that the species was a velvet worm a relative of modern arthropods

Unlike its contemporary Aysheaia Hallucigenia has very little resemblance to modern Onychophora The elongated and clawed legs bear little resemblance to the paired annulated legs of the Onychophora It is unknown what the spines were made of and how much protection they offered It is not easy to explain why 30 or more specimens each thought to have seven pairs of rather long flexible legs do not show even one example of paired legs But at least this reconstruction of the animal can plausibly walk and the spines serve a reasonable purpose A picture of this reconstruction as well as a photograph of an actual fossil can be seen on the Geological Survey of Canadas website

Teleology is a philosophical idea that things have goals or causes It is the view that developments are due to the purpose or design which is served by them

An example would be Aristotles view of nature later adopted by the Catholic Church The word teleological comes from the Ancient Greek telos which means end or purpose A simpler example would be a tool such as the clock which is designed by man to tell the time

Whether or not an entity is needed to cause teleology to happen is one of the most important questions All cultures we know of have creation stories in their religions However much of science operates on the principle that the natural world is self organising This applies particularly to astronomy and biology which were once explained as the action of a deity and are now seen as natural and automatically self organising Cybernetics is the basic science of self organising systems

The general issue of whether the original sense of teleology applies to the natural world is still a matter of controversy between religion and science

Non sequitur means does not follow It is a type of logical fallacy a bad argument that makes no sense 

A non sequitur argument takes something that people accept is true and says that because this is true the conclusion is right The problem is that the conclusion has nothing to do with the premise

Usually this argument seems convincing on the surface However consider the following example

This is wrong because 1 stupid people can still know things just not have good ideas or use their knowledge well and 2 knowledge is not the only source of power This argument tries use a statement that people agree with as bad support for a new idea that is not the logical conclusion of the statement

Hostility happens when people are not being very nice It is an attitude that a person or group of people has that sets that person or group against something else North Korea is hostile towards the United States This means that North Korea does not like the United States  and shows it

Richard W Lariviere was President of the University of Oregon from 2009 to 2011 He is a Life Member of the Council on Foreign Relations He became president of OU in 2009 Larivieres contract was not renewed in 2011 amid a racketeering scandal in the OU Dean of Students office

All seven public colleges in Oregon are run by a single Oregon state board of higher education Lariviere agreed to work with other public colleges to seek more independence in a plan that resulted in Senate Bill 242 Governor Kitzhaber signed that law on July 20 2011 to give public college more control over how they spend money At the same time OU developed a separate legislative proposal to start a separate 15 person board of trustees for OU and a 800 million state bond issue to match private donations to a new OU endowment fund The governor and state board asked Lariviere to delay pushing for the OU legislation while Senate Bill 242 went through the legislature first Because Lariviere and OU seemed to be working separately from the Governor and state board the board voted to fire him on November 28 2011 He was given 30 days to leave his office The board hired Robert M Berdahl as interim president

The Oxford Movement also known as the Tractarians and by their enemies as Newmanites and Puseyites after John Henry Newman and Edward Bouverie Pusey two important Tractarians was a religious movement based at the University of Oxford which tried to bring back Catholic or Roman thought doctrine and forms of service into the Anglican Church It also believed the Anglican church was apostolic or connected directly to the Church of Saint Peter and the Apostles

After publishing ninety Tracts Newman decided in Tract 90 that the Branch Theory was not enough and converted to Catholicism becoming a Cardinal Enemies of the Movement thought this proved that they were trying to reunify with Rome Others followed Newman to Rome while others such as Pusey and John Keble remained in the Anglican Church to continue reforming

Today it is represented in the Anglo Catholic or High Church part of the Anglican Church the smaller conservative part Recently with the Anglican Church debating if female clergymen should be allowed some Anglo Catholics such as Bishop Burnham Bishop Newton and sixty priests have left the Church and converted to Rome in protest as they do not believe female bishops or female priests should be allowed

Tabuaeran also known as Fanning Island or Fanning Atoll is one of the Line Islands of the central Pacific Ocean and part of Kiribati It is an atoll The maximum elevation is about 3 m above high tide

At some 900 miles distant Tabuaeran is one of the closest landfalls to the Hawaiian Islands and the atoll was possibly used as a stopover by the Polynesians who first settled Hawaiokinai Artifacts have been discovered that indicate possible early settlements by people from Polynesiaprobably the Cook Islands or Tonga 

Historically the first recorded mariner to sight Tahanea atoll was American captain Edmund Fanning of the American ship Betsy on June 11 1798 and was named for him At the time the atoll was uninhabited and like all of the Line Islands has no truly native population After Fanning it was visited by whalers of several nationalities

Prior to 1855 Captain Henry English and 150 laborers from Manihiki settled and began producing coconut oil for export He put the island under British protection when it was visited by WH Morshead in HMS Dido on October 16 1855

On August 18 1856 the United States passed the Guano Islands Act which helped it claim many of the Line Islands

Fanning was formally annexed to Great Britain by Captain William Wiseman of HMS Caroline on March 15 1888 A deep opening was blasted thereafter called the English Channel on the west side of the atoll Tabuaeran hosted a cable station on the Trans Pacific Cable between Canada and Australia a part of the All Red Line beginning in 1902 In September 1914 the Cable Station was shelled by a German cruiser the Nrnberg and was slightly damaged A landing force went ashore to complete the destruction In 1939 the atoll was incorporated into the British colony of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands and later in gained independence becoming part of the Republic of Kiribati

Tabuaeran features in John Updikes short story The Blessed Man of Boston My Grandmothers Thimble and Fanning Island

Tabuaeran has a population of 2500 principally Gilbertese settlers brought from Kiribati by Fanning Island Plantations Ltd to work in the copra industry The capital is Napari in the northwest The former capital is Napia on the western side south of a passage into the lagoon Other villages are Tereitaki in the northwest Aontena a resettlement area just south of Napia and Manuku a resettlement area in the south

Reef fish and shellfish babai coconut pigs chickens and seaweed grown in a lagoon are local foods supplementing a main diet of imported rice and tinned meats

The islands major exports are copra and hand crafts A supply ship from Australia calls two or three times a year

Tabuaeran was a weekly port of call for Norwegian Cruise Line who had ships based in Honolulu Due to federal regulations requiring foreign flagged ships to call in a foreign port the ships cruised to Tabuaeran It was also more cost effective for the cruise line to visit a foreign country than to pay port charges as a consequence of the US Passenger Services Act In 2007 the Norwegian Wind left Norwegians fleet and they introduced three cruise ships specifically to cruise in Hawaiokinai These three ships were all US flagged ships and thus were not required to visit foreign ports The Pride of Hawaiokinai and Pride of America sailed 7 day sailings and the Pride of Aloha took over the 10 and 11 day sailings which included Tabuaeran In the fall of 2007 Norwegian announced that the Pride of Hawaiokinai would be reflagged and renamed the Norwegian Jade and sail in Europe With this change Norwegian announced that the Pride of Aloha and the Pride of America would both sail 7 day cruises in Hawaiokinai NCL stopped cruises to Tabuaeran In the late spring of 2009 NCL decided to only have the Pride of America in Hawaii and the Pride of Aloha was relocated Fanning has been suffering since NCL ships stopped regular visits Starting in January 2010 Holland America has made some cruise ship visits to Fanning Such visits will allow the island to regain some income

Management accounting or managerial accounting gives accounting information to managers within organizations to provide them with the basis to make informed business decisions that will allow them to be better equipped in their management and control functions

In contrast to financial accountancy information management accounting information is

The Institute of Management Accountants recently updated its definition as follows management accounting is a profession that involves partnering in management decision making devising planning and performance management systemsand providing expertise in financial reporting and control to assist management in the formulation and implementation of an organizations strategy

The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants states that management accounting as practice extends to the following three areas

The Institute of Certified Management Accountants states A management accountant applies his or her professional knowledge and skill in the preparation and presentation of financial and other decision oriented information in such a way as to assist management in the formulation of policies and in the planning and control of the operation of the undertaking Management Accountants therefore are seen as the value creators amongst the accountants They are much more interested in forward looking and taking decisions that will affect the future of the organization than in the historical recording and compliance aspects of the profession Management accounting knowledge and experience can therefore be obtained from varied fields and functions within an organization such as information management treasury efficiency auditing marketing valuation pricing logistics etc

The distinction between traditional and innovative accounting practices is perhaps best illustrated with the visual timeline of managerial costing approaches presented at the Institute of Management Accountants 2011 Annual Conference

Traditional Standard Costing used in Cost Accounting dates back to the 1920s and is a central method in management accounting practiced today because it is used for financial statement reporting for the valuation of Income Statement and Balance Sheet line items such as Cost of Goods Sold and Inventory valuation Traditional Standard Costing must comply with generally accepted accounting principles and actually aligns itself more with answering Financial Accounting requirements rather than providing solutions for management accountants Traditional approaches limit themselves by defining cost behavior only in terms of production or sales volume

In the late 1980s accounting practitioners and educators were heavily criticized on the grounds that management accounting practices had changed little over the preceding 60 years despite radical changes in the business environment In 1993 the Accounting Education Change Commission Statement Number 4 calls for faculty members to come down from their ivory towers and expand their knowledge about the actual practice of accounting in the workplace Professional accounting institutes perhaps fearing that management accountants would increasingly be seen as superfluous in business organizations subsequently devoted considerable resources to the development of a more innovative skills set for management accountants

Variance analysis which is a systematic approach to the comparison of the actual and budgeted costs of the raw materials and labor used during a production period While some form of variance analysis is still used by most manufacturing firms it nowadays tends to be used in conjunction with innovative techniques such as life cycle cost analysis and activity based costing which are designed with specific aspects of the modern business environment in mind Life cycle costing recognizes that managers ability to influence the cost of manufacturing a product is at its greatest when the product is still at the design stage of its product life cycle since small changes to the product design may lead to significant savings in the cost of manufacturing the products 

Activity based costing recognizes that in modern factories most manufacturing costs are determined by the amount of activities The key to effective cost control is therefore optimizing the efficiency of these activities Both lifecycle costing and activity based costing recognize that in the typical modern factory the avoidance of disruptive events is of far greater importance than reducing the costs of raw materials Activity based costing also focuses less on direct labor as a cost driver and looks instead on activities that drive costs As the provision of a service or the production of a product component

One of the more innovative accounting practices available today is Resource consumption accounting RCA has been recognized by the International Federation of Accountants as a sophisticated approach at the upper levels of the continuum of costing techniques because it provides the ability to derive costs directly from operational resource data or to isolate and measure unused capacity costs RCA started by taking the best costing characteristics of the German management accounting approach Grenzplankostenrechnung and combining the use of activity based drivers when needed such as those used in Activity based costing With the RCA approach resources and their costs are considered as foundational to robust cost modeling and managerial decision support because an organizations costs and revenues are all a function of the resources and the individual capacities that produce them

Management accountants have a dual reporting relationship Management accountants are a strategic partner and provider of decision based financial and operational information Management accountants are responsible for managing the business team and at the same time having to report relationships and responsibilities to the corporations finance organization

The activities management accountants provide inclusive of forecasting and planning performing variance analysis reviewing and monitoring costs inherent in the business are ones that have dual accountability to both finance and the business team Examples of tasks where accountability may be more meaningful to the business management team vs the corporate finance department are the development of new product costing operations research business driver metrics sales management scorecarding and client profitability analysis See Financial modeling Conversely the preparation of certain financial reports reconciliations of the financial data to source systems risk and regulatory reporting will be more useful to the corporate finance team as they are charged with aggregating certain financial information from all segments of the corporation

Information technology costs are a significant source of uncontrollable spending in corporations that derive much of their profits from the information economy such as banks publishing houses telecommunications companies and defence contractors Information technology costs are often the greatest corporate cost after total compensation costs and property related costs Management accounting in such organizations work closely with the IT department to provide IT Cost Transparency

Given the above one widely held view of the progression of the accounting and finance career path is that financial accounting is a stepping stone to management accounting Consistent with the notion of value creation management accountants help drive the success of the business while strict financial accounting is more of a compliance and historical endeavor

A very rarely expressed alternative view of management accounting is that it is neither a neutral or benign influence in organizations rather a mechanism for management control through spying on workers This view locates management accounting specifically in the context of management control theory Stated differently management accounting information is the mechanism which can be used by managers as a vehicle for the overview of the whole internal structure of the organization to help their control functions within an organization

Cost accounting is a central element of managerial accounting

In the mid to late 1990s several books were written about accounting in the lean enterprise The term lean accounting was coined during that period These books contest that traditional accounting methods are better suited for mass production and do not support or measure good business practices in just in time manufacturing and services The movement reached a tipping point during the 2005 Lean Accounting Summit in Dearborn MI 320 individuals attended and discussed the merits of a new approach to accounting in the lean enterprise 520 individuals attended the 2nd annual conference in 2006

Resource Consumption Accounting is formally defined as a dynamic fully integrated principle based and comprehensive management accounting approach that provides managers with decision support information for enterprise optimization RCA emerged as a management accounting approach around 2000 and was subsequently developed at CAM I the Consortium for Advanced ManufacturingInternational in a Cost Management Section RCA interest group in December 2001

The most significant recent direction in managerial accounting is throughput accounting which recognizes the interdependencies of modern production processes For any given product customer or supplier it is a tool to measure the contribution per unit of constrained resource

A combination lock is a lock that is opened with a set of secret numbers instead of a key Mechanical combination locks usually have a dial that is rotated to three different numbers to open the lock Electronic combination locks usually have a keypad where the combination can be entered like a telephone number

The mechanical combination lock usually has three discs inside The last disc is connected directly to the dial and a notch on this disc rotates the second disc A notch on the second disc in turn rotates the first disc The lock is usually opened by rotating the dial clockwise to the first number counterclockwise past the first number and to the second number and clockwise to the third number This type of lock is popular on safes and padlocks It is available for entry doors but is not popular due to the amount of time required to enter the combination The combination is usually set at the factory and can not be changed easily

The electronic combination lock uses a keypad that looks similar to a telephone keypad The combination is entered one number at a time When the last digit is entered a motor opens the lock This type of lock is popular on safes and doors but is almost never seen on padlocks These locks require batteries or another source of electricity There is sometimes a key backup in case the batteries die or the electronics fail Most safe locks do not have a key backup as a key backup can be picked Most electronic locks allow the user to set the combination

Combination locks can not be picked and the user does not have to carry a key There is little chance of getting locked out as long as the user is good at remembering the combination

Mechanical combination locks can be difficult to use for people who have never used one before The most common mistakes are forgetting to pass the first number when dialing the second number and rotating the dial backwards In an electronic combination lock the batteries can die preventing the lock from opening until the batteries are replaced With most combination locks it is possible for a thief to obtain the combination by watching a legitimate user entering it

Zork The Great Underground Empire  Part I also known as Zork I is an interactive fiction video game written by Marc Blank Dave Lebling Bruce Daniels and Tim Anderson and published by Infocom in 1980 It was the first game in the popular Zork trilogy and was released for a wide range of computer systems followed by Zork II and Zork III It was Infocoms first game and sold more than 400000 copies

The player steps into the role of an adventurer The game begins near a white house in a small self contained area Although the player is no instructions the house is point of interest

When the player enters the house through a window it yields a number of interesting objects an ancient brass lantern an empty trophy case an intricately engraved sword etc Beneath a rug a trap door leads down into a dark cellar But what appears the cellar is actually one of several entrances to an underground areathe Great Underground Empire The player soon encounters dangerous creatures including deadly grues an axe wielding troll a giant cyclops and a nimble fingered thief 

The goal of Zork I is to collect the Twenty Treasures of Zork and place them in the trophy case Finding the treasures requires solving a variety of puzzles such as the navigation of two difficult mazes and some precise controls at Flood Control Dam 3 

Placing all of the treasures into the trophy case scores the player 350 points and grants the rank of Master Adventurer An ancient map with further instructions then appears in the trophy case These instructions provide access to a stone barrow The entrance to the barrow is the end of Zork I and the beginning of Zork II

The Wizard of Frobozz is soon introduced The wizard was once a good sorceror but when his powers began to go away he was exiled by Lord Dimwit Flathead Now bordering on insanity the wizard is a force to be reckoned with Your goal as you venture into the wizards area is to avoid his tricks and learn to control his magic

Like its predecessor Zork II is essentially a treasure hunt Unlike the previous game the ten treasures are tied together by a crude plot Finding the treasures does not end the game and finding all the treasures is not needed to finish the game Instead the adventurer must figure out a way to use the treasures in order to reach the games finale

The nature versus nurture debate concerns the relative importance of a persons innate qualities versus personal experiences in causing individual differences In the language of population genetics the heritability of a feature is the extent to which it is inherited genetically That includes traits of behaviour and character Though the public debate is all about humans the principles apply to any living thing plants as well as animals 

The realisation that people inherited some features but were modified during life was known to the ancients The phrase nature versus nurture was suggested by the English Victorian polymath Francis Galton who was influenced by Darwins On the Origin of Species He investigated the influence of heredity and environment on social advancement The terms had been contrasted previously for example by Shakespeare 

From the reference it can be seen that Galton did not oppose nature to nurture as two exclusive alternatives The phrase nature vs nurture has been rightly criticized for its over simplification However almost all writers have realised that both play a part in our make up One who at first sight seemed to think humans got their mind from nurture was philosopher John Locke He however was only concerned with how we acquire knowledge from sense data 

Since both nature and nurture play such interacting roles in development many modern psychologists and anthropologists consider the contrast naiverepresenting an outdated state of knowledge

Identical twins are natural clones Because they carry the same genes they may be used to investigate how much heredity contributes to individual people Studies with twins have been quite interesting If we make a list of characteristic traits we find that they vary greatly in how much they owe to heredity For example

The way the studies are done is like this Take a group of identical twins and a group of fraternal twins and a group of siblings from the population Measure them for various traits Do a statistical analysis This tells you to what extent the trait is inherited You will find that all those traits which are partly inherited will be significantly more similar in identical twins 

Studies like this may be carried further by comparing identical twins brought up together with identical twins brought up in different circumstances That gives a handle on how much circumstances can alter the outcomes of genetically identical people

The person who first did twin studies was Francis Galton Darwins half cousin who was a founder of statistics His method was to trace twins through their life history making many kinds of measurement Unfortunately though he knew about mono and dizygotic twins he did not appreciate the real genetic difference Twin studies of the modern kind did not appear until the 1920s

This kind of research works well when the features can measured simply It works less well when the measurement is itself controversial This was the case with IQ measurement where the method of measurement was not well agreed between researchers

RSA is an algorithm used by modern computers to encrypt and decrypt messages It is an algorithm for public key cryptography It is based on the fact that finding the factors of a integer is hard RSA stands for Ron Rivest Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman who first publicly described it in 1978 A user of RSA creates and then publishes the product of two large prime numbers along with an auxiliary value as their public key The prime factors must be kept secret Anyone can use the public key to encrypt a message but with currently published methods if the public key is large enough only someone with knowledge of the prime factors can feasibly decode the message Whether breaking RSA encryption is as hard as factoring is an open question known as the RSA problem

Relativism is an theory in philosophy that says that the truth of a statement is based on conditions The same applies to these conditions The start of this chain some arbitrary definitions or persuasions of an individual For this reason there can be no statements that are unconditionally true as there is no uncoditional or absolute truth In the same way there are no absolute ethical values There are similar ideas in Nihilism Scepticism and Amoralism but these fieds do not use a chain of conditions to show this 

People who agreed with the idea of relativism include Paul Feyerabend Isaiah Berlin and Richard Rorty 

The Roman Catholic Church especially under John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI has identified relativism as one of the most significant problems for faith and morals today

The Church and some philosophers define relativism as the denial of absolute truth They say that without absolute truth there can be no moral values If there are no moral values there might not be sin and God may not exist In their view relativism constitutes a denial of the capacity of the human mind and reason to arrive at truth Truth according to Catholic theologians and philosophers consists of adequatio rei et intellectus the correspondence of the mind and reality Another way of putting it states that the mind has the same form as reality This means when the form of the computer in front of someone is also the form that is in their mind then what they know is true because their mind corresponds to objective reality

The denial of an absolute reference of an axis mundi denies God who equates to Absolute Truth according to these Christian philosophers They link relativism to secularism an obstruction of religion in human life

Pope Leo XIII was the first known Pope to use the word relativism in the encyclical Humanum Genus Leo XIII condemned Freemasonry and claimed that its philosophical and political system was largely based on relativism

Cheese analogues are substitutes of cheese that are made to imitate the taste and the look of real cheese Such substitutes replace the dairy milk by other plant based ingredients The fat in the milk is replaced by other kinds of fat of animal or plant origin Sometimes the proteins found in milk are also replaced by proteins from other sources Cheese analogues are usually used because of health reasons for example lactose intolerance They are also used as a personal choice In most cases Cheese analogue is kosher 

Cheese analogue cost less to make than real cheese By carefully choosing the ingredients in the analogue other characteristics such as the melting temperature and the taste can be changed Flavour enhancers can be added to make the product taste similar to Parmesan feta or Camembert cheese for example Food coloring is used to match the color of a cheese product Real cheese undergoes a ripening process cheese analogues do not have this Usually vegetable oil is heated and mixed with a premade powder and water Flavour enhancers are added After cooling the product is ready for packaging 

In Europe cheese analogue is used for gastronomy and in bakeries In the United States it is marketed as a replacement for real cheese The arguments used cater to people who do not want to use real cheese for personal reasons or that cannot use it for health reasons

Lime is a general term for various naturally occurring minerals and materials derived from them in which carbonates oxides and hydroxides of calcium predominate

These materials are used in large quantities as building and engineering materials and as chemical feedstocks among other uses The rocks and minerals from which these materials are derived primarily limestone and chalk are composed primarily of calcium carbonate  Burning converts them into the highly caustic material quicklime and through the additon of water into the less caustic but still strongly alkaline slaked lime

In general writing when the term is used in an agricultural context it probably refers to Agricultural lime Otherwise it most commonly means slaked lime as the more dangerous form is usually described more specifically as quicklime or burnt lime

Permineralization is a process of fossilization where mineral deposits form internal casts of organisms The minerals are moved by water They fill the spaces in the cells of the organic material Because of the nature of the casts permineralization is particularly useful in studies of the internal structures of organisms usually of plants

In silicification silicate minerals are released due to the weathering of rocks The silica makes its way into a body of still water Eventually the mineral laden water permeates the pores and cells of some organism where it becomes a gel Over time the gel will dehydrate forming an opaline crystal structure that is an internal cast of the organism This accounts for the detail found in permineralizations Silicification reveals information about what type of environment the organism was likely to live in Most fossils that have been silicified are bacteria algae and other plant life Silicification is the most common type of permineralization

Carbonate mineralization involves the formation of coal balls Coal balls are the fossilizations of many different plants and their tissues They are usually made when there is seawater or acidic peat Coal balls are calcium rich permineralizations of peat by calcium and magnesium carbonates They are usually round Their mass ranges from a few grams to several hundred kilograms

Coal balls are formed when water containing carbonate permeates the cells of an organism This type of fossilization yields information about plant life in the Upper Carboniferous Period

This method involves the elements sulfur and iron Organisms are pyritized when they are in marine sediments saturated with iron sulfides Pyrite is iron sulfide As organic matter decays it releases sulfide which reacts with dissolved iron in the surrounding waters Pyrite replaces carbonate shell material due to an undersaturation of carbonate in the surrounding waters Some plants are also pyritized when they are in a clay terrain but to a lesser extent than in a marine environment Some pyritized fossils include marine arthropods and plants

On 5 October 2000 the operator of the MTR network MTR Corporation Limited became Hong Kongs first privatised rail and metro company which marked the start of the Hong Kong governments planned initiative to wind down its interests in various public utilities Prior to its listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange the Mass Transit Railway Coporation was wholly owned by the Hong Kong Government The offering involved the sale of around one billion shares and the company now has the largest shareholder base of any company listed in Hong Kong In June 2001 MTR Corporation Limited was transferred to Hang Seng Index

MTR Corporation Limited has always been reliant on developing properties next to railway stations for its profits many recently built stations are incorporated into large housing estates or shopping complexes Examples of this type of construction can be seen at Tsing Yi station which is built next to the Maritime Square shopping centre and directly underneath the Tierra Verde housing estate

On April 11 2006 MTR Corporation Limited signed a non binding Memorandum of Understanding with the Hong Kong Government the owner of Kowloon Canton Railway Corporation to merge the operation of the two railway networks of Hong Kong If eventually approved MTR Corporation Limited will take over the operation of the KCR network and combine the fare system of the two networks

The Battle of Plassey was a major battle that took place 23 June 1757 at Palashi Bengal It was an important British East India Company victory over the Nawab of Bengal and his French allies It let the British East India Company take control of a part of South Asia They grew their area of control over a large part of the Indies for the next hundred years 

The battle took place at Palashi Bengal on the river banks of the Bhagirathi River The fighting took place about convert150kmmi north of Calcutta This was near Murshidabad which was the capital of Bengal at the time Plassey is the anglicised version of Palashi The battle was between Siraj ud daulah the last independent Nawab of Bengal and the British East India Company

The battle took place after the attack and plunder of Calcutta by Siraj ud daulah and the Black Hole tragedy The British sent more soldiers under Colonel Robert Clive and Admiral Charles Watson from Madras to Bengal The British retook control of Calcutta Clive then took control of the French fort of Chandernagar The troubles between Siraj ud daulah and the British led to the Battle of Plassey The battle was fought during the Seven Years War The French East India Company sent a small group to fight against the British Siraj ud Daulah had more soldiers and chose to fight at Plassey The British were worried about having fewer soldiers They formed a conspiracy with Siraj ud Daulahs demoted army leader Mir Jafar as well as others such as Yar Lutuf Khan and Rai Durlabh Mir Jafar Rai Durlabh and Yar Lutuf Khan brought their soldiers near Plassey but did not actually join the battle Siraj ud Daulahs army was beaten by about 3000 soldiers of Col Robert Clive Part of the reason the British won was because Siraj ud daulah fled from the battlefield and the worry caused by the close by soldiers due to the conspiracy

This is thought to be one of the most important battles for the control of South Asia by the colonial powers The British now had a large amount of influence over the Nawab They also got a lot of revenue from trade The British used this revenue to increase their military power They pushed the other European colonial powers such as the Dutch and the French out of South Asia This was a sign of the expansion the British Empire in Asia

Eero Saarinen was a Finnish American architect and industrial designer of the 20th century He was known for varying his style according to the demands of the project simple sweeping arching structural curves or machine like rationalism

Eero Saarinen shared the same birthday as his father Eliel Saarinen Saarinen emigrated to the United States of America in 1923 at the age of thirteen He grew up in Bloomfield Hills Michigan where his father was a teacher at the Cranbrook Academy of Art He took courses in sculpture and furniture design there He had a close relationship with fellow students Charles and Ray Eames He became good friends with Florence Knoll

Beginning in September 1929 he studied sculpture at the Acadmie de la Grande Chaumire in Paris France He then studied at the Yale School of Architecture until 1934 Later he toured Europe and North Africa for a year and returned for a year to his native Finland He returned to Cranbrook to work for his father and teach at the academy He became a naturalized citizen of the US in 1940 Saarinen was recruited by his friend who was also an architect to join the military service in the Office of Strategic Services Saarinen was assigned to draw illustrations for bomb disassembly manuals and to provide designs for the Situation Room in the White House Saarinen worked full time for the OSS until 1944 After his fathers death in 1950 Saarinen founded his own architects office Eero Saarinen and Associates Eero Saarinen died of a brain tumor in 1961 at the age of 51

He married the sculptor Lilian Swann Saarinen They divorced in 1954 He had two children from his first marriage Eric and Susan Saarinen then married Aline Bernstein Louchheim an art critic at The New York Times They had a son Eames named after his collaborator Charles Eames

Saarinen first received critical recognition while still working for his father for a chair designed together with Charles Eames for the Organic Design in Home Furnishings competition in 1940 for which they received first prize The Tulip Chair like all other Saarinen chairs was taken into production by the Knoll furniture company founded by Hans Knoll who married Saarinen family friend Florence Knoll

During his long association with Knoll he designed many important pieces of furniture including the Grasshopper lounge chair and ottoman the Womb chair and ottoman the Womb settee side and arm chairs and his most famous Tulip or Pedestal group which featured side and arm chairs dining coffee and side tables as well as a stool All of these designs were highly successful except for the Grasshopper lounge chair which although in production through 1965 was not a big success

One of Saarinens earliest works to receive international acclaim is the Crow Island School in Winnetka Illinois

While Saarinen was still working for his father he took first prize in the 1948 competition for the design of the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial St Louis His arch not completed until the 1960s The competition award was mistakenly sent to his father

The first major work by Saarinen in collaboration with his father was the General Motors Technical Center in Warren Michigan It follows the rationalist design Miesian style incorporating steel and glass but with the added accent of panels in two shades of blue The GM technical center was constructed in 1956 with Saarinen using models These models allowed him to share his ideas with others and gather input from other professionals With the success of the scheme Saarinen was then invited by other major American corporations to design their new headquarters these included John Deere IBM and CBS Despite their rationality however the interiors usually contained more dramatic sweeping staircases as well as furniture designed by Saarinen such as the Pedestal Series In the 1950s he began to receive more commissions from American universities for campus designs and individual buildings these include the Noyes dormitory at Vassar Saarinen designed an ice rink Ingalls Rink and Ezra Stiles College at Yale University 

He served on the jury for the Sydney Opera House commission and was crucial in the selection of the design by Jrn Utzon

Saarinens architectural firm was called Eero Saarinen and Associates He was the principal partner from 1950 until his death in 1961 The firm was initially known as Saarinen Swansen and Associates headed by Eliel Saarinen and Robert Swansen from the late 1930s until Eliels death in 1950 The firm was located in Bloomfield Hills Michigan until 1961 when the practice was moved to Hamden Connecticut Under Eero Saarinen the firm carried out many of its most important works including the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial in St Louis Missouri the Miller House in Columbus Indiana the TWA Flight Center at John F Kennedy International Airport that he worked on with Charles J Parise and the main terminal of Dulles International Airport near Washington DC Many of these projects use catenary curves in their structural designs Saarinen designed one of the best known thin shell concrete structures in America the Kresge Auditorium Another thin shell structure that he created is the Ingalls Rink which has suspension cables connected to a single concrete backbone and is nicknamed the whale He is known for the TWA Flight Center which represents the culmination of his previous designs and demonstrates his expressionism and the technical marvel in concrete shells

Eero worked with his father mother and sister designing elements of the Cranbrook campus in Bloomfield Hills Michigan including the Cranbrook School Kingswood School the Cranbrook Art Academy and the Cranbrook Science Institute Eeros leaded glass designs are a prominent feature of these buildings throughout the campus httpwwwarkitekturanyccomcat3htm

Saarinen died while undergoing an operation for a brain tumor at the age of 51 His wife Aline coincidentally would also die of the same ailment His partners Kevin Roche and John Dinkeloo completed his ten remaining projects including the St Louis Arch Afterwards the name of the firm was changed to Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo and Associates or Roche Dinkeloo

Eero Saarinen was elected a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects in 1952 He is also a winner of the AIA Gold Medal

Saarinen is now considered one of the masters of American 20th Century architecture There has been more interest in Saarinens work in recent years including a major exhibition and several books This is partly due to the Roche and Dinkeloo office having donated their Saarinen archives to Yale University but also because Saarinens work seems to fit in with present day concerns about pluralism of styles He was criticized in his own timemost vociferously by critic Vincent Scullyfor having no identifiable style one explanation for this is that Saarinen adapted his modernist vision to each individual client and project which were never exactly the same

An exhibition of Saarinens work Eero Saarinen Realizing American Utopia has been organized by the Finnish Cultural Institute in New York in collaboration with Yale School of Architecture and the Museum of Finnish Architecture The exhibition will tour in Europe and the USA from 2006 to 2010 The exhibition is accompanied by the book Eero Saarinen Shaping the Future

In 1973 the Aline and Eero Saarinen papers were donated to the Archives of American Art Smithsonian Institution by Charles Alan Aline Saarinens brother and executor of her estate In 2006 these primary source documents on the couple were digitized in their entirely and posted online on the Archives website

The Akutan Zero also known as Kogas Zero and the Aleutian Zero was a type 0 model 21 Mitsubishi A6M Zero Japanese fighter plane This type of airplane was the Imperial Japanese Navys most common fighter plane during World War 2 It crashed on Akutan Island Alaska Territory during June 1942 It was the first flyable Zero that the United States got during the war The Americans fixed the plane and test pilots flew it to find out how it worked American tacticians were able to find ways to defeat the Zero

Tadayoshi Koga was the pilot He was a 19 year old flight petty officer first class He launched from the Japanese aircraft carrier Ryj as part of a June 4 1942 raid on Dutch Harbor Alaska Small gun fire cut the oil line in the plane Without oil the plane crashed and killed the pilot The plane did not break apart in the crash The pilots of other Zero planes flying with Koga thought that he might be alive Because of this they did not try to destroy his plane The Americans got the plane in July 

The Akutan Zero was very important to the American war effort Some said it may have been one of the greatest prizes of the Pacific war Japanese historian Masatake Okumiya thought that losing the Akutan Zero to the Americans was similar to Japan losing the Battle of Midway He said it made Japan lose the war sooner On the other hand John Lundstrom is among those who do not agree with the contention that it took dissection of Kogas Zero to create tactics that beat the fabled airplane

The Akutan Zero was destroyed in a training accident in 1945 Parts of the plane are kept in several museums in the United States

The Morrill Anti Bigamy Act was a federal law The act banned men having more than one wife at the same time It also limited the amount of property that a church and non profit could own in any territory of the United States to 50000 Justin Smith Morrill of Vermont sponsored it President Abraham Lincoln signed it on July 8 1862 

The act wanted to stop the Mormon practice of plural marriage and the property dominance of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints in the Utah Territory The measure had no funds allocated for enforcement Lincoln chose not to enforce this law Instead Lincoln gave Brigham Young tacit permission to ignore the Morrill Act in exchange for not becoming involved with the Civil War General Patrick Edward Connor commanding officer of the federal forces garrisoned at Fort Douglas Utah beginning in 1862 was explicitly instructed not to confront the Mormons over this or any other issue

In 1878 the Supreme Court ruled in Reynolds v United States that religious duty was not a suitable defense for breaking this law Many Mormons went into hidingThe Morrill Anti Bigamy Act was amended in 1882 by the Edmunds Act and then again in 1887 by the EdmundsTucker Act By 1904 the LDS church disavowed bigamy

Pitjantjatjara is the name of a tribe of native Australian people They live in the central Australian desert The people call themselves Anangu It is a word which means People in their own language Two other tribes the Yankunytjatjara and the Ngaanyatjarra are related to them Their languages are understandable by members of each others tribes

The parts of Australia they live in start in the North Western area of South Australia and continue across the land border with the Northern Territory near to Lake Amadeus and then finish a short distance away in Western Australia The land they occupy is special to them It forms a large part of their culture and beliefs

The Pitjantjatara people have almost given up the nomadic lifestyle of hunting for food and collecting it from the wild They have kept their culture and identity despite outside influences and attempts to force them to change These influences come from the wider Australian community

There are currently about 4000 people from this tribe living in small communities spread out across their land

The island of stability in nuclear physics describes a set of as yet undiscovered isotopes of transuranium elements which physicsts predict to be much more stable than others Specifically they are expected to have radioactive decay half lives of at least minutes or days as compared to seconds Some of these elements may have half lives of millions of years

The possibility of an island of stability was first proposed by Glenn T SeaborgWhendateOctober 2011 He thought that an atomic nucleus is built up in shells in a manner similar to the structure of the much larger electron shells in atoms In both cases shells are just groups of quantum energy levels that are relatively close to each other Energy levels from quantum states in two different shells will be separated by a relatively large energy gap So when the number of neutrons and protons completely fills the energy levels of a given shell in the nucleus the binding energy per nucleon will be the strongest in that range of atomic numbers With a stronger binding energy that particular isotope will have a longer lifetime than nearby isotopes that do not possess filled shells

A filled shell would have magic numbers of neutrons and protons One possible magic number of neutrons for spherical nuclei is 184 and some possible matching proton numbers are 114 120 and 126 which would mean that the most stable spherical isotopes would be ununquadium 298 unbinilium 304 and unbihexium 310 Of particular note is Ubh 310 which would be doubly magic and thus the most likely to have a very long half life

Recent research indicates that large nuclei are deformed causing magic numbers to shift Hassium 270 is now believed to be a doubly magic deformed nucleus with deformed magic numbers 108 and 162 However it has a half life of only 36 seconds

Some scientists like to draw graphs of the number of neutrons in an isotope against the number of protons in the isotope with the third dimension showing the half life of the isotope In such graphs there is a cluster of comparatively stable isotopes Scientists call that cluster the island of stability

Isotopes have been produced with enough protons to plant them upon an island of stability but with too few neutrons to even place them upon the islands outer shores Chemists hope that these elements possess unusual chemical properties and if they have isotopes with adequate lifespans would be available for various practical applications

All elements with an atomic number above 82 are unstable The stability of elements generally decreases with rising atomic numbers from the relatively stable uranium upwards to the heaviest known element 118 It increases very slightly in the range of elements 110 to 113 expected to be at the beginning of the island of stability The longest lived observed isotopes of each of the heaviest elements are shown in the following table

For comparison the shortest lived element with atomic number below 100 is francium with a half life of 22 minutes

The half lives of nuclei in the island of stability itself are unknown since none of the isotopes that would be on the island have been observed Many physicists think they are relatively short on the order of minutes or days Some theoretical calculations indicate that their half lives may be long on the order of 109 yearsVerify credibilitysource seems severely outdated with values given for eg Db 268 of years which really has a half life of 1 day dateMay 2011

The alpha decay half lives of 1700 nuclei with 100 Z 130 have been calculated in a quantum tunneling model with both experimental and theoretical alpha decay Q values The theoretical calculations are in good agreement with the available experimental data

Current theoretical investigation indicates that in the region gapsZ106108 and gapsN160164 a small islandpeninsula might be stable with respect to fission and beta decay such superheavy nuclei undergoing only alpha decay Also chem298Uuq is not the center of the magic island as predicted earlier On the contrary the nucleus with gapsZ110 gapsN183 appears to be near the center of a possible magic island In the gapsN162 region the beta stable fission survived chem268Sg is predicted to have alpha decay half life 32 hours that is greater than that of the deformed doubly magic chem270Hs The superheavy nucleus chem268Sg has not been produced in the laboratory as yet For superheavy nuclei with gapsZ116 and gapsN184 the alpha decay half lives are predicted to be less than one second The nuclei with gapsZ120 124 126 and gapsN184 are predicted to form spherical doubly magic nuclei and be stable with respect to fission Calculations in a quantum tunneling model show that such superheavy nuclei would undergo alpha decay within microseconds or less

It is hard for physicists to make nuclei on the island of stability One way to generate new elements is to shoot a target made out of one element with a beam made out of a second element When the beam hits the target some nuceli stick together with an atomic weight equal to the sum of the target and beam weight It is hard for this method to make nuclei on the island because the nuclei available as starting materials do not deliver the necessary sum of neutrons For the synthesis of isotope 298 of element 114 one could use an isotope of plutonium and one of calcium that together have a sum of at least 298 nucleons for example calcium 50 and plutonium 248 However these and heavier isotopes are not available in measurable quantities making production virtually impossible with current methods The same problem exists for the other possible combinations of isotopes needed to generate elements on the island using target projectile methods It may be possible to generate the isotope 298 of element 114 if the multi nucleon transfer reactions would work in low energy collisions of actinide nuclei One of these reactions may be

Linear programming or Linear optimisation is a field of mathematics that deals with finding optimal values or solutions that can be described with linear equations and inequalities Very often this involves finding the minimal or maximal values given some conditions Linear programming is often used for problem where no exact solution is known for example for planning traffic flows Limnear programming is one of the main methods used in Operations research Linear optimization is a special case of Convex optimization It forms the basis for several methods of solving problems of Integer programming In many cases the solutionms of linear programs can be mapped to Polyhedra which allows to solve and model certain problems geometrically 

In the case of linear programming the word programming should be seen as planning George Dantzig coined the term in the 1940s long before computers were used to solve such problems Looking at the information theory complexity linear programming problems are simple and can be solved efficiently using algorithms such as the interior point method In many cases the Simplex algorithm developed by Dantzig has proven to be very fast even though its complexity is exponential in the worst case 

Leonid Kantorovich developed the first methods of linear programming in 1939

Cedar is a genus of cone bearing trees in the plant family Pinaceae They are native to the mountains of the western Himalaya and the Mediterranean region They are found at heights of convert15003200mft in the Himalaya and convert10002200mft in the Mediterranean

Cedars are trees up to convert3040mft tall with spicy scented wood thick ridged or square cracked bark and broad level branches The shoots are of two kinds long shoots which form the framework of the branches and short shoots which carry most of the leaves The leaves are evergreen and needle like 860 mm long arranged in an open spiral on long shoots and in dense spiral clusters of 1545 together on short shoots they vary from bright grass green to dark green to strongly glaucous pale blue green depending on the thickness of the white wax layer which protects the leaves from drying out The female seed cones are barrel shaped 612 cm long and 38 cm broad green at first then maturing grey brown and as in Abies disintegrate when mature to release the winged seeds The seeds are 1015 mm long with a 2030 mm wing as in Abies the seeds have 23 blisters containing an unpleasant tasting resin thought to be a defence against squirrels eating them Cones take one year to mature with pollination in autumn and the seeds maturing the same time a year later The male pollen cones are slender egg shaped 38 cm long produced in late summer and shedding pollen in autumn 

Cedar cones have a similar structure to fir cones and for many years in the past experts thought they were closely related but modern scientific investigation has shown that they belong to the same family but not closely related

There are several types of cedars and experts cannot agree how they are related Some scientists put them all in one group while others separate them into different groups

These are the names of the different kinds of cedars

No Motherland Without You is a North Korean song It is the signature song of Kim Jong il The song tells about the talent and virtues of Jong il and the attachment of the Korean people for him The repeated phrase in the song is We cannot exist without you Comrade Kim Jong il The motherland cannot exist without you It is also thought to be the anthem of Songun politics because Jong il started the Songun policy to North Korean politics in 1995 It is often broadcasted on the radio and from loudspeakers on the streets of Pyongyang

The official lyrics use the phrase to refer to the son of Kim Il sung The current usage of the song refers to the North Korean leader as because of he was the Supreme Commander of the Korean Peoples Army since 1991 The lyrics used by the Korean Workers Party are as follows

There are 28 UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the United Kingdom and overseas territories The UNESCO list has seventeen properties in England four in Scotland three in Wales one in Northern Ireland and one in each of the overseas territories of Bermuda the Pitcairn Islands and Saint Helena 

The first sites in the UK to be added to the World Heritage List in 1986 were

The latest site to be added was Pontcysyllte Aqueduct and Canal in 2009

The constitution of the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization was ratified in 1946 by 26 countries The United Kingdom was one of these countries UNESCO was created for the conservation and protection of the worlds inheritance of books works of art and monuments of history and science The UK contributes 130000 annually to the World Heritage Fund which finances the preservation of sites in developing countries Some locations have many sites that have a common geographical location or cultural history

The United Kingdom National Commission for UNESCO advises the British government on policies dealing with UNESCO The British government is responsible for maintaining its World Heritage Sites 

There are 10 criteria for a site to be able to be added to the list World Heritage Site selection criteria iiv are culturally based selection criteria viix are natural criteria Twenty three properties are listed as cultural Four are listed as natural One is listed as mixed This is similar to the proportions of all World Heritage Sites Of the 890 sites on the World Heritage List 774 are cultural 198 are natural and 28 are mixed St Kilda is the only mixed World Heritage Site in the UK At first it was added to the list because of its natural habitats In 2005 the crofting community that once was part of the archipelago was added to the site The natural sites are the Dorset and East Devon Coast Giants Causeway and Causeway Coast Gough and Inaccessible Islands and Henderson Island The rest are cultural

The Folketing is the national parliament of Denmark The name means Peoples thing It is the highest legislative body in the Kingdom of Denmark and decides most of the laws for Denmark Greenland and the Faroe Islands The Folketing meets in Christiansborg Palace in the Danish capital Copenhagen 179 members sit in the Folketing and are democratically elected

Greenland and the Faroe Islands also have their own less powerful parliaments and are allowed to make some laws on their own

The Folketing is where many political parties in Denmark meet to discuss important issues affecting Danish people and to pass laws they agree on The Folketing is also where the Government of Denmark is formed when several parties who are in agreement decide to join together and form a coalition government The voting system used in Denmark is proportional meaning the distribution of seats reflects the distribution of votes This means that many parties and different political views are represented including some extreme views

The leader of the Folketing is the Speaker who sits at the front The members sit in front of the speaker in the shape of a semicircle

From 1849 to 1953 the Folketing was one of the two houses in a parliament It was known as the Rigsdag The other house was known as the Landsting The members of the Folketing included farmers traders and merchants The Landsting was made up of the wealthy members of society It included the nobility These members were chosen by the King to become members In 1953 the Landsting was gotten rid of This left the Folketing as the only house of parliament The Rigsdag became the Folketing

A European windstorm is an extratropical cyclone that affects Europe They are normally caused by areas of low atmospheric pressure that move across the North Atlantic towards northwestern Europe They are most common in the winter months Low pressure areas are common over the North Atlantic They sometimes start as noreasters off the New England coast They usually move past the north coasts of the British Isles to the Norwegian Sea When they move south they can affect almost any country in Europe These most often affect Britain Ireland Norway the Faroe Islands and Iceland They can affect any country in central northern and western Europe

These storms cause economic damage of 19 billion each year They cause insurance costs of 14 billion yearly Only US hurricanes cause more insurance costs of all natural disasters

The Euston Arch was an archway built at the front of Euston railway station in London It was built in 1837 by the London and Birmingham Railway The people in charge of the new and modern railway wanted passengers to have a good feeling about the station They built the large arch as a gate in front of the station to attract attention 

Four columns supported the arch The outside two columns were plain and square The inside two were circular and decorated in the Doric style This Doric style gave the arch its common name of The Doric Arch

Originally the words London and Birmingham Railway marked the top of the gate In 1870 the letters EUSTON in gold were carved into the beam across the tops of the four columns This railway company had joined other companies to form the London and North Western Railway This new company did not want passengers to use the old name It changed the name of the arch from the company name to the station name

In 1960s Britain was modernising the railways Diesel locomotives were replacing of steam locomotives Overhead electric wires were added to the important line from Euston Station in London to the North West of England The old Euston station was also to replaced The railway added more platforms and more space at the front of the station for cars By 1961 the Arch had been removed

The Northern station of the railway was at Curzon Street in Birmingham That station was decorated with large pillars too and it still stands today The columns at Curzon Street are Ionic instead of Doric This means that the columns are plain not fluted

SSI or social security income is a type of government check that is given to those in the United States with some type of disability Those who are above age 65 are automatically qualified to receive SSI benefits However children who has a disability can also qualify for SSI benefits In all cases with children they can received SSI until the age of 18 Some children continue to receive SSI if their disability worsen or if they continue to develop more disabilities When a child reaches the age of 18 they are evaluated by a professional physiatrist who ask several questions ranging from their moods to how they are doing in their life The evaluation also consists of several mental work problems that are based on decision making At the end of the evaluation the physiatrist will determine if the child is still disabled or have more disabilities 

There has been mixed to negative commentaries by the general public who believe that SSI is a mere waste and should be get rid of While others argue that if SSI is taken away that the elderly and children with disabilities would have to struggle with medical expenses and other lifetime economy struggles SSI is founded by the government The money given to those with SSI are taken from taxes from those who work in the United States SSI benefits include insurance automatically qualification for low income housing free transportation to and from appointments and a monthly check that arrives on the first of every month

Aberdeen Airport is an international airport in Aberdeen Scotland

It is about 5 nautical miles northwest of Aberdeen city centre 276 million passengers used Aberdeen Airport in 2010 a reduction of 74 from 2009 It is the 15th busiest airport in the UK The airport was the second busiest airport in Scotland and sixth busiest in the United Kingdom by number of flights in 2010

The airport is owned and operated by BAA which is a Spanish company It operates six British airports including Heathrow Airport

Aberdeen Airport is a base for BMI Regional and Eastern Airways The Airport is also the main heliport for the Scottish offshore oil industry 

The airport has one main passenger terminal serving scheduled and charter holiday flights There are three terminals for North Sea helicopter operations used by Bristow Helicopters CHC Scotia and Bond Offshore Helicopters There is also a small terminal next to the main passenger terminal Broomfield House used for oil company charter flights to Scatsta in Shetland operated by Eastern Airways

Aberdeen Airport has the worlds largest commercial heliport which has more than 400000 passengers each year

With the newer aircraft helicopters can reach the northern most platforms on both the East and west of Shetland areas However helicopters often use Wick Kirkwall Scatsa and Sumburgh for refuelling stops

A heliport is a small airport only for use by helicopters Heliports normally contain one or more helipads and may have limited facilities such as fuel lighting a windsock or even hangars In larger towns and cities customs facilities may be available at a heliport 

The early supporters of helicopters hoped that heliports would become popular but they have not been popular in urban areas due to the unpleasant noise caused by helicopter traffic

In a large metropolis a heliport can serve passengers needing to quickly move within the city or to outlying regions Generally heliports can be situated closer to a town or city centre than an airport for fixed wing aircraft The advantage in flying by helicopter to a destination or even to the citys main airport is that travel can be much faster than driving As an example the Downtown Manhattan Heliport in New York City provides scheduled service to John F Kennedy International Airport and is used to move wealthy persons and important goods quickly to destinations as far away as Maryland

Some skyscrapers feature rooftop helipads or heliports to serve the transport needs of executives or clients The US Bank Tower in Los Angeles is an example Police departments use heliports as a base for police helicopters and larger department may have a dedicated one such as the LAPD Hooper Heliport

Helipads are common features at hospitals where they serve to facilitate MEDEVACs or air ambulance transfers of patients to trauma units or to accept patients from remote areas without local hospitals or facilities capable of providing the level of emergency care required In urban environments these heliports are typically located on the roof of the hospital

Heliports have no orientation and are not numbered in a standard fashion like runways In some US cities it is standard to paint the maximum allowable weight of a helicopter in thousands of pounds Thus a 12 in a circle designates that the maximum landing weight is 12000 lbs

Some Canadian hospital heliports have a cross and some have the letter H in the middle

Heliport lighting normally consists of a circle or square of inset lights around the surface called the TLOF and another around the overall landing area called the FATO The later encompasses the TLOF as well and the lights may be elevated or inset Both sets of lights are now recommended to be green by the International Civil Aviation Organization and Federal Aviation Administration Yellow was the former standard and is still preferred in many locations There is a great deal of variance in color depending on the owner and jurisdiction These lights were traditionally incandescent but are now increasingly light emitting diodes with brightness control The TLOF and FATO lights may be supplemented with surface flood lights A lighted wind cone is necessary At ground based locations a row of lead in lights in the preferred direction of approach is sometimes used Visual slope guidance systems are recommended in both ICAO and FAA documents but are rarely deployed due to the high cost relative to the rest of the lighting system While airports commonly use 66A direct current power heliport lighting is normally AC powered Radio control of the lighting by the pilot via an automated ground based controller is also common

Ballarat Airport Airport codesYBLT or Ballarat Aerodrome is at Mitchell Park an outer suburb of Ballarat Victoria Australia

Pilots were first trained on the Ballarat Common in 1914 15 In 1934 a tin hangar was built

In 1940 in World War II the site was taken over by the Australian government and a Royal Australian Air Force airfield known as Empire Air Training Scheme No 1 Wireless Air Gunners School was begun at the Ballarat Showgrounds on 22 April 1940

The hangar was moved to the Commonwealth Flax Mill and four Bellman Hangars and numerous P type hut buildings were erected In mid 1940 the Wireless Air Gunners School moved to the aerodrome At first the wireless operators were mainly trained in panel vans but from mid 1941 they used CAC Wackett trainer aircraft

No 1 WAGS was disbanded on 31 December 1945

The RAAF continued to use the airfield as its Radio School until 1961 The Shire of Ballarat took over the airport as a civil airport and kept many of the hangars and other structures Most of the P Huts were sold by the Australian government

The site was listed on the Victorian Heritage Register in 2007 because of its history with the Empire Air Training Scheme in Victoria

The airport still has an important role in emergency services operation civil operation and flight training Many community groups and organisations use the old buildings

The airfield was also used for motor sport starting on Australia Day in 1947 when it held its first motor race meeting In February there was an International Formula Libre race which was attended by some European Formula 1 teams BRM factory drivers Dan Gurney and Graham Hill finished first and second in the major race the Victoria Trophy with Ron Flockhart third in a Cooper On the night before the race Gurneys car was stolen from its hangar and driven into or hidden with hay bales out on the track

In 1942 Contra Costa County paid 88000 for land to build an airport in the county The airport was being developed when World War II started The United States Army Air Forces took over the land The Army added more land and built the airport They also built a training base for pilots and the base was called Concord Army Airfeld

In 1946 the War Assets Administration gave the airport back to the County In August 1946 the airport name was changed to honor County Supervisor William J Buchanan who was a board member for more than forty years The airport was still sometimes used by the US Army to move soldiers especially during the Korean War

In 1977 Buchanan Field was its busiest with 357000 total operations That made it the 16th busiest airport in the United States ahead of San Francisco International Airport John F Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport During this time people were worried about noise from the airplanes so in 1988 the county made a law against some kinds of airplanes flying into Buchanan Field

Starting in the 1990s the county started planning to build more businesses near the airport Some of the businesses built were Sams Club Taco Bell Sports Authority and Jiffy Lube People might try to close this airport in the future That is because people would like to use the land it is on for other things because it is in the middle of the city of Concord with no room to grow and because the airplane noise bothers people The county has built a new airport in Byron in the eastern part of the county

On December 23 1985 a small plane crashed into the roof of the Macys Department Store at nearby Sunvalley Mall The pilot and two passengers were killed 84 shoppers in the mall were hurt mostly from burning fuel Four of the shoppers died later from their injuries The accident made more people be against the airport Pacific Southwest Airlines delayed scheduled passenger service that had been planned to start in January 1986

Another plane crashed on April 13 2004 just after leaving Buchanan Field The plane landed on a minivan on Interstate 680 in Pleasant Hill The crash almost severed the left leg of a 12 year old girl The crash was the fault of a mechanic who had worked on the plane

On December 21 2006 another plane crashed It was flying too low and ran into the ground The plane hit Highway 4 It crashed between the highway and Marsh Drive Three passengers were killed instantly and another passenger died after surgery

Right now Buchanan Field does not have scheduled flights

Flights to San Francisco started in 1969 but were stopped by 1980 On May 1 1986 Pacific Southwest Airlines started flights from Buchanan Field to Los Angeles International Airport PSA offered several round trips each day using airplanes that had 100 seats In 1987 USAir took over those flights after buying PSA That year USAir said that it was stopping most of the West Coast flights that it got from PSA This included Concord where flights ended in 1992 Buchanan Field has had no airline flights since

In 1940 the US Navy got the land that would become Naval Air Station Oceana The nearby area was mostly farmland that flooded easily It was useful as a second airfield to support the growing Naval Air Force at NAS Norfolk It also let units get ready for deployments away from the crowded base there NAS Norfolk could not be the home station for tactical air units because of problems with airspace Much of its airspace is shared with the Norfolk International Airport In the 1950s NAS Oceana was made larger and given Master Jet Base status to be the home for the tactical air units NAS Oceana has grown to become one of the largest air stations in the world It covers an area of convert6820acrekm2 Area around the base was cleared to remove obstructions and make flight easier at the base This adds an additional convert3680acrekm2 to the area of the base The bass has four runways They are laid out in two pair forming a cross Three of the runways are convert8000ftm in length The other is convert12000ftm They are designed for high performance aircraft NAS Oceanas main mission is to train and house the Navys Atlantic Fleet strike fighter squadrons of FA 18 Hornets and Super Hornets Naval Aviators and Naval Flight Officers at NAS Oceana fly about 219000 training operations each year

On a Navy Master Jet Base all aircraft at one base are usually of the same TypeModelSeries That airfield also has the maintenance and training facilities for that type of aircraft NAS Oceana had two types normally It had a fighter and Attack aircraft section In the 1960s NAS Oceana became the home to all East Coast based F 4 Phantom II squadrons Fighter Squadron 101 created a detachment at NAS Oceana It served as the Fleet Readiness Squadron It trained pilots and other crew members to operate the Phantom It also trained the people who repaired the aircraft After the F 14 Tomcat began being used in 1976 VF 101 changed to using and training people to use Tomcats Phantom training operations moved to Fighter Squadron 171 VF 171 dealt with Atlantic Fleet training for the F 4 Phantom until it was no longer used in 1984 The last F 14 was retired on 22 September 2006 At one time all of the Atlantic Fleets A 6 Intruder attack squadrons were also home based at NAS Oceana VA 42 was the Fleet Readiness Squadron that trained all east coast A 6 pilots bombardiernavigators and A 6 maintenance personnel The A 6E was no longer used in the Fleet in 1997

NAS Oceana became home to the FA 18 Hornet in 1999 after NAS Cecil Field Florida was closed

NAS Oceana is home to seventeen strike fighter squadrons of FA 18 Hornets and FA 18 Super Hornets The base is the only East Coast Master Jet Base It is home to all the east coast strike fighter units except VFA 86 and Marine Corps VMFA squadrons VFA 106 Gladiators are in charge of training They use FA 18CD Hornets and FA 18EF Super Hornets

Tomcat training was done by the VF 101 Grim Reapers NAS Oceana was host to the Tomcat Sunset reunion from 2123 September 2006 Over 3000 former and current aircrew and maintainers came together to celebrate the retirement of the F 14 from active use NAS Oceana was where the F 14 took off for the last time for final flight The F 14D Bureau Number 164603 Modex 101 of Fighter Squadron31 was flew from NAS Oceana to Calverton on Long Island NY It was put on display at the Northrop Grumman facilities where the Tomcat was first built

During the 2005 BRAC base closures it was decided that NAS Oceana could stay open only if some conditions were met The largest problem was that the city of Virginia Beach had to buy and destroy about 3400 houses and an unknown number of businesses near the base These buildings were in the Crash zone the area most likely to be the site of an accident on landing The fighters would likely have been moved to NAS Cecil Field near Jacksonville Florida if NAS Oceana was not able to meet the conditions The plan was well liked by Jacksonville Mayor John Peyton The Navy decided it did not like the idea of moving the Master Jet Base to the Jacksonville area On 20 December 2005 the Virginia Beach passed many ordinances to do what BRAC wanted but did not destroy any of the homes

NAS Oceana has been an possible landing site for NASAs Space Shuttle if needed

In addition to the squadrons listed there are many other commands at Oceana

Flights into and out of DCA cannot be further than convert1250mikm This is done to control the number of aircraft over Washington It causes most of the air traffic to be sent to the Washington Dulles International Airport which is larger and further from the city There are some exceptions to this rule In 2010 the airport served about 181 million passengers Reagan National is a focus city for US Airways the airports largest carrier The US Airways Shuttle has air shuttle service to LaGuardia Airport in New York City and Logan International Airport in Boston Massachusetts Delta Air Lines Delta Shuttle also has air shuttle service to LaGuardia These shuttle flights leave Reagan International about once an hour

Hoover Field near the present site of the Pentagon was the first major terminal to be developed in the Capital area opening its doors in 1926 The facilitys single runway was intersected by a local street guards had to stop automobile traffic during takeoffs and landings The following year Washington Airport another privately operated field began service next door In 1930 the economics of the Great Depression caused the two terminals to merge to form Washington Hoover Airport Bordered on the east by US Route 1 with its accompanying high tension electrical wires and obstructed by a high smokestack on one approach and a dump nearby the field was less than adequate

Although the need for a better airport was acknowledged in 37 studies conducted between 1926 and 1938 there was a statutory prohibition against federal development of airports Congress lifted the prohibition in 1938 President Franklin Roosevelt had emergency powers to spend money while Congress was in recess He used that power to spend 15 million to build National Airport by shifting funds from other purposes Construction of Washington National Airport began in 194041 by a company led by John McShain Congress challenged the legality of FDRs recess appropriation but construction of the new airport continued

The airport is southwest of Washington DC The eastern side of the airport was made by filling in the Potomac River The western part of the airport was once within a large Virginia plantation called Abingon For many years the plantation house stood near the airport parking lot but it burned down Only small pieces of it are left

The airport opened on June 16 1941 In 1945 Congress passed a law that established the airport was legally within Virginia but under the jurisdiction of the federal government

In 1977 the Washington Metro opened a station at the airport

The runway layout limited due to the location and orientation of the airport has changed little except for the 1956 closure of a fourth east west runway now used for taxiing and aircraft parking The terminal building was supplemented by the completion of the North Terminal in 1958 the two were connected in 1961 A United Airlines holdroom complex was built in 1965 and a facility for American Airlines was completed in 1968 A commuter terminal was constructed in 1970

Despite the expansions several efforts have been made to restrict the growth of the airport The advent of jet aircraft as well as traffic growth led Congress to pass the Washington Airport Act of 1950 which resulted in the opening of Dulles Airport in 1962 Concerns about aviation noise led to the imposition of noise restrictions even before jet service began in 1966 To reduce congestion and drive traffic to alternative airports the Federal Aviation Administration imposed landing slot and perimeter restrictions on National and four other high density airports in 1969Citation neededdateMarch 2011

In 1984 Secretary of Transportation Elizabeth Dole appointed a commission to study transferring National and Dulles Airports from the Federal Aviation Administration to a local entity which could use airport revenues to finance improvements The commission recommended that one multi state agency administer both Dulles and National over the alternative of having Virginia control Dulles and the District of Columbia control National In 1987 Congress through legislation transferred control of the airport from the FAA to the new Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority with the Authoritys decisions being subject to a Congressional review panel The constitutionality of the review panel was later challenged in the Supreme Court and the Court has twice declared the oversight panel unconstitutional Even after this decision however Congress has continued to intervene in the management of the airports While the cases challenging the legality of the MWAA were in court the MWAA could not sell bonds to finance new construction So new terminals parking garages and runways at National and Dulles airports had to wait

In 1998 some friends of Ronald Reagan wanted to name things in all 50 states in his honor They wanted a law that would rename the airport Ronald Reagan Airport Democratic Congressmen suggested renaming the office building of the Bureau of the Public Debt after him instead They also said that the airport was already named after George Washington So Congress renamed the airport Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport That name is so long that many people kept calling it National Airport for short Congress did not provide money to make new signs with the new names So the name was slow to be accepted The name of the airports Metro station remained National Airport In early 2001 a letter signed by 24 members of Congress requested WMATA rename the station to match the new airport name However according to a Metro policy adopted in 1987 groups seeking to rename a station were required to pay the cost of replacing signs and maps The Arlington County government which could have made the change demurredthe price was estimated at 400000and WMATA subsequently declined to rename the station on April 19 2001 In response Republican Congressman Bob Barr of Georgia threatened to withhold federal funding from the agency unless the station was renamed Congress ultimately voted to require the renaming on November 30 According to then General Manager Richard A White Metro paid to complete the renaming

With the addition of more flights and limited space in the aging main terminal the airport began an extensive renovation and expansion in the 1990s On July 27 1997 a new 450 million terminal complex consisting of terminals B and C and two parking garages opened Argentine architect Csar Pelli designed the new terminals of the airport One pier of the main terminal which mainly housed American Airlines and Pan Am was demolished the other pier originally designed for NorthwestTWA remains operational today as gates 19 Both the American Airlines and the NorthwestTWA Terminals were designed by Joseph C Giuliani FAIA

Before 1999 Runway 119 and 422 were originally designated 1836 and 321

Given Reagan National Airports proximity to the city and high security facilities Reagan National has extra security precautions required by the Washington Air Defense Identification Zone that were in place since the airport began operations

Prior to the September 11 attacks in 2001 the most notable security measure was the southbound approach into the airport Most of central Washington DC is prohibited airspace up to convert18000ftm Due to this restriction pilots approaching from the north follow the path of the Potomac River and make a steep turn shortly before landing on the southbound runway This approach is known as the River Visual Similarly flights taking off to the north are required to climb quickly and take a steep left turn to avoid contact with the Washington Monument or flight over the White House

After the 2011 attacks the airport was closed for several weeks and security was tightened extensively when it reopened Increased security measures included

On October 18 2005 the airport was reopened to general aviation on a limited basis and under serious restrictions passenger and crew manifests must be submitted to the Transportation Security Administration 24 hours in advance and all planes must pass through one of 27 gateway airports where re inspections of aircraft passengers and baggage take place An armed security officer must be on board before departing a gateway airport

On March 23 2011 the air traffic control supervisor on duty reportedly fell asleep during the night shift Two aircraft on approach to the airport were unable to contact anyone in the control tower and subsequently landed unassisted

Reagan National Airport also has noise restrictions that are some of the most restrictive in the country Pilots are required to use the River Visual approach which follows the course of the Potomac River and is only possible with a ceiling of at least convert3500ftm and visibility of convert3smikm or more There are lights on the Key Bridge Theodore Roosevelt Bridge Arlington Memorial Bridge and the George Mason Memorial Bridge to aid pilots following the river Aircraft using the approach can be observed from various parks on the rivers west bank Passengers seated on the left side of an airplane that is landing can easily see the Capitol the Washington Monument the Jefferson Memorial the World War II Memorial Georgetown University the National Mall and the White House Passengers seated on the right side can see CIA headquarters Arlington National Cemetery the Pentagon and the United States Air Force Memorial

When visibility and ceiling are below the minimums for the River Visual and southerly winds restrict northbound runway operations aircraft fly an offset localizer or GPS approach to Runway 19 again involving a final turn moments before touchdown or they fly a VOR or GPS approach to either of the shorter Runways 15 and 22 which are marginally usable by air carrier jetsCitation neededdateMarch 2011

Flights are divided between DCA and Dulles based on how far each plane flies The shorter non stop flights use DCA Longer flights use Dulles This is called a perimeter restriction If the distance is too short then Congressmen cannot use DCA to fly home each weekend

The airport is subject to a federally mandated perimeter limitation and may not accommodate nonstop flights to or from cities beyond a 1250 statute mile radius with limited exceptions The US Department of Transportation has issued beyond perimeter slot exemptions which allow specified carriers to operate 12 daily round trip flights to cities outside the perimeter These exemptions are allocated as follows

Originally the airport had no perimeter rule in 1954 1960 airlines scheduled nonstop flights to California on piston engine airlinersCitation neededdateMarch 2011 Scheduled jet airliners were not allowed at all until April 1966 the perimeter rule arrived with them and apparently applied only to them The initial perimeter was 650 statute miles except that airports under 1000 statute miles that had scheduled nonstops in 1965 were allowed to retain them This meant Minneapolis St Paul was allowed nonstop jet flights but Kansas City New Orleans and Fort Lauderdale were not In 1981 the perimeter became a flat 1000 statute miles it expanded to 1250 statute miles enough to encompass Houston in 1986 87

In 1999 Senator John McCain of Arizona introduced legislation to remove the 1250 statute mile perimeter restrictionCitation neededdateMarch 2011 infuriating some local residents concerned about noise and traffic from increased service by larger long haul aircraft McCain argued that the move would improve competition while criticsSpecifydateMarch 2011 charged he was supporting the interests of Phoenix Arizona based America West Airlines In the end the restriction was not lifted but the FAA was permitted to add additional exemptions which went not to AWA but to competitor Alaska Airlines America West later gained additional exemptions for non stop service to Phoenix in 2004

In 2010 Reagan National Airport handled 18118713 passengers US Airways has the largest share of traffic at the airport accounting for 2156 as of20112lcon Delta Air Lines the second largest accounts for 1453 of traffic with American Airlines in third at 1338

Terminal A opened in 1941 It was made larger in 1955 to handle more passengers and airlines Most of the gates were taken out of this building in 1997

Terminals B and C opened in 1997 They replaced a group of terminals used by a single airline in each terminal These terminals were built during the 1960s The new terminals were designed by architect Cesar Pelli They have 35 gates There is no Gate 13 This may be because of superstition

The National Airport station on the Washington Metro is located on an elevated outdoor platform connected to the concourse level of Terminals B and C and offers service on the Yellow and Blue lines

A major histocompatibility complex or MHC is a molecule on the outside of immune cells such as white blood cells It is coded for by a large gene family in all vertebrates

MHC molecules affect the way immune cells interact with other cells Their function is to sense foreign antigens and hence the presence of foreign proteins Adaptive immunity depends on this reaction

Immune cells use MHC to communicate with each other on how to attack an infection like a bacterium or virus They do this by presenting information on the MHC and physically touching another cell An autoimmune disease occurs when the immune cells do not recognize the MHC molecules of other cells and starts attacking its own body Transplants are limited to those which get the least reaction from the MHC system in tests of tissue matches

BrasliaPresidente Juscelino Kubitschek International Airport airport codesBSBSBBR is the airport serving Braslia Brazil Since April 22 1999 the airport is named after Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira the 21st President of Brazil

In 2010 the airport was ranked 3rd in terms of transported passengers and aircraft operations and 8th in terms of cargo handled in Brazil placing it amongst the busiest airports in the country It is operated by Infraero

Some of its facilities are shared with the Braslia Air Force Base of the Brazilian Air Force

Braslia was only an unbuilt plan when in 1956 President Juscelino Kubitschek landed for the first time in the Central Plateau However Vera Cruz Airport built in 1955 by the then Deputy Governor of Gois Bernardo Sayo at the request of the chairman of the location of the New Federal Capital Marechal Jos Pessoa already existed On October 2 1955 the airport received the first crew of workers that would build the new capital This airport was located where today is the Integrated Bus and Train Terminal of Braslia It had a dirt runway of 2700 meters and a passenger terminal in a makeshift shack cob wall covered with buriti leaves

This facility however was only temporary The relocation to a definitive site had already been identified as a priority Construction of the current airport started on November 6 1956 It took only over six months and required the clearing of an area of 1334 million square meters 178500 square meters of earthwork base stabilized 40900 m covering 73500 m topographical services positioning and leveling The runway was designed to have a length of 3300m but initially it had only 2400m and was 45m wide The passenger terminal was built of wood On April 2 1957 the presidential aircraft landed for the first time at the new site and the official inauguration took place on May 3 1957 That year on the same location the Braslia Air Force Base was also commissioned

In 1965 Oscar Niemeyer designed a new terminal for the Braslia Airport to replace the wooden terminal However due to the 1964 Brazilian coup dtat the military government chose to build a design by Trcio Fontana Pacheco an architect of the Brazilian Air Force Ministry The airport is thus one of the few important buildings in Braslia that was not designed by Niemeyer This terminal opened in 1971 and since 1990 it is under renovation following an architectural concept of the architect Sergio Roberto Parada

In 1990 Braslia International Airport underwent its first major renovation and began to gain its present form with a central body and two satellites The first phase included the construction of an access viaduct to the passenger terminal and metal cover inaugurated in 1992 and the first circular satellite inaugurated in 1994 In the second phase the main body of the passenger terminal was renovated to include a shopping mall and the satellite received nine jetways In 2005 a second runway was opened Presently the second satellite is under construction

Moorabbin Airport airport codesMBWYMMB is an airport for light aircraft located in Mentone Victoria Australia The airport is a suburb with its own postcode 3194 The airport opened in December 1949 It was going to be called Mentone but this was too similar to the then French airport Menton The name Cheltenham was too similar to the UK airport GloucesterCheltenham The name comes from the nearby suburb of Moorabbin Victoria Moorabbin Airport is the third busiest airport in Australia by aircraft movements

Moorabbin Airport has five intersecting runways an air museum helicopter terminals a control tower and several flight training facilities Moorabbin Airport serves the general aviation needs for the south eastern of Melbourne and King Island

The nearest train station is Cheltenham about convert3kmabbron from the airport

An airport terminal is a building at an airport It is where passengers are able to get on and off aircraft Inside the terminal passengers can buy tickets leave or pick up their luggage and be checked by security staff The buildings that provide access to the airplanes through gates are usually called concourses However the words terminal and concourse are sometimes used to mean the same thing Small airports have only one terminal while large airports can have several terminals andor concourses At small airports the single terminal building usually has all of the functions of a terminal and a concourse

Some larger airports have one terminal that is joined to multiple concourses via walkways sky bridges or underground tunnels Some larger airports have more than one terminal each with one or more concourses Still other larger airports have multiple terminals each of which includes the functions of a concourse

Most airport terminals are built in a plain style However some such as Baghdad International Airport are grand monuments while others are considered architectural masterpieces such as Terminal 1 at Charles de Gaulle airport near Paris or Terminal 5 at New Yorks JFK Airport A few are designed to reflect the culture of an area The terminal at Albuquerque International Sunport in New Mexico is designed in the Pueblo Revival style made popular by architect John Gaw Meem The terminal at Bahas de Huatulco International Airport in Huatulco Oaxaca Mexico which features some palapas that are interconnected to form the airport terminal

Many early terminals were built in the 1930s1940s when air travel become popular They are often in the art deco style architecture of the time One such example from 1940 is the Houston Municipal Airport Terminal Early airport terminals opened directly onto the tarmac passengers would walk or take a bus to their aircraft This design is still common among smaller airports Many larger airports have bus gates to access aircraft which are parked beyond the main terminal

A pier design uses a long narrow building with aircraft parked on both sides One end joins to a ticketing and baggage claim area Piers can hold a lot of aircraft and are simple to design They can often result in a long distance from the check in counter to the gate At Kansai International Airport this distance is half a mile Most large international airports have piers including Chicagos OHare International Airport Larnaca International Airport Frankfurt International Airport London Heathrow Airport Amsterdam Schiphol Airport Murtala Muhammed International Airport Kuala Lumpur International Airport Bangkok International Airport Beirut International Airport Hong Kong International Airport Allama Iqbal International Airport and Miami International Airport

A satellite terminal is a building that is not joined to other airport buildings The aircraft can park around the entire building The first airport to use a satellite terminal was London Gatwick Airport Passengers use an underground tunnel to walk to the satellite from the main terminal This was also the first setup at Los Angeles International Airport but it has since been changed to a pier layout The first airport to use an automatic people mover to join the main terminal with a satellite was Tampa International Airport Other examples include the following

Some airports use a semicircular terminal with aircraft parked on one side and cars on the other This design results in long walks for passengers changing aircraft but greatly reduces travel times between check in and the aircraft Airports designed around this model include Charles de Gaulle International Airport Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport Mumbai DallasFort Worth International Airport Seouls Incheon International Airport Toronto Pearson Airport Kansas City Airport and Sapporos New Chitose Airport

Another unusual terminal design is the mobile lounge Passengers are taken from the gate to their aircraft in a large vehicle which docks directly to the terminal and the aircraft Washington Dulles International Airport Mexico City International Airport and Mirabel International Airport have used this design A mix of layouts also exist San Francisco International Airport and Melbourne Airport use both a pier semicircular layout and a pier layout

Common use terminal designs means airlines share check in counters gates and IT systems Check in counters and gates can be used by airlines as needed

Dubai International Airport Dubai United Arab Emirates Terminal 3 is the largest single Terminal building in the world It had an area of over when it opened on October 14 2008 It can handle an excess of 43 million passengers

Beijing Hong Kong Bangkok and Mexico City have the worlds second third fourth and fifth largest single terminals in Beijing Capital International Airport Hong Kong International Airport Suvarnabhumi Airport and Mexico City International Airport

Many small and mid size airports have a single two or three lane one way loop road which is used by local private vehicles and buses to drop off and pick up passengers

An international airport may have two one way loop roads one for departures and one for arrivals It may have a direct rail connection by regional rail light rail or subway to the downtown or central business district of the closest major city The largest airports may have direct connections to the closest freeway There will be car rental agencies and taxi companies at the terminals The Hong Kong International Airport has ferry piers on the airside to connect with ferry piers across the border

Sydney Airport Airport codesSYDYSSY is in the suburb of Mascot in Sydney Australia It is Sydneys main airport and is the main hub for Qantas and a secondary hub for Virgin Australia and Jetstar Airways It is next to Botany Bay The airport has three runways the eastwest northsouth and third runways

Sydney Airport is one of the oldest airports in the world still in use It is the busiest airport in Australia handling 36 million passengers in 2010 and 289741 aircraft movements in 2009 It was the 28th busiest airport in the world in 2009 The airport is managed by Sydney Airport Corporation Limited Flights from Sydney link with all parts of Australia There are direct flights to 47 Australian cities and towns

Before the airport was built it was a field for bullocks Nigel Love a former World War I pilot wanted to start building aircraft He needed to set up a factory and an aerodrome close to the city He found some land owned by the Kensington Race Club It had been used by a local abattoir which was closing down to graze sheep and cattle The surface was perfectly flat and was covered with a pasture of buffalo grass This grass which had been grazed so evenly by the sheep and cattle running on it that it was easy to make it suitable to land aircraft In addition it was clear for aircraft on all four sides On the sides of the field were a racecourse gardens a river and Botany Bay

Love set up Mascot as a private business leasing Convert200acrekm22abbron from the Kensington Race club for three years At first he had a small canvas structure but was later put up an imported Richards hangar The first flight from Mascot was on 19 November 1919 when Love took movie cameraman Billy Marshall up in an Avro The official opening flight took place on 9 January 1920 also performed by Love

In 1921 the Australian government purchased Convert161acrekm22abbron in Mascot to set up a public airfield In 1923 at the end of Loves three year lease the government took the land from the racing club The first regular flights began in 1924

In 1933 the first gravel runways were built The course of Cooks River was moved away from the area in 194752 to provide more land for the airport and other small streams were filled When Mascot was declared an aerodrome in 1920 it was known as Sydney Airport In 1953 it was renamed Sydney Airport after Charles Kingsford Smith a pioneering Australian aviator The first paved runway was 0725 and the next one built was 16R sticking out into Botany Bay starting in 1959 to land large jets 07 25 is used mainly by lighter aircraft although large four engine jet aircraft still land on the runway from the east when south westerly winds are blowing in Sydney 16R is presently the longest operational runway in Australia with Convert14300ftm paved length and Convert12850ftm between the zebra thresholds

By the 1960s a new international terminal was needed and work started in late 1966 The new building was officially opened on 3 May 1970 by Queen Elizabeth II

The first Boeing 747 Jumbo Jet to land at the airport Pan Americans Clipper Flying Cloud arrived on 4 October 1970 In the 1970s the north south runway was made longer to become one of the longest runways in the southern hemisphere The international terminal was made bigger in 1992 and has been modernized several times since then

Having only two runways that crossed each other became a problem and various governments tried to increase with Sydney airports capacity for many years A decision was finally made to build a third runway This was not popular with people who lived near the airport The third runway was built parallel to the existing main northsouth runway entirely on reclaimed land from Botany Bay A proposed new airport on the outskirts of Sydney was not developed

The third runway remained a problem because of increased aircraft movements especially over many inner suburbs The 1990s saw the setting up of the No Aircraft Noise Party although it did not win any seats in Parliament Changes for Sydney Airports operation were introduced by the Howard government in 1996 These included

In 2002 the Australian Government sold Sydney Airport to Southern Cross Airports Corporation Holdings Ltd 8293 of SACL is owned by MAp Airports International Limited part of Macquarie Bank Sydney Airport Intervest GmbH own 1211 and Ontario Teachers Australia Trust own 496 SACL holds a 99 year lease on the airport which remains Crown land

The international terminal has been made bigger several times The next rebuilding will take place in stages over twenty years This will include a high rise office block a multi level car park and bigger international and domestic terminals This rebuilding and other plans of Macquarie Bank for the airport are seen as controversial They do not need the legal oversight of local councils which usually act as the local planning authority for such developments

As of April 2006 some of the proposed development has been scaled back

Sydney Airports International terminal underwent a 500 million rebuild that was completed in mid 2010 It included a new baggage system an extra Convert7300m2sqft0abbron of space for shops and passenger waiting areas and other improvements

In March 2010 the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said that prices at Sydney airport were too high The report said Sydney Airport recorded the highest average prices at 1363 per passenger compared to the lowest of 796 at Melbourne Airport The price of short term parking had almost doubled in the 200809 financial year from 28 to 50 for four hours The report also said the airport abused its monopoly power

In December 2011 Sydney Airport said it would divide the airport into two airline based areas which would have international domestic and regional services under the one roof by 2019 Terminal 2 and Terminal 3 would be used by Qantas Jetstar and members of the oneworld airline alliance Terminal 1 would be used by Virgin Australia and its international partners Other international airlines would continue to operate from T1

Sydney Airport has three passenger terminals The International Terminal is separated from the other two by a runway Passengers needing to catch another flight need to allow for longer transfer times Sydney Airport requires minimum connection times

Naval Air Station Glenview or NAS Glenview was a military airport from 1923 to 1995 It was in Glenview Illinois a northern suburb of Chicago close to Lake Michigan The air base primarily operated training aircraft as well as seaplanes on nearby Lake Michigan during World War II It was reconfigured as a Naval Air Reserve base following World War II The Naval Air Reserve and Marine Air Reserve4th Marine Aircraft Wing units as well as an active duty Coast Guard Air Station all used the airport The airport closed permanently in 1998 The land is now used for civilian purposes

The Curtiss Flying Service first built the airport to be the hub of Chicagos air service When the field was dedicated as Curtiss Field on 20 October 1929 it was home to the largest hangar built to that time Hangar One Hangar One one of the most advanced hangars at the time It included many innovations which were considered state of the art A one gigacandela electric light was erected which allowed for airfield activity in the dark Additionally a system of carefully designed sliding doors created dividers for storage and zone heating Glassed in galleries allowed passengers to watch the mechanics at work on the ground floor A passenger friendly restaurant and lounge were opened in the upper levels A loudspeaker system informed the passengers of the flight arrivals and departures The final cost for the airfield and Hangar One was 3 million in 1930 By adjusting the price for inflation the relative cost in 2005 would be about 324 million It was widely believed to be one of the Midwests finest airports

In 1930 the National Air Races took place at Curtiss Reynolds AirportCurtiss Field and in 1933 the International Air Races took place there in conjunction with the Century of Progress Worlds Fair Such aviation luminaries as Charles Lindbergh Wiley Post and Jimmy Doolittle attended In 1934 Post tried to set an aviation altitude record from Curtiss By 1938 civilian and military operations both used the field In 1940 it was sold outright to the United States Navy

Military Presence 

Reduced military budgets between World War I and World War II forced the War Department and the Navy Department to place increased emphasis on Reserve and National Guard manpower Many of the facilities for Reserve personnel were in major metropolitan areas given their status as centers of civilian employment The US Navy established a series of Naval Reserve Air Bases NRABs The third NRAB was placed near Chicago next to to the then Naval Training Station Great Lakes Reservists initially flew and maintained seaplanes from shore facilities on Lake Michigan and a small field at Naval Training Station Great Lakes These facilities eventually became inadequate for newer and larger aircraft entering the US Naval Fleet in the 1930s So the NRAB moved to Curtiss Reynolds AirportCurtiss Field Military construction at Curtiss Field began on 4 January 1937 followed by an official dedication as NRAB Chicago on 28 August 1937

For the next three years the air stations primary role was elimination training for students seeking appointments as Naval Aviation Cadets Those students meeting the required standards were later transferred to NAS Pensacola Florida for further flight training However by 1941 the United States entry into World War II appearing imminent Naval leadership in Washington DC saw that the war time expansion Naval Aviation would need more pilots than could be trained at and around NAS Pensacola As a result naval planners opted to transfer primary flight training to multiple NRABs around the country and use NAS Pensacola for advanced training NRAB Chicago was selected to be the first base in this program as a proof of concept A subsequent construction program of 121 work days resulted in 1300000 square feet of new concrete being poured for runways taxiways and ramps while new hangars and other administrative and support buildings were also constructed and completed by late November 1942 On 1 January 1943 NRAB Chicago was redesignated as NAS Chicago By 1944 Chicago was deleted from the air stations title and the installation renamed NAS Glenview

Nearly 9000 aviation cadets for the US Navy US Marine Corps and US Coast Guard received their primary flight training at NAS Glenview during World War II This represented over 800000 flight hours and over 2 million takeoffs and landings Later during the war NAS Glenview also hosted advanced training in Fleet combat aircraft primarily for carrier qualification in Lake Michigan aboard the Chicago homeported training aircraft carriers USS Sable and USS Wolverine of the 9th Naval District Carrier Qualification Training Unit

Following the end of World War II NAS Glenview discontinued its role as a primary training base Instead the airport was headquarters for the newly formed Naval Air Reserve Training Command in 1946 NAVAIRESTRACOMs primary responsibility was the oversight of numerous reserve naval air stations throughout the United Sates where experienced Naval Aviators enlisted Naval Aircrewmen and maintenance personnel from World War II could affiliate as Naval Reservists and maintain their aviation proficiency should their skills be needed for future conflicts These activities were important when the Naval Reserves went back to active duty during the Korean War and the Berlin Blockade  Each base also had an assigned Naval Air Reserve Training Unit which until a reorganization of the Naval Air Reserve in 1970 actually owned all assigned aircraft One of the better units based at NAS Glenview in the post World War II period was an attack squadron known as Attack Squadron 725 which was part of NARTU Glenview until 1970 when it was redesignated as Attack Squadron 209 and became part of Carrier Air Wing Reserve TWENTY from 1970 onward Initially flying the A 4B Skyhawk the squadron later transitioned to the A 4L Skyhawk From 1967 to 1972 part of VA 725 cum VA 209 also operated as the Air Barons a Naval Air Reserve precision flight demonstration team that augmented the US Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron the Blue Angels and the US Air Forces demonstration squadron the Thunderbirds at air show locations other than those where the Blue Angels or Thunderbirds were performing on a given weekend during the air show season Both VA 209 and the Air Barons were diesetablished in 1972      

During the latter half of the Cold War from 1970 until 1990 and continuing on from the post Cold War period until 1995 NAS Glenview was primarily the home of two Naval Air Reserve patrol squadrons Patrol Squadron SIXTY and Patrol Squadron NINETY Initially equipped with the P 2 Neptune both squadrons later transitioned to the P 3A Orion followed by another transition the P 3B Orion maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft These aircraft were home based at NAS Glenview and manned by a combination of full time active duty personnel and part time Naval Reservists the latter residing in Illinois and several other midwestern states Training activities were conducted from NAS Glenview and the patrol squadrons routinely deployed overseas for anti submarine warfare operations against Soviet submarines and surface ships in the Atlantic and Mediterranean or for other operations in the Caribbean Another Naval Air Reserve squadron at NAS Glenview was Fleet Logistics Support Squadron FIFTY ONE operating the C 9B Skytrain II aircraft and providing operational support airlift and transport of military personnel and cargo world wide VR 51s noteworthy service included support of US military operations in Lebanaon and Grenada during the 1980s and between the United States and multiple bases in Southwest Asia during Operations DESERT SHIELD DESERT STORM in the 1990s 

Through the mid 1990s NAS Glenview was also home to twenty seven Naval Air Reserve reinforcingsustaining augmentation units to include two patrol squadron augmentation units containing additional P 3 flight crews in an active flying status that also routinely flew VP 60 and VP 90 aircraft as well as oversight of Naval Air Reserve training programs and associated reinforcingsustaining units at Naval Air Reserve Center Twin Cities Minnesota the latter facility now part of Minneapolis Saint Paul Joint Air Reserve Station      

Before its closure due to a 1993 BRAC decision the base was also used as a staging area and departure point for aircraft participating in the annual Chicago Air Water Show Following the 1993 BRAC decision VP 60 and VP 90 were also slated for inactivation and their respective P 3B aircraft either distributed to other patrol squadrons or mothballed VR 51 was also inactivated concurrent with VP 60 and VP 90 with its C 9B aircraft similarly distributed to other VR squadrons or mothballed Unlike the two patrol squadrons VR 51 was later reactivated in November 1997 as a Naval Reserve squadron at MCAS Kaneohe Bay Hawaii where it currently operates C 20G Gulfstream IV aircraft The majority of NAS Glenviews Naval Reserve reinforcingsustaining units were also disestablished with their reserve personnel either retiring from the Navy or transferring to other Regular Navy or Naval Reserve commandsunits at other bases across the United States

The air station was also home to Marine Corps aircraft In 1959 the Marine Corps Reserve established the Marine Helicopter Transportation Squadron 776 at NAS Glenview with HUP 2 helicopters The squadron was redesignated as Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron 776 in 1962 and changed aircraft to the CH 34D In 1972 the squadron was redesignated for the last time to Marine Light Helicopter Squadron 776 and changed aircraft to the UH 1E which was eventually upgraded to the UH 1N This unit was deployed in 1991 in support of Operation Desert Storm and returned to NAS Glenview 10 months later HML 771 was deactivated in 1994 NAS Glenview was also home to the 4th Marine Aircraft Wings Marine Aerial Refueler Transport Squadron 234 VMGR 234 and its KC 130F and KC 130T Hercules aircraft until 1994 when the squadron was permanently relocated to NAS JRB Fort Worth Texas as part of the BRAC mandated closure of NAS Glenview

Coast Guard Air Station Chicago was commissioned as a tenant activity on the northwest corner of NAS Glenview in March 1969 and equipped with HH 52 Seaguard helicopters Primarily a search and rescue activity for the Great Lakes Air Station Chicago was the primary US Coast Guard aerial SAR unit for southern Lake Michigan responsible for the waters from Milwaukee Wisconsin to Muskegon Michigan and south to Gary Indiana 

In April of 1995 Coast Guard Air Station Traverse City gained operational responsibility for what was CGAS Chicago Renamed Coast Guard Air Facility Glenview the station remained on the base during NAS Glenviews BRAC closure process and consisted of a multipurpose hangar office facility and public works building Air Facility Glenview staged one of Air Station Traverse Citys HH 65A Dolphin helicopters with two full crews during the busy search and rescue season from April through mid November However CGAF Glenview subsequently ceased operations on 15 Nov 1996 and its operations eventually relocated to the current Coast Guard Air Facility Waukegan Illinois

Towards the end and following the end of the Cold War BRAC Commissions were established to shed what the Department of Defense and the US Congress considerd to be excess military units and infrastructure The 1993 BRAC identified NAS Glenview for closure no later than 30 September 1995 along with corresponding inactivation or transfer of its assigned squadrons and other units

On 29 June 1998 the Navy transferred the last segment of the closed Naval Air Station Glenview from Navy ownership to private ownership The Village of Glenview Illinois and the Local Reuse Authority taking posession of over 90 of the closed and transferring portion of the base The first transfer occurred in September 1997 with the remaining 10 transferred in October 1999 This last 10 contained the remaining sites that required some form of remedial environmental action The 90 milestone was due to the fact that the operational closure of the base occurred in September of 1995 just two years after the base was selected for closure during BRAC 1993 Since then much of the base property had been idle The new use plan for the base was to demolish the airport and use the land for new parks commerical and residential buildings The importance of the redevelopment effort was significant NAS Glenview was located in the geographic center of the Village of Glenview and contained 15 of the villages landmass 

The conversion removed 1 million cubic yards of concrete 15 miles of runways and 108 former Department of Defense buildings In their place is The Glen a 1121 acre mixed use district with new homes offices and retail space The control tower and Hangar 1 have been preserved as a historic building Hangar 1 including the control tower was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998 as building 98001357 However according to the Glenview Hangar One Foundation 85 of Hangar One was dismantled even following efforts by the foundation and the US Navy to preserve historical buildings

Boris Godunov is an opera by Modest Mussorgsky It was the only opera that Mussorgsky finished It is his most famous work and one of the most famous of all Russian operas It was composed between 1868 and 1873

The story of the opera is based on something that really happened in Russian history The Russian people were ruled by a tsar The previous tsar Tsar Ivan IV was known as Ivan the Terrible He was terribly cruel and the Russian people suffered badly under his rule They were hungry they were tortured and killed When he died his son became Tsar but he was mentally retarded so a group of powerful people including Boris Godunov had to rule for him Ivan also had another son but he disappeared He was almost certainly murdered and Boris Godunov who wanted to become tsar himself had probably ordered him to be murdered  Then he persuaded the Russian people that they should choose him to be their tsar 

Some years later a young monk escapes from his monastery and pretends to be the murdered son of Ivan the Terrible He gets a Polish army to help him to fight Boris Godunov Boris Godunov feels terrible guilty about the murder He suffers so much that he dies The young monk arrives in Moscow and makes himself tsar The ordinary Russian people remain desperately poor It is their fate to suffer ruled by cruel tyrants 

The composer wrote the words himself It was based on a play by Aleksandr Pushkin Mussorgsky also read a famous book on the history of Russia Nikolay Karamzins History of the Russian State and used some of the historical material from this book

Originally Mussorgsky composed the opera in 1869 but in those days it had to be approved by the censors before it was allowed to be performed The opera was rejected by the censors The main reason they gave was that there were no female characters in the opera Mussorgsky made lots of changes including adding a whole new act with Dimitry in love with a Polish princess Another reason why the opera had been rejected was that composers and dramatists were not allowed to have the character of a tsar on stage However Tsar who then ruled said he did not mind so the opera was first performed in 1874 in Saint Petersburg

The opera Boris Godunov can either be performed in the first version of 1869 or in the second version of 1874 In actual fact performances of the opera have often been something of a mixture as opera directors have often made cuts or changes to the music or the order of scenes The composers Nikolai Rimsky Korsakov and Dmitri Shostakovich have both made new editions of the opera in which they thought they could improve some of Mussorgskys harmony or orchestration For many years it was these editions that were usually performed Nowadays people realize more and more that Mussorgskys harmonies and orchestrations which were very original for their time were quite deliberate and very effective Modern performances therefore often go back to what Mussorgsky originally wrote

By the close of 1868 Mussorgsky had already started two operas but never finished them These were Salammb and Marriage which was influenced by Alexander Dargomyzhskys opera The Stone Guest Mussorgsky was breaking away from the Romantic style that many composers used at the time He had learned a lot by trying to write these operas and he used some of the musical ideas in Boris Godunov

Vladimir Nikolsky a professor of Russian history suggested to Mussorgsky the idea of writing an opera about Boris Godunov based on Pushkins play Mussorgsky worked very fast on the opera finishing the vocal score in 9 months During this time he was also working as a civil servant When he state censor rejected the opera he worked another two years on it adding a female role as required and making other changes he felt necessary adding three scenes cutting one and changing another adding songs for the Hostess Fyodor and the Nurse In 1873 three scenes were performed and on 27 January 1874 the first performance of the whole opera took place The conductor Npravnk was a good conductor but he often made cuts in the operas he performed He cut the whole of the Cell Scene because he thought the opera was too long Nevertheless it was a great success among many people although some critics hated it It was performed 21 times in Mussorgskys lifetime

During the early 20th century the Russian bass singer Fyodor Shalyapin was a very singer who often sang the role of Boris

The opera is divided into a prologue and 4 acts

In the first scene of the prologue a large crowd has come to the courtyard of a monastery Chelkalov comes and talks to the crowd He tells them that Boris has not yet accepted the throne but that they should pray that he will The second scene is the famous coronation scene The crowd are kneeling in front of two cathedrals in the centre of Moscow The church bells are ringing The boyars cross the stage Boris has agreed to be Tsar Boris appears on stage but he is rather gloomy He tells the crowd to pray for guidance

Act II The scene is the Tsars apartments in the Kremlin in Moscow The Tsarevich Fyodor is reading his sister sings sadly a song about a man she loved who died before they could get married The Nurse tries to comfort her Fyodor tries to cheer her up by singing a jolly clapping song The Nurse joins in Then Boris comes in He tells him to concentrate on his lesson One day he will rule the country and he will need to be wise Boris sings of his terrible feelings of doubt and agony A boyar enters and tells Boris that Shuisky wants to speak to him He warns Boris that Shuisky is on the side of the Poles who are against him When Shuisky enters he tells Boris that a pretender has come who claims to be the Tsars son who is thought to have been murdered Boris asks Shuisky whether it really was the Tsars son who was killed and buried Shuisky says that it definitely was and that he had watched over the body for five days Boris cannot bear to hear any more and tells Shuisky to leave He then sinks back in a chair A clock chimes and the figures on the clock move Boris thinks they are aghost of the murdered child He goes mad

Act III The scene takes place in the royal palace in Poland Dimitri has gone to Poland to persuade the Polish army to support him in his fight against Boris The Poles are glad to do this because they often fought Russia when they thought they could take a bit of their land They want the Polish Princess Marina to marry Dimitri Princess Marina sings of her love for Dimitri She has not met him yet but she would like to be Tsarina because that would bring her power Rangoni tells Dimitri that the Princess is in love with him A meeting is arranged in the garden Princess Marina is horrible to him She persuades him to act quickly to get an army together to march to Moscow and get the throne They embrace Rangoni is pleased because it will be a triumph for his church

Act IV Scene i takes place in the palace in the Kremlin Shuisky tells the assembled noblemen that he saw Boris who seemed to be having a mad fit He was shouting Away Away and waving his arms Just at that moment Boris enters doing just that He does not seem to notice any of the boyars who are standing there Shuisky manages to persuade him to sit down on his throne Shuisky then says that there is a holy man outside who has something to say to everyone The man is let in It is Pimen He tells a strange story It is about a shepherd who was blind He had a dream in which he was told to go to the tomb where the murdered Tsars son Dimitri lies buried He went there and prayed  Immediately he was able to see Boris becomes terribly distressed at this story He calls for light he collapses in the arms of the boyars and he sends for his son Fyodor Boris asks to be left alone with him He then says goodbye to his son and tells him to take good care of the Russian people Monks behind the scene pray for the soul of Boris Boris dies

There has been a lot of discussion about the order of the two scenes in Act IV scene i which shows the death of Boris and scene ii which shows the Russian people in the forest The order given above is what Mussorgsky wanted For him the most important thing about the opera was to express the tragedy of the Russian people who are always doomed to be ruled by cruel tyrants

When Rimsky Korsakov edited the opera after Mussorgskys death he put Boriss death scene last Finishing the opera with Boriss death meant that the personal tragedy of Boris was the most important thing Certainly famous singers who sang the role of Boris such as Chaliapin liked the opera to finish with Boriss death Nowadays the opera is nearly always performed with the forest scene finishing the opera This was Mussorgskys intention It is about the tragedy of the people and this is put into words by the Simpleton who expresses the truth through his simple words

Minneapolis Saint Paul International Airport Airport codesMSPKMSPMSP is a joint civil military public use airport It is the largest and busiest airport in the five state upper Midwest region of Minnesota Iowa South Dakota North Dakota and Wisconsin

In terms of passengers Minneapolis Saint Paul International Airport is the fifteenth busiest airport in the United States in 2009 It is thirtieth busiest airport in the world in 2008 A joint civil military airport MSP is also home to the Minneapolis Saint Paul International Airport Joint Air Reserve Station supporting both Air Force Reserve Command and Air National Guard flight operations Airlines out of MinneapolisSt Paul International airport serve 134 nonstop markets including 120 domestic and 14 international markets Compared to other large metropolitan areas in the United States only the airports in Denver and Atlanta serve more non stop markets per capita 

The airport including both passenger terminal buildings is mostly located in the Census designated place of Fort Snelling in an unincorporated part of Hennepin County Small sections of the airport are within the city limits of Minneapolis The airport is across the Mississippi River from St Paul The terminal exits of the airport are minutes away from the Mall of America Flight patterns are planned so that aircraft never fly over the mall at low altitude 

It is the third largest hub airport for Delta Air Lines and Delta Connection partners Compass Airlines Mesaba Airlines and Pinnacle Airlines It also serves as the home airport for Sun Country Airlines Champion Air was based at the Minneapolis Saint Paul International Airport until the airline ceased operations in May 2008 Delta Air Lines accounts for more than 80 of the airports passenger traffic It is operated by the Metropolitan Airports Commission which also handles operation of six smaller airports in the region

The airport started when several local groups came together to take control of the former bankrupt Twin City Speedway race track giving the airport its original name Speedway Field Soon after in 1921 the airport was renamed Wold Chamberlain Field for the World War I pilots Ernest Groves Wold and Cyrus Foss Chamberlain Howard Hughes briefly stopped at Wold Chamberlain Field on his round the world flight in 1938 In 1944 the site was renamed to Minneapolis St Paul Metropolitan AirportWold Chamberlain Field with International replacing Metropolitan four years later Today it is very rare to see the Wold Chamberlain portion of the name used anywhere

MSP was the main base for Northwest Airlines starting in 1926 and became the main base of regional carrier North Central Airlines in 1952 North Central merged with Southern Airways to form Republic Airlines in 1979 Republic then merged with Northwest in 1986 The combined carrier came to control 79 of traffic at the airport and merged into Delta Air Lines in 2010

People living in South Minneapolis and its suburbs complained about aircraft noise In response Northwest Airlines and others proposed moving out of MSP and building a new airport on the fringes of the Twin Cities metro area to handle more large jets and more international traffic Minneapolis and other neighboring cities were concerned that such a move would have a negative economic impact So the Metropolitan Airports Commission outfit many homes close to the airport with sound insulation and air conditioning to reduce the noise A citizen group named ROAR started in 1998 and helped push the MAC to make these concessions Later in 2004 the MAC voted to reduce funding for the soundproofing projects stating in part that the economic climate had turned in the wake of the September 11 2001 attacks Minneapolis Mayor RT Rybak who had been a founding member of ROAR promised that the city would challenge the funding changes

The main Charles Lindbergh terminal building was built in 1962 It handles all international flights and airlines such as Delta United and others The 1970 disaster film Airport was partially filmed at MSP filling in for a fictional Lincoln airport It was followed by several sequels and was a prototype for many disaster films that followed The airport used colors as the method for naming different concourses for many years a convention that was duplicated in the movie Starting in 2000 MSP switched to lettered concourses which has become standard practice at airports around the world The color names still survive as the names for the Lindbergh Terminal parking ramp wings

The Hubert H Humphrey Terminal was built in 2001 It is used mostly for charter airlines and low cost carriers including Sun Country AirTran and Southwest

Icelandair started service to MinneapolisSt Paul from Reykjavik in 1998 Northwest operated flights from MinneapolisSt Paul to Hong Kong and Osaka in 1998 using 747 400 aircraft but were dropped in the same year Northwest also operated MinneapolisSt Paul to Oslo and Frankfurt service using DC 10 aircraft but they too were dropped From the early 1990s and to 2000s KLM operated 747 and MD 11 service from Amsterdam to MinneapolisSt Paul In part because of the DeltaKLM joint venture KLM hasnt served MinneapolisSt Paul with its own aircraft since 2003

MinneapolisSaint Paul International Airport has two terminals the Lindbergh Terminal and the much smaller Humphrey Terminal Lindbergh Terminal officially has seven concourses lettered A G with the Humphrey terminal labeled as Concourse H The Lindbergh Terminal is designated as Terminal 1 Lindbergh and the Humphrey Terminal is designated as Terminal 2 Humphrey The old Humphrey Terminal built in the late 1970s was rebuilt in 2001 to expand capacity

Like many other airports MSP interconnects with several other forms of transportation Several large parking ramps are available for cars Most other connections are made at the Hub Building and adjacent Transit Center which has city and shuttle bus taxi light rail and rental car service Two trams are at the airport One carries passengers from the main section of Lindbergh Terminal to the Hub Building and another runs along the long Concourse C in that terminal

The airport is near Fort Snelling the site of one of the earliest European settlements in the area Both the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers flow nearby Minnesota State Highway 5 provides the closest entrance to the Lindbergh Terminal just a short distance from Interstate 494 The Humphrey Terminal is accessed via the 34th Avenue exit from I 494 which runs past Fort Snelling National Cemetery Delta Air Lines has hangars arranged along I 494 and 34th Avenue so its possible to see airliners undergoing maintenance while driving past

The Hiawatha Line light rail has stops at both the Hub Building and Humphrey Terminal It connects the airport with downtown Minneapolis as well as with the Mall of America in nearby Bloomington and operates as a shuttle service between the two airport terminals Travelers can use the rail line to go between the two sites at all times it is the only part of the line that operates continuously through the night Passengers going between the two terminals may ride free of charge but those riding beyond the airport grounds must pay a standard fare Two parallel tunnels for the line run roughly 70 feet below the airport and at 17 miles in length are the longest tunnels on the route The Lindbergh Terminal station is the only one underground on the line as the rails return to the surface near Humphrey Terminal Due to current concerns about terrorism a great deal of effort went into ensuring that the tunnels are highly blast resistant The underground portion was the costliest section of the entire rail project

The airport has three airline lounges all located in the Lindbergh Terminal two Delta Air Lines Sky Clubs and one United Airlines United Club

Concourses A G are located at the Lindbergh Terminal while Concourse H is the Humphrey Terminal

The Minneapolis Saint Paul International Airport Joint Air Reserve Station at MSP is home to the 934th Airlift Wing an Air Force Reserve Command unit and the 133d Airlift Wing of the Minnesota Air National Guard Both units fly the C 130 Hercules and are operationally gained by the Air Mobility Command The 934th consists of over 1300 military personnel of which approximately 250 are full time Active Guard and Reserve and Air Reserve Technician personnel The 133rd is similarly manned making for a total military presence of over 2600 full time and part time personnel

Joint Base Anacostia Bolling is a convert905acre military installation in Southeast Washington DC On 1 October 2010 Bolling Air Force Base and the Anacostia Naval Air Station merged to implement the recommendations of the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission 

The legislation combined Naval Support Facility Anacostia and Bolling Air Force Base which were adjoining but separate military installations into a single joint base It is one of 12 joint bases formed in the country as a result of the law

Coast Guard Station Washington DC is located on the post next to the Capitol Cove Marina

The only aeronautical facility at the base is a convert100by100ft helipad The Presidents heliocopter Marine One operates from the helipad

Joint Base Anacostia Bolling is responsible for providing installation support to 17000 military civilian employees and their families 48 mission and tenant units including ceremonial units various Army Marine Corps Coast Guard Joint Service commands and other DOD and federal agencies

JBABs property has been a Department of Defense asset since 1917 From its beginning the installation has included the Army Air Corps and Navy aviation and support elements The tract of land selected for the base was scouted by William C Ocker at the direction of General Billy Mitchell The base began near Anacostia in 1918 as the only military airfield near the United States Capitol and was originally called The Flying Field at Anacostia on 2 October 1917 It was renamed Anacostia Experimental Flying Field in June 1918

Not long after its acquisition by the military the single installation evolved into two separate adjoining bases one Army and one Navy Bolling Field was officially opened 1 July 1918 and was named in honor of the first high ranking air service officer killed in World War I Colonel Raynal C Bolling Colonel Bolling was the Assistant Chief of the Air Service He was killed in action near Amiens France on 26 March 1918 while defending himself and his driver Corporal Paul L Holder from an attack by German soldiers 

In the late 1940s Bolling Fields property became Naval Air Station Anacostia and a new Air Force base named Bolling Air Force Base was constructed just to the south on 24 June 1948

Bolling AFB has served as a research and testing ground for new aviation equipment and its first mission provided aerial defense of the capital It moved to its present location along the Potomac in the citys southwest quadrant in the 1930s

Over the years Marine Corps Coast Guard and National Guard units as well as DOD and federal agencies also used the facility

Although fixed wing aircraft operations ceased the installations continued their important service to the country and the world serving in many capacities including service with the Military Airlift Command the headquarters for the Air Force District of Washington the Air Force 11th Wing Commander Naval Installations Command Naval Media Center and many other military commands and federal agencies

The Air Force District of Washington was created and activated at Bolling on 1 October 1985 with the mission of providing administrative support to Air Force members On 15 July 1994 AFDW was deactivated but was reactivated 5 January 2005 to provide a single voice for Air Force requirements in the National Capital Region according to the bases website

Bolling field units also provide ceremonial support to the White House Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Secretary of the Air Force and the Air Force Chief of Staff mainly through 11th Wing the United States Air Force Honor Guard and The United States Air Force Band

The Defense Intelligence Agency built its Defense Intelligence Analysis Center at Bolling Air Force Base on thelocation of the former runway The Agency moved many of its operations there in 1987 Bolling provides housing for families of military officers who work at other Washingon locations

Until security increased after the September 11 2001 attacks the base hosted the Air Force 5K and 10K runs which were the counterparts to the Marine Corps Marathon and the Army Ten Miler

Joint Base Andrews is a United States military facility located in Prince Georges County Maryland The facility is under the jurisdiction of the United States Air Force 11th Wing Air Force District of Washington

The base is named for Lieutenant General Frank M Andrews former Commanding General of United States Forces in the European Theater of Operations during World War II Andrews is widely known for serving as the home base of two Boeing VC 25A aircraft that serve the President of the United States

For statistical purposes the base is delineated as a census designated place by the US Census Bureau As of the 2010 census the resident population was 2973

The United States Air Force Andrews Air Force Base and the United States Navy Naval Air Facility Washington merged on 1 October 2009 to form this base The merger follows the recommendations of the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission The legislation ordered the consolidation of the facilities which were adjoining but separate military installations into a single joint base one of 12 joint bases formed in the United States as a result of the law

The host unit at Andrews is the 11th Wing assigned to the Air Force District of Washington A non flying wing the 11 WG is responsible for maintaining emergency reaction rotary wing airlift and other National Capital Region contingency response capabilities critical to national security and for organizing training equipping and deploying combat ready forces for Air and Space Expeditionary Forces The 11th WG commander is Colonel Kenneth R Rizer The Command Chief Master Sergeant is Chief Master Sergeant Anthony Brinkley

The following units are based at Andrews

Opened on 2 May 1943 the base was originally known as Camp Springs Army Air Base It was renamed to Andrews Field on 7 February 1945 in honor of Lt General Frank Maxwell Andrews General Andrews organized and commanded the General Headquarters Air Force and at the time of his death on 3 May 1943 in the crash of a B 24 Liberator in Iceland he was Commanding General United States Forces European Theater of Operations

The military history of Andrews AFB began in the 1860s during the Civil War when Union troops occupied a small country church near Camp Springs Maryland as sleeping quarters At present the same church is used on the base and is known as Chapel Two

Established first as Camp Springs Army Air Field Andrews history began 25 August 1941 the day President Franklin D Roosevelt wrote a letter to the secretary of war directing the use of the land on which the base now stands Located 10 miles southeast of Washington DC in Prince Georges County Md the base was under construction during the remainder of 1942 and became operational 2 May 1943 with the arrival of the first Republic P 47 Thunderbolt

By 1943 the airport had four convert5500ft runways The field then served mainly as Army Air Forces Headquarters base with secondary missions for fighter and bomber training It was a B 25 Mitchell medium bomber training base during the Korean War HQ Air Research and Development Command moved to Andrews from Baltimore on 24 June 1958 With the construction of new facilities beginning in 1959 Andrews had become by early 1962 the primary USAF flight installation serving the Washington DC area with the closing of the runway at Bolling AFB

When the United States Air Force became a separate military service on 18 September 1947 the base name changed to Andrews AFB It served mostly as a headquarters base in a curtailed operational capacity during the post World War II years the Continental Air Command Strategic Air Command and the Military Air Transport Service have been headquartered here Headquarters Command held command reins at Andrews from 1947 through 1952 and again after 1957 Headquarters Military Air Transport Service controlled the base during the interim period

In the late 1950s Andrews began an annual open house and air show on base This event later evolved into the Department of Defense Joint Services Open House an annual event that now brings more than 700000 visitors to the base every year The open house is held every year over Armed Forces Day weekend

In the years since 1959 Andrews flight operations and importance have increased greatly In 1961 the last of the Military Air Transport Services flying units at Washington National Airport transferred to Andrews This was followed a year later by the transfer to Andrews of all fixed wing flying activities from Bolling Air Force Base Andrews has become firmly established as the main port of entry for foreign military and government officials flying to Washington and the United States In July 1961 the official presidential aircraft was stationed here known as Air Force One when the president is on board Before 1961 the presidential airplane had been kept at Washington National Airport and Bolling AFB

In 1963 the Naval Air Facility originally established at the former NAS Anacostia in 1919 moved to Andrews The NAF handles Naval VIP flight operations The Marine Corps detachment that flies the FA 18 Hornet is located here Coast Guard Air Station Washington DC occupies space at Andrews AFB Andrews AFB has evolved to become one of the most modern bases in the Air Force

A tragic time for Andrews AFB occurred on 22 November 1963 when the 35th president of the United States was assassinated in Dallas Texas The body of John F Kennedy arrived at Andrews at 608 pm the same evening accompanied by his widow Jacqueline B Kennedy newly sworn in President Lyndon B Johnson and his wife Ladybird The air terminal was jammed with thousands of people including the largest gathering of news media representatives ever assembled at any time on Andrews AFB Since that time Andrews has seen the arrival of other fallen leaders but no other death has caused such national attention

In a major reorganization Headquarters Command US Air Force was disbanded 1 July 1976 restructured under the Military Airlift Command as the 76th Airlift Division and transferred its headquarters from Bolling AFB to Andrews The 76th remained the parent unit of the Andrews host command redesignated as the 1st Air Base Wing

In October 1977 the 76th Airlift Division became the 76th Military Airlift Wing The 1st Air Base Wing was redesignated the 76th Air Base Group and the 89th Military Airlift Wing became the 89th Military Airlift Group The 76th MAW remained the parent unit at Andrews On 15 December 1980 the 76th Airlift Division was reestablished the 76th Air Base Group became the 1776th Air Base Wing and the 89th Military Airlift Group became the 89th Military Airlift Wing On 1 October 1985 the 76th Airlift Division was inactivated as the result of activation of the Headquarters Air Force District of Washington at Bolling AFB The 1776th Air Base Wing was designated the host wing for Andrews AFB and assumed base support responsibilities

During Operation Desert Storm Andrews handled 16540 patients in makeshift hospital facilities located in the base tennis center

On 12 July 1991 the 89th Military Airlift Wing was redesignated as the 89th Airlift Wing and assumed duties as the host wing at Andrews AFB Support functions previously performed by the 1776th Air Base Wing now fall under the 89th and the 1776th was inactivated With the consolidation of the two wings the newly formed 89th Airlift Wing is one of the largest wings in Air Mobility Command with a work force approaching 9000 people

Known as The Presidents Wing the 89th Airlift Wing continues to contribute to Andrews rich history as the elite Air Mobility Command wing for transporting VIPs around the world Not only does Andrews provide service for Americas senior officials but also kings queens presidents prime ministers popes and local and foreign military leaders make Andrews AFB their first stop in the United States

On 5 January 2005 the Air Force reactivated the Air Force District of Washington as the single Air Force voice for planning and implementing Air Force and joint solutions within the National Capital Region This event brought with it significant changes at Andrews On 12 May 2006 the 89th Medical Group at Andrews and the 11th Medical Group Bolling Air Force Base Washington DC combined into the 79th Medical Wing where it established its headquarters at Andrews In June 2006 the 316th Wing stood up under the command of AFDW as the new host unit for Andrews Air Force Base and its nearly 50 tenant units to include organizations from the US Army the Air Force Reserve Command Air National Guard Navy Reserve Marine Corps Reserve and the Civil Air Patrol The activation of the 316th prompted the transfer of the 1st Helicopter Squadron from the 89th Airlift Wing to the 316th Operations Group Finally in May 2007 the AFDW as well as the 844th Communications Group transferred from Bolling AFB to Andrews AFB

On 1 October 2010 following the recommendations of Base Realignment and Closure 2005 the Air Force completed the merge of the 11th Wing and the 316th at Joint Base Andrews The 11th Wing became the host base organization for Joint Base Andrews

Dallas Love Field Airport codesDALKDALDAL is a city owned public use airport 6 miles northwest of the central business district of Dallas Texas United States

Love Field was Dallas primary scheduled airline service facility until 1974 when DallasFort Worth International Airport opened

As of December 2011 Love Field is served by Southwest Airlines Continental Express and American AirlinesAmerican Eagle Southwest Airlines maintains its corporate headquarters at Love Field and Dallas is a major focus city for the airline Also seven full service fixed base operators at Love Field provide general aviation services including fuel maintenance hangar rentals and charters Some also provide executive class amenities such as meeting rooms car rentals limousine service and restaurants

Love Field was opened as an Army flying field on October 19 1917 constructed just southeast of Bachman Lake It was named after First Lieutenant Moss Lee Love who died in an airplane crash in San Diego California Love Field was opened to civilian use in 1927 when the city of Dallas purchased the land National Air Transport started the first passenger service

On April 9 1932 the first paved runways at the airfield were completed

The airport was used by the United States Army Air Forces used the airport for flying training During World War II The Dallas Texas Aviation School providing basic flight training equipped with Fairchild PT 19s as the primary trainer used The school at Love Field lso had several PT 17 Stearmans and a few P 40 Warhawks assigned Love Field was also used as a sub depot of the San Antonio Air Service Command for aircraft overhauls  Air Force facilities were closed at the end of the war in August 1945

In September 1943 construction was completed on a new north south runway and northwest southeast runway On March 9 1947 Love Fields Lemmon Avenue Terminal Building opened on the east side of the airfield The city adopted an amended Master Plan for Love Field in 1948 guiding future expansion

On November 29 1949 American Airlines Flight 157 a Douglas DC 6 en route from New York City to Mexico City with 46 passengers and crew slid off Runway 36 after the flight crew lost control on final approach to Love Field for a routine stopover The airliner struck a parked airplane a hangar and a flight school before crashing into a business across from the airporttagrefThe crash occurred in the neighborhood northwest of Love Field and southeast of Bachman Lake many of the buildings and streets in this area were later removed to accommodate Runway 13R31LgroupN killing 28 This was the deadliest air disaster in Texas history at the time and according to modern reference sources remains the deadliest crash to take place at the airfield itself

Pioneer Airlines moved its base from Houston to Love Field in 1950

On March 26 1952 work was completed to extend Runway 1331tagrefRunway 1331 was renamed Runway 13L31R after the 1965 completion of the parallel Runway 13R31LgroupN to its current length of 7752 ft Soon afterwards on June 1 1954 the eastwest crosswind Runway 725 was permanently closed it was later removed to accommodate new terminal construction This left Love Field with only two runways Runway 1331 the longer primary runway and the shorter Runway 1836

Love Fields new terminal building was dedicated on October 20 1957 and opened to airline service on January 20 1958 The complex opened with three one story concourses equipped with 26 ramp level gates and connected to the terminal by the worlds first airport moving walkways Airlines serving the airport at the time included American Braniff Central Continental Delta and Trans Texas

Jet powered operations began on April 1 1959 when Continental Airlines introduced the Vickers Viscount turboprop Turbojet operations began on July 12 1959 when American Airlines initiated Boeing 707 flights to New York

The 1960s brought tremendous growth to Love Field In 1961 Mr and Mrs Earle Wyatt made a gift of a large bronze statue bearing the inscription One Riot One Ranger for display in the airports new terminal Famed Texas born sculptress Waldine Tauch created the piece The inscription refers to an incident in which a single Texas Ranger was dispatched to quell a riot Beginning October 2010 the One Riot One Ranger statue is temporarily moved for display to the nearby Frontiers of Flight Museum until completion of the first phase of airport terminal renovation in early 2013 

On November 22 1963 President John F Kennedy arrived at Love Field on board Air Force One and was assassinated in Dealey Plaza while his motorcade was traveling from Love Field to the Dallas Trade Mart Hours later Lyndon B Johnson was sworn in as president aboard Air Force One before its departure from Love Field

On April 2 1965 the 8800 ft long parallel Runway 13R31L was opened to relieve traffic on congested Runway 1331 People tried to stop the new runway because it was close to schools and had minimal safety areas It would increase jet noise and would remove homes and businesses adjacent to the airport to accommodate the project The runway was built anyway

Several terminal expansion programs responded to increases in air travel during the 1960s American Airlines expanded its concourse in 1968 In the same year Braniff opened its Terminal of the Future The expansion showcasing Alexander Girard Herman Miller and Ray and Charles Eames designs featured the first rotunda concourse jet bridges and several airport innovations Braniff connected their new terminal to new remote parking lots with the Jetrail monorail system in 1970 Texas International expanded its concourse in 1969 and Deltas concourse was expanded in 1970

In 1972 Love Field was the site of a notable hijacking incident On 12 January Billy Gene Hurst Jr a resident of Houston Texas hijacked Braniff Flight 38 a Boeing 727 airliner as it departed William P Hobby Airport in Houston bound for Dallas After the plane landed at Love Field Hurst allowed all 94 passengers to deplane but continued to hold the 7 crewmembers hostage Hurst insisted on flying to South America and made a variety of other demands including food cigarettes parachutes jungle survival gear US 2 million and a handgun After a 6 hour standoff police gave Hurst a package containing parachutes and some other items and the hostages escaped while he was distracted examining the packages contents Police officers stormed the craft soon afterwards and arrested him without serious incident He was later sentenced to 20 years in prison

With the need for a larger airport the cities of Dallas and Fort Worth agreed to build DallasFort Worth Regional Airport It was agreed that to protect the new airport each city would restrict its own passenger service airports from air carrier operations

Southwest Airlines started in 1971 Its main office was at Love Field Southwest built its business on selling quick no frills trips between Dallas Houston and San Antonio The company felt that the notion of a quick trip would be destroyed by a long drive to the new large airport outside of the city Prior to the opening of DFW Southwest Airlines sued for the right to remain at Love FieldCitation neededdateMay 2009

In 1973 the courts ruled that the City of Dallas could not restrict Southwest Airlines from operating out of Love Field so long as it remained open as an airport This ruling effectively granted Southwest the right to continue to operate its existing intrastate service out of Love Field The airlines operating from Love Field at the time DFW was conceived executed agreements with DFW stipulating that no airline could operate at the new airport if it continued to operate any flights out of Love Field Southwest was created after the other carriers had signed on to the DFW operating agreements Southwest had not signed the promise to abandon Love Field So it remained as the only airline operating at Love Field after DFW opened

Prior to completion of DFW regularly scheduled service from Love Field included New York Chicago Los Angeles San Francisco Philadelphia Baltimore Phoenix Washington Nashville Oklahoma City Tulsa Cleveland San Antonio El Paso and Mexico City Atlanta New Orleans Orlando Shreveport Birmingham Jackson Los Angeles and San Francisco Chicago Denver Kansas City Minneapolis St Paul New York Washington Houston Austin Lubbock Amarillo Oklahoma City Tulsa San Antonio and Mexico City Midland Odessa Lubbock Amarillo Albuquerque and El Paso New Orleans Tampa and Miami Trans Texas Airways provided service to Beaumont Pt Arthur Texarkana Houston San Antonio Laredo Big Spring Austin Abilene Wichita Falls and Amarillo among other locales

1973 saw Love Field which contained more than 70 gates and saw frequent Boeing 747 service reach record enplanements at 6668398 as the eighth busiest airport in the United States On January 13 1974 DFW Airport officially opened ending most passenger service at Love Field

With the drastic reduction in flights and only 467212 enplanements in 1975 Love Field decommissioned several of its concourses The city of Dallas attempted to make use of these dormant facilities by leasing some of them to an entrepreneur who opened the Llove Entertainment Complex in November 1975 The main lobby at the front of a former terminal was transformed into movie theaters ice rink roller rink huge video arcades restaurants and bowling alley Llove seemed especially suited for the pre teen and teen crowd who could spend the day for a single admission charge of about 350 Llove closed in May 1978Citation neededdateMay 2009 Several of the concourses were remodeled into support and training buildings for Southwest Airlines

After deregulation of the US airline industry in 1978 Southwest Airlines was able to enter the larger passenger markets and announced plans to start providing interstate service in 1979 This angered the City of Fort Worth and DFW International Airport which resented expanded air service at Love Field Therefore Fort Worth based US Representative Jim Wright helped get a compromise law through Congress that restricted air service at Love Field Using the pretext of protecting DFW the Wright Amendment restricted passenger air traffic out of Love Field in the following ways Passenger service on regular mid sized and large aircraft could only be provided from Love Field to locations within Texas and the four neighboring states Long haul service to other states was possible but only on commuter aircraft with no more capacity than 56 passengers

While the Wright Amendment prevented any other major airlines from starting service out of Love Field it did not deter Southwest Based on short trips to begin with Southwest continued to grow as it used multiple shorthaul flights to build its Love Field operation Some people managed to work the system and get around the Wright Amendments restrictions For example a person could fly from Dallas to Houston or Albuquerque change planes and then fly to any city Southwest served although he or she had at the time to do so on two tickets in each direction since the Wright Amendment specifically barred airlines from issuing tickets that violated the laws provisions This work around was also problematic because flyers could not check baggage to the final destination city Passengers had to collect checked baggage at the end of the first flight and checked onto the next flight This had the effect of creating mini hubs at HoustonHobby Airport and the Albuquerque International Sunport Southwest continued to grow and became one of the most successful and profitable airlines in the United StatesCitation neededdateMay 2009

Due to the success of Southwest Airlines other airlines wanted to use Love Field for short haul trips Southwest co founder Lamar Muse started Muse Air a short haul competitor using DC 9s and MD 80s between Love Field and Houston in 1982 Muse Air was unable to operate profitably against Southwest at Love Field and was purchased by Southwest in 1985 and renamed TranStar Airlines Southwest ceased TranStar operations in 1987 Continental Airlines expressed its intent to fly out of Love Field in 1985 which led to years of court battles over the interpretation of the Wright Amendment as Fort Worth and DFW continued to try to prevent expansion at Love Field Seeing the benefit of increased air traffic at Love Field the City of Dallas began to actively lobby for the repeal of the Wright Amendment restrictions in 1992 In 1997 the Shelby Amendment successfully passed through Congress which changed the Wright Amendment A compromise of sorts the Shelby Amendment allowed Love Field flights to three more states Kansas Mississippi and Alabama In addition it amended the definition of 56 passenger jets that could fly to other states to include any aircraft weighing less than 300000 pounds which has been reconfigured to accommodate 56 or fewer passengers

The passage of the Shelby Amendment caused several airlines to consider flying 56 passenger jets out of Love Field including Continental Delta and a new airline Legend The City of Fort Worth immediately sued the City of Dallas to try to prevent the Shelby Amendment from going into effect American headquartered at DFW joined the lawsuits against Dallas but also said that if other airlines were allowed to fly out of Love Field it would have no choice but to offer competing service In 1998 after a year of legal decisions and appeals Continental Express became the first major airline other than Southwest to fly out of Love Field since 1974 American began service out of Love Field shortly thereafter but continued to sue to stop the service Fort Worth and American Airlines eventually sued the DOT to stop allowing more flights out of Love Field

In 2000 several federal appeals court decisions finally rejected all lawsuits against the Shelby Amendment Fort Worth and American Airlines appealed to the US Supreme Court which refused to review the case These legal decisions opened the door to increased long haul flights out of Love Field using 56 passenger jets including new service by Delta and Legend The majority of this 56 passenger jet market was composed of business travelers making day trips to other cities

In 2001 the September 11 2001 attacks and the subsequent recession greatly reduced the demand for air travel in the US especially within the business traveler market As a result most of the airlines providing long haul 56 passenger flights stopped service and pulled out of Love Field By 2003 Southwest and Continental Express were the only two major commercial airlines operating out of Love Field However due to Southwests success and the possibility of other airlines returning in the future the airport has completed an expansion of its parking facilities and is redeveloping one of its terminals

A 2400 space garage opened in 2002 and 2003 connected to the terminal with a climate controlled walkway The East Concourse formerly Braniffs Terminal of the Future was demolished as part of the Love Field Master Plan

Love Field celebrated 85 years in the aviation industry in 2002 and was designated as a Texas State Historical Site in 2003

The Frontiers of Flight Museum which had been located inside the airport terminal since 1988 moved to the north side of the airport in a separate facility

In November 2004 at a breakfast sponsored by the North Dallas Chamber of Commerce Southwest announced their active opposition to the Wright Amendment claiming that the law is anti competitive and outdated On November 30 2005 Missouri was added to the list of states exempted from the Wright Amendment by an amendment written by Sen Kit Bond Southwest began nonstop flights to Kansas City and St Louis on December 13 American Airlines and American Eagle began flights from Love to St Louis Kansas City Austin and San Antonio on March 2 2006 although American Airlines subsequently pulled out of the market leaving American Eagle to offer a reduced service to Austin and Kansas City alone In 2008 American decided to terminate the Austin and Kansas City service and replace it with service to OHare International Airport using 50 passenger regional jets in compliance with the Wright provisions regarding aircraft size although American Eagle recently stopped service from Love field altogether

On June 15 2006 it was announced that American Airlines Southwest Airlines Dallas Fort Worth International Airport and the cities of Dallas and Fort Worth had all agreed to seek full repeal of the Wright Amendment with several conditions Among them the ban on nonstop flights outside the Wright zone would stay in place until 2014 through ticketing to domestic airports would be allowed immediately Love Fields maximum gate capacity would be lowered from 32 to 20 gates and Love Field would handle only domestic flights non stop Southwest will be able to operate from 16 gates American 2 gates and Continental 2 gates JetBlue and Northwest Airlines have claimed that the gate cap will effectively bar any airlines not named in the compromise to ever operate from Love Field even though the agreement calls for Southwest American and Continental to share gates with new airlines that desire to serve the airport The cap of 20 gates would effectively restrict the purpose of the 2014 lifting of the ban on nonstop flights outside the Wright zone

After extensive negotiations with the House and Senate Judiciary Committees the compromise bill passed both Houses of Congress on Friday September 29 just before the 109th Congress adjourned for the November elections Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison led the effort to pass the bill in the Senate while Rep Kay Granger led a bipartisan Texas House coalition to see the bill through to a successful conclusion in the House President George W Bush signed the bill into law on October 13 2006 Southwest and American airlines then required approval from the Federal Aviation Administration to begin one stop flights from Love Field to destinations outside the Wright limits

On October 17 2006 Southwest Airlines announced that it would begin one stop or connecting service between Love Field and 25 destinations outside the Wright zone on October 19 2006 American Airlines made travel between Love Field and locations outside the Wright zone available by October 18 2006

In 2008 the airport handled 8060792 passengers

The airport became embroiled in a controversy over concessions contracts when Dallas mayor Tom Leppert during a March 3 2010 City Council meeting abruptly withdrew support for no bid contracts with current airport food vendor Star Concessions Ltd and newspaper and book vendor Hudson Retail Dallas insisting that the contracts should be opened to public bidding instead At a February 22 2010 meeting the City Council recommended that the existing contracts set to expire in June 2011 be extended until 2026 with an additional three year option and exclusive rights to 54 percent of vending space in a new terminal scheduled to open in 2014 After several abortive attempts to resolve the issue the City Council voted on August 18 2010 to open all concessions space in the new terminal for public bidding city staff would attempt to reach a deal with Star and Hudson to operate existing concessions space from 2011 to 2014 otherwise it would also be opened for public bidding

At 325 PM on August 19 2010 an hour long police chase ended at Love Field when Dallas police vehicles rammed a truck driven by carjacking suspect Michael Browne who had driven through an airport perimeter fence and onto an active runway in an attempt to evade pursuing officers Flight operations were briefly disrupted but no aircraft were directly endangered Transportation Security Administration officials announced that a review of airport security measures would be conducted due to the incident

In early 2009 a plan to modernize Love Field was announced The 519 million master plan will replace the existing terminals with a new 20 gate concourse and expanded baggage facilities The project is scheduled to open when the last of the Wright amendment restrictions end in 2014 The project also calls for a 250 million people mover system to connect to Dallas Area Rapid Transits Burbank Station

Love Fields passenger terminals have 19 gates divided into two terminals 1 and 2 Southwests Terminal 2 has 15 gates 1 1A12 14 15 while Terminal 1 has four gates 2932

The terminal was built by Legend Airlines and was later used by Legend Airlines and Delta ConnectionAtlantic Southeast Airlines Under the terms of lifting the Wright Amendment the number of gates at the airport is limited thus effectively precluding use of the terminal for scheduled passenger flights The gates of the former terminal were demolished and the remaining structure converted into a US Customs and Border Protection facility

Currently DART buses 39 and 539 serve the airport

The Green Line light rail serves the airport at InwoodLove Field Station opened in 2010 When terminal reconstruction is complete a people mover system will directly link the terminal to DARTs Burbank Station

Boris came from a boyar family His parents were dead and he was brought up at the court of the Tsar in Moscow The Tsar who ruled was Ivan IV known as Ivan the Terrible who really was a very cruel ruler He ruled for more than 50 years Boris was very close to the royal family One of the Tsars sons Fyodor who was not very intelligent He married Irina the sister of Boris The Tsar killed his eldest son When the Tsar died he had a son Dmitry who was only two years old Dmitri was not allowed to become tsar because he was the son of Ivans 7th marriage and the rules of the Russian Orthodox Church were that no one should be allowed to marry more than three times So Fyodor became Tsar Fyodor I He was not bright enough to rule himself We would probably say that he was mentally disabled or that he had learning difficulties  Boris therefore became regent he ruled for him Some boyars were against Boris but Boris somehow managed to silence them In some ways Boris did a good job He made Russia a safer place fighting back the Tatars in the south and making strong contacts with Europe He built towns and fortresses made sure that Western Siberia was firmly under Moscows control and made the head of the Muscovite Church a patriarch In 1598 Fyodor died and Irina should have become Tsarina but she refused and went to live in a convent The boyars voted for Boris to become Tsar

At first everything went well but in 1601 1603 the harvest was bad and many poor people starved The people became angry with the Tsar because he had made very strict rules which took away the rights of the serfs There were still several royal families in Russia They started to plot against Boris because they saw him as a threat to themselves Boris got lots of spies to watch these families He accused the families of treason and sent some of them to Siberia or to monasteries in the north or Russia One of these families were the Romanovs who were later to produce a long line of tsars

While this crisis was happening a young man called Grigory Otrepev arrived He was a pretender He said that he was Dmitry Ivans youngest son who had been murdered in 1591 At the time people had said that it was an accident caused by the boys epilepsy But some people thought that Boris had murdered him so that he himself could become Tsar The pretender said that he had actually escaped from the people who were trying to murder him The pretender got lots of people on his side including Poles and Cossacks He marched towards Moscow Boriss armies tried to stop them but then Boris died suddenly Dmitri was able to march into Moscow and claim the throne

A period of chaos followed in Russia with many deaths and changes of rulers This lasted until Micael Romanov was chosen as Tsar in 1613

It is now thought that the Romanov family made up evidence to make things looks as if Boris Godunov had been guilty of the murder of Ivans son Karamzin who later wrote a history of Russia made it look as if this were true When Pushkin wrote his play Boris Godunov he followed Karamzins version of the story and this is also the story as told in Mussorgskys opera Boris Godunov

Iced tea is cold tea usually served in a glass with ice

Walter Walt Whitman was an American poet essayist and journalist

A boyar was a member of the ruling nobility in medieval Russia and some other Slavic countries such as Bulgaria The boyars held the most important jobs in the army They met in a group called the duma and gave advice to the ruling prince or in later times the tsar In the 13th and 14th centuries they were rich landowners who could advise the prince but they were free to go and work for another prince if they wanted to

In Moscow from the 15th to the 17th centuries they were a closely bonded aristocracy There were about 200 boyar families Their ancestors were former princes or Moscow boyar families or foreign aristocrats They were not nobility in the European sense Many of them had bad manners and not many of them could read They did not travel and they were suspicious of anything foreign

Altitude or height has means different things based on how it is used Common uses include aviation geometry geographical survey and sports As a general definition altitude is a distance measurement It is usually in the vertical or up direction It is the difference between a set point and a point or object The reference datum also changed depending on how the term altitiude is being used Altitude is commonly used to mean the height above sea level of a location but the term elevation is used more often

Vertical distance measurements in the down direction are commonly referred to as depth

In aviation the term altitude can have several meanings Aviation altitude is measured using either Mean Sea or local ground level as the reference

Airplanes usually use air pressure to know what their altitude is The instrument for measuring altitude is the pressure altimeter It is an aneroid barometer with a front face showing distance instead of atmospheric pressure

There are several types of aviation altitude

In simple terms these types of altitude can be explained as ways of measuring the altitude

In fuller definitions

The Earths atmosphere is divided into several altitude regions

Regions on the surface of the Earth or in its atmosphere that are high above mean sea level are said to be high altitude High altitude is often said to begin at convert8000ftmdispflip above sea level

At high altitude atmospheric pressure is lower than that at sea level This is because of two effects These effect s are gravity and the heat in the air Gravity makes the air to be as close as possible to the ground The amount of heat in the air makes the molecules move quickly This causes the air to expand

As the the air expands it rises to where the air pressure is less As it rises it begins to cool Because of this high altitude air is cold This causes an alpine climate This climate affects the ecology at high altitude

Altitudes above convert1500mft start to affect humans Humans cannot live in very high altitudes above convert5500 6000mft As altitude increases atmospheric pressure decreases This affects humans because there is less oxygen to breathe The low amount of oxygen above convert8000ftmdispflip can cause illnesses such as altitude sickness High altitude pulmonary edema and High altitude cerebral edema 

The human body can deal with high altitude by breathing faster having a higher heart rate and changing its blood chemistry This can take days or weeks to happen Above convert8000mft 3 the human body cannot make the needed changes and will die

People living at higher elevations have a higher rate of suicide The cause for this is not known so far

In the airline industry a focus city is an airport that is not a hub but from which the airline has non stop flights to several destinations other than its hubs Other terms with equivalent meaning are minor hub mini hub hublet key city or base 

Compared to a hub operation flights from focus cities are often less frequent served by smaller regional aircraft and cater more to origin and destination traffic instead of connecting traffic Connections are often available by default however due to the number of destinations and frequencies served by a single operator 

The term focus city is somewhat of a misnomer since it generally refers to an airport rather than a city For example US Airways has focus city operations at Washington National Airport in Arlington Virginia Focus city airports also may retain characteristics of hubs  for example the airline may have aircraft maintenance or repair facilities there or operate cargo handling facilities

Focus cities are also commonly used by low cost carriers that primarily fly point to point and thus do not have large concentrations of hub operations such as Southwest Airlines Spirit Airlines JetBlue Airways Allegiant Air and WestJet in the Americas and Ryanair EasyJet Norwegian Air Shuttle and Wizz Air in Europe

Gay and Lesbian Employees at Microsoft is a group of gay lesbian bisexual and transgender employees at Microsoft GLEAM originated as a private mailing list during the 1980s Members of the list successfully campaigned for sexual orientation to be added to Microsofts anti discrimination policy in 1989 In 1997 group leaders would point out that anti gay actions occurred but overt bias is extremely rareDead linkdateNovember 2010 

GLEAM also lobbied for Microsoft to offer insurance and other benefits to same sex domestic partners Lobbying intensified after Lotus software offered these benefits to its workers Microsoft added this benefit in 1993 

GLEAM became more formally organized in 1993 under Microsofts Diversity Advisory Council along with Blacks At Microsoft the womens group Hoppers and similar groups

GLEAM also pushed to secure Microsofts support of gay rights legislation in Washington state During legislative hearings on Washingtons HB 1515 bill which would extend the states current anti discrimination laws to people with alternate sexual orientations two Microsoft employees testified as private citizens on behalf of the legislation A conservative religious group took this to mean Microsoft was actively supporting the legislation as an organization and demanded the company reverse its support

In an April 22 2005 e mail company CEO Steve Ballmer explained to Microsoft employees that earlier in the year the company had decided to focus its lobbying efforts on issues more directly related to its core business In the same e mail he affirmed the companys commitment to diversity and encouraged individual shareholders to get involved in the issue but said that no one on either side should represent themselves as speaking for the company

In response seven days later the GLEAM board of directors sent an e mail that proposed with specific timelines various steps that Microsoft should take in order to repair its public image and the lack of trust created by the Ballmer e mail on April 22 Among the proposals was that Microsoft should acknowledge its neutral position was a mistake and partner with GLEAM as subject matter experts in reaching out to the LGBT community beginning with a sixty day intense outreach period Meanwhile a petition of employees asking Microsoft to support the bill topped 1700 signaturesFactdateNovember 2010 

The bill was passed in the subsequent legislative session under the leadership of openly gay legislator Rep Ed Murray of the 43rd legislative district and after the defection of Republican State Senator Bill Finkbeiner who subsequently retired and whose seat was captured by Democrat and Microsoft alumnus Eric Oemig During the 2006 elections voters of the 43rd legislative district also elevated Rep Ed Murray to the Washington State Senate

Overclocking is the process of configuring a computer processor or other electronic circuit to run faster than it was designed to Overclocking allows a computer to be faster and more responsive Overclocked processors tend to use more electricity and make more heat than those running at their intended speed It is often necessary to install a better heat sink to avoid overheating the processor If a processor is overclocked too high it can damage the processor or make the computer unstable Increasing the voltage to the processor can allow it to be run at even higher speeds where it would otherwise be unstable but this carries an especially high risk of damaging the processor Overclocking is usually done in the computers BIOS setup utility Most brand name computers such as Dell HP and others do not allow overclocking in the BIOS setup utility but custom built computers usually do It is also possible to do the opposite called underclocking where the processor is run at a lower speed than intended This may be done to extend battery life and reduce heat output Underclocking will not usually damage a processor Some processors automatically underclock themselves when the computer isnt doing a lot of work

Many other digital circuits with a clock signal can be overclocked This includes video cards smartphones and even graphing calculators Overclocking has become popular with Android users

The vowels in Interlingua are pronounced like in Spanish or LFN The consonants are pronounced for the most part like in English or LFN

Interlingua keeps much of the spelling of Latin words more near to the forms in English and French than to them in the other Romance languages For example it keeps q y ch ph rh and th It keeps also the common use of double consonants More it allows versions like ch for s between vowels like z c before ei like ts g before ei like qu before ei like k etc

Accent is not indicated even in exceptions but it follows for the most part a system of similar rules to that of LFN

Interlingua has also a collateral spelling that simplifies the complications above to a system more like this of LFN This collateral spelling has the same status but in reality it is not much used by adherents The details

The plural is s after a vowel es after a consonant but hes after final c

Transponder timing is a way of measuring performance in sport events A radio frequency identification transponder is attached to the athlete The transponder emits a unique code Radio receivers at the strategic points in an event detect and record the code

Prior to the use of this technology races were either timed by hand or using video camera systems

Generically there are two types of transponder timing systems active and passive An active transponder consists of a battery powered transceiver connected to the athlete that emits its unique code when it is interrogated 

A passive transponder does not contain a power source inside the transponder Instead the transponder captures electromagnetic energy produced by a near by exciter and utilizes that energy to emit its unique code 

In both systems an antenna is placed at the start finish and in some cases intermediate time points and is connected to a decoder This decoder identifies the unique transponder code and calculates the exact time when the transponder passes a timing point Some implementations of timing systems require the use of a mat on the ground at the timing points Other systems use vertically oriented portals 

The first manufacture to introduce transponder timing was AMB Identification Timing although it was in motorized racing Since 1983 AMB active transponders are used in several motorized sports ranging from RC model car racing high speed car racing motocross motor cycle racing kart racing to snow cross Since 1992 AMB transponders are also used in non motorized sports such as cycling marathon horse racing and triathlon

Older systems used transponders attached to a runners shoe Now disposable transponders are attached to the back of a runners race number or to a bicycle helmet Such changes reflect the greater directional control and power of the reading antennas

As events draw very large numbers of participants there are delays in participants reaching the start line which penalize their performance Some races place antennas or timing mats at both the start line and the finish line which allow the exact net time to be calculated A controversy has developed as to whether awards in a race should be based on the gun time or net time The IAAF and USA Track and Field rules have decided that performance is based on gun time However some races use net time for presenting age group awards

When transponder timing was first introduced the running community hoped for a universal standard so that timing systems could operated interchangeably with no overlap in chip serial numbers However race management companies have invested in incompatible systems and individual runners who purchase a chip from one manufacturer find that the chip is not operable in races that use a competitors equipment The market share of the different incompatible transponder systems vary in each local market depending upon which system was adopted by the local clubs or timing companies

As the cost of transponder tags have declined the use of disposable tags has become more popular The technology is the same as a reusable tag but the race does not bother to collect and recycle the tags at the finish line One manufacturer has developed a tag which is taped to a Tyvek strip without a permanent glass or plastic form factor The strip is then formed as a loop and laced to the running shoe Another manufacturer has developed a tag that is taped to the runners race number This has the added feature of increased accuracy in being recorded as the participants torso crosses the finish line as opposed to the lead or trail foot which sometimes leads to incorrect place results

The Neolithic British Isles is about the history of the group of islands off the north west of Europe from about 4000 BC to 2500 BC The islands are those of Britain Ireland Isle of Man Lewis Orkney and Shetland and several hundred other islandsp37 This was the last part of the Stone Age in the British Isles

Before the Neolithic period was the Mesolithic period and after the Neolithic was the Bronze Age During the Mesolithic the inhabitants of the British Isles were nomadic hunter gatherers Around 4000 BE new ideas arrived in the islands from continental Europe These ideas were taken up by the natives and led to huge changes in both the society and the landscape This has been called the Neolithic Revolution 

The Neolithic is marked by agriculture and living in settlements with the hunter gatherer lifestyle declining To make room for the new farmland these early agricultural communities cut down trees across the islands This very greatly changed the landscape At the same time many new types of stone tools began to be produced They needed new skills such as polishing

The Neolithic tribes built many monuments in the landscape many of which were megalithic in nature The earliest of these are the chambered tombs although later came the building of stone circles a trend that would continue into the following Bronze Age These constructions were probably places for ceremonies and religious rites New ideas about religion ritual and social hierarchy came with the new lifestyle 

Neolithic people on these islands were not literate so left no written record Everything we know about this time comes from archaeological investigations This investigation began with the antiquarians of the 18th century and intensified in the 19th when John Lubbock coined the term Neolithic The work expanded during the 20th and 21st centuries

During the Mesolithic Britain was still attached by the landmass of Doggerland to the rest of continental Europe Archaeologist and prehistorian Caroline Malone noted that during the Late Mesolithic the British Isles were something of a technological backwater in European terms still living as a hunter gatherer society whilst most of southern Europe had already taken up agriculture and sedentary livingp11

The first societies in the world to abandon hunter gathering and replace it with agriculture were found in the Near East around 8000 6000 BCE Similar developments occurred independently in China and later in Mesoamerica southeast Asia Africa and Indiap18 It was in the Near East that the most important developments in early farming occurred in the Levant and the mountains surrounding what is now Syria Israel Jordan Turkey Iran and Iraq These areas already had rich ecological variation that was being exploited by hunter gatherers in the Upper Palaeolithic and Mesolithic periodsp20 

Early signs of these hunter gatherers beginning to harvest select and grow various food plants have been found in the Mesolithic Natufian culture of the Levant These are signs that would later lead to the actual domestication and farming of crops Archaeologists believe that the Levantine peoples developed agriculture between 8000 and 7000 BCE in response to a rise in their population levels which could not be fed by the food which hunting and gathering could providep20 The idea of agriculture spread from the Levant into Europe being adopted by hunter gathering societies in what is now Turkey Greece the Balkans and across the Mediterranean eventually reaching north western Europe and the British Islesp22

The archaeological community still debate whether the Neolithic Revolution was brought to the British Isles through by adoption by natives or by migrating groups of continental Europeans who decided to settle therep22

The period that followed the Neolithic is known by archaeologists as the Bronze Age and it is characterised by the adoption of bronze as a material for making certain tools

The Coligny calendar is a celtic calendar from roman times It was found near Lyon in 1897 It was made of bronze but today only fragments remain Studies found that these fragments made up a gallic calendar which had been created for a period of five years The calendar indicates both the time of the solar year and the phase of the moon which is generally called a lunisolar calendar

It was engraved on a bronze tablet preserved in 73 fragments that originally was 148 m wide and 09 m high or approximately convert5ftm wide by 3 feet in height Based on the style of lettering and the accompanying objects it probably dates to the end of the 2nd century AD It is written in Latin inscriptional capitals and is in the Gaulish language The restored tablet contains sixteen vertical columns with 62 months distributed over five years

The French archaeologist J Monard speculated that it was recorded by druids wishing to preserve their tradition of timekeeping in a time when the Julian calendar was being imposed throughout the Roman Empire However the general form of the calendar suggests the public peg calendars found throughout the Greek and Roman world

A similar calendar found nearby at Villards dHeria is only preserved in eight small fragments It is now preserved in the Muse dArchologie du Jura at Lons le Saunier

A lunisolar calendar is a calendar that shows both the phases of the moon and the days of the solar year

Robert Fortune was a Scottish plant expert plant hunter and traveller best known for introducing tea plants from China to India

Fortune was born in Kelloe Berwickshire He was employed in the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh and later in the garden of Horticultural Society of London at Chiswick In 1842 was sent out by the Society to collect plants in China

He brought back to Europe many new exotic and beautiful flowers His most famous achievement was the successful introduction of tea from China to India in 1848 on behalf of the British East India Company

Like some European travellers of that period such as Walter Medhurst Fortune disguised himself as a Chinese merchant during several of his journeys into parts of China that were prohibited to him Not only was Fortunes purchase of tea plants forbidden by the Chinese government of the time but he was not permitted to travel more than one day from certain ports where Europeans were allowed to trade Fortune travelled to some areas of China that had seldom been visited by Europeans including remote areas of Fujian Guangdong and Jiangsu provinces

Fortune employed many different means to transport tea plants seedlings and other botanical discoveries but he is most well known for his use of cases like small greenhouses called Wardian cases to keep the plants alive With these cases Fortune introduced 20000 tea plants and seedlings to the Darjeeling region of India He also brought with him a group of trained Chinese tea workers to assist in the production of tea leaves Except for a few plants which survived in Indian gardens most of the Chinese tea plants Fortune introduced to India died The special growing methods and knowledge that was brought over from China however may have been very helpful in the later success of the Indian tea industry 

Apart from his many contributions to plant history Fortune was the first European to discover that black tea and green tea were actually from the same plantreference  science and colonial expansion The role of the british botanical gardens  Lucile H Brockway Page 27

In later journeys he visited Formosa and Japan and described the culture of the silkworm and the growing of rice He introduced many trees shrubs and flowers to the West including the cumquat a climbing double yellow rose and many varieties of tree peonies azaleas and chrysanthemums A climbing white rose that he brought back from China in 1850 was named R fortuniana in his honor This rose also proved a failure in England preferring warmer climates Today both of these roses are still widely grown by antique rose fanciers in mild winter regions R fortuniana is also a valuable rootstock in Australia and the southern regions of the United States 

The stories of his travels were told in a number of different books He died in London in 1880 and is buried in Brompton Cemetery

Neuroethology is the study of animal behavior and its control by the nervous system Neuroethology explores how the brain links stimuli to behavior For example many bats have a special ability called echolocation Bats use echolocation to find prey and to navigate Researchers study the auditory system of bats to show how sounds can be changed into a neural representation of sound Neuroethologists are scientists who study neuroethology They try to discover how the nervous system works They often use animals with special behaviors in their research

The word neuroethology combines ideas from two fields  neurobiology and ethology Neuroethology focusses on natural behavior Natural behaviors of animals were created by natural selection Neuroethology avoids artificial behaviors like those in lab experiments

Jeffrey Jeff Dunham is an American ventriloquist actor and comedian who has also appeared on numerous television shows He has four specials that run on Comedy Central Jeff Dunham Arguing with Myself Jeff Dunham Spark of Insanity Jeff Dunhams Very Special Christmas Special and Jeff Dunham Controlled Chaos Dunham also starred in The Jeff Dunham Show a series on the network in 2009 His style has been described as a dressed down more digestible version of Don Rickles with multiple personality disorder Describing his characters Time observes All of them are politically incorrect gratuitously insulting and ill tempered Dunham has been credited with reviving ventriloquism and doing more to promote the art form than anyone since Edgar Bergen

Dunham has been called Americas favorite comedian by Slatecom and according to the concert industry publication Pollstar he is the top grossing standup act in North America and is among the most successful acts in Europe as well As of March 2009 he has sold over four million DVDs an additional 7 million in merchandise sales and received more than 350 million hits on YouTube A Very Special Christmas Special was the most watched telecast in Comedy Central history with its DVD going quadruple platinum in its first two weeks Forbescom ranked Dunham as the third highest paid comedian in the United States behind Jerry Seinfeld and Chris Rock and reported that he was one of the highest earning comics from June 2008 to June 2009 earning approximately 30 million during that period

Dunham was born in Dallas Texas on April 18 1962 When he was three months old he was adopted by real estate appraiser Howard Dunham and his homemaker wife Joyce who raised him in a devoutly Presbyterian household in an affluent Dallas neighborhood as an only child He began ventriloquism in 1970 at age eight when his parents gave him a Mortimer Snerd dummy for Christmas and an accompanying how to album The next day he checked out a how to book on ventriloquism from the library and explained in 2011 that he still had it remarking that he was a thief in the third grade By the fourth grade Dunham decided he not only wanted to be a professional ventriloquist but the best one ever Dunham began practicing for hours in front of a mirror studying the routines of Edgar Bergen and the how to record Jimmy Nelsons Instant Ventriloquism finding ventriloquism to be a learned skill similar to juggling that anyone with a normal speaking voice can acquire Dunham explains that as an only child he enjoyed being alone likening his solitude to a warm blanket with which he could explore his own thoughts and ideas which prepared him for the solitude of living alone when he later moved to Los Angeles as a struggling comedian

When Dunham was in the sixth grade he began attending the Vent Haven ConVENTion in Fort Mitchell Kentucky an annual international meeting of ventriloquists that includes competitions where he met Jimmy Nelson in person Dunham has missed only one ConVENTion since then in 1977 The organizers of the ConVENTion eventually declared Dunham a retired champion ineligible from entering any more competitions as other attendees were too intimidated to compete against him The Vent Haven Museum devotes a section to Dunham alongside Seor Wences and his idol Edgar Bergen

Dunham began performing for audiences as a teenager in various venues such as school church and during his job at Six Flags By his middle school years he began to perform for banquets attended by local celebrities such as Dallas Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach having developed his style of lampooning those he performed for using the puppets to say things too risque for him to say without them Dunhams television debut came in 1976 when the still prepubescent performer caught the attention of Dallas reporters like Bill OReilly who interviewed Dunham for a local news story Dunham later did commercials for Datsun dealerships in Dallas and Tyler while in high school While emceeing a high school talent show he dealt with a heckler and won over the rest of the audience During this period he became so associated with his craft that he and one of his dummies cowrote a column in the school paper and he would pose with his dummies for yearbooks as an inexpensive way to acquire professional photos of his act for promotional purposes He was voted Most Likely to Succeed and in 1980 after he graduated from high school Dunham gave himself a career goal of obtaining within ten years an appearance on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson which was seen as the holy grail for comedians

That year Dunham began attending Baylor University hoping to graduate with a degree in communications while performing around campus He would also fly around the country on weekends doing up to 100 private shows a year entertaining corporate customers such as General Electric whose CEO Jack Welch he mocked during his routine By his junior year in college Dunham was making 70000 a year and as word spread of his act he landed featured spots opening for Bob Hope and George Burns though he still perceived his act as raw as he did not have any knowledge of standup comedy beyond his Bill Cosby albums He caught a break in 1985 when he was asked to join the Broadway show Sugar Babies with Mickey Rooney and Ann Miller replacing the outgoing variety act For the naive and devoutly raised Dunham Broadway was a new world filled with beautiful showgirls and crusty stagehands and his first taste of entertainment industry egos came when Rooney called Dunham into his dressing room and told him he was there for one reason alone so that Rooney could change his costumes Dunham also performed at the Westbury Music Fair on Long Island These early experiences in which he used characters like Jos Jalapeo on a Stick taught him the value of modifying his act regionally as the jalapeo jokes that worked well in Texas were not as well received by audiences in Long Island

After graduating from Baylor University in 1986 he continued honing his act in comedy clubs in the Southwest with new characters such as Peanut and Jose Jalapeo but struggled against the perception he relates from fellow comedians that he was not a true a comedian because he relied on props His experience at Catch a Rising Star in New York City served as a bitter confirmation of where ventriloquists stood in the comedic food chain as the emcee at that club gave Dunham little respect According to Dunham after he arrived at the club in the evening and informed the emcee that he was a ventriloquist the emcee reacted with derision telling Dunham that he would be given a late time slot and after that time slot came and passed kept postponing Dunhams stage time until Dunham left the club By the end of 1988 Dunham felt his career went as far as it could go in Texas and he moved to Los Angeles California never having as he has commented a real job much to the concern of his parents who assumed he would relegate his act to local venues such as church groups When he first arrived in Los Angeles the comedy in his act bombed Dunham attributes to his underdeveloped comedy explaining that while the characters personalities were developed at that point his jokes were not In addition to this the comedy world was not welcoming to ventriloquists and his manager Judi Brown Marmel did not use the word ventriloquist when finding bookings for him choosing to present him as a comedy duo After Dunham became friends with Mike Lacey the owner of The Comedy Magic Club in Hermosa Beach Lacey gave Dunham a steady slot at the club where Dunham sharpened his act by observing the techniques of comedians like Jerry Seinfeld and taking the advice of colleague Bill Engvall moving away from his G Rated material toward edgier more adult themes

At the end of 1988 Dunham was told by James McCawley a talent booker for The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson that Dunham would be given a spot on the program Though the 26 year old Dunham was elated that his 10 year goal was arriving two years early McCawley later cancelled Dunhams appearance after attending with Roseanne Barr a public performance of Dunhams the day before Dunhams scheduled Tonight Show taping McCawley informed Dunham on the day of the scheduled taping that he had been wrong in his initial assessment of Dunham whom he now said was not ready for The Tonight Show His dreams dashed the humiliated Dunham continued to tighten his act in Los Angeles clubs performing same six minute segment with Peanut a total of nine times for McCawley over the next few months Finally at the Ice House in Pasadena in April 1990 after Dunham did the same segment McCawley informed Dunham that he would finally get his Tonight Show appearance Dunham and Peanut appeared on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson on April 6 1990 alongside guests Bob Hope and BB King Following his bit he was invited to sit on Johnny Carsons couch a mark of approval that only three comedians had ever garnered during their first Carson appearance Upon sitting down next to Carsons desk Dunham pulled out Walter who told Carson sidekick Ed McMahon Stop sending me all your damn mail At the time Dunham saw his Tonight Show appearance as his big break but was frustrated at his parents initial disapproval over Walters use of the words hell and damn and he would toil in obscurity for another twelve years continuing his stand up at venues such as The Improv chain and appearing in small roles on TV One of these was such as a 1996 episode of Ellen in which he appeared with Walter Dunham also appeared with Walter in a TV commercial for Hertz Dunham would appear on The Tonight Show a total of four times as well as similar TV venues such as Hot Country Nights appearing in one segment on that show with singer Reba McEntire This exposure helped make Dunham a large theater headliner a rare accomplishment for a ventriloquist but by the mid 1990s his television appearances had dwindled and with them so did his stage audiences

Dunham moved back to clubs more than 200 appearances a year To maintain a connection with his fan base he would use question cards that he had audiences fill out for his performances to build a database which was tailor made for the burgeoning World Wide Web Though he was voted Funniest Male Standup at the American Comedy Awards in 1998 his club work kept him away from his wife and daughters between two and three weeks each month which put a strain on his marriage and made paying bills for his expanded family difficult By 2002 Dunham was hoping to obtain more TV work to raise his profile and ease his standup schedule Such exposure was elusive until a successful appearance on The Best Damn Sports Show Period where Dunham and Walter made jokes at the expense of co hosts Tom Arnold Michael Irvin John Salley and John Kruk generating laughter from them and giving Dunham much needed exposure In 2003 Dunham was the frontrunner to replace Jimmy Kimmel on Fox NFL Sunday but hosts Howie Long and Terry Bradshaw were not amenable to the idea of being upstaged by a puppet and as Dunham tells it did not provide a welcoming atmosphere to Dunham nor allow him to get a word in edgewise during his appearance

On July 18 2003 Dunham appeared on Comedy Central Presents his first solo appearance on Comedy Central During his half hour piece he showcased Jos Jalapeo on a Stick Walter an early version of Melvin the Superhero Guy and Peanut whom Dunham had begun to merchandise into a line of dolls The appearance was successful but Comedy Central resisted giving Dunham more airtime feeling that he was not a good fit for them By 2005 Dunham decided to gamble on financing his own comedy DVD Jeff Dunham Arguing with Myself which was taped in Santa Ana California Dunhams manager Judi Brown Marmel lobbied the network to air it pointing to Dunhams drawing power and merchandising profits and arguing that the network needed more diverse content Surprised by the high ratings of the first Blue Collar Comics concert movie that same year the network began to reconsider its brand In late 2006 Comedy Central aired Arguing with Myself drawing two million viewers when it aired and selling two million DVDs

In 2007 Dunham appeared as The Amazing Ken with Jos Jalapeo on a Stick in the Larry the Cable Guy feature film Delta Farce

His second special Jeff Dunham Spark of Insanity was taped at the Warner Theater in Washington DC that same year It served not only to cement Dunhams stardom but to introduce his most controversial character Achmed the Dead Terrorist which became a viral Internet sensation A clip of Achmed from Insanity attracted over 140 million hits on YouTube making it the ninth most watched clip on that website as of October 2009 By 2008 Dunhams characters had crossed language barriers with his specials dubbed for audiences in various countries such as France and Dunham attracting requests for performances in South Africa Australia Norway Denmark China and the Middle East Jeff Dunhams Very Special Christmas Special was taped at the Pabst Theater in Milwaukee Wisconsin that same year and premiered on Comedy Central on November 16 2008 watched by 66 million people It became available on DVD and Blu ray on November 18 2008 The specials premiere was the highest rated telecast in Comedy Centrals history
