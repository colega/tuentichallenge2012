Charonosaurus was a genus of hadrosaur that lived at the very end of the Upper Cretaceous about 65 million years ago Its remains wer found in China It is very similar to Parasaurolophus from North America suggesting that a Bering land bridge existed during the Cretaceous period

Charonosaurus was featured in the Discovery Channel television documentary The Last Day of the Dinosaurs where it was the prey of Troodon

Dinosaur brains and intelligence are sometimes points of contention for paleontologists Dinosaurs were once regarded as stupid animals but it is now realised that some of the smaller carnivores had above average intelligence for reptiles This newfound optimism for dinosaur intelligence led to exaggerated portrayals in works like Jurassic Park

Brain size usually increases with body size in animals ie large animals usually have larger brains than smaller animals The relationship is not linear however Generally small mammals have relatively larger brains than big ones Mice have a direct brainbody size ratio similar to humans while elephants have comparatively small brainbody size despite elephants being obviously quite intelligent animals

The formula for the curve varies but is usually given as Ew 012w23 As this formula is based on data from mammals it should be applied to other animals with caution For some of the other vertebrate classes the power of 34 rather than 23 is sometimes used and for many groups of invertebrates the formula may give no meaningful results at all

Intelligence in animals is hard to establish but the larger the brain is relative to the body the more brain weight might be available for more complex cognitive tasks The EQ formula as opposed to the method of simply measuring raw brain weight or brain weight to body weight makes for a ranking of animals that coincide better with observed complexity of behaviour Mean EQ for mammals is around 1 with carnivorans cetaceans and primates above 1 and insectivores and herbivores below It also puts humans at the top of the list The relationship between brain to body mass ratio and complexity of behaviour is not perfect as other factors also influence intelligence like the evolution of the recent cerebral cortex and different degrees of brain folding which increase the surface of the cortex which is positively correlated to intelligence in humans

Traditional comparisons of brain volume to body mass in dinosaurs have estimated brain size as the volume of the endocast However the brain of the modern reptile genus Sphenodon fills only about half of its endocranial volume Some paleontologists used this fifty percent estimate in their estimates of dinosaur brain volume Other workers have observed that details on the endocranial surface indicates that some fossil reptiles had brains that occupied a much larger portion of the endocranium Larsson notes that the transition from reptiles to birds prevents using a set ratio from being a valid approach to estimating the volume of the endocranium occupied by a dinosaurs brain

Adding difficulty is the wide range of estimates for live mass One study estimated that the live masses for many dinosaur genera had a four fold range Larsson laments that the broad ranges of body mass estimates combined with the ambiguous ratio of endocranial volume occupied by the brain present a high degree of uncertainty for creating an index of brain size Consequently he attempted to minimize errors by making a different kind of comparison

While it is difficult to estimate the absolute volume of the brain the proportions of its various regions of the brain should be the same in the endocast as it was in the live brain Larssons study compared the ratio of the cerebrum which is clearly marked on the inside of skulls to the rest of the endocasts volume According to Larsson his technique is superior to traditional comparisons of brain volume to estimated live body mass

Most dinosaurs and most theropods had brains no better than present day reptiles so far as can be estimated In a 2001 study of a Carcharodontosaurus saharicus endocast Hans Larsson found that both C saharicus and Allosaurus had a ratio of cerebrum to brain volume that was very similar to non avian reptiles By contrast the Tyrannosaurus ratio was slightly in the direction of a more bird like proportion Since tyrannosaurs are relatively basal coelurosaurs this is evidence that the advent of the Coelurosauria marks the beginning of a trend in theropod brain enlargement

Troodons cerebrum to brain volume ratio was 315 to 63 of the way from a nonavian reptile proportion to a truly avian one

Archaeopteryx had a cerebrum to brain volume ratio 78 of the way to modern birds

The method used for Larssons comparison was not the EQ but a ratio of the size of the cerebrum to the whole brain The cerebrum is chiefly responsible for what might be called intelligent behaviour

The brains of dinosaurs were generally much like other reptiles in their proportions The exception is the coelurosaurs which had cerebra proportionately larger than most reptiles but proportionately smaller than modern birds

Paul Christison Edwards is an English organist and composer of music for the Anglican Church 

Paul Edwards spent his childhood in the village of Turvey in Bedfordshire He liked church music especially the sound of the big organ in the church at Turvey He became a chorister at St Pauls Cathedral for four and a half years and then spent the same amount of time as lay clerk at Peterborough Cathedral He has been organist and choir master at several churches in Bedfordshire including All Saints Turvey and St Pauls Church Bedford He works as a teacher piano accompanist and choral singer 

Edwards has made a series of recordings of interesting old organs of North Bedfordshire He has transcribed and edited ten volumes of 18th century English Organ Music The list of all his compositions has 450 opus numbers They include about 150 hymn tunes and a large number of anthems Many of these works have been published in collections including Hymns for Todays Church Psalms for Today and Carols for Today His carol No Small Wonder written in 1983 was published in Carols for Today in 1986 and was recorded on LP by Canterbury Cathedral Choir It was sung at the famous Nine Lessons and Carols service broadcast on the BBC Television by the Choir of Kings College Cambridge in 2000  His music has been recorded on several CDs

Edwards finds inspiration for his compositions in the English countryside especially that of Norfolk  He also enjoys driving and photographing busses and coaches

Opus is Latin for work

A lay clerk also known as a lay vicar is a term used in the United Kingdom to describe a male singer who sings in a cathedral choir or a choir belonging to a college of one of the large traditional universities A lay clerk is usually paid for the job When he is called lay vicar the term vicar comes from the Latin word vice A lay vicar is not in holy orders Today there are a few female lay clerks eg in Dublin

The term layman was used in the Middle Ages for a chorister who sings some of the music that was too difficult for the priests to sing Today many of the lay clerks in places such as Oxford or Cambridge combine their work as layclerk with studying at University It is similar to a scholarship for studying

Owen is probably best remembered today for coining the word Dinosauria and for his outspoken opposition to Charles Darwins theory of evolution by natural selection 

Owen was the driving force behind the establishment in 1881 of the British Museum in London

Owens technical descriptions of vertebrates were important His Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of Vertebrates was a standard reference work for many years

His career was tainted by accusations that he failed to give credit to the work of others and even tried to appropriate it under his own name

Owen credited himself and Georges Cuvier with the discovery of the Iguanodon completely excluding any credit for the original discoverer of the dinosaur Gideon Mantell This was not the first or last time Owen would deliberately claim a discovery as his own when in fact it was not Owen was finally dismissed from the Royal Societys Zoological Council for plagiarism

Owen was highly critical of Darwins On the Origin of Species in part because Darwin did not refer much to the previous scientific theories of evolution Instead Darwin compared the theory of evolution by natural selection with the unscientific theory in the Bible 

Owen in Darwins opinion was Spiteful extremely malignant clever the Londoners say he is mad with envy because my book is so talked about It is painful to be hated in the intense degree with which Owen hates me 

Owen was also a party to the threat to end government funding of the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew botanical collection

In the first part of his career Owen was regarded rightly as one of the great scientific figures of the age In the second part of his career his reputation slipped This was not solely due to his underhanded dealings with colleagues it was also due to the serious errors of scientific judgement which were discovered and publicized A fine example was his decision to classify man in a separate sub class of the Mammalia In this Owen had no supporters at all Also his unwillingness to come off the fence concerning evolution became increasingly damaging to his reputation as time went on 

Owen continued working after his official retirement at the age of 79 but he never recovered the good opinions he had got in his younger days

Ashcroft v Al Kidd is a 2011 case decided in a 5 3 ruling by the US Supreme Court It was a civil law suit filed in federal court challenging the holding of Muslim Americans after the September 11 attacks

A young man named Lavoni T Kidd was a prominent football player at the University of Idaho He is an American citizen While at college Kidd converted to Islam and adopted the name Abudulla al Kidd The police arrested Al Kidd in 2003 as he was boarding a flight to Saudi Arabia where he planned to study He was held for 15 nights under the federal material witness statute because he was to testify in the trial of Sami Omar Al Hussayen FBI Director Robert S Mueller told Congress that al Kidds capture was one of the FBIs success stories Al Kidd was never charged with a crime or called as a witness He was later released

Al Kidd went to court suing John Ashcroft who was US Attorney General from 2001 to 2005 Al Kidd alleges that he was strip searched shackled interrogated without a lawyer present and treated as a terrorist The American Civil Liberties Union lawyers who represent al Kidd claim that he is one of 70 Muslim men who were similarly treated

Aschroft claims that he has absolute immunity from such civil suits In other words because he was acting within the scope of his duties as Attorney General nobody can sue him about his conduct Ashcroft also claims that he has qualified immunity that prevents such suits unless the official actied in violation of a clearly established constitutional right

In 2009 the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found that Ashcroft could be sued and held personally responsible for the wrongful holding of al Kidd On October 18 2010 the United States Supreme Court agreed to hear Ashcrofts appeal

On May 31 2011 the Supreme Court in a 5 3 ruling along the Courts ideological lines stated that Al Kidds lawyers had not met the high burden of proof needed to show that Attorney General Ashcroft could be personally sued that he was directly involved or had explicit knowledge of the events All eight Justices agreed that the Ninth Circuit should be reversed in this case But they reached their decision for different reasons Justice Antonin Scalia joined by Justice Roberts Kennedy Thomas and Alito wrote a majority opinion He said that a Magistrate Judge had issued a valid arrest warrant for al Kidd based on specific information about him A footnote in Justice Scalias opinion gets into a fight with Justice Ginsburg about what type of individualized suspicion is required Scalia does not believe that a person must be suspected of wrongdoing just that he is suspected Justice Scalia found Ashcroft to be free from possible lawsuits for ordering this group of arrests The objectively reasonable arrest and detention of a material witness pursuant to a validly obtained warrant cannot be challenged as unconstitutional on the basis of allegations that the arresting authority had an improper motive

Justice Kennedy joined by Justices Ginsburg Breyer and Sotomayor for Part I of his opinion also would dismiss the lawsuit noting that the Supreme Court is not deciding the validity of the Material Witness Statute in this case Kennedy then writes alone to describe his concern that the Attorney General of the United States cannot be personally sued just because lower courts in some parts of the United States have made legal decisions opposing his policies Justice Ginsburg joined by Justices Breyer and Sotomayor said the scope of the Material Witness Statute was uncertain They questioned whether a law abiding citizen who was not suspected of wrongdoing could be sent to jail if he saw a crime during the days or weeks before a scheduled flight abroad They were also concerned about how al Kidd was treated in jail The court left al Kidd with the right to sue his jailers for mistreating him 

Justice Sotomayor joined by Justices Ginsburg and Breyer wrote that it was unnecessary to reach Constitional questions to decide the outcome of this case Justice Kagan did not participate in the case

Roman Wales is the area of modern Wales that was under Roman Empire control

Roman Wales was an area of south western Britannia under Roman Empire control from the first to the fifth century AD Romans considered it to be part of Roman Britannia South east Wales was fully made Roman at the beginning of the fifth century

Up to and during the Roman occupation of Britain the native inhabitants of Iron Age Britain spoke Brythonic languages and were regarded as Britons The area of modern Wales was divided among a number of tribes of which the Silures in modern south east Wales and the Ordovices in central and northwest Wales were the largest and most powerful These two tribes were the ones who put up the strongest force to the Roman invasion Mona was only conquered by Gnaeus Julius Agricola in 78 AD 

The first attack on the Celtic tribes of what is now Wales was made under the legatus Publius Ostorius Scapula about 48 AD Ostorius first attacked the Deceangli in the north east who appear to have surrendered with little resistance He then spent several years campaigning against the Silures and the Ordovices Their resistance was led by Caratacus who had fled what is now southeast England when it was conquered by the Romans He first led the Silures then moved to the territory of the Ordovices where he was defeated by Ostorius in 51 AD Caratacus fled to the Brigantes whose queen handed him over to the Romans

The Silures were not going to go under Roman rule however and waged effective warfare against the Roman forces Ostorius died with this tribe still unconquered after his death they won a victory over the Roman Second Augusta Legion Legio II Augusta There were no more attempts to extend Roman control in Wales until the governorship of Caius Suetonius Paulinus who attacked further north and captured the island of Anglesey in 60 or 61 AD However he was forced to stop the offensive to meet the threat from the rebellion of Boadicea 

The Silures eventually came under Roman rule by Sextus Julius Frontinus in a series of campaigns ending about 78 AD His successor Gnaeus Julius Agricola subdued the Ordovices and recaptured Anglesey by the beginning of 78 AD

The Romans occupied the whole of the area now known as Wales where they built Roman roads and Roman forts mined gold at Luentinum and conducted commerce but their interest in the area was limited because of the difficult geography and shortage of flat agricultural land Most of the Roman remains in Wales are military in nature 

The area was controlled by Roman legionary bases at Deva Victrix and Isca Augusta two of the three such bases in Roman Britain with roads linking these bases to Roman auxiliary forts such as Segontium and Moridunum 

Romans are only known to have founded one town in Wales Venta Silurum in Monmouthshire although the fort at Moridunum was later superseded by a civilian settlement The modern day Wales is thought to have been part of the Roman province of Britannia Superior and later of the province of Britannia Secunda which also included part of what is now the West Country of England

The later part of the third century witnessed a new concern defending the coast from seaborne marauders from Hibernia The response was a Saxon Shore style fort at Cardiff and refurbishment elsewhere 

It is not clear when the legionary garrison at Caerleon was finally withdrawn possibly by the end of the third century although it may have left a skeleton force there as late as the mid fourth century 

The military dispositions in late fourth century Wales at Cardiff Caernarfon Holyhead and Caerhun seem to have been concerned with continuing incursions by Irish bands

The remaining recognisably military posts seem to have been abandoned cAD 393 when soldiers were needed to counteract a rebellion in Gaul There is some evidence that troops may have been left to guard the towns of Carmarthen and Caerwent into the fifth century

Wales was occupied by the Romans from the first century AD to the Roman withdrawal from Britain nearly four centuries later leaving their province to develop into Sub Roman Britain and the emergence of Wales in the Early Middle Ages

The only city founded by the Romans in Wales is Caerwent called Venta Silurum in 75 AD when was created and the last place to be left by the Romans

The town lacked substantial defences until the mid 4th century when stone town walls were built A small garrison may have been based in the town during that period Large sections of the defensive walls are still in place rising up to 5 metres in height in places 

The walls have been described as easily the most impressive town defence to survive from Roman Britain and in its freedom from later rebuilding one of the most perfectly preserved in Northern Europe 

Indeed the Roman town remained occupied after the Roman troops left until at least the end of the fifth century Caerwent has been even called the possible Camelot of King Arthur because it is located only ten miles from the Roman fort Isca Silurum that Geoffrey of Monmouth wrote was the place of the Round Table

Furthermore it appears that Christian worship was already established in the town in the fifth century and it may have had a bishop A monastery was founded by Saint Tatheus in the 6th century and a Christian cemetery was also established around the site of the present church

The name Venta gave its name to the emerging Kingdom of Gwent and the town itself became known as Caer went or CastraFort of VentaGwent Tradition holds that Caradog Freichfras of Gwent moved his court from Caerwent to Portskewett during the second half of the 6th century finishing in this way the last romanised presence in Wales

Finally Gwyn A Williams argues that even at the time of the erection of Offas Dyke the people to its west saw themselves as Roman citing the number of Latin inscriptions still being made into the 8th century

PEN awards dozens of literary awards each year Some examples include

Literature national though it be in origin knows no frontiers and should remain common currency among nations in spite of political or international upheavals

In all circumstances and particularly in time of war works of art and libraries the heritage of humanity at large should be left untouched by national or political passion

Members of PEN should at all times use what influence they have in favor of good understanding and mutual respect among nations they pledge themselves to do their utmost to dispel race class and national hatreds and to champion the ideal of one humanity living in peace in the world

PEN stands for the principle of unhampered transmission of thought within each nation and among all nations and members pledge themselves to oppose any form of suppression of freedom of expression in their country or their community

PEN declares for a free press and opposes arbitrary censorship in time of peace It believes that the necessary advance of the world toward a more highly organized political and economic order renders free criticism of governments administrations and institutions imperative And since freedom implies voluntary restraint members pledge themselves to oppose such evils of a free press as mendacious publication deliberate falsehood and distortion of facts for political and personal ends 

International PENs Writers in Prison Committee works to help persecuted writers worldwide The Writers in Prison Committee monitors the cases of over 900 writers who have been imprisoned tortured threatened attacked made to disappear and killed for the peaceful practice of their profession It publishes a bi annual Case List documenting free expression violations against writers around the world This committee was started in 1960 in response to increasing attempts to silence voices of dissent by imprisoning writers 

Liu Xia is a painter poet and photographer who resides in Beijing China She is married to 2010 Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo

Liu used to be a civil servant in the Beijing tax bureau She met her husband Liu Xiaobo while part of the Beijing literary scene in the 1980s She married Liu Xiaobo while he was in prison in a Chinese labor re education camp between the years of 1996 and 1999

Ms Liu prefers to lead the solitary life of an intellectual However she has been forced to act for her husband in public because of he is often in prison for his activism She has been described as her husbands most important link to the outside world She also personally experiences pressures from Chinese authorities for publicly voicing opinions because she is the wife of one of Chinas most prominent human rights advocates Since his arrest she the government watches her constantly She speaks out on issues of human rights both for herself and for her husband Although she may not want always want to he has continued to speak publicly all during their marriage and while her husband has been in prison Despite the pressures she attempts to keep her life normal

Liu Xiaobos was sent to prison for 11 years after he helped write the political manifesto 2008 called Charter 08 Liu Xia begged her husband to not participate in writing the document At first he did as she asked But later he did it anyway spent much of his time for three years writing and re writing the document He later got more than 300 prominent workers Chinese Communist Party members and intellectuals to sign the charter 10000 people added their names to a charter support list on the Internet

After it was announced that her husband had won the Nobel Peace Prize Liu Xia said that For all these years Liu Xiaobo has persevered in telling the truth about China and because of this for the fourth time he has lost his personal freedom She also said that she would visit him in jail and give him a big hug After visiting him however she was placed under house arrest and her mobile phone number was canceled

Jilin University is a national university Chinas Ministry of Education controls the university directly

The Down to the Countryside Movement was a government plan in the Peoples Republic of China in the late 1960s and early 1970s During the Cultural Revolution anti bourgeois thinking was very common Mao Zedong said that richer youth from the cities would be sent to mountains or farming villages so they could learn from the workers and farmers there

Many fresh high school graduates were forced out of the cities They had to stay in far away areas of China They became known as the Rusticated Youth of China Many of them lost the chance to go university Some call them Chinas lost generation Famous authors who have written about their experiences during the movement include Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo Jiang Rong and Zhang Chengzhi both of whom went to Inner Mongolia

Hu Jintao is now the Paramount Leader of the Peoples Republic of China He has held the titles of General Secretary of the Communist Party of China since 2002 President of the Peoples Republic of China since 2003 and Chairman of the Central Military Commission since 2004 succeeding Jiang Zemin as the top leader of the Peoples Republic of China

Beginning in the 1960s Havel focussed on the politics of Czechoslovakia in his work After the Prague Spring he became more and more active against the government In 1977 he became famous internationally for his work on the human rights manifesto Charter 77 He became known as a leader of the opposition in Czechoslovakia He was also sent to prison for these activities The 1989 Havel became president during the Velvet Revolution As president he led Czechoslovakia and later the Czech Republic to an open democracy with several political parties His country changed greatly during the thirteen years he was president The Czech Republic separated from Slovakia even though Havel was against separation The Czech Republic also joined NATO and started negotiating membership in the European Union The country became a member of the EU in 2004 He was one of the first people to sign the Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism

Vclav Havel was born in Prague Czechoslovakia on 5 October 1936 He grew up in a well known and wealthy entrepreneurial and intellectual family His family was active in culture and politics in Czechoslovakia from the 1920s to the 1940s His father owned of the suburb of Barrandov This area is the highest part of Prague Havels mother came from a well known family Her father was an ambassador and journalist Havel completed his required education in 1951 However the Communist government did not allow him to continue to study formally because of his bourgeois family background In the early 1950s the young Havel entered a four year apprenticeship as a chemical laboratory assistant He took evening classes at the same time and completed his secondary education in 1954 None of the colleges or universities with humanities programs would accept Havel for political reasons Therefore he chose to study at the Faculty of Economics of Czech Technical University in Prague He dropped out after two years In 1964 Havel married proletarian Olga plchalov His mother was against the marriage

Havel was already leader of the Civic Forum and on 29 December 1989 he became president He left office after his second term as Czech president ended on 2 February 2003 Every member of the Federal Assembly voted to make him president This was surprising change because Havel had always said that he was not interested in politics He and other dissidents had said that change should come from groups of people directly not from the government

Czechoslovakia had free elections in 1990 Havel won and continued to be president Havel wanted to keep of the federation of the Czechs and the Slovaks together during the breakup of Czechoslovakia He supported keeping the country together despite stress and pressure On 3 July 1992 the federal parliament did not elect Havel the only candidate because Slovak MPs did not support him Havel resigned as president on 20 July after the Slovaks issued their Declaration of Independence He stood for election as president of the new Czech Republic in 1993 He won and became president of this new separate country

Havel was quite popular throughout his career However some of his actions caused controversy and criticism One of his first acts as a president was to pardon many people He wanted to both reduce the pressure in overcrowded prisons and release those who may have been falsely imprisoned during the Communist era He did not trust the decisions of a corrupt court of the previous government He thought most in prison had not been fairly tried in court Critics claimed that this amnesty raised the crime rate In his memoir To the Castle and Back Havel wrote that most of the people he released had less than a year left to stay in prison Statistics about this are not clearcn

Havel said that the most important thing he did as president was breaking up the Warsaw Pact Ending this group of countries was very complicated because the association was a deep part of how the countries worked It took two years before the Soviet troops finally left Czechoslovakia completely

Havel was very important to changing NATO He helped change it from an anti Warsaw Pact alliance to a group that includes former Warsaw Pact members Havel spoke very strongly for expanding of the military alliance into Eastern Europe including the Czech Republic

He has received many awards including

Qincheng Prison is a maximum security prison in the Changping District northwest of Beijing in the Peoples Republic of China The prison was built in 1958 with aid from the Soviet Union and it is the only prison belonging to the Ministry of Public Security 

The majority of people in prison here are political prisoners Some of them were participants in the Chinese democracy movement and Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 Famous inmates include Jiang Qing Bao Tong Dai Qing as well as Tibetans such as Choekyi Gyaltsen the 10th Panchen Lama and Phuntsok Wangyal Other inmates included many communist cadres who were criticized during the Cultural Revolution such as Bo Yibo Peng Zhen Israel Epstein Sidney Rittenberg and David Crook 2010 Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo was also imprisoned here

The prison is at the eastern foothill of Yanshan facing the North China Plain in the east north and south The plain is where Qincheng Farm is which is part of the prison

The need of training in judiciary was being felt for long Initially there was no such proposal The institution itself was averse to the idea of acknowledging the need of training in the initial years It was felt that the subordinate judges have the background of legal knowledge which can be applied by them while working as Presiding Officers of the Courts Gradually the idea of training gained momentum The Law Commission of India in its report has been in favour of the training and the need of establishing training institutes was later on felt It received legal recognition for the first time when the Apex Court asked the states to establish their own judicial training academies Consequently the state of UP established Judicial Training and Research Institute at Lucknow The officers of the state of Uttarakhand were also part of the UP cadre and hence they received Induction Training as well as Refresher Training Programme in JTRI Lucknow

On Nov 9 2000 a new state was carved out Honble Mr Justice VS Sirpurkar the then Chief Justice of Uttaranchal High Court desired that this state should have its own judicial academy and therefore a big chunk of land measuring 703 acres was transferred to the law department of Uttarakhand The academy is christened as Uttarakhand Judicial and Legal Academy The foundation stone was laid on December 19 2004 by Honble Mr Justice RC Lahoti the then Chief Justice of India in the presence of Honble Sri ND Tiwari the then Chief Minister of Uttarakhand and Honble Mr Justice VS Sirpurkar the then Chief Justice of Uttarakhand High Court and now the Judge of Supreme Court of India Administrative cum training block of the academy was constructed Mess and hostel of the academy is also constructed

Finally the academy became functional on June 14 2008 It was inaugurated by Honble Mr Justice KG Balakrishnan the Chief Justice of India in the presence of Honble Sri BL Joshi the then Governor of Uttarakhand and now Governor of UP and Honble Mr Justice VK Gupta the then Chief Justice of Uttarakhand High Court Two batches of Induction Training programme for newly recruited Civil Judges have taken place Orientation Programme for direct recruits to HJS has also taken place Refresher Training Programme for Senior Additional District Judges has also concluded recently Besides that refresher training programme for Civil JudgesCJMs is currently under progress

Basically this academy is meant for the training of judicial officers The ultimate goal of UJALA is to strengthen the administration of justice as a whole In this process every stake holder be it offices of State Government or any Department who by virtue of their official position have to take judicial or quasi judicial decision may be benefited by the resources of UJALA By doing so on the one hand the resources of UJALA would be utilised to the optimum level for strengthening the administration of justice and on the other hand it would also help the officers of other services to acquire proficiency in the process of applying law in more functional manner Consequently workshops for the officers of Police Deptt Medical Health Deptt Urban Development Deptt PWDRESIrrigationMinor Irrigation Deptt and workshop on RTI Act have also been organised to cater to training needs of the Govt departments History The institute was established as College of Engineering Technology Delhi on August 21 1961Citation neededdateSeptember 2010 Its foundation stone was laid by HRH Prince Philip Duke of Edinburgh and was inaugurated by ProfHumayun Kabir then Union Minister for Scientific Research and Cultural AffairsCitation neededdateSeptember 2010

A suicide pact is a plan of two or more people to kill themselves People who agree on such a plan may kill themselves together or they may do so in a planned manner When studying suicide suicide pacts are an important concepts Suicide pacts have occurred through history

Note that a suicide pact is different from mass suicide In a mass suicide many people commit suicide for the same reason This reason is often influenced by religious beliefs 

In a mass suicide a group of people kill themselves for the same reason Very often all the people involved kill themselves together at more or less the same time The reason for the mass suicide often inolves religious views Suicide bombings and Kamikaze missions are military or paramliitary forms of mass suicide

Guard cells are types of cells that surrounds stomates in plants Plants lose water through stomates Guard cells have the ability to open and close the stomates to save water Guard cells are activated by sunlight To open a guard cell protons are pumped into the guard cells and water follows since the water potential inside the guard cell is lower When water follows the cells get hard and they push open At night guard cells lose water and close again

Adasaurus is a genus of dromaeosaurid theropod dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous period It lived in what is now Central Asia It was a small carnivore with a large sickle shaped claw on the second toe of each hind foot An adult was probably about 62 feet long

Ada is an evil spirit in the national mythology of Mongolia The name also includes the Greek word sauros meaning lizard the most common suffix used in dinosaur names There is one species named after the country of Mongolia where the fossil was found Both genus and species were named and described in 1983 by famous Mongolian paleontologist Rinchen Barsbold

Adasaurus is a member of Dromaeosauridae a theropod family thought to be very closely related to birds Relationships within the family are poorly understood but Adasaurus seems to be a member of the subfamily Dromaeosaurinae along with the Mongolian Achillobator and several North American species including Utahraptor and Dromaeosaurus after which the whole family is named Other dromaeosaurids include Deinonychus Velociraptor Microraptor and Buitreraptor Adasaurus is unique among dromaeosaurids in having much smaller sickle claws on its feet

Two specimens of Adasaurus have been found both from the Nemegt Formation of Bayankhongor Province in Mongolia The holotype is an incomplete skull associated with some bones of the skeleton including all three bones of the pelvis The holotype specimen appears to be an elderly adult because its bones are injured and diseased from a long hard life The second specimen also described in the original paper consists of the back end of another skeleton including the hindlimbs Both specimens are currently in the collection of the Mongolian Geological Institute in Ulaanbaatar Mongolia

The age of the Nemegt like most of Mongolias Late Cretaceous sediments is not known for certain but it is commonly thought to belong to the Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous Period Therefore the Nemegt was deposited somewhere between 74 and 65 million years ago Other dinosaurs found in this formation include Tarbosaurus Anserimimus and Saurolophus

Dromaeosaurus was a genus of theropod dinosaur which lived during the Upper Cretaceous period about 75 million years ago Its remains were found in the western United States and Alberta Canada 

Dromaeosaurus was a small carnivore the size of a wolf about 2 m in length and 15 kg in weight Its mouth was full of sharp teeth and it had a large sickle claw on each foot It lived during the Upper Cretaceous some fragmentary remains such as teeth which may belong to this genus have been found from the latest Cretaceous 655 million years ago

Although only a few bones are known from the hind limb they indicate that Dromaeosaurus was a powerfully built animal The presence of feathers in closely related animals makes it extremely likely that it was feathered as well

Dromaeosaurus had remarkably large eyes and excellent vision It also probably had a good sense of smell and hearing Its neck was curved and flexible and its jaws were solidly built The tail was flexible at the base but sheathed in a lattice of bony rods this allowed it to be carried in an upturned position

Despite receiving widespread attention in popular books about dinosaurs and the usage of a complete mounted skeleton cast in many museums around the world Dromaeosaurus is surprisingly poorly known from actual fossils The preparation of the popular cast by the Tyrrell Museum was only made possible by knowledge gained from other dromaeosaurids that have been discovered more recently

The first known Dromaeosaurus remains were discovered by paleontologist Barnum Brown during a 1914 expedition to Red Deer River on behalf of the American Museum of Natural History

Several species of Dromaeosaurus have been described but Dromaeosaurus albertensis is the most complete specimen This genus is even rarer than other small theropods although it was one of the first small theropods described 

Matthew and Brown originally placed Dromaeosaurus within Deinodontidae based on some similarities in the general proportions of the skull In 1969 John H Ostrom recognized that Dromaeosaurus shared many features with Velociraptor and the newly discovered Deinonychus and assigned these forms to a new family Dromaeosauridae

Dromaeosaurus differs from most of its relatives in having a short massive skull a deep mandible and robust teeth The teeth tend to be more heavily worn than those of its relative Saurornitholestes suggesting that its jaws were used for crushing and tearing rather than simply slicing through flesh Therrien et al estimated that Dromaeosaurus had a bite nearly three times as powerful as that of a Velociraptor 

It is possible that unlike most other dromaosaurids Dromaeosaurus relied more heavily on its jaws than its claws to dispatch its prey It was probably better suited to tackling large prey than the more lightly built Saurornitholestes

The relationships of Dromaeosaurus are unclear Although its rugged build gived it a primitive appearance it was actually a very specialized animal It is usually given its own subfamily the Dromaeosaurinae this group is thought to include Utahraptor Achillobator Adasaurus and possibly Deinonychus

However the relationships of dromaeosaurs are still in a state of flux Dromaeosaurus Morphotype A is the designation given to a series of unusual ridged dromaeosaur teeth from Alberta These teeth probably do not belong to Dromaeosaurus although it is not clear from what animal they do come

Dromaeosaurus are featured in Walking with Dinosaurs stalking juvenile Torosaurus and attempting to steal eggs from Tyrannosaurus despite never coexisting with the latter in real life Dromaeosaurus makes an appearance in Jurassic Fight Club where a pack is shown being capable of taking down Edmontosaurus in spite of the carnivores small size but the carcass is later taken by a Tyrannosaurus

On 14 September 2010 the Senate of France passed a law that forbids the wearing of clothing that covers the face of a person in public so that the perosn cannot be identified The law talks about clothing that covers the face so it includes burqas and niqabs but does not include the chador The main arguments for the ban are that people wearing such types of clothing cannot be identified by police forces and that such velis are not compatible with the values of France as a state In addition there was a discussion about womens rights

John Flamsteed FRS was an English astronomer He was the first Astronomer Royal appointed in 1675

Flamsteed accurately calculated the solar eclipses of 1666 and 1668 

He was responsible for several of the earliest recorded sightings of the planet Uranus which he mistook for a star and catalogued as 34 Tauri The first of these was in December 1690 which remains the earliest known sighting of Uranus by an astronomer

Flamsteed is also remembered for his conflicts with Isaac Newton the President of the Royal Society at the time Flamsteed was refusing to publish work commissioned by the king so in 1712 Newton and Edmond Halley published a preliminary version of Flamsteeds Historia Coelestis Britannica They did so without crediting the author 

Some years later Flamsteed managed to buy many copies of the book and publicly burnt them in front of the Royal Observatory However the numerical star designations in this book are still used and are known as Flamsteed designations

In 1725 Flamsteeds own version of Historia Coelestis Britannica was published posthumously edited by his wife Margaret This contained Flamsteeds observations and included a catalogue of 2935 stars to much greater accuracy than any previous work This was considered the first significant contribution of the Greenwich Observatory In 1729 his wife published his Atlas Coelestis assisted by Joseph Crosthwait and Abraham Sharp who were responsible for the technical side

Edmond Halley FRS was an English astronomer the second Astronomer Royal

He was also a mathematician meteorologist and physicist Halley is best known for computing the orbit of the comet named after him Halleys Comet

On leaving Oxford in 1676 Halley visited the south Atlantic island of St Helena and set up an observatory with a convert24ftmadjmid long telescope which had no tube

He used the telescope to study stars from the Southern Hemisphere He later published Catalogus Stellarum Australium which was about the 341 southern stars 

In 1686 Halley published the second part of the results from his St Helena expedition This was a paper and chart on trade winds and monsoons He thought solar heating was because of atmospheric motions He also established the relationship between barometric pressure and height above sea level His charts were an advance in how to display information visually Halley also persuaded Sir Isaac Newton to publish a book about his discovery of gravity

In 1690 Halley built a diving bell a device in which the atmosphere was replenished by way of weighted barrels of air sent down from the surface In a demonstration Halley and five companions dived to 60 feet in the River Thames and remained there for over an hour and a half Halleys bell was of little use for practical salvage work as it was very heavy but he made improvements to it over time later extending his underwater exposure time to over 4 hours 

That same year at a meeting of the Royal Society Halley introduced a rudimentary working model of a magnetic compass using a liquid filled housing to damp the swing and wobble of the magnetized needle

In 1691 Halley sought the post of Savilian Professor of Astronomy at Oxford University As he was well known as an atheist he was opposed by the Archbishop of Canterbury John Tillotson The post went instead to a mathematician who had the support of Isaac Newton

In 1693 Halley published an article on life annuities which featured an analysis of age at death on the basis of the Breslau statistics Caspar Neumann had been able to provide This article allowed the British government to sell life annuities at an appropriate price based on the age of the purchaser Halleys work strongly influenced the development of actuarial science The construction of the life table for Breslau which followed more primitive work by John Graunt is now seen as a major event in the history of demography

These are generally either hli rhyming with valley or heli Hailey though some people will use Halleys supposed pronunciation of his own name hli Hawley The Hailey pronunciation inspired the rock and roll singer Bill Haley to call the rest of his band his Comets after Halleys Comet 

There are areas on the periodic table where elements have similar properties For example all of the first column elements are light very soft react with water rapidly make hydroxides that are strong bases and react with the halogens to make colorless ionic compounds 

The second column elements are a little heavier a little harder react with water a little less rapidly made hydroxides that are strong bases and react with the halogens to make colorless ionic compounds

The other categories are transition metals pnictogens chalcogens halogens and noble gases There are also inner transition metals that are divided into lanthanides and actinides

Flamsteed designations are for stars that are similar to Bayer designations However they use numbers instead of Greek letters Flamsteed designation contained 2554 stars

The numbers are usually assigned in the order of increasing right ascension within each constellation However because of the effects of precession they are now slightly out of order in some parts This method first appeared in John Flamsteeds Historia Coelestis Britannica a book that was published by Edmond Halley and Isaac Newton together in 1712

An inner transition metal is one of a group of chemical elements on the periodic table They are normally below all of the other elements They include elements 57 71 and 89 103 The lanthanides are very similar The actinides are all radioactive

 FileHEUraniumCjpgUranium metal an actinide FileLanthanumjpgLanthanum metal a lanthanide 

Molar mass is the mass of a substance that has 6022 x 1023 atoms The mass number of an element is equal to the molar mass of the element The molar mass of a chemical compound is the amount that has 6022 x 1023 molecules It can be found by adding the molar masses of all of its elements So sodium hydroxides molar mass can be found by adding the molar mass of sodium oxygen and hydrogen

Absolute hot is the hottest temperature that any entity in the atmosphere can reach It is measured at 1416785 1032 kelvins It is the opposite of Absolute 0 which is 27315C on the Celsius scale or 0 K on the Kelvin scale When something reaches this temperature normal physics completely changes

A block in the periodic table is an area of chemical elements that has the same electron arrangement There are four blocks the S block the P block the D block and the F block The alkali metals and the alkaline earth metals are in the S block The group of elements after the transition metals are the P block The transition metals are the D block as well as the last lanthanide and actinide The rest of the inner transition metals are in the F block

The D block is a group of elements on the periodic table They include the transition metals The Group 12 elements are normally called post transition metals because they are different from the transition metals The Group 12 elements are still in the d block though

A group 12 element is a group in the periodic table of chemical elements It includes zinc cadmium mercury and copernicium Copernicium is not stable so its properties are not clear They all have low melting and boiling points Mercury is even a liquid Zinc is the least electronegative and most reactive of the Group 12 elements

A period 4 element is an element in the fourth period of the periodic table It begins at potassium and ends at krypton

A kilogram per cubic meter is a measurement of density It is defined as the amount of kilograms that one cubic meter of a substance has in it

Wilfred Smokey Harris was a Canadian ice hockey forward

Harris began playing professional ice hockey with the Vancouver Millionaires in 1911 After spending some time with the Millionaires he moved on to play for the Seattle Metropolitans and Portland Rosebuds Eventually he would find his way to the other side of the country to play for the Boston Bruins in the National Hockey League where he scored the first goal in the teams history

A kilojoule per mole is a way of measuring the amount of heat needed for something It is the number of kilojoules needed to make the reaction in one mole of substance

Enthalpy of fusion is the measure of the energy needed to change a substance from a solid to a liquid Extra energy is needed more than what is obvious by the temperature scale For example ice at 0C needs to absorb heat before it converts to water at 0C The temperature does not change but energy is absorbed to change from solid to liquid

Ionization energy is the energy needed to take an electron from an atom The atom is not connected to any other atoms The chemical elements to the left of the periodic table have a much lower ionization energy The ones to the right have a much higher ionization energy The chemical elements down the periodic table have a much lower ionization energy The ionization energy increases as each electron is removed

A picometer is a measurement It is one billionth of a meter It is also one millionth of a millimeter This is very small Many atoms are larger than this

To help compare different orders of magnitude this page lists lengths between 1010 m and 109 m

The covalent radius is the radius of an atom that is measured when that atom is in a covalent bond It is normally measured in picometers It is normally found by X ray diffraction 

The Van der Waals radius is the radius of an atom that is seen as a hard sphere It is named after someone who realized that atoms were not points but actual objects It can be found by the critical point and the physical properties of a gas It also can be found by a molecular crystal 

Diamagnetism is a type of magnetism They very weakly repel magnets Most substances are diamagnetic It was discovered in 1778 when someone saw that bismuth and antimony repelled a magnet Diamagnetic things can be levitated A frog was levitated in a very strong magnet Water can be repelled by a magnet because it is diamagnetic It is too weak to be noticed normally though

Youngs modulus is the measure of how much force is needed to stretch or compress a substance Its most basic form is stressstrain Stress is the measure of a force in a certain area Strain is the amount the substance is deformed

Shear modulus is a measure of the amount of force that will shear or twist an object It is normally the letter G It is the measure of the force needed to shear an object that is attached to a solid object It can also measure the amount of force needed to twist an object

The bulk modulus is a measure of the resistance of a substance to compression on all sides Gases are easily compressed while solids and liquid are only compressed with difficulty It is measured by a measuring instrument when another object is placed under pressure

Poissons ratio is a measure of the contraction that happens when an object is stretched This contraction is perpendicular to the stretching force It can also expand as the object is compressed in a perpendicular direction

The Brinell scale is a measure of hardness in materials It is measured by making a dent in the material and seeing how deep the dent goes with a known amount of force It is similar to the Mohs hardness scale which scratches the material It is used to test the hardness of metals Normally a steel ball is pressed into an object and the dent made is measured

A CAS Registry number is a special number that is given to each chemical compound substance and alloy About 50000 numbers are added every week There are about 55 million numbers for chemical compounds in the CAS Registry It is own by the American Chemical Society

The Sugar Act was a tax passed by the British to pay for the Seven Years War called the French and Indian War in America It taxed sugar and molasses in British colonies in America and the West Indies It was also a use of mercantilism It was one of the first taxes that led to protests in the Thirteen Colonies The Sugar and Stamp Acts were done away with in 1766

The Townsend Duties was a tax passed by the British to pay for the Seven Years War in 1767 It was named for Charles Townsend who was the British Prime Minister at the time Townsend wanted the duties to make sure the colonists knew that they were under British rule It taxed a number of items including paint glass and tea The tax was resisted in the Thirteen Colonies including John Dickenson A group in Boston called the Sons of Liberty was started to protest the acts This in turn led to the Boston Massacre in 1770

The Jay Treaty was a treaty between the United States and Britain in the years following the American Revolution The main American involved in the treaty was John Jay who was also Chief Justice of the United States It was passed by Congress in 1795 It allowed for increased trade with Britain in exchange for the British giving up their forts on the Great Lakes Many people thought that the Jay Treaty was good for the British and bad for the Americans which led to them burning effigies of Jay

Aegyptosaurus meaning Egypts Lizard after the country where it was discovered is a genus of sauropod dinosaur that lived in Africa around 95 million years ago during the Late Cretaceous period Like most sauropods it had a long neck and a small skull The animals long tail probably acted as a counterweight to its body mass Its tail also ended in a whip like structure that it used to defend itself against predatory dinosaurs that lived in the same place and time as it such as Carcharodontosaurus and Spinosaurus Aegyptosaurus was a close relative of Argentinosaurus a much larger dinosaur that lived in South America at about the same time This suggests a possible land bridge between Africa and South America during the Cretaceous period 

Aegyptosaurus was discovered and named by a German paleontologist named Ernst Stromer in 1932 Its fossils have been found in Egypt Niger and in several different locations in the Sahara Desert All known specimens were discovered before 1939 The fossils were stored together in Munich but were obliterated when an Allied bombing raid destroyed the museum where they were kept in 1944 during World War II The type species is Aegyptosaurus baharijensis named after the Bahariya Formation in Egypt where the first fossils were found

Aegyptosaurus was much smaller and more common than its contemporary Paralititan Predators probably hunted the smaller Aegyptosaurus more often than the huge Paralititan

Solitary confinement is a punishment or special form of imprisonment A prisoner is not allowed contact with anyone except the prison staff It may be a kind of psychological torture It is also used to protect one prisoner from other inmates in the prison

Solitary confinement has many other names In American English it also called the hole lockdown the SHU or the pound In British English people say block or the cooler

People who think solitary confinement is necessary give several reasons Some prisoners are considered dangerous to other people in the prison Other prisoners might be able to lead crime groups even from inside jail Also solitary confinement can be used to stop prisoners from communicating with others because of possible fears about national security Finally it may be used for prisoners who are at high risk of being attacked by other inmates such as pedophiles celebrities or witnesses who are in prison themselves This form of solitary confinement is sometimes called protective custody

In the US Federal Prison system solitary confinement is known as the Special Housing Unit u Californias prison system also uses the abbreviation SHU but it stands for Security Housing Units In other states it is known as the Special Management Unit pronounced smu

Opponents of solitary confinement claim that it is cruel and unusual punishment and torture Taking away human contact and the sensory input is usually part of solitary confinement and can have a powerful negative effect on a prisoners mind This may lead to mental illnesses such as depression and even death

Thomas Gainsborough was an 18th century English portrait and landscape painter He was born in Sudbury Suffolk England He was the youngest son of John Gainsborough When he was 13 he surprised his father by how well he drew with the pencil Impressed his father let him go to London to study art in 1740 In the 1740s Gainsborough married Margaret Burr and began painting portraits more than landscapes He had two daughters In 1774 Gainsborough and his family moved to London In 1780 he painted portraits of King George III He died on 2 August 1788 when he was 61 years old because of cancer

In painting portraits he sometimes painted with brushes on sticks six feet long This put him at the same distance from subject and canvas set at right angles to each other

Kings College is one of the colleges of the University of Cambridge England It is a very famous college because it is very old and it has a world famous choir

The college was founded in 1441 Its full name is The Kings College of Our Lady and St Nicholas in Cambridge The students at the university usually just call it Kings 

Kings was founded in 1441 by King Henry VI At first the college was going to be quite small but by 1445 the college was going to be a magnificent building to show how important the king was The king gave the college a lot of money for several feudal privileges 

King Henry VI had admired what William of Wykeham had done when he founding the twin colleges of New College Oxford and Winchester College in 1379 He copied a lot of Wykehams ideas when building Kings and Eton College These colleges still have the same tie as part of their uniform

Originally the college was just for boys from Eton College It was not until 1865 that other people could study there Kings does not have any strong connection now with Eton although there is still a scholarship for a student from Eton to study at Kings 

Although building began in 1441 the project was interrupted by wars and it was not until 1544 that the inside was finished By this time King Henry VIII was King of England

Henry VI is still remembered at the College each year on the Saturday after the end of Autumn Term is Founders Day It begins with a service in the chapel the Founders Eucharist This is followed by a Founders Breakfast with ale and finally a big dinner called Founders Feast to which all members of College in their last year of studies are invited

The College Chapel is built in the style of late Gothic architecture It was built over a period of a hundred years in three stages The Chapel has the worlds largest fan vault stained glass windows and the painting The Adoration of the Magi by Rubens

Many concerts and college events take place here The world famous Chapel choir consists of choral scholars and choristers The choir sings services on most days in term time and also performs concerts and makes recordings and broadcasts Every Christmas it sings the service called Nine Lessons and Carols which is shown on BBC television as well as heard on the radio

The Chapel is so famous that it is seen as a symbol of Cambridge and appears on the logo of the city council

Nearly all subjects that can be studied at Cambridge can be studied at Kings There is a big library which includes some rare books and manuscripts

Traditionally students have come from independent schools but today the college has gradually started to include many students from state schools

As with all Cambridge colleges Kings has its own student unions both for undergraduates and for graduates

The student union has a long record of activism In the 1980s a long strike against the colleges investment in apartheid South Africa was organised

The Cellar Bar is a small room in the basement of the college which is used for music The main bar at Kings is far older The bar has been traditionally painted a socialist red including a picture of a hammer and sickle In 2004 it was redecorated with the walls painted yellow and the overall dcor lightened A hammer and sickle survives in a frame on the wall There is a lot of argument about this Kings also has a Coffee Shop next to the bar A Vacation Bar or vac bar also is sometimes open during the summer vacation run by the graduate students who stay in College throughout the year

Most Cambridge colleges celebrate May Week with a May Ball but since the early 1980s Kings has instead held a June Event which they call Kings Affair The reason they have a different event from other colleges is because many students who were not invited used to forced their way into the party A ticket usually costs around 60 which is cheap compared to the May Ball tickets for other colleges which can cost up to 200

Once someone has been admitted to the College they become a member for life For this reason Kings alumni are referred to as Non Resident Members

A leavening agent is a substance used to make a baked good rise Most people like baked goods that are risen so leavening agents are popular

Yeast is a common leavening agent It is a fungus that converts sugar to ethanol and carbon dioxide The carbon dioxide makes the bread rise This is slower and makes the bread more soft Most of the ethanol evaporates when the bread is baked The yeast is also killed when the bread is baked 

Yeast takes longer time to rise than chemical leavening agents It also can be killed by heat or salt Yeast is normally sold in small packages These contain yeast fungi 

Main articles Baking powder and baking soda

There are several chemical leavening agents For acidic foods baking soda can be used It reacts with the acid to make carbon dioxide gas which makes the bread rise For non acidic foods baking powder is used Baking powder is a mix of a powdered acid and sodium bicarbonate They react when dissolved in water to make carbon dioxide gas Baking powder is more common

Baking powder and baking soda leavening is better for certain baked goods like muffins or cakes The bread rises much faster with baking powder or baking soda It is not affected by many other ingredients But it does not have the same texture or taste that yeast has

Sweet potato pie is a type of pie It is common in the southern United States It is similar to pumpkin pie It is common at Thanksgiving It is a side dish or dessert

It is normally made as a large tart It doesnt have a top crust The filling has mashed sweet potatoes milk sugar eggs and flavoring The filling can be made light or dense Occasionally marshmallows are added as a topping

Modern art refers to artistic works produced from the 1860s to about the 1970s It refers to the style and philosophy of the art produced during that erap102 The period coincides with the invention of mechanical means of recording images photography and film

The term modern art is usually associated with art in which the traditions of the past have been thrown aside in a spirit of experimentationp419 Modern artists experimented with new ways of seeing and with fresh ideas about the nature of materials and functions of art A tendency toward abstraction is characteristic of much modern art More recent artistic production is often called Contemporary art or Postmodern art

Modern art begins with the heritage of painters like Vincent van Gogh Paul Czanne Paul Gauguin Georges Seurat and Henri de Toulouse Lautrec all of whom were essential for the development of modern art At the beginning of the 20th century Henri Matisse and several other young artists including the pre cubist Georges Braque Andr Derain Raoul Dufy and Maurice de Vlaminck revolutionized the Paris art world with wild multi colored expressive landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called Fauvism 

Henri Matisses two versions of The Dance marked a key point in his career and in the development of modern painting It reflected Matisses fascination with primitive art the intense warm color of the figures against the cool blue green background and the rhythmical succession of the dancing nudes convey the feelings of emotional liberation and hedonism 

Pablo Picasso made his first cubist paintings based on Czannes idea that all depiction of nature can be reduced to three solids cube sphere and cone With the painting Les Demoiselles dAvignon 1907 Picasso dramatically created a new and radical picture depicting a raw and primitive brothel scene with five prostitutes violently painted women reminiscent of African tribal masks and his own new Cubist inventions 

Analytic cubism was jointly developed by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque exemplified by Violin and Candlestick Paris from about 1908 through 1912 Analytic cubism the first clear manifestation of cubism was followed by Synthetic cubism practised by Braque Picasso Fernand Lger Juan Gris Albert Gleizes Marcel Duchamp and several other artists into the 1920s Synthetic cubism is characterized by the introduction of different textures surfaces collage elements papier coll and a large variety of merged subject matter

The notion of modern art is closely related to Modernism

Modern art was introduced to the United States in 1913 and through European artists who moved to the US during World War I It was only after World War II however that the US became the focal point of new artistic movements The 1950s and 1960s saw the emergence of Abstract Expressionism one of the most important of the later modernist art movements

Modern art and Impressionism dominates the world art markets Of the 20 top art prices only one is a work of classical art The worlds highest price for a work of art is Jackson Pollocks No 5 1948 privately sold by Sothebys for 1512 million dollars The modern paintings overtook the old masters in 1987

The Colonial Clash is an annual American College Football rivalry game played between the University of Massachusetts and the University of New Hampshire These are traditionally the two best programs in the championship subdivision of college football in New England

The rivalry adopted the name Colonial Clash on August 18 2010 just two months before becoming the first college football match up ever at Gillette Stadium Robert Kraft owner of Gillette Stadium and its tenants the New England Patriots and New England Revolution called it a fitting name for a border rivalry between schools who represent two of the original colonies The game is scheduled to be held at the professional venue in both 2010 and 2011

The two schools have played each other every year since 1952 with UMass holding a 43 26 3 advantage UNH captured the 2008 game 52 21 while UMass won on homecoming in 2009 23 17 In 2006 the schools played twice meeting first on November 4th in Durham NH then again on December 2nd in Amherst for the NCAA FCS Quarterfinals After each regular season meeting the Billy Knight Trophy is awarded to the MVP of the game

Since the separation of Division I college football into two separate tiers in 1978 UMass has played for the National Championship three times winning in 1999 While New Hampshire has not yet reached a National Championship game they were the 1 overall seed in the 2005 FCS playoffs

Classical physics is the study of matter and energy that was first worked out by Sir Isaac Newton and later elaborated by countless scientists Newton observed that things in nature such as the falling of an apple occur the same way each time For instance a cannon ball dropped from a tall building will strike the ground after the same length of time no matter how many times you drop it It will be going the same speed each time that it hits the ground Newton made equations that let him predict such events He called these equations the laws of physics 

Newtons laws of physics have been tested both by intentional experiments and by using them in doing jobs Sometimes other things interfere with an experiment and make the results come out a little wrong For instance in the example above a powerful wind coming from directly below the cannon ball could slow it down a little bit But when people make efforts to get rid of these extra factors the results of the experiments always get closer to what Newtons laws predict Or at least that was always the case for ordinary things and events

Classical physics turned out not to work when the things being studied were very very small or were moving very very fast So around the beginning of the twentieth century Albert Einstein worked out his Theory of Relativity and people like Neils Bohr Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schrdinger created Quantum mechanics

Huayangosaurus is a genus of stegosaurian dinosaur from the Middle Jurassic of China The name derives from Huayang an alternate name for Sichuan province 

It lived about 165 million years ago some 20 million years before its famous relative Stegosaurus appeared in North America At only 45 metres long it was also much smaller than its famous cousin Found in the Lower Shaximiao Formation Huayangosaurus shared the local landscape with the sauropods Shunosaurus Datousaurus Omeisaurus and Protognathosaurus the ornithopod Xiaosaurus and the carnivorous Gasosaurus

Like other stegosaurians Huayangosaurus was a quadrupedal herbivore with a small skull and a spiked tail Like its more famous relative Stegosaurus Huayangosaurus bore the distinctive double row of plates that characterize all the stegosaurians These plates rose vertically along its arched back In Huayangosaurus the plates were more spike like than in Stegosaurus Like Stegosaurus however it bore two pairs of long spikes extending horizontally near the end of its tail

Huayangosaurus was one of the smallest known stegosaurians at just 45 meters in length

Huayangosaurus remains from twelve individual animals were recovered from the Dashanpu Quarry near Zigong in Sichuan The type species is H taibaii

As it is the most basal stegosaurian it is placed in within its own family Huayangosauridae It is also morphologically distinct from later forms Its skull was broader and had premaxillary teeth in the front of its mouth All later stegosaurians lost these teeth

Like many other stegosaurians it had plates all down its back and spikes on its tail Two large spikes were above its hips and may have been used for deterring an attack from above Its plates were smaller than those of Stegosaurus with much less surface area Thus they would have been much less effective heat regulators one of the postulated functions of plates

Mounted skeletons of Huayangosaurus are on display at the Zigong Dinosaur Museum in Zigong and the Municipal Museum of Chongqing in Sichuan Province in China

A gas balloon is a kind of balloon that uses a gas of low density to fly using buoyancy Gas balloons sometimes fly very high very far and for a very long time

A gas balloon is different from a hot air balloon A hot air balloon uses a fire to lower the density of air A gas balloon does not use fire

Art Nouveau is an international art movement and style It was seen in art graphic design architecture and applied arts such as decoration jewellery ceramics and glassp7 It peaked in popularity at the fin de sicle of the late 19th century and continued until the First World War 

A reaction to academic art of the 19th century Art Nouveau is organic in style It has floral and plant inspired motifs and stylized flowing curvilinear formsp3 36 Art Nouveau is an approach to design according to which artists should work on everything from architecture to furniture making art part of everyday life

The movement was strongly influenced by Czech artist Alphonse Mucha Mucha produced a lithographed poster as an advertisement for the play Gismonda by Victorien Sardou starring Sarah Bernhardt 

The poster appeared on 1 January 1895 in the streets of Paris It was an overnight sensation and announced the new artistic style and its creator to the citizens of Paris Initially called the Style Mucha this soon became known as Art Nouveau

Art Nouveaus fifteen year life was most strongly felt throughout Europefrom Glasgow to Moscow to Madridbut its influence was global In France Hector Guimards Paris Metro entrances shaped the landscape of Paris and Emile Gall was at the center of the school of thought in Nancy Victor Horta had a decisive impact on architecture in Belgiump37 

Magazines like Jugend helped spread the style in Germany especially as a graphic design form while the Vienna Secessionists influenced art and architecture throughout Austria Hungary Art Nouveau was also a movement of distinct individuals such as Gustav Klimt Charles Rennie Mackintosh Alphonse Mucha Ren Lalique Antoni Gaud and Louis Comfort Tiffany each of whom interpreted it in their own individual mannerp34

Although Art Nouveau fell out of favour with the arrival of 20th century modernist styles it is seen today as an important bridge between Neoclassicism and modernism 

Art Nouveau monuments are now recognized by UNESCO on their World Heritage Sites list as significant contributions to cultural heritage The historic center of Riga Latvia with the finest collection of art nouveau buildings in Europe was inscribed on the list in 1997 in part because of the quality and the quantity of its Art NouveauJugendstil architecture Four Brussels town houses by Victor Horta were included in 2000 as works of human creative genius that are outstanding examples of Art Nouveau architecture brilliantly illustrating the transition from the 19th to the 20th century in art thought and society

This is a list of dinosaurs whose remains have been recovered from Africa 

Africa has a rich fossil record but it is patchy and incomplete Prosauropods dating from the Early Triassic period about 230 million years ago have been discovered in Madagascar Africa is rich in Triassic and Lower Jurassic dinosaurs African dinosaurs from these time periods include Syntarsus Dracovenator Melanorosaurus Massospondylus Euskelosaurus Heterodontosaurus Abrictosaurus and Lesothosaurus The Middle Jurassic is poorly represented in Africa Only the three sauropods Cetiosaurus Lapparentosaurus and Archaeodontosaurus have been discovered dating from this time period The Upper Jurassic however is well represented in Africa mainly thanks to the spectacular Tendaguru Formation Allosaurus Ceratosaurus Elaphrosaurus Giraffatitan Dicraeosaurus Janenschia Tornieria Tendaguria Kentrosaurus and Dryosaurus are among the dinosaurs whose remains have been recovered from Tendaguru This fauna seems to show strong similarities to that of the Morrison Formation in the United States and the Lourinha Formation in Portugal For example Allosaurus Ceratosaurus and Dryosaurus have been found in both the Tendaguru and the Morrison This has important biogeographical implications 

The Lower Cretaceous in Africa is known primarily from the northern part of the continent particularly Niger Suchomimus Elrhazosaurus Spinostropheus Rebbachisaurus Nigersaurus Kryptops Nqwebasaurus and Paranthodon are some of the early Cretaceous dinosaurs known from Africa The early Cretaceous was an important time for the dinosaurs of Africa because it was when Africa finally separated from South America forming the South Atlantic Ocean This was an important event because now the dinosaurs of Africa started developing endemism because of isolation The Upper Cretaceous of Africa is known mainly from North Africa During the early part of the Upper Cretaceous North Africa was home to a rich dinosaur fauna It includes Spinosaurus Carcharodontosaurus Rugops Bahariasaurus Deltadromeus Paralititan Aegyptosaurus and Ouranosaurus During the latest Cretaceous at the end of the Age of Dinosaurs Majungasaurus Masiakasaurus Rapetosaurus and the flying dromaeosaurid Rahonavis lived in Africa

The American Crocodile is a species of crocodile that lives in the Americas from the southern United States to northern South America Its scientific name Crocodylus acutus means Pointy snouted crocodile and refers to the shape of its snout American Crocodiles feed mostly on fish but large individuals occasionally prey on larger animals such as deer The crocodile will pretend it is a log and hide beneath the surface of the water When the deer comes down to the water to drink it lunges out of the water grabs the deer in its jaws and pulls it underwater where it drowns 

After the deer is dead the crocodile will grab a piece of meat in its jaws and spin around in a Death Roll American Crocodiles are a somewhat aggressive crocodile species and have been known to attack humans Attacks on humans are very rare However attacks have started happening frequently in Mexico recently

The American Crocodiles range in southern Florida overlaps with that of the closely related American Alligator However while the American Alligators range stretches as far north as Virginia the American Crocodiles range in the United States is confined to southern Florida This is because alligators are much better at tolerating cold weather than crocodiles The body temperature of alligators has been known to drop to 38 degrees Fahrenheit without any harm at all to the alligator However the American Crocodile is better at tolerating saltwater than the alligator American Crocodiles have regularly been sighted 140 miles away from shore in the Caribbean Sea

Galvanizing is the coating of a metal with a more reactive metal to stop corrosion Normally zinc is used to coat iron The zinc coating corrodes instead of the iron stopping the iron from corroding Even if the zinc is scratched it doesnt corrode Metal corrodes after paint is scratched The zinc eventually corrodes all the way and then the iron starts corroding

Galvanizing can happen in two ways There is hot dip galvanizing where the object is dipped in a pool of liquid zinc This makes a thicker coating that lasts a long time It does not have a shiny clean surface though so some people would not like it as much

There is also electro galvanizing This is the electroplating of zinc onto an object It is shiny but thinner so it doesnt last as long

The bugle is a very simple brass instrument It has no valves or other mechanisms the only way the player has to control the pitch is changing the shape of his lips This means that only notes from the harmonic series can be played

The bugle comes from instruments made from animal horns The earliest bugles were shaped in a loop usually a double loop but sometimes triple or single similar to the modern French horn and were usually used to send messages during hunts Predecessors and relatives of the developing bugle included the post horn the Pless horn and the bugle horn

The first use of a brass horn as a military signal was the Halbmondblaser meaning half moon blower used in Hanover in 1758 It was U shaped and easily carried with a shoulder strap It first arrived in England in 1764 where it was slowly it became used often by foot soldiers Cavalry did not normally use a proper bugle but instead used an early trumpet that made a sound which was easier to hear from nearby but travelled less far

The bugle is used mainly in the military where the bugle call is used to make announcements A long time ago the bugle was used in the cavalry to pass instructions from officers to soldiers during battle In the Bible bugles are found in the time of Moses when God commanded Moses to make two bugles of hammered silver in Numbers 101 3 They were used to assemble the leaders and to give marching orders to the camps

In the drum and bugle corps the bugle has changed from its military origins and now has valves In American drum and bugle corps G is considered the traditional key for bugles to be pitched in However current rules in both Drum Corps International and Drum Corps Associates define a bugle as a brass instrument in any key with 0 to 4 valves and bell front

Civilian drum corps were made using instruments sold off by the military in the early 1900s and the last official change made to the military bugle was to make them all use the key of G Bugles in other parts of the world used to be in B flat or E flat

The bugle is also used in the Boy Scouts They use some of the same calls as the military but not all

The cornet is sometimes wrongly considered to be the valved version of the bugle although it comes from the French cornet de poste

19th century versions based on the original bugle included keys and valves Keyed bugles were invented in England in the early 19th century with a patent for one design the Royal Kent bugle taken out by Joseph Halliday in 1811 This bugle was highly popular and widely in use until around 1850 for example in works by Richard Willis later bandmaster of the United States Military Academy Band at West Point This version of the bugle stopped being used when the valved cornet was invented

Modern instruments considered bugles often have valves

 Henry Spencer Moore OM CH FBA was an English sculptor and artist in the modern art genre He was best known for his abstract monumental sculptures which are located around the world as public works of art 

His forms are usually abstractions of the human figure typically depicting mother and child or reclining figures Moores works are usually suggestive of the female body apart from a phase in the 1950s when he sculpted family groups His forms are generally pierced or contain hollow spaces Many interpreters liken the undulating form of his reclining figures to the landscape and hills of his birthplace Yorkshire 

Moore was born in Castleford the son of a mining engineer He became well known through his larger scale abstract cast bronze and carved marble sculptures His ability in later life to fulfill large scale commissions made him exceptionally wealthy Yet he lived frugally and most of the money he earned went towards endowing the Henry Moore Foundation which continues to support education and promotion of the arts

WDC DML 001 is the number of a substantially complete troodontid specimen It was found in the Late Jurassic Morrison Formation of western North America

The fossil was found in Wyoming WDC DML 001 has not yet been officially named but the specimen is nicknamed Lori Lori will be described by scientists from the Wyoming Dinosaur Center a small natural history museum in Wyoming 

A phylogenetic analysis was presented in an abstract for the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology in 2005 The phylogenetic analysis placed the specimen as a close relative of Sinornithoides

This dinosaur is very significant because it is the oldest known troodontid Until the discovery of Lori troodontids were believed to have first originated and evolved in Asia and then migrated to North America Most troodontids were discovered in Asia and the previously oldest known troodontids from the Lower Cretaceous lived there

Abstract art is modern art which does not represent images of our everyday world It has colour lines and shapes but they are not intended to represent objects or living things Often the artists were influenced by ideas and philosophies

Abstract art is found in painting and in sculpture There are also many works of art which are partly abstract and partly representational And there are many artists who work in abstract and other types of modern art

Purely abstract art is a 20th century invention It grew out of the earlier forms of modern art but it is perhaps the one movement which is absolutely modern It has no roots in earlier art

One of the first to achieve complete abstract paintings was Kazimir Malevich who presented a completely black square in 1913 He was a Suprematist an art movement based on simple geometrical shapes Art based on geometry is a kind of geometric abstraction Wassily Kandinsky painted a famous work Composition VII in 1913 which was completely abstract and very complex 

The case of Manierre Dawson an American from Chicago is very interesting During a tour of Europe in 1910 he started painting true abstract works Back in America he became convinced that he could not earn a living at art and became a farmer He was forgotten until a rediscovery in 1963 He may have been the first person to paint a completely abstract work

There are many hundreds of other artists who painted abstracts Piet Mondrian and the sculptor Henry Moore deserve mention for their wide influence on other artists

After World War II abstract art became a dominant form of art in the United States with some outstanding exponents Immigrants such as Piet Mondrian Max Ernst and Mark Rothko and native born Americans such as Barnett Newman and Jackson Pollock became almost household names 

Abstract expressionism is the name given to the American post World War II art movement It was the first specifically American movement to achieve worldwide influence and put New York City at the center of the western art world a role formerly filled by Paris The term was used in 1919 but is more widely used for American work of the 1940s to 1960s Of the previous generation of painters Kandinsky is most clearly an abstract expressionist

Technically an important predecessor was surrealism with its Freudian emphasis on dreams and on spontaneous automatic or unconscious creation Jackson Pollocks dripping paint onto a canvas laid on the floor is a method of using spontaneity It was novel and brought into play several factors Action movements how the artist worked Automatism and the unconscious worked was planned but details were not 

Abstract expressionist paintings share certain characteristics The artists use large canvases sometimes very large There is an all over approach the whole canvas is treated with equal importance as opposed to the center being of more interest than the edges The canvas as the arena became a credo of Action painting while the integrity of the picture plane became a credo of the Color field painters

Painting like Jackson Pollocks which express the actions of the painter

Painting mainly of coloured shapes of a geometric kind Examples Mark Rothko Barnett Newman Josef Albers

Icelandic names are different from most other naming systems used in the West in that the names follow a patronymic surname pattern 

This means that when a person is named their last name is the name of their father plus sson So if a man called Eric had a son called Leif Leifs name would be Leif Ericsson 

The same is true for females although sometimes women take the name of their father for their last name or the name of their mother Also the suffix sdottr is added to the end of the parents name So if a girl called Astrids parents were Leif and Inga then their daughter could be called either Astrid Leifsdottr or Astrid Ingasdottr 

This is naming system is the same naming system that was used by the Vikings Iceland has kept this naming system because Iceland is an island and had little contact with the outside world for quite some time so there was not much change in things like customs language and naming systems

In mathematics odds are the chance that an event will happen compared to the chance that it will not happen For example if there is an equal chance that it will rain or that it will not rain the odds of it raining are 11 If it is twice as likely that it will not rain then the odds of it raining are 12

Odds are often used in gambling especially in horse racing

Terracotta is a red clay based baked ceramic usually unglazed 

Its uses include vessels water and waste water pipes and surface embellishment in building construction along with sculpture such as the Terracotta Army and Greek terracotta figurines The term is also used to refer to items made out of this material and to its natural brownish orange color which varies considerably 

Clay is partially dried and cast molded or hand worked into the desired shape After thorough drying it is placed in a kiln or atop combustible material in a pit and then fired 

After pit firing the hot ware is covered with sand to cool and after kiln firing the kiln is slowly cooled When unglazed the material will not be waterproof but it is suitable for in ground use to carry pressurized water for garden ware and sculpture or building decoration in tropical environments and for oil containers oil lamps or ovens Most other uses such as for table ware sanitary piping or building decoration in freezing environments require that the material be glazed Terracotta if uncracked will ring if lightly struck but not as brightly as will ware fired at higher temperature which is called stoneware The fired material is weak compared to stoneware

Some types of terracotta are created from clay that includes recycled terracotta

The unglazed color after firing can vary widely but most common clays contain enough iron to cause an orange orangish red or brownish orange color with this range including various colors described as terracotta Other colors include yellow gray and pink

The Yo yo effect means people rapidly gaining weight after a diet Other words for this activity are yo yo dieting or weight cycling Peoples weight can move down and back up like a yo yo when they follow several diets one after another A persons weight after the diet is often higher than it was before dieting 

The body needs less energy after losing weight on a diet People have less fatty tissue and often less muscle after dieting Muscle tissue needs more energy than fatty tissue Reducing the amount of muscle tissue therefore reduces the need for energy Diets also limit the number of calories people take in At some point a dieters body will change the way it uses energy if there are less calories to burn The body does this to make sure it survives when less food is available These changes in the body cause people to gain weight rapidly when they stop dieting and return to their old eating habits

People can avoid the yo yo effect by changing their diet If a diet works without the body switching to a more efficient way of using calories there will be no yo yo effect A diet should change the dieters eating habits for a long time New eating habits should not give the body more energy than it needs At the end of the diet it also makes sense to raise the number of calories someone eats slowly Exercise and sports can increase the amount of calories burned by the body rather than turned into fat

Futurism was a modern art and social movement which originated in Italy in the early 20th century It was largely an Italian phenomenon though there were parallel movements in Russia England and elsewhere The Futurists practiced in every medium of art including painting sculpture ceramics graphic design industrial design interior design theatre film fashion textiles literature music architecture and even gastronomy

The founder of Futurism and its most influential personality was the Italian writer Filippo Tommaso Marinetti Marinetti launched the movement in his Futurist Manifesto which he published for the first time on 5 February 1909 in La gazzetta dellEmilia This article was reprinted in the French daily newspaper Le Figaro on 20 February 1909 Marinetti was soon joined by the painters Umberto Boccioni Carlo Carr Giacomo Balla Gino Severini and the composer Luigi Russolo

Marinetti expressed a passionate loathing of everything old especially political and artistic tradition We want no part of it the past he wrote we the young and strong Futurists The Futurists admired speed technology youth and violence the car the airplane and the industrial city all that represented the technological triumph of humanity over nature and they were passionate nationalists They repudiated the cult of the past and all imitation praised originality however daring however violent bore proudly the smear of madness dismissed art critics as useless rebelled against harmony and good taste swept away all the themes and subjects of all previous art and gloried in science

Publishing manifestos was a feature of Futurism and the Futurists wrote them on many topics including painting architecture religion clothing and cooking

The founding manifesto did not contain a positive artistic programme The Futurists attempted to create it in their subsequent Technical Manifesto of Futurist Painting This committed them to a universal dynamism which was to be directly represented in painting 

In practice much of their work was influenced by Cubism and indeed their images were more dynamic than those of Picasso and Braque The phrase plastic dynamism has been used to describe their early work

Many Italian Futurists supported Fascism in the hope of modernizing the country Italy was divided between the industrial north and the rural archaic South Like the Fascists the Futurists were Italian nationalists radicals admirers of violence and were opposed to parliamentary democracy Marinetti was one of the first members of the National Fascist Party He soon found the Fascists were not radical enough for him but he supported Italian Fascism until his death in 1944 

The Futurists association with Fascism after its triumph in 1922 brought them official acceptance in Italy and the ability to carry out important work especially in architecture After the Second World War many Futurist artists had difficulty in their careers because of their association with a defeated and discredited regime

The Futurists renewed themselves again and again until Marinettis death 

Futurism influenced many other twentieth century art movements including Art Deco Vorticism Constructivism Surrealism and Dadaism Futurism was like science fiction in part overtaken by the future

Nonetheless the ideals of futurism remain as significant components of modern Western culture the emphasis on youth speed power and technology finding expression in much of modern commercial cinema and culture Ridley Scott consciously evoked the designs of SantElia in Blade Runner 

Echoes of Marinettis thought especially his dreamt of metallization of the human body are still strongly prevalent in Japanese culture and surface in mangaanime and the works of artists such as Shinya Tsukamoto director of the Tetsuo films Marinettis legacy is also obvious in philosophical ingredients of transhumanism especially in Europe Futurism has produced several reactions including the literary genre of cyberpunk in which technology was often treated with a critical eye Artists who came to prominence during the first flush of the Internet such as Stelarc and Mariko Mori produce work which is influenced by Futurist ideas

A revival of sorts of the Futurist movement began in 1988 with the creation of the Neo Futurist style of theatre in Chicago which uses Futurisms focus on speed and brevity to create a new form of immediate theatre There are active Neo Futurist troupes in Chicago New York and Montreal

The Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols is a form of church service used at Christmas in the Anglican Church There are nine lessons and between each reading there is a carol sung either by the choir on its own or by the whole congregation The story is told from the beginning of the Bible in which Adam disobeys God to the coming of the baby Jesus

The form of the service was started by Edward White Benson who was Bishop of Truro in Cornwall for use on Christmas Eve 1880 The service is now used by other churches all over the world not just in Anglican churches but also in some Roman Catholic and Lutheran churches In the UK the service has become the standard form for schools Christmas carol services

The best known Nine Lessons and Carols service is the one held in Kings College Cambridge every Christmas The choir carols are sung by the world famous Choir of Kings College Cambridge This service has been broadcast on BBC television for more than half a century

The first Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols at Kings College Cambridge was held on Christmas Eve in 1918 The music at the first service was directed by Arthur Henry Mann who was the organist from 1876 to 1929 The choir had 16 trebles which was the number that Henry VI said there must be when he founded the college Until 1927 the men in the choir were choral scholars and lay clerks Today 14 undergraduates from the Choir of Kings College Cambridge sing the mens parts

The service was first broadcast by the British Broadcasting Corporation in 1928 and except for 1930 has been broadcast every year since even throughout World War II in spite of the stained glass having been removed from the Chapel and the lack of heating The service is slightly different today not all the readings are from the Bible  Most of the carols are sung by the choir There are generally more than nine carols  The service starts with the famous carol Once in Royal Davids City Verse one is always sung as an unaccompanied solo by one of the boys in the choir The boy is not told that he is the one who has been chosen to sing the solo until just before the service begins

Since 1982 the Director of Music has been Stephen Cleobury Each year he commissions a composer to write a new carol for the Choir The service ends with the carol O Come all ye faithful This is followed by the Organ Voluntary In Dulci Jubilo by Johann Sebastian Bach and then another Organ Piece

A bearing is an item used to reduce friction Babbitt metal is a common bearing Some bearings can be stainless steel They decrease the rubbing inside moving things so they can move more quickly

Babbitt metal is a metal that has very little friction It is used for bearings It can be made from tin copper antimony or lead Normally it is a certain mixture of these metals It is very soft There are harder and softer parts in it though This creates small holes where grease can go in when the soft parts rub away 

Zinc aluminium also called ZA are alloys of zinc and aluminium They make good bearings They work similar to Babbitt metal Different amounts of aluminium can be added to make different properties The percentage of aluminium can be known by a number ZA8 means there is 8 aluminium

Nickel silver is an alloy It normally has copper nickel and zinc in it It is common in utensils It is also used in cymbals keys zippers and musical instruments Some coins use nickel silver It is sometimes used to trick people into thinking it is silver 

Pope Innocent III was an Italian priest of the Roman Catholic Church and the 177th Pope from 1198 until his death in 1216

Lotario di Conti was born at Anagni in central Italy His father was Count Trasimund of Segni who was a member of the Conti family 

During the short reigns of Pope Lucius III Pope Urban III Pope Gregory VIII and Pope Clement III he served in the church bureaucracy

In 1190 Clement III raised him to the rank of Cardinal 

Cardinal Segni was unanimously elected pope on January 8 1198 and he took the name of Innocent III

Pope Innocent was involved in Italian and European political disputes

Pope Innocent promoted the theory that the spiritual power of the church was greater than than any king or emperor Innocent was the first pope to form a Papal state

Innocent III was responsible for starting the Fourth Crusade the Albigensian Crusade and the Fifth Crusade

In 1215 Innocent brought together the churchs bishops and cardinals in a meeting called the Fourth Lateran Council

Grades are a teachers evaluation of a students performance They are often letters or numbers

Letter grades are most commonly used in the US and some others A D or C usually is sufficient grade to pass

Grades can also be on a number scale Typically a midpoint score is a pass Sometimes the numbers can go in descending order to indicate better performance

GPA stands for Grade Point Average which takes the grade of a student and assigns point values to them These points are added up and divided to calculate the GPA

Elaphrosaurus is a genus of theropod dinosaur that lived during the Upper Jurassic period about 150 million years ago It was 15 feet long and weighed 450 pounds 

Elaphrosaurus was a slender fast and agile predator that probably preyed on small ornithopods such as Dryosaurus 

The type specimen was found in the Tendaguru Formation in Tanzania It was a nearly complete skeleton but unfortunately it lacked a skull Since its body was similar to ornithomimids it was originally thought to be the earliest ornithomimid However later studies showed that it is actually a ceratosaur There is one named species Elaphrosaurus bambergi Remains very similar to it have also been found in the Morrison Formation in the western United States These may possibly belong to Elaphrosaurus indicating that this dinosaur had a wider range than previously thought

The United States Numbered Highways is a national system of roads in the United States These roads connect to places across the country Some of the roads are freeways which means cars must use ramps in order to get on or off the road but others are surface roads Many US Highways such as US Route 66 have had their numbers removed because of the creation of the Interstate Highway System

US highways have a special way to figure out their numbers The main US Highways usually have numbers with 1 or 2 digits An exception is US Route 101 which is a 3 digit route that is treated like a 2 digit route with a first digit of 10 US Highways that run eastwest are even numbers and northsouth US Highways are odd numbers For eastwest US Highways the small numbers are in the north and the big numbers are in the south For northsouth US Highways the small numbers are in the east and the big numbers are in the west The important eastwest US Highways usually have numbers ending in 0 and the important northsouth US Highways have numbers ending in 1 Many of the routes ending in 0 or 1 used to go across the country but no longer do because of the Interstate Highway System

US Highways that have 3 digit numbers are spurs of a 1 or 2 digit highway For example US Route 201 is a spur of US Route 1 

US Route 2 is considered a major US Highway even though it does not end in 0 US Route 163 US Route 400 US Route 412 and US Route 425 have 3 digit numbers that do not act as a spur of a 1 or 2 digit route

An indentured servant was a worker in a contract with an employer for a certain length of time Usually a laborer or craftsman would have to work three to seven years in exchange for the cost of transportation across the ocean food clothing land a place to live and other things they needed to live or work during their contract This kind of contract was called indenture Indentures were quite common in Colonial in the 17th and 18th centuries

Many immigrants arrived in Colonial America as indentured servants Their new master paid a ships captain for the workers trip across the Atlantic Ocean Most were young men and women from England Scotland and Germany under the age of 21 Their parents often made the arrangements In the 17th and early 18th century most people who came to America were indentured servants

Indentured servants often had to do very hard labor on a farm or in a household Often they were no more than slaves for their indentures During the 17th century over half of indentured servants died before their indentures ended  

In the 17th century when a person had served an indenture they usually received a piece of land usually 40 acres However by the 1690s indentured servants were not getting land as much This to led an attack on the Virginia government by Nathaniel Bacon and other indentured servants called Bacons Rebellion After Bacons Rebellion the number of indentured servants decreased and the South turned to slaves for its labor 

This type of contract has been common throughout world history in different forms Usually the worker became an indentured servant by choice

Some people claim that practices in the United Arab Emirates are examples of modern day indentured servitude Many workers from India and Pakistan must pay agents in their own countries for jobs in the Emirates The recruiting agents take the workers passports after they enter the country The workers do not know when they will get their passports back The indentured servants get basic food and housing and transportation to the work place

The United Nations passed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948 Article 4 of the Declaration says that indenture or servitude is illegal However only laws in each country can stop it In America the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 expanded the definition of servitude

Balaur is a genus of dromaeosaurid theropod dinosaur that lived in southern Europe during the Late Cretaceous period about 70 million years ago It is unique because unlike most other dromaeosaurs it had two sickle claws on each foot not just one 

It was discovered in 2010 Balaur lived on a large prehistoric island called Hateg Island Seventy million years ago sea levels were much higher than they are today Europe was an archipelago of islands Possibly because it was relatively isolated from other dinosaurs Balaur developed unique features 

There is one known species Balaur bondoc Balaur is classified as a velociraptorine Studies have shown that it is most closely related to the famous Asian dromaeosaurid Velociraptor

Lithography is a method for printing using a stone or a metal plate with a completely smooth surface 

Lithography was invented in 1796 by Bavarian author Alois Senefelder as a low cost method of publishing theatrical works Lithography can be used to print text or artwork onto paper or other suitable material

Lithography originally used an image drawn in wax or other oily substance applied to a lithographic stone as the medium to transfer ink to the printed sheet In modern times the image is often made of polymer applied to a flexible aluminum plate 

The flat surface of the plate or stone is slightly roughened or etched and divided into hydrophilic regions that accept a film of water and repel the greasy ink and hydrophobic regions which repel water and accept ink The image may be printed directly from the stone or plate or may be offset by transfer to a flexible sheet usually rubber for transfer to the printed article

This process is different from gravure or intaglio printing where a plate is engraved etched or stippled to make cavities to contain the printing ink and in woodblock printing and letterpress where ink is applied to the raised surfaces of letters or images 

In the early days of lithography a smooth piece of limestone was used After the oil based image was put on the surface a solution of gum arabic in water was applied the gum sticking only to the non oily surface During printing water adhered to the gum arabic surfaces and avoided the oily parts while the oily ink used for printing did the opposite

Chromolithography was invented by Engelmann and son who were granted a patent in 1837 After that it was a matter of time before it reached full commercial development 

By using more than one stone different colours can be added to the same picture Each colour needs a separate stone The great posters of such artists as Alphonse Mucha and Toulouse Lautrec are made like this Complicated graphics may need twenty or more stones

Norman Steven Maciver is a retired Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman who played in the National Hockey League as a member of the New York Rangers Hartford Whalers Edmonton Oilers Ottawa Senators Pittsburgh Penguins and the Winnipeg JetsPhoenix Coyotes franchise

MacIver was never drafted by an NHL franchise and instead took the university route in order to reach the NHL The defenceman played four seasons with the University of Minnesota Duluth and in 1985 86 was a finalist for the Hobey Baker Award awarded to the NCAAs top player While playing at the University of Minnesota MacIver earned a communications degree and signed as a free agent with the NHLs New York Rangers upon graduation

He played 500 regular season games in the NHL scoring 55 goals and 230 assists for 285 points and collecting 350 penalty minutes A career highlight came during the Ottawa Senators debut season of 1992 93 when Maciver led the team in scoring with 17 goals and 46 assists for 63 points in 80 games In the spring of 1996 he scored the final goal in Winnipeg Jets history prior to the teams relocation to Phoenix in the sixth game of a first round playoff series against the Detroit Red Wings After retirement he became an assistant coach for the American Hockey Leagues Springfield Falcons from 2000 to 2003 and then the NHLs Boston Bruins from 2003 to 2006

Maciver is currently an amateur scout with the NHLs Chicago Blackhawks

Shortening is a semisolid fat used in baking It makes foods crumbly Shortening doesnt smoke as easily as butter or oil and it is 100 fat Butter is 80 fat It works by stopping long gluten polymers from forming in the food It does not need to be refrigerated It also is cheaper than butter It can make foods last longer 

Shortening is made from hydrogenated oils which have trans fats in them Trans fats can cause heart attacks People making shortening try to take out the trans fats 

A semisolid thing is something that is not really a solid or a liquid Mayonnaise is an example Mayonnaise does not hold its shape like a solid but does not flow like a liquid Normally semisolids are covalent things Covalent substances get softer and softer until they melt Ionic substances melt at one temperature and do not get softer Butter can be a semisolid when it is warm Butter does not hold its shape but it does not flow like a liquid

Hydrogenation is the process of adding hydrogen to organic compounds It is done to alkenes 

Vegetable oils have alkenes in them Alkenes are liquid and spoil easily People making shortening add hydrogen to the alkene turning it into an alkane The alkanes are more solid and stable A catalyst is used to react the hydrogen with the oil This makes trans fats though

Other things can be hydrogenated too Hot nitrogen is reacted with hydrogen under high pressure with a catalyst usually nickel to make ammonia gas

A quiche is a type of pie It is savory It normally has a pie crust The filling is made of eggs and meat Ham is sometimes used

Bradyons also known as tardyons or ittyons are very small particles that travel below the speed of light as opposed to hypothetical tachyons All known subatomic particles which have mass are bradyons

FileCMS Higgs eventjpgthumbnail200rightA computer generated image of a Higgs interactionHiggs Fields are theoretical fields which affect fundamental particles giving them mass This is known as the Higgs Effect 

The Higgs Effect is not accepted to be true by all scientists since it has never been found in an experiment However most physicists believe that it is true because it could explain issues in the normal rules of physics called the Standard Model The main issue is that according to the gauge theory all force carrying particles should not have mass However the particles that carry weak force have mass The explanation of this is the Higgs Effect which would give mass to these particles Scientifically the Higgs Effect breaks SU symmetry A symmetry of a system is something you can do to the system that leaves it the same as before you acted on it A symmetry also provides a rule for how something should always act unless acted on by an outside force An example that might help thinking about one sort of symmetry is a Rubiks Cube If we take a solved Rubiks cube and scramble it up by making whatever moves we want it is still possible to solve the puzzle Since each of the moves we can make with a Rubiks cube leaves the Rubiks cube solvable we can say that these moves are symmetries of the Rubiks cube Together they form what what we call the symmetry group of the Rubiks cube Making any of these moves doesnt change the puzzle since each move leaves it solvable But we can break this symmetry by taking the cube apart and putting it back together with one of the corner pieces in a rotated position No matter what moves we try it is no longer possible to solve the Rubiks cube Breaking the cube apart and putting it back together in the wrong way is the outside force Without this outside force nothing we do to the cube makes it unsolvable The symmetry of the Rubiks cube is that it stays solvable whatever moves we make as long as we dont take apart the cube

The way that the SU symmetry is broken is known scientifically as spontaneous symmetry breaking Spontaneous means random or unexpected Symmetries are the rules that are being changed and Breaking refers to the fact that the symmetries are no longer the same The result of spontaneously breaking the SU symmetry can be a Higgs Boson

The reason that a the Higgs effect is believed to occur is that nature wants to be at its lowest energy state Although this may seem weird if you hold a pencil and then drop it the pencil will release some of its potential energy stored in its relative distance from the center of the earth This potential energy released in converted into kinetic energy Likewise the Higgs Effect will happen because gauge bosons near a Higgs Field will want to be in their lowest energy states and this would break at least one symmetry If Higgs Bosons were found to exist this would probably mean that the Higgs effect is also true

To justify giving mass to a would be massless particle scientists were forced to do something out of the ordinary They assumed that vacuumsactually had energy and that way if a particle that we think of as massive were to enter it the energy from the vacuum would be transferred into that particle giving it mass A mathematician named Jeffrey Goldstone basically proved that if you violate a symmetry a reaction will occur In the case of the rubiks cube the cube will become unsolveable if violated In the case of the Higgs field something named after Jeffrey is produced a Nambu Goldston Boson This is basically an excited or energetic form of the vacuum which can be graphed revealing that to the left The elevated areas are where the Nambu Goldstone Bosons allow particles to have mass under the energy provided by a Higgs Field

The Equal Rights Amendment was a proposed amendment to the United States Constitution in the 1970s and 1980s It would have given men and women full equality under the law Alice Paul first wrote the ERA In 1923 it was introduced in the Congress for the first time It passed both houses of Congress in 1972 after the National Organization for Women protested outside the United States Senate Some people opposed it because women were already becoming equal in most areas and women did not want to be drafted into the Vietnam War Though 35 states ratified it the amendment did not pass Most of the states that did not ratify it were in the Southern United States which is the most conservative and religious part of the country 

The ERA would say Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex

Twenty one states have a version of the ERA in their state constitutions Sixteen of those states ratified the federal ERA while five did not

The ERA has been introduced into Congress each year from 1923 to 1972 The amendment has been reintroduced in every session of Congress since 1982 In 2011 it was introduced in the US House of Representatives by 159 House cosponsors and several Senators

The genus Amanita contains about 600 species of basidiomycete mushrooms including some of the most toxic known It is found worldwide 

This genus is responsible for approximately 95 of the fatalities resulting from mushroom poisoning with the death cap accounting for about 50 on its own The most potent toxin present in these mushrooms is amanitin of which at least eight versions are known

Amanita muscaria commonly known as the fly agaric is a psychoactive fungus It is known as the fly agaric for its ability to kill houseflies when combined with milk The reason for this is that flies are attracted to the milk because it is so sweet When they drink the milk they feel the effects of the mushroom and begin to act intoxicated

Amanita phalloides commonly known as the death cap is a deadly poisonous fungus one of many in the genus Amanita Widely distributed across Europe A phalloides forms ectomycorrhizas with various broadleaved trees In some cases death cap has been accidentally introduced to new regions with the cultivation of non native species of oak chestnut and pine The large fruiting bodies appear in summer and autumn the caps are generally greenish in color with a white stipe and gills

One mushroom if eaten may destroy the liver and cause death There is no antidotep211

Their major toxic mechanism is the inhibition of RNA polymerase II a vital enzyme in the synthesis of messenger RNA microRNA and small nuclear RNA Without mRNA essential protein synthesis and hence cell metabolism grind to a halt and the cell dies

The liver is the principal organ affected as it is the organ which is first encountered after absorption in the gastrointestinal tract though other organs especially the kidneys are susceptible The RNA polymerase of Amanita phalloides is insensitive to the effects of amatoxins as such the mushroom does not poison itself

Alphonse Mucha was a Czech Art Nouveau painter and decorative artist best known for his distinct style and his images of women He produced many paintings illustrations advertisements and designs

Mucha moved to Paris in 1887 continued his studies and worked at producing magazine and advertising illustrations

Around Christmas 1894 Mucha happened to drop into a print shop where there was a sudden and unexpected need for a new advertising poster for a play starring Sarah Bernhardt the most famous actress in Paris Mucha volunteered to produce a lithographed poster within two weeks and on 1 January 1895 the advertisement for the play Gismonda by Victorien Sardou appeared on the streets of the city It was an overnight sensation and announced the new artistic style and its creator to the citizens of Paris Bernhardt was so satisfied with the success of this first poster that she entered into a 6 year contract with Mucha  

Mucha produced a flurry of paintings posters advertisements and book illustrations as well as designs for jewellery carpets wallpaper and theatre sets in what was initially called the Mucha Style but became known as Art Nouveau Muchas works frequently featured beautiful strong young women in flowing vaguely Neoclassical looking robes often surrounded by lush flowers which sometimes formed halos behind the womens heads In contrast with contemporary poster makers he used pale pastel colours

The 1900 Paris Exhibition spread the Mucha style abroad of which Mucha said I think the Exposition Universelle made some contribution toward bringing aesthetic values into arts and crafts He decorated the Bosnia and Herzegovina Pavilion and collaborated in the Austrian Pavilion

Muchas Art Nouveau style was often imitated The Art Nouveau style however was one that Mucha attempted to distance himself from He always insisted that his paintings came purely from within and from Czech art He declared that art existed only to communicate a spiritual message and nothing more He was frustrated at the fame he gained through commercial art when he most wanted to concentrate on more lofty projects that would ennoble art and his birthplace

The 1986 Pacific hurricane season officially started May 15 1986 in the eastern Pacific and June 1 1986 in the central Pacific and lasted until November 30 1986 These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean

The number of storms this season was slightly above average There were eight tropical storms and six hurricanes However the number of major hurricanes was below average with three

On May 22 a tropical depression formed It took a rare southeast track On May 24 the depression made a lope strengthened into Tropical Storm Agatha Agatha headed almost due north On May 25 reached minimal hurricane strength and turned to the east southeast Agatha weakened back to a tropical storm and then a tropical depression as it continued paralleling the coast of Mexico Agatha restrengthened into a tropical storm for 12 hours on May 28 and 29 before dissipating for good that same day

At midday on July 16 a tropical depression formed It acquired gale force winds 12 hours later and was named Estelle On July 18 it intensified into a hurricane In an environment that favored an increase of the storms winds Estelle continued strengthening and became the first major hurricane of the season on July 20 Estelles forward motion increased to close to 20 knots Estelles path took it towards a potential landfall on the Big Island Due to a shearing environment from a trough Estelle weakened as it continued approaching Hawaii A possible recurve never materialized and the cyclone continued its path towards the Hawaiian Islands

The hurricane veered to west and passed south of the islands Estelle weakened to a tropical storm on July 23 Early on July 25 Tropical Storm Estelle weakened to a depression The tropical cyclone weakened two days later

Due to its rapid motion Estelle kept pace with a large swell of water that it generated In combination with a high spring tide and peripheral winds generated by Estelle huge waves crashed on the shores of the Big Island on the afternoon of July 22 The high waves washed away five beachfront homes and severely damaged dozens of others in Vacation Land The total damage was around 2 million dollars On Maui waves washed away a dirt road on the eastern part of the island between Kipahulu and Kaupo

After Estelle passed by the islands moisture related to the tropical cyclone caused heavy rainfall in the Kau and Puna districts on the Big Island After Estelle dissipated its moisture continued to spread over the islands causing significant rainfall and thunderstorms over the archipelago The only deaths reported were two drownings on Oahu that occurred on July 23 

A cloud mass became a tropical depression late on the September 27 roughly 200 miles southwest of Guatemala Paralleling the Mexican coastline the system became a tropical storm late on the 29th about 350 miles west southwest of Acapulco It steadily intensified peaking with winds of 100 mph This made Paine a Category 2 hurricane Paine entered the Gulf of California on the evening of October 1 The hurricane increased its motion crossing the coast near San Jose while still a hurricane The system moved rapidly across Mexico bringing significant rains from west Texas across Oklahoma and Kansas into the Mid Mississippi Valley Flooding was reported with the worst flood begin near Oklahoma City the capital of the US State of Oklahoma

The next tropical cyclone originated as a tropical disturbance which moved westward offshore Nicaragua During the early afternoon of the 15th ship reports indicated the formation of a tropical depression near 102N 927W The cyclone moved at a quick pace to the west northwest south of a warm core ridge Early on the morning of the 16th Roslyn became a tropical storm By the morning of the October 17 it had developed into a hurricane south of Acapulco

Roslyn began to recurve within a few hundred miles of Manzanillo Striking Mazatln as a marginal hurricane on the 20th the remains of the system caused heavy rains along the Middle Texas coast It later moved northward through the Mississippi Valley spreading light to moderate rains along its path and then started to spread rains across the Southern United States Click here for the storm total rainfall graphic for Roslyn

The 1985 Pacific hurricane season was an event in tropical cyclone meteorology It officially started on May 15 1985 in the eastern Pacific and on June 1 1985 in the central Pacific and lasted until November 30 1985 These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean

At the time the 1985 season was the most active on record in the eastern north Pacific with 25 tropical cyclones forming Of those 22 attained tropical storm intensity 12 reaching hurricane intensity and 8 becoming major hurricanes by reaching Category 3 or higher on the Saffir Simpson Scale In addition three additional systems formed in the central north Pacific of which one became a hurricane and another became a typhoon before re crossing the international dateline

Despite the activity there were few notable systems this year The only cyclone to make landfall was Hurricane Waldo which caused damage in Mexico Elsewhere surf from Hurricane Pauline caused damage in Hawaii and either Pauline or the following system sank a sailing vessel

Hurricane Pauline caused heavy surf along the Big Island which washed debris up onto roads There was no damage reported It threatened the islands enough to prompt a hurricane watch which means winds of 74 mph or higher are possible during the next 36 hours However the hurricane turned away

Rick was the strongest storm of the season and at the time had the second strongest winds recorded in a tropical cyclone in the Central Pacific It may also have contributed to the sailing vessel being overdue

Terry was a powerful major hurricane that formed by the 15th of September It became a major hurricane fours days later on the 19th but it did not affect land while doing so It eventually dissipated due to hostile conditions on the 24th without ever impacting land

Tropical Depression Twenty Three E formed from a disturbance on October 7 In a environment over warm waters it rapidly intensified reaching Tropical Storm intensity the same day it formed Waldo moved towards the Mexican coast Just after peaking as a Category 2 hurricane on the hurricane scale Waldo made landfall southwest of Culiacn Waldo rapidly dissipated over land Major damage but no deaths were reported in Mexico It was the seasons lone landfall

The first recorded twenty second storm of a season formed October 25 It strengthened into Tropical Storm Xina early October 27 Xina began to start tracing out a huge oblong loop beneath an anticyclone Xina peaked as a minimal major hurricane on October 29 As it finished the loop and left the cover of the anticyclone Xina started falling apart Cool waters took their toll on the cyclone and Xina dissipated on November 5

Had the list of names not been extended Xina would have been named Alpha instead However the anticipated exhaustion of the old list was averted meaning that the east Pacific has never exhausted its list Xina stayed at sea and no casualties or damages were reported 

The following names were used for named storms that formed in the eastern Pacific in 1985 No names were retired so it was used again in the 1991 season The name Dolores was misspelled as Delores in 1991 This is the same list used for the 1979 season except for the added names Storms were named Kevin Linda Marty Nora Olaf Pauline Rick Sandra Terry Vivian Waldo and Xina for the first time in 1985 Names that were not assigned are marked in gray

One name from the Central Pacific list was used Nele It was the first usage for this name One storm Typhoon Skip formed in the central Pacific but did not receive a name until it reached the west Pacific therefore only Nele was used from the central Pacific list

Later during the 80s the added names were made a permanent part of the Eastern Pacific lists and other names were added for even numbered years

Had the names not been added this season would have been the first Pacific or Atlantic hurricane season to exceed the list and had to have used a Greek letter named storm This would not occur until the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season which saw an unprecedented 28 storms and 6 Greek names

Aliens of the Deep is a 2005 documentary film directed in part by James Cameron and filmed in the IMAX 3D format It was produced by Walden Media and Buena Vista Pictures Cameron worked with NASA scientists to explore the Mid Ocean Ridges under water chains of mountains in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans that are home to some of the planets more unusual forms of life

Cameron joins up aboard the Russian research ship Akademik Mstislav Keldysh with a group of NASA scientists as well as some Russian marine biologists to investigate ten hydrothermal vents in both the Atlantic and Pacific The vents have their own unique ecosystem which support diverse organisms such as giant tube worms swarms of blind white crabs and vast amounts of shrimp which are capable of seeing water that is heated by the vents These creatures do not need sunlight like other organisms and instead get their energy from the vents They are able to survive in the superheated and sulfurous water Because of this the documentary suggests that this is what life beyond Earth might look like As some alien ecosystems are likely to be a lot harsher than a typical terrestrial ecosystem these exotic vents provide an insight into some of the forms that alien life might take

The documentary shows Camerons passion for exploring the oceans as well as his interest in extraterrestrial life It also shows the technology used to reach such depths

The film is similar to Camerons earlier documentary Ghosts of the Abyss which involves him journeying to the wreck of the RMS Titanic It too was filmed in the 3 D IMAX format

The area was first settled in 1834 by freed African American slaves and African Americans who were born free Most of them were from the US state of Maryland and were there under the aurhority of the Maryland State Colonization Society In 1838 other African American settlements were joined to the Commonwealth of Liberia which said that it was independent and not a part of Liberia in 1847 The Maryland in Liberia colony remained apart as the state colonization society did not want anyone else to be able to trade goods On 2 February 1841 Maryland in Africa became the State of Maryland The state said that it was independent on 29 May 1854 and that it would be called Maryland in Liberia with its capital at Harper

In December 1831 the Maryland state legislature said that it would give US10000 for 26 years to take free blacks and former slaves from the United States to Africa and the Maryland State Colonization Society was started for this purpose

On 29 May 1854 The State of Maryland declared its independence naming itself Maryland in Liberia with its capital at Harper Liberia It held the land along the coast between the Grand Cess and San Pedro Rivers However it would last just three years as its own country

Soon afterwards local tribes including the Grebo and the Kru attacked the State of Maryland Unable to defend itself Maryland asked Liberia its more powerful neighbor for help President Roberts sent military help and an alliance of Marylanders and Liberian militia troops stopped the local tribesmen However it was now clear that the Republic of Maryland could not survive on its own and 18 March 1857 Maryland was added by Liberia and became known as Maryland County

The Year of the Four Emperors was a year in the history of the Roman Empire AD 69 in which four emperors ruled in a remarkable turnover The four emperors were Galba Otho Vitellius and Vespasian

The suicide of emperor Nero in 68 was followed by a brief period of civil war the first Roman civil war since Mark Antonys death in 30 BC Between June of 68 and December of 69 Rome witnessed the successive rise and fall of Galba Otho and Vitellius until the final accession of Vespasian the first ruler of the Flavian Dynasty

This was an example of the political disturbances which occurred in the history of the Roman Empire The military and political anarchy created by this civil war had serious repercussions such as the outbreak of the Batavian rebellion The Jewish Revolt was already ongoing

By June of 68 the Senate took the initiative to rid itself of Nero declaring him a public enemy and Galba emperor The Praetorian Guard were bribed to betray Nero and Nero committed suicide Galba was recognized as emperor and welcomed into the city at the head of his legions

Galba did not remain popular for long On his march to Rome he either destroyed or took enormous fines from towns that did not accept him immediately In Rome Galba cancelled all the reforms of Nero including benefits for many important persons The army was not happy either After his safe arrival in Rome Galba refused to pay the rewards he had promised to soldiers who had supported him The Roman treasury was indeed in a bad way after Neros extravagances but Galba did not handle the situation well

Like Nero Galba had a fear of conspirators and executed many senators and equites without trial Moreover in the start of the civil year of 69 on January 1 the legions of Germania Inferior refused to swear allegiance and obedience to the new emperor On the following day the legions acclaimed Vitellius their governor as emperor

Marcus Salvius Otho bribed the Praetorian Guard already very unhappy with the emperor to his side When Galba heard about the coup dtat he went to the streets in an attempt to normalize the situation It proved a mistake because he could attract no supporters Shortly afterwards the Praetorian Guard killed him in the Forum

Otho was recognised as emperor by the Senate that same day The new emperor was saluted with relief Although ambitious and greedy Otho did not have a record for tyranny or cruelty and was expected to be a fair emperor However trouble in the form of Vitellius was marching down on Italy from Germany

Vitellius had behind him the finest elite legions of the empire composed of veterans of the Germanic Wars These would prove to be his best arguments to gain power Otho was not keen to begin another civil war and sent emissaries to propose a peace and inviting Vitellius to be his son in law It was too late to reason Vitellius generals had half of his army heading to Italy After a series of minor victories Otho was defeated in the Battle of Bedriacum Rather than flee and attempt a counter attack Otho decided to put an end to the anarchy and committed suicide He had been emperor for a little more than three months

On the news of Othos suicide Vitellius was recognised as emperor by the Senate Given this recognition Vitellius set out for Rome He faced problems from the start of his reign The city was left very skeptical when Vitellius chose a day of bad auspices to accept the office of Pontifex Maximus

Events would seemingly prove them right With the throne tightly secured Vitellius engaged in a series of feasts banquets and triumphal parades that drove the imperial treasury close to bankruptcy Debts were quickly accrued and money lenders started to demand repayment 

Vitellius showed his violent nature by ordering the torture and execution of those who dared to make such demands Vitellius took the step of killing citizens who named him as their heir often together with any co heirs Moreover he engaged in a pursuit of every possible rival inviting them to the palace with promises of power only to have them assassinated

Vespasian had been given a special command in Judaea by Nero in 67 with the task of putting down the Great Jewish Revolt He gained the support of the governor of Syria Gaius Licinius Mucianus A strong force drawn from the Judaean and Syrian legions marched on Rome under the command of Mucianus Vespasian himself travelled to Alexandria where he had been acclaimed Emperor on July 1 thereby gaining control of the vital grain supplies from Egypt Vespasians son Titus remained in Judaea to deal with the Jewish rebellion Before the eastern legions could reach Rome the Danubian legions of the provinces of Raetia and Moesia also acclaimed Vespasian as Emperor in August and led by Marcus Antonius Primus invaded Italy In October the forces led by Primus won a crushing victory over Vitellius army at the Second Battle of Bedriacum

Surrounded by enemies Vitellius made a last attempt to win the city to his side distributing bribes and promises of power where needed The Danube army was now very near Rome Vitellius went into hiding and prepared to flee but decided on a last visit to the palace There he was caught by Vespasians men and killed In seizing the capital they burned down the temple of Jupiter

The Senate acknowledged Vespasian as emperor on the following day It was 21 December 69 the year that had begun with Galba on the throne

microSD is a kind of removable flash memory card used for storing information SD is an abbreviation of Secure Digital The cards are used in cellular phones They are also used in newer types of handheld GPS devices portable media players digital audio players expandable USB flash memory drives Nintendo DS flashcards and digital cameras

It is the smallest memory card that can be bought at 15 mm 11 mm 1 mm it is about a quarter of the size of a normal sized SD card There are adapters that make the small microSD able to fit in things that have slots for standard SD miniSD Memory Stick Duo and even USB cards But not all of the different cards can work together Many microSD cards sold on the internet and in stores have a standard SD adapter so that people can use them in things that take standard SD but not microSD cards

TransFlash and microSD cards are the same but microSD has support for SDIO mode so that non memory cards like Bluetooth GPS and Near Field Communication devices to use the card also

Some people have a hard time knowing the difference between the microSD and the newer microSDHC format The SD and SDHC act the same but not all devices are able to be used with the newer format This is even true with devices that have been made by SanDisk like their e200 series of MP3 players Using 3rd party firmware SDHC reading can sometimes be done

TransFlash cards are sold in 16MB and 32MB sizes microSD cards are sold in many sizes from 64 MB to 2 GB while microSDHC cards are sold in sizes between 4 GB to 64 GB

The microSD format was made by the company SanDisk It was first called T Flash and then TransFlash before being named microSD when it started to be used by the SD Card Association Other flash card formats approved by the SDA include miniSD and standard SD card

The SDA announced the microSD format at CTIA Wireless 2005 on March 14 2005 and the final microSD details were announced on July 13 2005 Then they were first sold the microSD format was sold in sizes of 32 64 and 128 MB SanDisk made a 2 GB microSD card on July 2006 at first costing 99 Since then the prices for flash memory devices have gotten much lower At the time of April 2009 the same 2 GB card could be bought for as low as 12 at department stores and by May 2009 for as low as 6 at online electronics stores In January 2010 a 16 GB micro SD card class 2 cost about 40 and a 4 GB class 2 micro SD card about 8

It is predicted that the SDXC format will be moved over to the MicroSD cards one dayCitation neededdateMay 2010

The amount of power used by microSD cards are all different because they are made by different manufacturers but it looks like it is in the range of 20 100 mA at a supply voltage of 33 V TwinMos technologies says that the cards carry a maximum of 45 mA during transfer Toshiba lists 80 100 mA

Vespasian was Roman Emperor from 69 AD to 79 

Vespasian was the founder of the Flavian dynasty which ruled the empire for a quarter century Although he held the consulship in 51 AD Vespasian became more highly regarded as a successful military commander He took part in the Roman invasion of Britain in 43 ADp16 and the Jewish rebellion of 66 ADp2938 

While Vespasian was preparing to besiege Jerusalem during the latter campaign emperor Nero committed suicide plunging the empire into a year of civil war known as the Year of the Four Emperors After the emperors Galba and Otho perished in quick succession Vitellius became emperor in April 69 AD 

In response the armies in Egypt and Judaea declared Vespasian emperor on July 1p43 In his bid for imperial power Vespasian joined forces with Mucianus the governor of Syria and Primus a general in Pannonia Primus and Mucianus led the Flavian forces against Vitellius while Vespasian gained control of Egypt On 20 December Vitellius was defeated and the following day Vespasian was declared emperor by the Roman Senate

Little factual information survives about Vespasians government during the ten years he was emperor His reign is best known for financial reforms the successful campaign against Judaea and several ambitious construction projects such as the Colosseum Upon his death in 79 he was succeeded by his eldest son Titus

Titus was Roman Emperor from 79 to 81 A member of the Flavian dynasty Titus succeeded his father Vespasian upon his death

Before becoming emperor Titus gained renown as a military commander He served as a military tribune in Germany and Britain 

It was he who brought the reinforcements after the revolt of Boudicca Two tribes had destroyed Colchester London and St Albans and wiped out a whole legion but were finally defeated by the Roman governor of Britain

He served under his father in Judaea during the First Jewish Roman War where he commanded a legion The campaign came to a brief halt with the death of emperor Nero in 68 but soon continued in the Year of the Four Emperors 

When Vespasian was declared emperor on 1 July 69 Titus was left in charge of ending the Jewish rebellion In 70 he successfully laid siege to Jerusalem He destroyed the city and Temple in Jerusalem For this Titus was awarded a Roman triumph To this day the Arch of Titus commemorates his victory

When Vespasian became Emperor Titus and his brother Domitian received the title of Caesar from the Senate Titus held seven consulships during Vespasians reign and acted as his secretary appearing in the Senate on his behalf 

Under the rule of his father Titus gained some notoriety in Rome as a ruthless Prefect of the Praetorian Guard 

During the Jewish wars Titus had begun a love affair with Berenice sister of Agrippa II The Herodians had collaborated with the Romans during the rebellion and Berenice herself had supported Vespasian upon his campaign to become emperor 

In 75 she returned to Titus and openly lived with him in the palace as his promised wife The Romans were wary of her and disapproved of their relationship When the pair was publicly denounced by Cynics in the theatre Titus caved in to the pressure and sent her away but his reputation suffered

Titus ruled to great acclaim after the death of Vespasian in 79 He was considered a good emperor by Suetonius and other contemporary historians 

As emperor he is best known for completing the Colosseum and for his generosity in relieving the suffering caused by two disasters the Mount Vesuvius eruption of 79 and a fire in Rome in 80 

Because of his supposed vices many Romans feared he would be another Nero But Titus proved to be an effective emperor and was well loved when people found that he had virtues instead of vices One of his first acts as an emperor was to stop trials based on treason charges which had long plagued Rome 

Under Augustus the law of treason had been revived and applied to cover slander and libel This led to a long cycle of trials and executions under such emperors as Tiberius Caligula and Nero This spawned entire networks of informers who terrorized Rome for decades Titus put an end to this practice against himself or anyone else declaring

It is impossible for me to be insulted or abused in any way For I do naught that deserves censure and I care not for what is reported falsely

Consequently no senators were put to death during his reign he thus kept to his promise that he would assume the office of Pontifex Maximus for the purpose of keeping his hands unstained The informers were publicly punished and banished from the city Titus then made it unlawful for persons to be tried under different laws for the same offense Finally when Berenice returned to Rome he sent her away

After barely two years in office Titus died of a fever on 13 September 81 He was deified by the Roman Senate and succeeded by his younger brother Domitian

Nerva was Roman Emperor from 96 to 98 

Nerva became emperor at the age of sixty five after a lifetime of imperial service under Nero and the rulers of the Flavian dynasty Under Nero he was a member of the imperial team and played a vital part in exposing the Pisonian conspiracy of 65 

Later as a loyalist to the Flavians he attained consulships in 71 and 90 during the reigns of Vespasian and Domitian respectively 

On 18 September 96 Domitian was assassinated in a palace conspiracy On the same day Nerva was declared emperor by the Roman Senate As the new ruler of the Roman Empire he vowed to restore liberties which had been cut during the autocratic government of Domitian 

Nervas brief reign was marred by financial difficulties and his inability to assert his authority over the Roman army 

A revolt by the Praetorian Guard in October 97 caused him to adopt an heir After some deliberation Nerva adopted Trajan a young and popular general as his successor After barely fifteen months in office Nerva died of natural causes 

Although much of his life remains obscure Nerva was considered a wise and moderate emperor by ancient historians Recent historians have revised this assessment characterizing Nerva as a well intentioned but ultimately weak ruler whose reign brought the Roman Empire to the brink of civil war 

Nervas greatest success was his choice of Trajan This led to a peaceful transition after his death thus founding the Nerva Antonine dynasty

Evolutionary suicide the an idea that the adaptation of an individual animal works in such a way that an entire species dies out This is different from group selection where the biological fitness of an animal is linked to the entire population

The idea is that evolution makes plants and animals pass on their genes to the next generation more efficiently but it does not guarantee the survival of the population or the species For this reason the evolutionary benefit of an individual and its descendants might lead to the extinction of the respective population or the whole species

An example of this would be that an animal of a population starts to eat the seeds or the buds of a food plant This would destroy the supply of plants that would usually be available All animals would then starve 

As of 2010 there is no proof that evolutionary suicide exists Different scientific studies found a correlation between acquired traits and a higher risk of a population disappearing

A candidate for a future evolutionary suicide migh be cod Cod is caught as fish by humans There is evolutionary pressure on the bigger fish which are caught This has led to the fish not growing as much as they used to They also mature earlier These adaptations are a reaction that should save the species from becoming extinct in the short run They do however also mean that the amount of offspring per fish is reduced This bears the risk of the population becoming extinct

Territorialism also known as Statism was a Jewish political movement Jewish people wanted some land to live in that was big enough for them It did not necessarily have to be in the land where the country of Israel is today and it did not necessarily have to be its own country

Before 1905 some Zionist leaders were thinking about making places for Jews to call home other than Palestine Theodor Herzls Der Judenstaat argued for a Jewish state in either Palestine our ever memorable historic home or Argentina one of the most fertile countries in the world Many of the socialist Zionist groups were more territorialist than Zionist such as Nachman Syrkins Zionist Socialist Workers Party

The Jewish Colonization Association started in 1891 by the Baron Maurice de Hirsch was started to help move many Jews from Russia and other Eastern European countries It wanted to move them to land where they could grow food and that it would buy It had in mind land in North and South America

In 1903 British cabinet ministers suggested the British Uganda Program land for a Jewish state in Uganda At first Herzl said no to the idea because he liked Palestine better After the April 1903 Kishinev pogrom in which many Jews were violently attacked in Russia Herzl suggested to the Sixth Zionist Congress to look at the offer as a temporary way to keep Russian Jews safe The plan was very controversial and many Russian Jews were so upset that they walked out of the meeting Few historians believe that such a settlement idea could have attracted immigrants received much money in donations or been supported by many other countries Because some members of the Zionist leadership liked the idea however peace was kept in the movement because they voted to start a committee to look at the possibility They did not officially say no to the idea until the 7th Zionist Congress in 1905

Because of this the Jewish Territorialist Organization led by Israel Zangwill split off from the Zionist movement It tried to find land where Jews could settle in different parts of America Africa Asia and Australia but with little success The ITO broke up in 1925

As the Holocaust became close and as Nazis were discriminating against Jews in Germany Isaac Nachman Steinberg started the Freeland League in the United States in 1935 This organization tried but did not succeed to start a new Jewish country by getting a large piece of land in places in Ecuador Australia or Suriname where not many people lived One of the more well known tries was the Kimberley Plan to get land in Australia After the State of Israel was created in 1948 Steinberg had criticized the exclusivist politics of the Zionist government and continued his attempts to create a non nationalist Jewish settlement in some other part of the world After Steinberg died in 1957 the Freeland League was led by Mordkhe Schaechter who gradually changed the focus of the organization to more cultural Yiddishist goals

Hadrian was Roman Emperor from 117 to 138 

He is best known for building Hadrians Wall which marked the northern limit of Roman territory in Britain In Rome he built the Pantheon and the Temple of Venus and Roma 

In addition to being emperor Hadrian was a humanist and a lover of Greek culture in all his tastes Hadrian was the third of the so called Five Good Emperors

Hadrian was born to a Hispano Roman family probably in Italica His predecessor Trajan was a maternal cousin of Hadrians father Trajan never officially designated an heir but according to his wife Pompeia Plotina Trajan named Hadrian emperor immediately before his death Trajans wife and his friend Licinius Sura were well disposed towards Hadrian and he may well have owed his succession to them

During his reign Hadrian traveled to nearly every province of the empire Hadrian sought to make Athens the cultural capital of the empire he ordered the construction of many temples in the city 

Hadrian spent much of his time with the military He usually wore military attire and dined and slept amongst the soldiers He ordered military training and drilling to be more rigorous and even made use of false reports of attack to keep the army alert Despite his fondness for the army there was little military activity throughout the empire while Hadrian reigned After he became emperor Hadrian withdrew from Trajans conquests in Mesopotamia and Armenia and even considered abandoning Dacia Late in his reign he stopped the Bar Kokhba revolt in Judaea renaming the province Syria Palaestina 

In 136 an ailing Hadrian adopted Lucius Aelius as his heir but he died suddenly two years later In 138 Hadrian promised to adopt Antoninus Pius if he would in turn adopt Marcus Aurelius and Aelius son Lucius Verus as his own eventual successors Antoninus agreed and soon afterward Hadrian died at his villa near Tibur

Paul Revere was a silversmith and an early United States patriot He was a messenger and soldier in the American Revolution

Revere worked with metals in the city of Boston where he was born He married Sarah Orne in 1757 and they had six children who lived After Orne died in 1773 he married Rachel Walker and they had five children who lived 

In the 1760s Revere joined a group called Sons of Liberty The group wanted the better treatment for the American colonies from the British government

Many people in Boston were unhappy about British troops being in the city On March 5 1770 a fight started and British troops shot and killed five people in Boston This was called the Boston Massacre Revere drew a picture of the shootings He had a man named Christian Remick add color to it Many people saw copies of the picture which was called The Bloody Massacre perpetrated in King Street People were angry about what had happened Revere would make more pictures for the Sons of Liberty over the next few years

Revere is most famous for his Midnight Ride on the night of April 18 19 1775 The British Army was marching to the city of Concord Massachusetts Dr Joseph Warren sent Revere and a man named William Dawes to ride on horseback from Boston to Lexington Massachusetts to warn John Hancock and Samuel Adams Hancock and Adams were American patriots who were against the British army Revere warned other patriots along the way 

When Paul Revere arrived in Lexington he shouted loudly to wake up and warn the people Revere was soon joined by Dawes who also told the people that the British regular soldiers were coming Revere and Dawes were later stopped by the British in a field in the city of Lincoln Massachusetts But both men escaped Revere ran away on foot leaving his horse behind

When he got back to Lexington the fighting had already started 

In 1861 American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow published a poem called Paul Reveres Ride Although this poem made Revere more famous not every part of the poem was exactly true Also the poem did not talk about Dawes In response in 1896 poet Helen Moore wrote a poem called The Midnight Ride of William Dawes about how Dawes had been forgotten

Antoninus Pius or simply Antoninus was Roman Emperor from 138 to 161 

As a private citizen between 110 and 115 he married Annia Galeria Faustina the Elder They are believed to have enjoyed a happy marriageFaustina was a beautiful woman renowned for her wisdom She spent her whole life caring for the poor and assisting the most disadvantaged Romans

Faustina bore Antoninus four children two sons and two daughters They included Faustina the Younger a future Roman Empress who married her maternal cousin future Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius

When Faustina died in 141 Antoninus was greatly bereaved and had a temple built in the Roman Forum in her name had coins with her portrait struck in her honor and created a charity called Girls of Faustina which assisted orphaned girls 

Having filled with success the offices of quaestor and praetor he was consul in 120 He was appointed by Hadrian as one of the four proconsuls to administer Italia then Asia The Emperor Hadrian adopted him as his son and successor on 25 February 138 after the death of his first adopted son Lucius Aelius The condition was that Antoninus would in turn adopt Marcus Annius Verus the son of his wifes brother and Lucius son of Aelius Verus who afterwards became the emperors Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus

There are no records of any military related acts in his time One modern scholar has written It is almost certain not only that at no time in his life did he ever see let alone command a Roman army but that throughout the twenty three years of his reign he never went within five hundred miles of a legion His reign was the most peaceful in the entire history of the Principate

Unrest in Britannia is believed to have led to the construction of the Antonine Wall from the Firth of Forth to the Firth of Clyde although it was soon abandoned 

He was virtually unique among emperors in that he dealt with crises without leaving Italy once during his reign He dealt with provincial matters through their governors or through imperial letters to the cities such as Ephesus This style of government was highly praised by his contemporaries and by later generations

Those twenty two years were not remarkably eventful in comparison to those before and after his reign We might think that he wisely cut the activities of the Roman Empire to a careful minimum Perhaps he was uninterested in events away from Rome and his inaction contributed to the troubles which faced Marcus Aurelius and other emperors of the third century 

German historian Ernst Kornemann in his Rmische Geschichte 2 vols ed by H Bengtson Stuttgart 1954 said that the reign of Antoninus comprised a succession of grossly wasted opportunities given the upheavals that were to come There is more to this argument given that the Parthians in the East were themselves soon to make no small amount of mischief after Antoninus passing Kornemanns brief is that Antoninus might have waged preventive wars to head off these outsiders

After the longest reign since Augustus Antoninus died of fever about twelve miles from Rome on 7 March 161 The last word that he uttered when the tribune of the night watch came to ask the password was aequanimitas 

Black Peter is in the folklore and legends of the Netherlands and Flanders a companion of Saint Nicholas This is celebrated every year on 5 December The Black Peters distribute sweets and presents to all good children

Lucius Verus was Roman co emperor with Marcus Aurelius from 161 until his death In practice he was the junior partner of the great Marcus Aurelius

When his father died in early 138 Hadrian chose Antoninus Pius as his successor Antoninus was adopted by Hadrian on the condition that Verus and Hadrians great nephew Marcus Aurelius was to be adopted by Antoninus as his sons and heirs

Verus started his political career as a quaestor in 153 became consul in 154 and in 161 was consul again with Marcus Aurelius as his senior partner

Antoninus died on 7 March 161 and was succeeded by Marcus Aureliusp156 Although the senate planned to confirm Marcus alone he refused to take office unless Lucius received equal powersp116 The senate accepted granting Lucius the imperium the tribunician power and the name Augustus It was the first time that Rome was ruled by two emperorsp117tagrefThere was however much precedent The consulate was a twin magistracy and earlier emperors had often had a subordinate lieutenant with many imperial offices Many emperors had planned a joint succession in the pastAugustus planned to leave Gaius Caesar and Lucius Caesar as joint emperors on his death Tiberius wished to have Gaius Caligula and Tiberius Gemellus do so as well Claudius left the empire to Nero and Britannicus imagining that they would accept equal rankbut all of these arrangements had ended in failure either through premature death or judicial murderp117groupnotes

In spite of their nominal equality Marcus held more authority than Verus He had been consul once more than Lucius he had shared in Pius administration and he alone was Pontifex Maximus It would have been clear to the public which emperor was the more senior As the biographer wrote Verus obeyed Marcusas a lieutenant obeys a proconsul or a governor obeys the emperorp117

Immediately after their senate confirmation the emperors proceeded to the camp of the praetorian guard Lucius addressed the assembled troops which then acclaimed the pair as imperatores Then like every new emperor since Claudius Lucius promised the troops a special donativep117 The ceremony was perhaps not entirely necessary given that Marcus accession had been peaceful and unopposed but it was good insurance against later military troubles

War with Parthia had started as soon as Antoninus died

Over the winter of 16162 as more bad news arriveda rebellion was brewing in Syriait was decided that Lucius should direct the Parthian war in person He was stronger and healthier than Marcus the argument went more suited to military activityp123 Whatever the case the senate gave its assent and Lucius left Marcus would remain in Rome the city demanded the presence of an emperor

Furius Victorinus one of the two praetorian prefects was sent with Lucius as were a pair of senators and part of the praetorian guardp125 Victorinus had previously served as procurator of Galatia giving him some experience with eastern affairs Since a prefect had to accompany the guard Victorinus was the clear choicep161

Laelianus one of the Senators was a serious man and an old fashioned disciplinarian Bassus the other Senator had been governor of Lower Moesia and was also made comesp125 

Lucius left in the summer of 162 to take a ship from Brundisium Marcus followed him as far as Capua Lucius feasted himself in the country houses along his route and hunted at Apulia He fell ill at Canosa probably afflicted with a mild stroke and took to bed Marcus made prayers to the gods for his safety in front of the senate and hurried south to see himp125

Verus continued eastward via Corinth and Athens accompanied by musicians and singers as if in a royal progress It is not known how long Verus journey east took he might not have arrived in Antioch until after 162 Statius Priscus meanwhile must have already arrived in Cappadocia he would earn fame in 163 for successful generalshipp126

Lucius spent most of the campaign in Antioch though he wintered at Laodicea and summered at Daphne a resort just outside Antioch He took up a mistress named Panthea from Smyrna The biographer calls her a low born girl friendp129 but she is probably closer to Lucians woman of perfect beauty more beautiful than any of Phidias and Praxiteles statues Polite caring humble she sang to the lyre perfectly and spoke clear Ionic Greek spiced with Attic witp129 Panthea read Lucians first draft and criticized him for flattery He had compared her to a goddess which frightened hershe did not want to become the next Cassiopeia 

Lucius faced quite a taskp162 The Syrian army had turned soft during the easts long peace They spent more time at the citys open air cafs than in their quarters Under Lucius training was stepped up Pontius Laelianus ordered that their saddles be stripped of their padding Gambling and drinking were sternly policed Fronto wrote that Lucius was on foot at the head of his army as often as on horseback He personally inspected soldiers in the field and at camp including the sick bayp129

In the middle of the war perhaps in autumn 163 or early 164 Lucius made a trip to Ephesus to be married to Marcus daughter Lucillap163 Lucillas thirteenth birthday was in March 163 whatever the date of her marriage she was not yet fifteen Marcus had moved up the date perhaps stories of Panthea had disturbed him Lucilla was accompanied by her mother Faustina and M Vettulenus Civica Barbarus the half brother of Lucius father Marcus may have planned to accompany them all the way to Smyrna this did not happen Marcus only accompanied the group as far as Brundisium where they boarded a ship for the east Marcus returned to Rome immediately thereafter and sent out special instructions to his proconsuls not to give the group any official reception Lucilla would bear three of Lucius children in the coming years Lucilla became Lucilla Augustap163

Legions I Minervia and V Macedonica under the legates M Claudius Fronto and P Martius Verus served under Statius Priscus in Armenia earning success for Roman arms during the campaign season of 163p163 including the capture of the Armenian capital Artaxata At the end of the year Verus took the title Armeniacus despite having never seen combat Marcus declined to accept the title until the following year When Lucius was hailed as imperator again however Marcus did not hesitate to take the Imperator II with him The army of Syria was reinforced by II Adiutrix and Danubian legions under X Geminas legate Geminius Marcianusp162

Occupied Armenia was reconstructed on Roman terms In 164 a new capital Kaine Polis replaced Artaxata On Birleys reckoning it was thirty miles closer to the Roman borderp131 Detachments from Cappadocian legions are attested at Echmiadzin beneath the southern face of Mount Ararat 400 km east of Satala It would have meant a march of twenty days or more through mountainous terrain from the Roman border a remarkable example of imperialism in the words of Fergus Millar A new king was installed a Roman senator of consular rank and Arsacid descent C Iulius Sohaemus He may not even have been crowned in Armenia the ceremony may have taken place in Antioch or even Ephesusp280n Sohaemus was hailed on the imperial coinage of 164 under the legend autRex armeniis Datus Verus sat on a throne with his staff while Sohamenus stood before him saluting the emperor

In 163 while Statius Priscus was occupied in Armenia the Parthians intervened in Osroene a Roman client state in upper Mesopotamia just east of Syria with its capital at Edessa They deposed the countrys leader Mannus and replaced him with their own nominee who would remain in office until 165p130 279 In response Roman forces were moved downstream to cross the Euphrates at a more southerly point On the evidence of Lucian the Parthians still held the southern Roman bank of the Euphrates as late as 163 Before the end of the year however Roman forces had moved north to occupy Dausara and Nicephorium on the northern Parthian bank Soon after the conquest of the north bank of the Euphrates other Roman forces moved on Osroene from Armenia taking Anthemusia a town south west of Edessa There was little movement in 164 most of the year was spent on preparations for a renewed assault on Parthian territoryp131

In 165 Roman forces perhaps led by Martius Verus and the V Macedonica moved on Mesopotamia Edessa was re occupied Mannus re installedp169 His coinage resumed too Manu the king or Antonine dynasts on the obverse and King Mannos friend of Romans on the reverse The Parthians retreated to Nisibis but this too was besieged and captured The Parthian army dispersed in the Tigris their general Chosrhoes swam down the river and made his hideout in a cave A second force under Avidius Cassius and the III Gallica moved down the Euphrates and fought a major battle at Durap163 

By the end of the year Cassius army had reached the twin metropolises of Mesopotamia Seleucia on the right bank of the Tigris and Ctesiphon on the left Ctesiphon was taken and its royal palace set to flame The citizens of Seleucia still largely Greek opened its gates to the invaders The city got sacked nonetheless leaving a black mark on Lucius reputation Excuses were sought or invented the official version had it that the Seleucids broke faith first Whatever the case the sacking marks a particularly destructive chapter in Seleucias long declinep1634

Cassius army although suffering from a shortage of supplies and the effects of a plague contracted in Seleucia made it back to Roman territory safely Iunius Maximus a young tribunus laticlavius serving in III Gallica under Cassius took the news of the victory to Rome Maximus received a generous cash bounty for bringing the good news and immediate promotion to the quaestorshipp164 Lucius took the title Parthicus Maximus and he and Marcus were hailed as imperatores again earning the title imp III 

Cassius army returned to the field in 166 crossing over the Tigris into Media Lucius took the title Medicus and the emperors were again hailed as imperatores becoming imp IV in imperial titulature Marcus took the Parthicus Maximus now after another tactful delayp164 

Most of the credit for the wars success must be ascribed to subordinate generals The forces that advanced on Osroene were led by M Claudius Fronto an Asian provincial of Greek descent who had led I Minervia in Armenia under Priscus He was probably the first senator in his familyp130 Fronto was consul for 165 probably in honor of the capture of Edessa P Martius Verus had led V Macedonica to the front and also served under Priscus Martius Verus was a westerner whose patria was perhaps Tolosa in Gallia Narbonensis 

The most prominent general however was C Avidius Cassius commander of III Gallica one of the Syrian legions Cassius was young senator of low birth from the north Syrian town of Cyrrhus His father Heliodorus had not been a senator but was nonetheless a man of some standing he had been Hadrians ab epistulis followed the emperor on his travels and was prefect of Egypt at the end of Hadrians reign Cassius also with no small sense of self worth claimed descent from the Seleucid kings Cassius and Martius Verus still probably in their mid thirties took the consulships for 166p164

Vologases IV of Parthia made peace but was forced to cede western Mesopotamia to the Romans Lucius is reported to have been an excellent commander without fear of delegating military tasks to more competent generals

On his return to Rome Lucius was awarded with a triumph The parade was unusual because it included Lucius Marcus Aurelius their sons and unmarried daughters as a big family celebration Marcus Aurelius two sons Commodus five years old and Annius Verus of three were elevated to the status of Caesar for the occasion

In the spring of 168 war broke out in the Danubian border when the Marcomanni invaded the Roman territory This war would last until 180 but Verus did not see the end of it In 168 as Verus and Marcus Aurelius returned to Rome from the field Verus fell ill with symptoms attributed to food poisoning dying after a few days However scholars believe that Verus may have been a victim of smallpox as he died during a widespread epidemic known as the Antonine Plague Despite the minor differences between them Marcus Aurelius grieved the loss of his adoptive brother He accompanied the body to Rome where he offered games to honour his memory

Brassica oleracea or wild cabbage is a species of Brassica native to coastal southern and western Europe

Its tolerance of salt and lime and its dislike of competition from other plants restrict it to limestone sea cliffs like the chalk cliffs on both sides of the English Channel 

B oleracea is believed to have been cultivated for several thousand years It has been bred into a wide range of cultivars including cabbage broccoli cauliflower and more Some of which are hardly recognisable as being members of the same genus let alone species

The plant is used because of its large food reserves which are stored over the winter in its leaves It is rich in essential nutrients including vitamin C

The cultivars of B oleracea are grouped into seven major cultivar groups of which the Acephala Group remains most like the natural wild cabbage in appearance 

All are in the same species However artificial selection has brought about genetic differences between the groups

In places such as the Channel Islands and Canary Islands where the frost is minimal and plants can grow all year round some cultivars can grow up to 3 meters tall These tree cabbages yield fresh leaves throughout the year and the plant is not destroyed as with a normal cabbage Their woody stalks are sometimes dried and made into walking sticks

Some contain high levels of sinigrin which may help prevent bowel cancer

The French Communist Party is a French left wing political party Founded in 1920 it had a large influence in the XXth century especially after the Second World War and is still important in the French political life though it declined over years

Its National Secretary is Pierre Laurent since June 2010

The French Communist Party was founded in 1920 after the Tours Congress of the French Section of the Workers International as the French Section of the Communist international by members who wanted to join the Third International It took in 1921 the name of Communist Party

In 1936 it was a part of the Popular Front and supported its social reforms but refused to participate in the governement

During the Second World War the PCF became a clandestine organisation and organised a massive armed resistance against the Nazi occupation At the Liberation the party was the most important in France and had several ministers in the Provisional Government However its support to independentist movement in French Indochina and to strikes isolated it from other parties

From the 1930s to the 1980s the French Communist Partys line is close to the Soviet Unions The collapse of the USSR in 1991 also affects the PCF whose electoral support decreases rapidly

At the French 2007 legislative election the PCF gained 429 of the votes one of its worst results However the Communist party is still one of the most important party in some regions of France where it has been historically strong

In 2009 the PCF created the Left Front with the Left Party and ran as a part of this alliance in the 2009 European Parliament election and the 2009 Regional election with some success

Marcus Aurelius Antoninus was Roman Emperor from 161 to 180 He ruled with Lucius Verus as co emperor from 161 until Verus death in 169 

He was the last of the Five Good Emperors and is considered one of the most important Stoic philosophers 

Marcus Aurelius work Meditations written in Greek while on campaign between 170 and 180 is still revered It serves as an example of how Aurelius approached the Platonic ideal of a philosopherking and how he symbolized much of what was best about Roman civilization

At the start of his reign the Empire under the joint rule of Marcus and Lucius Verus defeated a revitalized Parthian Empire in a war from 161 to 166 

The unforeseen consequences for the Empire were great The returning troops brought with them a plague which may have been smallpox It would eventually kill about 5 million people and severely weaken the Empire 

Aurelius fought the German tribes during a long war from 166 to 180 The pressure from the Goths moving west pushed settled Germanic tribes into invading Roman client states in Gaul and across the Danube 

The plague raging in the Empire limited Romes ability to respond The Marcomanni tribe entered Italy which had not been invaded for nearly 200 years and defeated the army of the Praetorian Prefect

This disaster forced Marcus to collect forces from other frontiers and move them against the Marcomanni The Roman army was commanded by Claudius Pompeianus Marcus son in law with the future emperor Pertinax as one of his lieutenants The invaders were thrown out of Italy and Marcus began planning to cross the Danube into their territory

Intense diplomatic activity followed as the Romans tried to win over various barbarian tribes in preparation for a crossing of the Danube A peace treaty was signed with some tribes while others became Roman allies In 172 Marcus defeated the Marcommani and in 173 their allies the Quadi were defeated It took until 174 for the Quadi to be subdued

Marcus was now interrupted by a revolt in the east led by the Roman general Avidius Cassius He was suppressed by Marcus army Marcus then returned to Rome A triumph was celebrated with his son Commodus 

In 177 the Quadi rebelled again and the Marcommani joined them Marcus arrived on the scene in August 178 and in due course the Romans won a decisive battle in what is now Slovakia The emperor Marcus died in 180 still fighting the German tribes

Victories were achieved in the next couple of years sufficient for Commodus to claim credit with a triumph The battles had been fought by his generals

The war had exposed the weakness of Romes northern frontier From then on half the Roman legions would be stationed along the Danube and the Rhine For the Germanic tribes although for the moment checked the Marcomannic wars were only the prelude Later invasions in the 4th and 5th centuries would eventually end the Western Roman Empire

Aurelius married his first cousin Faustina the Younger in 145 During their 30 year marriage Faustina bore 13 children Only one son and four daughters outlived their father

This is a list of dinosaurs whose remains have been recovered from North America 

North America has a rich dinosaur fossil record with great diversity of dinosaurs This may not mean the dinosaurs were more diverse or abundant it may be simply because substantial resources have been devoted to the North American fossil record

During the Triassic period dinosaurs such as Coelophysis Chindesaurus Gojirasaurus and Tawa lived in North America Fossils of Tawa have also been found in South America which has important indications about paleogeography During the Lower Jurassic dinosaurs such as Dilophosaurus Anchisaurus Ammosaurus Syntarsus and the early thyreophoran Scutellosaurus lived in North America The latter is believed to have been the ancestor of all stegosaurs and ankylosaurs The Middle Jurassic is the only poorly represented time period in North America although several Middle Jurassic localities are known from Mexico Footprints eggshells teeth and fragments of bone representing theropods sauropods and ornithopods have been found but none of them are diagnostic to the genus level 

The Upper Jurassic of North America however is the exact opposite of the Middle Jurassic The Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation is found in several US states including Colorado Utah Wyoming Montana New Mexico Oklahoma South Dakota and Texas It is notable as being the most fertile single source of dinosaur fossils in the world The roster of dinosaurs from the Morrison is impressive Among the theropods Allosaurus Saurophaganax Torvosaurus Ceratosaurus Coelurus Ornitholestes Tanycolagreus Stokesosaurus and Marshosaurus are found in the Morrison An abundance of sauropods has been found there including Apatosaurus Diplodocus Barosaurus Brachiosaurus Camarasaurus and Amphicoelias which is possibly the largest known dinosaur ever to exist Two genera of stegosaurs Stegosaurus and Hesperosaurus have been found there Finally ornithopods found in the Morrison include Dryosaurus Camptosaurus Drinker Othnielia and Othnielosaurus 

During the Lower Cretaceous new dinosaurs evolved to replace the old ones Sauropods were still present but they were not as diverse as they were in the Jurassic Period Theropods from the early Cretaceous of North America include dromaeosaurs such as Deinonychus and Utahraptor Acrocanthosaurus and Microvenator Sauropods included Astrodon Pleurocoelus and Sauroposeidon Ornithischians were more diverse than they were in the Jurassic Period Tenontosaurus Hypsilophodon Iguanodon Protohadros and Eolambia are some of the ornithopods that lived during this time period Ankylosaurs replaced their stegosaur cousins in the Cretaceous Ankylosaurs from the early Cretaceous of North America include Sauropelta and Gastonia Therizinosaurs such as Falcarius are also known from the early Cretaceous of North America

Finally in the long Upper Cretaceous period the greatest abundance and diversity of dinosaurs of all time lived in North America During the early part of the Upper Cretaceous the therizinosaur Nothronychus and the ceratopsian Zuniceratops lived During the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous an enormous diversity of dinosaurs is known Theropods included the tyrannosaurs Albertosaurus Gorgosaurus Daspletosaurus Appalachiosaurus and Dryptosaurus and the dromaeosaurids Dromaeosaurus Saurornitholestes Atrociraptor and Bambiraptor Ceratopsians such as Pachyrhinosaurus Styracosaurus Centrosaurus Monoclonius Brachyceratops Pentaceratops and Leptoceratops also existed Among hadrosaurs Parasaurolophus Corythosaurus Lambeosaurus Saurolophus and Prosaurolophus existed During the latest Cretaceous the Maastrichtian stage the diversity of dinosaurs wasnt as great as the preceding Campanian stage North American herbivorous dinosaurs from this time period include the titanosaur sauropod Alamosaurus the ceratopsians Triceratops and Torosaurus the pachycephalosaurs Pachycephalosaurus Stygimoloch Dracorex and Stegoceras the hadrosaurs Edmontosaurus and Anatotitan Predatory dinosaurs from this time period icluded the tyrannosaurids Tyrannosaurus and Nanotyrannus and the troodontid Troodon

This is a list of dinosaurs whose remains have been recovered from South America

Dinosaurs evolved partway through the Triassic period of the Mesozoic era around 230 Ma At that time the earth had one supercontinental landmass called Pangaea of which Europe was a part So it remained throughout the Triassic By the start of the Jurassic period some 30 million years later the supercontinent began to split into Laurasia and Gondwana The largest inlet from Panthalassa the superocean that surrounded Pangaea was called the Tethys Ocean and as this inlet cut deeper into the supercontinent much of Europe was flooded

By the Cretaceous from 145 to 65 million years ago the continents were beginning to approach their present shapes but not their present positions and Europe remained tropical At times it was a chain of island microcontinents including Baltica and Iberia

Europe is relatively rich in fossils from the Jurassic Cretaceous boundary and much of what is known about European dinosaurs dates from this time As the timeline below illustrates there are substantial gaps in our knowledge from the rest of the Mesozoic The absence of dinosaur genera from this time is because few fossils have been discovered and almost certainly not because Europe contained few types of dinosaurexcept perhaps immediately after the TriassicJurassic extinction event

Abelisaurus is a genus of theropod dinosaur that lived in South America during the Late Cretaceous period There is one known species Abelisaurus comahuensis 

Abelisaurus was the first abelisaurid to be discovered and gives its name to the family the Abelisauridae Abelisaurus is the type genus Despite this little is known about it 

The first and only fossils discovered were several skull bones found in Argentina Scientists put them back together in the lab to create a skull The skull is similar to that of other members of its family Like most abelisaurs it is blunt and short in length but tall in vertical height from a front view Abelisaurus probably preyed on the large sauropod dinosaurs of the time such as Amargasaurus in packs It may also have hunted smaller plant eating dinosaurs such as the small ornithopod Gasparinisaura

Gargoyleosaurus was an armoured ankylosaur which walked on four legs and had a stiff tail It had a series of spikes running along each side of its body Gargoyleosaurus was about 10 feet long and was roughly 33 feet tall to the top of the shoulder it may have weighed about a ton 

Gargoyleosaurus is found in the of the Morrison Formation in Wyoming It lived about 155144 million years ago

This dinosaur had a long narrow beak with teeth on both the upper and lower inner surface This plant eater had protective body armour on the upper surface of its body and tail 

John Andrew Boehner is an American politician Boehner was born in Reading Ohio and was one of twelve brothers and sisters Boehner worked in his familys bar and briefly served in the United States Navy before graduating from Xavier University in 1977 Later he was a small businessman 

Boehner is a member of the Republican Party He served in the Ohio State House from 1985 to 1990 In 1990 he became a Congressman a member of the United States House of Representatives He represents the area north of Cincinnati Ohio Boehner served as chair of several important committees before becoming Minority Leader in 2006 While minority leader Boehner was one of the main people who were critical of President Obama When the Republicans took back the House of Representatives in the 2010 elections Boehner became Speaker of the House

Othnielia was an ornithopod dinosaur that measured about 4 ft long weighing about 50 pounds Othnielia had a horny beak and a small skull with self sharpening cheek teeth Othnielia may have had cheek pouches 

This plant eater was bipedal It had thin legs and a stiffened tail that gave it speed and agility It had five fingered hands and four toed feet all clawed It had large eyes and short arms Othnielia resembled Hypsilophodon Its fossils were found in Colorado and Utah in rocks of the Late Jurassic age 

Coelurus is a poorly known genus It was perhaps a bipedal theropod dinosaur 6 feet long weighing roughly 20 kg Its femur was 55 cm long It was a carnivore that lived during the late Jurassic period about 156 to 145 million years ago Its bones were hollow and lightweight so Coelurus was probably light and fast Its fossils were found in Wyoming Coelurus was named by paleontologist Othniel C Marsh in 1879

Commodus was Roman Emperor from 180 to 192 He also ruled as co emperor with his father Marcus Aurelius from 177 until his fathers death in 180 

His accession as emperor was the first time a son had succeeded his father since Titus succeeded Vespasian in 79 Commodus was the first emperor born to the purple that is born during his fathers reign

The reign of Marcus Aurelius had been marked by almost continuous warfare even though he preferred books to war That of Commodus was comparatively peaceful in the military sense but was marked by political strife and the arbitrary and capricious behaviour of the emperor himself In the view of Dio Cassius a contemporary observer his accession marked the descent from a kingdom of gold to one of rust and iron The historian Edward Gibbon took Commoduss reign as the beginning of the decline of the Roman Empire 

Despite his notoriety Commoduss years in power are not well chronicled Commodus remained with the Danube armies for only a short time before negotiating a peace treaty with the Danubian tribes He then returned to Rome and celebrated a triumph for the conclusion of the wars on 22 October 180 

Unlike the preceding Emperors Trajan Hadrian Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius Commodus had little interest in the business of administration He left the running of the state to a succession of favourites beginning at this time with Saoterus a freedman from Nicomedia who had become his chamberlain

This state of affairs lead to a series of conspiracies and attempted coups which in turn eventually provoked Commodus to take charge of affairs which he did in an increasingly dictatorial manner 

Nevertheless though the senatorial order came to hate and fear him the evidence suggests that he remained popular with the army and the common people for much of his reign He made lavish shows of gifts and he staged and took part in spectacular gladiatorial combats 

One of the ways he paid for his mass entertainments was to tax the senatorial order and on many inscriptions the traditional order of the two nominal powers of the state the Senate and People is provocatively reversed

At the outset of his reign Commodus aged 19 inherited many of his fathers senior advisers He also had five surviving sisters all of them with husbands who were potential rivals Four of his sisters were considerably older than he the eldest Lucilla held the rank of Augusta as the widow of her first husband Lucius Verus

The first crisis of the reign came in 182 when Lucilla engineered a conspiracy against her brother Her motive is alleged to have been envy of the Empress Crispina Her husband Pompeianus was not involved but two men alleged to have been her lovers attempted to murder Commodus as he entered the theatre 

They bungled the job They were seized by the emperors bodyguard and executed Lucilla was exiled to Capri and later killed Pompeianus retired from public life One of the two Praetorian Prefects Tarrutenius Paternus had actually been involved in the conspiracy but was not detected at this time In the aftermath he and his co Prefect Sextus Tigidius Perennis organised the murder of Saoterus the hated chamberlain

Commodus took the loss of Saoterus badly and Perennis now seized the chance to advance himself by implicating Paternus in a second conspiracy Executions followed Perennis took over the reins of government and Commodus found a new chamberlain and favourite in Cleander a Phrygian freedman who had married one of the emperors mistresses Demostratia Cleander was in fact the person who had murdered Saoterus 

After those attempts on his life Commodus spent much of his time outside Rome mostly on the family estates at Lanuvium Though physically strong he was mentally lazy and his chief interest was in sport taking part in horse racing chariot racing and combats with beasts and men mostly in private but also on occasion in public

In Britain in 184 the governor Ulpius Marcellus pushed the Roman frontier north to the Antonine Wall but the soldiers revolted against his harsh discipline Perennis had all the legionary legates in Britain dismissed 

On 15 October 184 at the Capitoline Games a Cynic philosopher publicly denounced Perennis before Commodus who was watching He was immediately put to death According to Dio Cassius Perennis though ruthless and ambitious was not personally corrupt and generally administered the state well 

However the following year a detachment of soldiers from Britain denounced Perennis to the emperor as plotting to make his own son emperor They had been enabled to do so by Cleander who was seeking to dispose of his rival Commodus gave the soldiers permission to execute Perennis and his wife and sons The fall of Perennis brought a new spate of executions Ulpius Marcellus was replaced as governor of Britain by Pertinax brought to Rome and tried for treason Marcellus narrowly escaped death

Cleander took power into his own hands and enriched himself by selling public offices he sold and gave entry to the Senate army commands governorships and even replacement consulships to the highest bidder 

Unrest around the empire increased with large numbers of army deserters causing trouble in Gaul and Germany A revolt in Brittany was put down by two legions brought over from Britain In 187 one of the leaders of the deserters Maternus came from Gaul intending to assassinate Commodus at the Festival of the Great Goddess in March but he was betrayed and executed 

In the same year Pertinax unmasked a conspiracy by two enemies of Cleander As a result Commodus appeared even more rarely in public preferring to live on his estates Early in 188 Cleander disposed of the current praetorian prefect and himself took over supreme command of the Praetorians at the new rank of a pugione with two praetorian prefects subordinate to him Now at the zenith of his power Cleander continued to sell public offices as his private business The climax came in the year 190 which had 25 suffect consulsa record in the 1000 year history of the Roman consulshipall appointed by Cleander

In the spring of 190 Rome was afflicted by a food shortage for which the official actually in charge of the grain supply managed to lay the blame on Cleander At the end of June a mob demonstrated against Cleander during a horse race in the Circus Maximus he sent the praetorian guard to put down the disturbances but Pertinax who was now City Prefect of Rome dispatched the Vigiles Urbani to oppose them 

Cleander fled to Commodus who was at Laurentum in the house of the Quinctilii for protection but the mob followed him calling for his head At the urging of his mistress Marcia Commodus had Cleander beheaded and his son killed Other victims at this time were the praetorian prefect Julius Julianus Commoduss cousin Annia Fundania Faustina and his brother in law Mamertinus Papirius Dionysius was executed too 

Commodus continued to rule through a cabal which now consisted of Marcia his new chamberlain Eclectus and the new praetorian prefect Quintus Aemilius Laetus who about this time also had many Christians freed from working in the mines in Sardinia Marcia is alleged to have been a Christian

During 191 the city of Rome was extensively damaged by a fire that raged for several days during which many public buildings including the Temple of Pax the Temple of Vesta and parts of the imperial palace were destroyed

Commodus presented himself as the fountainhead of the Empire and Roman life and religion He also had the head of the Colossus of Nero adjacent to the Colosseum replaced with his own portrait gave it a club and placed a bronze lion at its feet to make it look like Hercules and added an inscription boasting of being the only left handed fighter to conquer twelve times one thousand men

The emperor also had a passion for gladiatorial combat which he took so far as to take to the arena himself dressed as a gladiator The Romans found Commodus naked gladiatorial combats to be scandalous and disgraceful It was rumoured that he was actually the son not of Marcus but of a gladiator whom his mother Faustina had taken as a lover at the coastal resort of Caieta In the arena Commodus always won since his opponents always submitted to the emperor Thus these public fights would not end in a death Privately it was his custom to slay his practice opponents For each appearance in the arena he charged the city of Rome a million sesterces straining the Roman economy

Military officials in Rome were enraged at his behavoiur in the arena Often wounded soldiers and amputees would be placed in the arena for Commodus to slay with a sword Citizens of Rome missing their feet through accident or illness were taken to the arena where they were tethered together for Commodus to club to death while pretending they were giants These acts may have contributed to his assassination 

Commodus was also known for fighting exotic animals in the arena often to the horror of the Roman people According to Gibbon Commodus once killed 100 lions in a single dayp106 Later he decapitated a running ostrich with a specially designed dart and afterwards carried the bleeding head of the dead bird and his sword over to the section where the Senators sat and gesticulated as though they were next On another occasion Commodus killed three elephants on the floor of the arena by himself Finally Commodus killed a giraffe which was considered to be a strange and helpless beastp107 Commodus killed a camelopardalis or giraffethe most useless of the quadrupeds

In November 192 Commodus held Plebian Games in which he shot hundreds of animals with arrows and javelins every morning and fought as a gladiator every afternoon naturally winning all the bouts In December he announced his intention to inaugurate the year 193 as both consul and gladiator on 1 January

At this point the prefect Laetus formed a conspiracy with Eclectus to supplant Commodus with Pertinax taking Marcia into their confidence On 31 December Marcia poisoned his food but he vomited up the poison so the conspirators sent his wrestling partner Narcissus to strangle him in his bath On his death the Senate declared him a public enemy and restored the original names to the city of Rome and its institutions Commodus statues were thrown down

Commodus was succeeded by Pertinax whose reign was short lived being the first to fall victim to the Year of the Five Emperors Commoduss death marked the end of the Nervan Antonian dynasty and the beginning of the end for the Western Roman Empire

There are a number of semi fictional versions of his life The most notable are the two films

The Battle of the Four Armies involved 8000 soldiers including 1200 cavalry and was shot on an undulating plain at Manzanares el Real which allowed large numbers of soldiers to be visible over a long distance The films reconstruction of the Roman Forum at Las Matas near Madrid at 400 x 230 meters holds the record for the largest outdoor film set The various ancient Rome settings covered 55 acres

The film is only loosely based on historical events Although the filmmakers consulted an academic expert with knowledge of the period of the Ancient Roman empire historical discrepancies were incorporated by the screenwriters At least one historical advisor resigned due to the changes made and another asked not to be mentioned in the credits Historian Allen Ward of the University of Connecticut believed that historical accuracy would not have made Gladiator less interesting or exciting creative artists need to be granted some poetic license but that should not be a permit for the wholesale disregard of facts in historical fiction The film begins with an exciting battle scenario using modern computer graphics The battle also plays with history much of the infantry combat is shown as one on one dueling between individuals The highly organized Romans would not have allowed this to happen the organized cohort based fighting style would have been used to wear down the Germans The film ends with the death of both Commodus and Maximus in the arena The post of Emperor is then auctioned off

Andrei Kolkoutine is a Russian artist In 1982 Kolkoutine graduated at the Repin Academy of Arts in Leningrad named after Ilya Repin Kolkoutine lives in southern Russia in the town of Nalchik He belongs to the art group FOSTER BROTHERS together with two other artists  Andrey Efi and Eugeny Lindin The medium of his paintings is usually oil on canvas but Kolkoutine also made a few sculptures and prints Besides Russia Kolkoutine has made exhibitions in Denmark Germany France and other European countries as well as the United States

Kolkoutine settled into his current characteristic style by the end of the 1980s in which he mixes traditions from the Russian icons with other art styles suprematism from Malevich cubism and nave art Kolkoutine states that he sought the special tones of colours which are seen in the old Russian icons and he developed a method for making these tones by pasting a layer of neutral grey paint on the canvas before painting the colours Geometrical and abstract elements are combined with figurative elements Buildings and playing cards may appear at the bottom of the paintings as well as Cyrillic letters Frames in different colours surrounding the motifs are often oblique 

Often the motifs are either stylized biblical or simple working people from the Russian province according to Kolkoutine the biblical characters are in principle the same kind as the provincial people The biblical motifs are also a reflection of his origin they are distinctly orthodox Jekatarina Seleznjova states that in her opinion the fundamental question asks in his paintings is Why are we here and thus despite the culturally characteristic motifs Kolkoutines paintings are supposed to touch something universally human Kolkoutines paintings are both simple and complicated it is said

The cult of domesticity also known as the cult of true womanhood is a view about women in the 1800s They believed that women should stay at home and should not do any work outside of the home There were four things they believed that women should be

These were very popular in the 1800s and in the 1950s Now most women reject this view

Roe v Wade was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1973 It made abortion legal in many circumstances The decision said that a womans right to privacy extended to the unborn child This meant that she could do what she wanted to with the child The decision was 7 2 with Chief Justice Warren Burger and six other Justices voting for Roe and justices William Rehnquist and Byron White voting against it 

This decision caused a lot of debate People divided into pro life and pro choice groups Pro life people said that abortions should not be allowed because it is the killing of unborn embryos Pro choice people said that a woman had the right to choose whether to have an abortion or not 

Roe was limited by a later decision called Webster v Reproductive Health which allowed regulation of abortion in some cases Several states have attempted to pass laws to undo Roe but most of these have been found unconstitutional 

The Moral Majority was a political organization in the United States It was made by Jerry Falwell It tried to get conservative Christian views into laws by lobbying It was one of the major organizations of the religious right It was started in 1979 in response to Roe v Wade and other events known as the culture wars It broke up in the late 1980s It had four branches

It broke up during Ronald Reagans presidency because people did not think that the matter was so urgent Other Christians also opposed it as well as many liberal people

Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking is a way that scientists start off with something completely symmetrical and end up with something non symmetrical Spontaneous means sudden or unexpected Symmetry refers to the fact that rules of physics that are changed Breaking refers to the change of the symmetry Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking commonly happens in the theoretical Higgs effect

Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking can create a theoretical particle called a Higgs Boson This is a particle which is predicted to be able to give mass to certain particles called bosons like a photon Also many scientists believe in the Higgs Effect to answer questions that are not answered in the Standard model of physics The Standard model predicts that certain types of quarks should have a mass of zero while in reality they have a non zero mass value Some scientists believe that Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking is the answer

For Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking to happen you need an environment which is completely symmetrical and has at least two outcomes that are equally likely Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking starts with two particles that are completely equal their spin is equal too Mathematically Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking can be extremely puzzling since you start out with two identical things and end up with two non identical things However in practice it is not so puzzling If you have two particles moving at each other with equal speed it would seem impossible for either of them to do anything but be symmetrical However if each particle has an equal 50 50 chance to be spinning one way or another it is possiblein theory and in practiceto have this symmetry broken It begins with symmetry to start with because the particles have an equal and symmetrical 50 50 chance of spinning one way or another

Scientists have been able to use Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking However it has not proven the theory of the Higgs Boson The energy required to generate a Higgs Boson is simply too powerful for the particle accelerators that we have available However the future will probably reveal the existence or nonexistence of the Higgs Boson

A Roman villa is a house that was built and inhabited during the Roman Republic or the Roman Empire In general thehouse is built so that there is a courtyard and all rooms are accessible from the coutrtyrd The entrance also leads into the courtyard An example of such a villa called villa rustica is shown in the picture Villas were owned by wealthy people Some of them even had mosaics or a central heating system 

The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry also known as the Grange is an organization for farmers It is in the United States It is made for them to more easily buy expensive things It also tried to make laws that supported farmers It was the most popular in the 1870s The most people it ever had was one million Today it has 300000 people Its name comes from the French for barn 

The Grange was fairly active in politics In the 19th century many members of the Grange were involved in the Greenback and Populist movements The Grange endorsed politicians well into the 20th century Often the endorsement of the State Grange was an important endorsement 

Roger Maris 1935 1993 was a baseball player for the Indians Athletics and the Yankees and the Cardinals Maris spent his early years for the Indians and the Athletics Being a great star the Yankees signed him in 1960 In 1961 the Yankees won the world series Sports writers called him and Mickey Mantle the MM boys After the 1966 season the Yankees traded him to the Cardinals In 1967 the Cardinals won the World Series After 1968 he retired

The Yankees won the world series that year They beat the Dodgers 4 games to 1 They won their 12th title

In the 1950 world series the Yankees won the world series again They beat the Phillies 4 0 They won their 13th title

Archimedes principle is named after Archimedes of Syracuse who first discovered this law It relates buoyancy to displacement

Archimedes treatise On floating bodies proposition 5 states

For more general objects floating and sunken and in gases as well as liquids Archimedes principle may be stated thus in terms of forces

For a sunken object the volume of displaced fluid is the volume of the object and for a floating object on a liquid the weight of the displaced liquid is the weight of the object

Briefly Buoyancy weight of displaced fluid

To use the principle to tell the difference between gold and another substance the concept of mass must be added

That gives you the density of the gold sample The only unknown is the density of the object the density of water is 1

Repeat for the experimental object when you get a different density

Now you can tell what is gold and what is not and collect your reward from the King of Syracuse That is why Archimedes shouted Eureka 

We do not actually know if Archimedes used exactly this method An alternative is to use a scale On one side put the object to be tested On the other side put gold of equal weight Immerse the scales The gold will go down and the crown up That is because being less dense than gold it occupies a larger volume and receives more buoyancy

Theoretical Particles are particles that have been assumed or predicted to exist by scientists but have not been proven in any experiment Some like the tachyon probably dont exist since they violate several laws of physics However many are still believed to exist For example the Higgs Boson is required by the standard model of particle physics but it also has yet to be found in an experiment All supersymmetric particles are theoretical Supersymmetrical particles are often abbreviated with an s in front of the particle name like a sfermion Particles found in antimatter are not theoretical particles because they have been found in numerous experiments

Supersymmetry is a theory that says that when the universe was made there was also the same number of theoretical superparticles created If this theory is true it would at least double the number of particles in the universe Supersymmetry may create more than one copy since there are many dimensions Supersymmetry is believed to exist by many scientists because it solves many inconsistencies in the Standard Model of physics 

A superparticle is the supersymmetric copy of its counterpart A superparticle also has a slightly different spin than its counterpart by 12 Many scientists believe that in the Big Bang superparticles were created for an almost immeasurably short amount of time before they effectively froze into space Note that these copies of what we would call normal matter may or may not be identical copies depending on the correctness of unbroken supersymmetry which simply states that supersymmetric particles are copies of matter with a 12 spin difference

If some of the principles of supersymmetry are correct then it may be possible to recreate these superparticles with particle accelerators This attempt could prove or disprove the ideas of supersymmetry

In outer space scientists have seen areas of matter that are completely dark This is not normal as all known matter reflects lightor absorbs it and reflects it in a different color Light is a form of electromagnetism Some scientists suspect that this means that the matter that is not giving off light may not even interact with electromagnetism This would explain why they dont emit light but not why no light would pass through them as they simply dont interact with electromagnetism

Many people wonder what dark matter is and scientists do not really have an answer for them However a simple answer for this is that dark matter is matter that does not emit light From now on the above mentioned matter will now be referred to as dark matter

Around the mid 1930s scientists predicted the existence of dark matter for variance reasons For example the spin of galaxies was nothing like how the visible matter would suggest it should Also some scientists noticed gravity fields from something that was not visible They labeled it dark matter Many scientists accept that dark matter exists but not all accept the connection between dark matter and supersymmetry

If scientists could somehow make a link between supersymmetry and dark matter this would raise many new questions Electromagnetism is one of the four fundamental interactions as is strong force

Matter as we know it is held together by strong force Strong force holds the protons and neutrons together in an atom and is thought to be a result of the lighter mesons for the interaction between protons Protons themselves are made of quarks which are in turn thought to be held together by gluons As a result of all of this an atom nucleus is formed

Strong force is necessary for an atom nucleus to hold together because apart from the fact that the protons wouldnt stick together protons actually repel each other because of their electromagnetic charge

However if a superparticle does not interact with electromagnetism strong force would not be so necessary because the super protons do not repel each other However this lack of interaction with electromagnetism would not allow electrons to orbit an atom nucleus This poses many new questions about superparticles as electrons are the reason that you cannot push your hand through a wall without the wall breaking electrons are negatively charged and repel each other In addition electrons are fermions which basically means that two electrons cant exist in the same place at the same time Since no electrons would orbit the nucleus it would be much easier to push two superparticle nuclei together 

It is difficult to imagine how a superparticle could exist if it was only held together by strong force This is one of the many problems with the supersymmetry theory

Antihydrogen is an atom made of antimatter Like normal matter antihydrogen can bond and form molecules with other antimatter Antihydrogen has one positronwhich is positively chargedorbiting an antiproton which is negatively charged This is opposite normal hydrogen which has one negatively charged electron orbiting a positively charged proton

Antihydrogen can also refer to the molecule called Antihydrogen which is made of two bonded antiprotons

Antiprotons are tiny particles of antimatter They have a negative charge and are the nucleus of an Antihydrogen atom They are not theoretical as they have been found in scientific studies When they come in contact with regular protons each are annihilated and a relatively massive amount of energy is generated

Leptoceratops was a stocky ceratopsian dinosaur that had a large skull are there was a horn on its beaked snout It is known from 5 skulls and some skeletal material Leptoceratops are during in the Late Cretaceous period about 68 65 million years ago Fossils have been found in Alberta Canada and Wyoming in North America

Montanoceratops was a ceratopsian dinosaur walked on four legs had a large head a bulky body a parrot like beak a small nose horn cheek teeth and a small frill on its head Males may have had larger frills than females indicating that the frill may have been used in courtship and mating

Montanoceratops was up to 6 feet long and weighed about 900 pounds Montanoceratops lived in the late Cretaceous period about 72 to 65 million years ago toward the end of the Mesozoic the Age of Reptiles Fossils have been found in Montana and Alberta Canada

Archelon was huge marine turtle that was the size of a car It lived during the Upper Cretaceous in the inland sea on part of North America Fossils have been found in Kansas and South Dakota 

This carnivore was up to convert46mft0 long It had a wide flattened shell paddle like legs a long narrow head weak jaws and a short pointed tail 

Archelon are like other turtles had a solidly roofed skull with no opening 

The Atlantic sturgeon is a member of the Acipenseridae family It is one of the oldest fish species in the world It can be found from New Brunswick Canada to the eastern coast of Florida The numbers of Atlantic sturgeon have fallen because of overfishing and water pollution It is considered threatened endangered and even extinct in much of its original habitats The fish live to 60 years of age 15 feet in length and over 800 pounds in weight

Quantum fluctuations are small variances in matter due to Heisenbergs uncertainty principle This states that the more we know about where a particle is the less we know about where it is going Basically small amounts of energy may change and this is accepted in the scientific community

Quantum fluctuations can result in theoretical photons being created from nothing These photons have no actual energy value Like all photons these theoretical photons can split into an electron and a positron However normal photons must interact with matter for this to occur whereas theoretical photons do not Like normal matter and antimatter this theoretical electron and positron annihilate each other Unlike normal matter however they do not create any energy when they annihilate each other but instead create an imaginary photon

A critical error is an error which the OS cannot reasonably ignore so as to respond again The critical error is often linked with a BSOD These errors are known also as system failure However not all types of OS failure are critical errors Freezing or deadlock are NOT usually considered critical Critical errors can lead to error avalanches also

The Year of the Five Emperors refers to the year 193 AD in which there were five claimants for the title of Roman Emperor The five were Pertinax Didius Julianus Pescennius Niger Clodius Albinus and Severus

The year 193 opened with the murder of Commodus on New Years Eve 31 December 192 The City Prefect Pertinax was proclaimed Emperor on New Years Day 1 January 193 

Pertinax tried to restore discipline in the Praetorian Guard and did not pay them what they had expected He was assassinated by the Praetorian Guard on 28 March 193 They then auctioned off the post of Emperor

Later that same day Didius Julianus outmaneuvered Titus Flavius Sulpicianus for the title of Emperor Flavius Sulpicianus offered to pay each soldier 20000 sestertii to buy their loyalty Didius Julianus however offered 25000 to each soldier to win the auction and was proclaimed Emperor by the Roman Senate on 28 March

However three other prominent Romans challenged for the throne Pescennius Niger in Syria Clodius Albinus in Britain and Severus in Pannonia 

Severus marched on Rome to oust Didius Julianus and had him decapitated on 1 June 193 then dismissed the Praetorian Guard and executed the soldiers who had killed Pertinax 

Consolidating his power Severus battled Pescennius Niger at Cyzicus and Nicea in 193 and then defeated him at Issus in 194 

Clodius Albinus initially supported Septimius Severus believing that he would succeed him When he realised that Severus had other intentions Albinus had himself declared Emperor in 195 but was defeated by Severus at the Battle of Lugdunum on 19 February 197

Severus was Roman Emperor from 193 to 211

Severus was born in Leptis Magna in the province of Africa As a young man Severus advanced under the reigns of Marcus Aurelius and Commodus 

Severus seized power after the death of Emperor Pertinax in 193 during the so called Year of the Five Emperors After deposing the incumbent emperor Didius Julianus in a bloodless coup Severus fought his rival claimants the generals Pescennius Niger and Clodius Albinus Niger was defeated in 194 at the Battle of Issus and Albinus three years later at the Battle of Lugdunum 

After solidifying his rule Severus waged a brief war against the Parthian Empire sacking their capital Ctesiphon in 197 In 202 he campaigned in Africa against the Garamantes briefly taking their capital Garama and expanding the southern frontier of the empire radically 

Late in his reign he fought the Picts in Caledonia and strengthened Hadrians Wall in Britain Severus died in 211 at Eboracum succeeded by his sons Caracalla and Geta With the succession of his sons Severus founded the Severan dynasty the last dynasty of the empire before the Crisis of the Third Century

Hadrosaurs were the family of duck billed herbivorous dinosaurs They were the most common dinosaurs 

Hadrosaurs ranged in size from 10 to 545 ft long They had horny toothless beaks and hundreds of cheek teeth in the sides of their jaws The duck billed dinosaurs had the most teeth they had up to about 960 cheek teeth Hadrosaurs lived during the later Cretaceous and their fossils have been found in North America Europe and Asia

Hadrosaurs had a stiff tail that was probably used for balance They had hoof like nails on their feet and bumpy skin They ran on two legs holding their tail and head in a horizontal position They may have walked on all four legs while grazing Hadrosaurs probably lived near bodies of water migrating to high ground to lay eggs It used to be thought that they had webbed hands but this was an artifact of the fossilization process

Amphetamine is a synthetic drug The drug is a stimulant it can help people keep the focus and stay awake It also decreases appetite and fatigue Chemically it is similar to Methamphetamine These drugs increase the level of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain which can create euphoria The class of drugs containing Amphetamine includes prescription drugs commonly used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder It is also used to treat symptoms of traumatic brain injury and the daytime drowsiness symptoms of narcolepsy amongst others Initially amphetamine was more popularly used to reduce appetite and to control weight 

Sometimes the drug is used for fun or to boost performance There are many different names that are used for amphetamines a common one is speed The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction reports the typical retail price of amphetamine in Europe varied between 3 and 15 a gram in half of the reporting countries The name amphetamine is derived from its chemical name alpha methylphenethylamine

The 8 track is a music format which first appeared in the 1960s It is a tape format which was created so people could play music in their cars Unlike cassettes 8 tracks are a continuous loop of tape They did not need to be turned over to keep playing There were four programs of music on each tape with two tracks on each program to create stereo sound When the track was over a very thin peice of metal in the tape would be sensed This would cause the part of the player that read the tape to start reading the next track 8 tracks became very popular in the early 1970s They were used both in the home and car

In the 1970s the cassette tape was improved It eventually had better quality than 8 tracks By the late 1970s cassettes became more popular than 8 tracks In 1980 8 tracks were rarely being made They could still be bought through mail order record clubs until 1987 Today there are still a small number of people who collect 8 tracks

The 8 track had many problems Unlike cassettes the rubber roller was in the cartridge It would often wear out This could cause a gooey substance in the tapes This also caused the tapes to wear out quickly The spacing between the tracks were very narrow Music from tracks other than the one being played could often be heard The sensing foil in the tape would sometimes break off This would stop the tape from changing tracks

The plateau is a neighborhood in Montreal just northeast of downtown Originally it was a middle class neighborhood containing large Quebecois Portugeese and Jewish population In the 1980s many artists moved into the plateau attracted by low rent and the beautiful architecture Today the plateau is a very expensive area to live in with many attractive shops and restaurants The neighborhood maintains an old world charm with its beautiful architecture It is certainly one of the most beautiful places in Montreal

Sinornithosaurus was a feathered dromaeosaurid dinosaur from the Lower Cretaceous Period of the Yixian Formation in what is now China This new fossil suggests that these dinosaurs may not have had scaly reptile like skin but perhaps had a softer downy coat No fossil skin impressions of these dinosaurs had been found previously

Sinosauropteryx is a genus of non avialan dinosaur 

It is the first one found with the fossilized impressions of furry down or filamentous feathers Overall the filaments resemble the down like feathers of some modern flightless birds

Sinosauropteryx lived in China during the early Cretaceous period and was a close relative of Compsognathus It has been dated to 1246122 million years ago

The fossils were from the famous Jehol biota of Sihetun Liaoning Province China and represent an ancient lake bed 

Most paleontologists do not consider Sinosauropteryx to be a bird because phylogenetically it lies far from the clade Aves usually defined as Archaeopteryx plus modern birds 

Sinosauropteryx prima is among the smallest known non avian theropods with the type specimen measuring only convert68cmabbron in length including a very long tail

Paleontologist Nick Longrich suggested that these specimens preserve remnants of the original colour pattern the animal would have had in life He argued that the dark banded stains on the tail were too evenly spaced to have been caused by random separation of the fossil slabs and that they represent fossilized pigments present in the feathers

The presence of dark feathers along only the top of the body may also reflect the colour pattern in life indicating that Sinosauropteryx prima was countershaded with dark colour on its back and lighter colour on its underside with bands or stripes on the tail for camouflage

The main colour turned out later to be ginger

Unenlagia was a theropod from the mid Cretaceous living about 90 million years ago The first birds appeared 150 million years ago evolving from dinosaurs long before Unenlagia lived Therefore it is not an ancestor of modern day birds but was an evolutionary dead end The most bird like dinosaur ever discovered is the 90 million year old Unenlagia comahuensis a flightless 4 foot tall 75 foot long carnivore

Subversion means trying to break the established order of a society Subversion works against structures of power authority exploitation servitude and hierarchy A subversive is something or someone that has some possibility of turning against an organization or system

Subversive activity is helping or supporting individuals groups or organizations that want to remove governments by force and violence Subversive activity may be similar to treason sedition sabotage or espionage

Subversion is a crime in China The government of the Peoples Republic of China prosecutes subversives under Articles 102 through 112 of the state criminal law These laws describe behavior that can be a threat to national security China has prosecuted many dissidents using these laws Articles 105 and 111 are used the most often to silence political dissent Article 105 makes it a crime to organize make a secret plan work against the national order or tell rumors to make people fight the national order or overthrow the socialist system Article 111 prohibits stealing secretly collecting purchasing or illegally providing state secrets or intelligence to an organization institution or personnel outside the country

There is no crime defined as subversion in British Constitutional law There is a crime of treason Legal experts have tried define subversion but political and legal thinkers could not reach a general agreement

The Severan dynasty was a Roman imperial dynasty which ruled the Roman Empire between 193 and 235 The dynasty was founded by the Roman general Septimius Severus who rose to power during the civil war of 193 known as the Year of the Five Emperors

Although Septimius Severus successfully restored peace following the upheaval of the late 2nd century the dynasty was disturbed by unstable family relationships and constant political turmoil It foreshadowed the coming Crisis of the Third Century It was the last lineage of the Principate founded by Augustus

Dates represent status of Augustus

The end of the Severids marked the start of the Crisis of the Third Century

The Crisis of the Third Century was a period in which the Roman Empire nearly collapsed under the combined pressures of invasion civil war plague and collapse of the economy The Crisis is sometimes called the Military Anarchy or Imperial Crisis 

The Crisis began with the assassination of Emperor Alexander Severus at the hands of his own troops in 235 AD This started a fifty year period in which 2025 claimants to the title of Emperor mostly prominent Roman Army generals taking power over all or part of the Empire 

By 258260 the Empire split into three competing states with the Gallic Empire including the Roman provinces of Gaul Britannia and Hispania and the Palmyrene Empire including the eastern provinces of Syria Palaestina and Aegyptus becoming independent from the Italian centered Roman Empire proper between them The Crisis ended with the ascension of Diocletian in 284

The Crisis resulted in profound changes in the Empires institutions society economic life and eventually religion It is increasingly seen a transition period between the historical periods of Classical antiquity and late antiquity

Sci Fi Science is a science show hosted by Michio Kaku As Kaku explains the principles of science he suggests methods and shows various diagrams of the concept

New South Greenlandwhich is also known as Morrells Land was an appearance of land recorded by the American captain Benjamin Morrell Morrel reported the sighting on the schooner Wasp in March 1823 during a sealing and exploration voyage in the Weddell Sea area of Antarctica He provided precise coordinates and a description of a coastline Morrel claimed to have sailed along the coastline for more than convert300mikmsigfig2 The Weddel Sea is in the Antarctic Because of icebergs it was difficult to navigate and few people did The sighting was never investigated properly at the time Expeditions to Antarctica in the early 20th century proved that there was no land at the positions recorded by Morrell 

At the time of Morrells voyage the Weddel Sea had not been named and its geography and coastline was almost entirely unknown This made the sighting plausible at the start Morrell made obvious errors when he told about the new sighting He also had the reputation of liking to invent new stories These two aspects made many people sceptical about the sighting In June 1912 the German explorer Wilhelm Filchners ship Deutschland was blocked by ice in the Weddel Sea and drifted into the area where Morrell had reported the new land Filchcher searched for the land but found no trace of it A sounding of the sea bottom revealed more than convert5000ftmsigfig2 of water indicating no land nearby Three years later trapped in the same waters with his ship Endurance Ernest Shackleton was able by similar means to confirm the lands non existence

Different explanations for Morells error have been suggested One of them is that Morrell wanted to deceive with this claimed finding Morrell describes his sighting briefly and seeks no personal credit or glory from the discovery In his narrative he gives all credit to his fellow sealing captain Robert Johnson for finding and naming the land two years earlier Morrell may have been honestly mistaken through miscalculation of his ships position or by misremembering detail when writing the account after nine years Alternatively he may have made the common error of confusing distant icebergs with land or been misled by the distorting effects of Antarctic mirage In 1843 the distinguished British naval explorer James Clark Ross reported possible land in a position close to Morrells this land too would eventually be proven not to exist

In the early 19th century the geography of Antarctica was almost completely unknown but occasional sightings of land had been recorded Benjamin Morrell sailed to the South Sandwich Islands Morrel was appointed commander of the schooner Wasp for a two year voyage of sealing trading and exploration in the Antarctic seas and the southern Pacific Ocean in 1822 In addition to his sealing duties Morrell had as he put it discretionary powers to prosecute new discoveries He proposed to use this discretion to investigate the Antarctic seas and to ascertain the practicality of penetrating to the South Pole This would be the first of four long voyages that would keep Morrell at sea for most of the following eight years although he would not revisit the Antarctic after the initial voyage

Wasp sailed south from New York on 22 June 1822 She reached the Falkland Islands late in October after which Morrell spent 16 days in fruitless searches for the nonexistent Aurora Islands before heading for South Georgia where the ship anchored on 20 November In his account Morrell wrongly records the position of this anchorage placing it in open sea about convert60mikm south west of the islands coastline Wasp then headed eastwards to hunt for seals According to Morrell the ship reached the remote Bouvet Island on 6 December He found this elusive island without apparent difficulty Historian HR Mill notes that Morrells description of the islands physical features fails to mention the islands most singular characteristicit is covered by a permanent ice sheet Morrell then attempted to take the ship southwards He reached think ice around 60S and decided to turn northeast towards the Kerguelen Islands where he anchored on 31 December

After several days of exploration and evidently profitable sealing Wasp left the Kerguelens on 11 January 1823 sailing south and east to record her furthest eastern position at 6452S 11827E on 1 February From this point according to his own account Morrell decided to take advantage of strong easterly winds and made a rapid passage westward back to the Greenwich meridian 0 His account is light on details but indicates that a distance of more than convert3500mikmsigfig2 was covered in 23 days The credibility of this claim of such fast direct travel in ice infested waters has been widely disputed particularly as Morrell quotes southerly latitudes during the voyage which later proved to be at least 100 miles inside the then undiscovered Antarctic continental mainland On 28 February Wasp reached Candlemas Island in the South Sandwich Islands After a few days spent in a search for fuel to feed the ships stoves Wasp sailed southwards on 6 March into the area later known as the Weddell Sea Finding the sea remarkably free of ice Morrell advanced to 7014S before turning north westward on 14 March This retreat Morrell says was due to the ships lack of fuel otherwise he claims in these open waters he could have taken the ship to 85 or perhaps to the Pole itself These words are very similar to those used by the British explorer James Weddell to describe his own experiences in the same area a month earlier This has led historians to believe that Morrel may have copied the section from Weddels

At 2 pm next day 15 March as Wasp cruised north east in the sea that would later bear Weddells name Morrell records land was seen from the masthead bearing west distance 3 leagues His account continues At half past 4 pm we were close on with the body of land to which Captain Johnson had given the name of New South Greenland Robert Johnson a former captain of the Wasp had made an exploratory voyage along the western coast of the Antarctic peninsula in 1821 Johnson had called it New South Greenland Morrell casually refered to Johnstons description This indicates that Morrell assumed that the land he was seeing was in fact the east coast of the pensinsula At the time he wrote this his position was about 14 degrees east of that pensinsula The geographical features of the pensinsula were not known at the time of Morrells voyage Morrell describes seal hunting activities continuing along this coast during the remainder of the day On the following morning sealing resumed as the ship moved slowly southward and continued until Morrell called a halt because of shortage of water and season far advanced Mountains of snow he observed could be seen about convert75mikmsigfig2 further south

Morrell turned north from a position he calculated as 6752S 4811W Three days later on 19 March the ship passed what he took to be the northern cape of the land at 6241S 4721W This land abounds with oceanic birds of every description wrote Morrell He also records seeing 3000 sea elephants At 10 oclock Wasp bade farewell to the cheerless shores of New South Greenland there is no further mention of it in the long voyage account Wasp sailed for Tierra del Fuego then through the Magellan Strait into the Pacific Ocean reaching Valparaiso Chile on 26 July 1823

From the first navigations of the Southern Ocean in the 16th century lands which subsequently proved to be nonexistent had from time to time been reported in these waters Polar historian Robert Headland of the Scott Polar Research Institute has suggested various reasons for these false sightings ranging from too much rum to deliberate hoaxes designed to lure rival ships away from good sealing grounds Some may have been of large ice masses that were carrying rocks and other glacial debrisdirty ice can appear convincingly similar to land It is also possible that some of these lands existed but later became submerged after volcanic eruptions Other sightings may have been of actual land wrongly located through observational errors due to chronometer failure bad weather or simple incompetence

Doubt was cast over the existence of New South Greenland when in 1838 the French explorer Jules Dumont dUrville sailed over the position of Morrells north cape but saw no indication of land This evidence and the general nature of Morrells accountits obvious errors and his reputation as a braggart as great as any hero of autobiographical romance in the words of British geographer Hugh Robert Mill led many geographers thereafter to ignore his claims This scepticism remained even after Sir James Clark Ross reported an appearance of land in 1843 not far from Morrells alleged observation Rosss sighting was occasionally proffered as supportive of Morrells claim There was no further penetration of the Weddell Sea until 1903 when William Speirs Bruce took Scotia to 741S but in a sector of the sea which did not bring him close to Morrells or Rosss sightings Bruce was however generally well disposed towards Morrell writing that his claims should not be rejected until absolutely disproved

The first determined search for New South Greenland came during the Second German Antarctic Expedition 191113 under Wilhelm Filchner The expeditions ship Deutschland had become trapped in heavy sea ice while attempting to establish a shore base at Vahsel Bay Her subsequent north westerly drift had by mid June 1912 brought her to a position convert37mikm east of Morrells recorded sighting Filchner left the ship on 23 June and with two companions and sufficient provisions for three weeks sledged westward across the sea ice in search of Morrells land Daylight was limited to two or three hours a day and temperatures fell to 31 F making travel difficult In these conditions the group covered convert31mikm taking frequent sightings They found no signs of land a lead weight dropped through the ice reached a depth of convert5248ftm before the line snapped a depth which confirmed there was no land in the vicinity Filchner concluded that what Morrell had seen had been a mirage

On 17 August 1915 Sir Ernest Shackletons ship Endurance trapped in the ice like Deutschland three years earlier drifted to a point 10 miles west of Morrells charted position Here a depth sounding recorded 1676 fathoms leading Shackleton to write I decided that Morrell Land must be added to the long list of Antarctic islands and continental coasts that have resolved themselves into icebergs On 25 August a further sounding of 1900 fathoms gave Shackleton additional evidence of the non existence of New South Greenland

Although Filchners and Shackletons investigations and observations were accepted as conclusive proof that New South Greenland was a myth there remained the question of Sir James Rosss reported appearance of land in a position around 65S 47W Rosss reputation was sufficient for this possibility to be taken seriously and for his alleged sighting to be recorded on maps and Admiralty charts In 1922 Frank Wild leading the Shackleton Rowett Expedition aboard Quest after Shackletons death early in the expedition investigated the location of Rosss sighting Nothing was seen prevented by ice conditions from reaching the exact spot Wild took a sounding at 6411S 464W which revealed convert2331fathomft m0 of water This showed that no land was near

According to WJ Mills Morrell had the reputation among his contemporaries as the biggest liar in the Southern Ocean Mills calls the westward journey from Morrells claimed farthest east position impossible unbelievably fast quite apart from lying south of the coastline for much of the way In search of an explanation Mills suggests that since Morrells account was written nine years after the voyage he may not have had access to the ships log and hence may have felt constrained to invent details that appeared plausible in order to sustain his narrative This would explain the profusion of positional and date errors

Hugh Robert Mill writing in 1905 before the non existence of New South Greenland had been proved conclusively refers to the sheer absurdity of some of the incidents described in Morrells account and concludes that because of Morrells blunders and his habit of incorporating the experiences of others into his story all his claims must be treated as not proven Nevertheless he concedes that a man may be ignorant boastful and obscure and yet have done a solid piece of work Canadian geographer Paul Simpson Housley adopts a more sympathetic approach Although dubious about much of Morrells account Simpson Housley suggests that the speeds claimed for the western journey though fast are not impossible He believes that the claimed farthest south in the Weddell Sea queried by Mill  is entirely plausible given that James Weddell had sailed four degrees further south just a month earlier

Another inclined to defend Morrells integrity is the writer Rupert Gould who included a lengthy essay on New South Greenland in his collection Enigmas published in 1929 The assumption that the New South Greenland sighting was simply invented by Morrell is dismissed primarily on the grounds of the very little weight given to the discovery in Morrells 500 page account Gould writes If Morrell wished to gain an undeserved reputation as an Antarctic explorer one would think he could have gone a better way about it than to bury his pices justificatives after he had forged them in an undistinguished corner of so bulky a book In the relatively few pages devoted to the Antarctic Morrells account of his discovery is brief and entirely matter of fact crediting it to Captain Johnson two years earlier rather than to himself

Gould also discusses the possibility that what Morrell sighted was indeed the eastern coast of Graham Land the so called Foyn Coast despite its being 14 further west from position of the New South Greenland sighting In support Gould asserts that the peninsulas eastern coast corresponds very closely with the stretch of coastline described by Morrell This theory supposes that Morrell miscalculated the ships position perhaps because he lacked the chronometer necessary for proper navigational observation In his account Morrell writes that he was destitute of the various nautical and mathematical instruments but other parts of his narrative make it clear that the occasional dead reckoning calculation was the exception to the norm In any circumstances a longitudinal error of 14 is very large and the additional distance of about convert350mikm to the Foyn coast seems too great to have been covered within the ten day voyage from the South Sandwich Islands where the ships position is recorded accurately Even so Gould maintains that a balance of evidence shows that what Morrell saw was the Foyn coast

Filchners view that the supposed sighting of New South Greenland could be explained by a mirage is echoed by Simpson Housley He suggests that Morrell and his crew saw a superior mirage One form of superior mirage sometimes described as a Fata Morgana distorts distant flat coastlines or ice edges both vertically and horizontally so they can appear to have tall cliffs and other features such as high mountain peaks and valleys In his expedition account South Shackleton gives a description of a Fata Morgana observed on 20 August 1915 coincidentally as his ship Endurance drifted close to the recorded position of New South Greenland The distant pack is thrown up into towering barrier like cliffs which are reflected in blue lakes and lanes of water at their base Great white and golden cities of Oriental appearance at close intervals along these cliff tops indicate distant bergs The lines rise and fall tremble dissipate and reappear in an endless transformation scene

Morrells four voyages finally ended on 21 August 1831 with his return to New York He then wrote his Narrative of Four Voyages which was published the following year He attempted to resume his seafaring career seeking employment with the London based shipping firm of Enderby Brothers but his reputation had preceded him and he was rejected Charles Enderby stated publicly that he had heard so much of him that he did not think fit to enter into any engagement with him Morrell also sought to join Dumont DUrvilles expedition to the Weddell Sea in 1837 but his services were again declined He reportedly died in 1839 and is commemorated by Morrell Island 5927S 2719W an alternative name for Thule Island in the Southern Thule sub group of the South Sandwich Islands Robert Johnson who coined the name New South Greenland disappeared with his ship in 1826 while investigating the Antarctic waters in the vicinity of what would later be known as the Ross Sea

Caesalpinioideae is a subfamily of the flowering plant family Fabaceae Members of this family usually have zygomorphic flowers 

Some classification systems for example the Cronquist system treat Fabaceae in a narrow sense raising Mimosoideae to the rank of family as Caesalpiniaceae The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group treats Fabaceae in the broad sense

Haptic technology or haptics is a tactile feedback technology It makes vibrations and movements which can make people think that there is a real object when there isnt They are used to look into the sense of touch Some video games use this to make it seem more real

The word Haptic comes from the Greek Haphe meaning pertaining to the sense of touch and comes from the Greek word haptesthai meaning to contact or to touch

Existing computer technology to the human and computer information exchange has been used mainly audio visual information However the user through the virtual reality want to be more specific and realistic information and is designed to feel the passing touch and force haptic technology

Haptis are divided into the force feedback and tactile feedback

Force feedback is the technology that user to feel the power and movements For example the park that are dynamic in the movie in the film as a moving screen move the chair forward speed and sense of the conflict that their audience will feel like scenes This is an example haeptikseuui using force feedback

Tactile feedback place in the field of medicine that is used a lot On a computer screen and watch the virtual 3 dimensional anatomical structure of the patient directly to the affected part of the 3 D video in real time sisulhal a notice on your computer screen And the compressed air and electrical machinery such as moving suyonggi using a small pin and in fact feels like touching the skin and is passed to implement the reality of the situation is almost similar to the environment

In the future the output of the computer device used to monitor speakers as well as standard haptic devices is expected to go In addition the leisure industry with the 21st century haptic technology has many economical potential haptic technology for the study will be very active

Carl Henning Pedersen was a Danish painter and a key member of the COBRA movement which existed from 1948 to 1951 He was known as the Scandinavian Chagall and was one of the leading Danish artists of the second half of the 20th century

Pedersen was born in Copenhagen and brought up in the poor area near Vigerslev Alle He held radical political beliefs He joined the International Folk High School in Elsinore in 1933 where he met self taught painter Else Alfelt They married in 1934 and their first daughter Vibeke Alfelt was born later that year Else Alfelt encouraged Pedersen to paint and he first exhibited at the Artists Autumn Exhibition in Copenhagen in 1936 where he showed four abstract works His modernist style was at odds with the socialist realism preferred by his communist friends who snubbed him he argued with Bertolt Brecht about his art His abstract works with flat planes of colour emulated the works of cubists and of Paul Klee

Pedersen travelled on foot to Paris in 1939 where he saw works by Picasso and Matisse He visited the exhibition of degenerate art in Frankfurt am Main on his way home where he was inspired by the paintings on show particularly the works of Chagall which remained a strong influence on his art for the rest of his life His second daughter Kari Nina was born in 1940 He joined the Hst group during the Nazi occupation of Denmark writing about medieval Danish murals for its journal Helhesten and continued to produce controversial modern abstract works 

Pedersen and Else Alfelt were founder members of the CoBrA movement in 1948 together with Asger Jorn Karel Appel and others The movement took its name from the European cities where its founders were based Copenhagen Brussels and Amsterdam They remained with the group until it dissolved in 1951 producing free form spontaneous images in strong fantastic colours He won the Eckersberg Award in 1950 and the Guggenheim Award in 1958 A retrospective was put on at the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh in 1961 and he was Denmarks representative at the Venice Biennale in 1962 He won the Thorvaldsen Medal in 1963

Pedersen moved into monumental art in the 1960s and 1970s producing a large mosaic Cosmic Sea for the H C rsted Institute at Copenhagen University and a huge tiled wall decoration Fantasy Play Around the Wheel of Life for the Angli courtyard in Herning

Pedersen was known for resisting to sell his works Instead he donated thousands to the Carl Henning Pedersen and Else Alfelt Museum which opened in Herning in 1976 Further works were donated to the Danish National Gallery in early 2007

Pedersen moved to Burgundy in the 1980s but most of his work still came from Danish sources He surprised many when he worked on the redecoration of the Gothic cathedral in Ribe working on the murals painted glass and mosaics to illustrate Bible stories from 1983 to 1987 He also produced bronze sculptures and works in oils and watercolour

He died in Copenhagen after a long illness He was survived by his second wife Sidsel Ramson

The Roman Senate was the longest lasting institution in Ancient Rome It began in the first years of the city which was supposedly founded in 753 BC It survived the kings the Roman Republic the Roman Empire 27 BC395 AD and the fall of the Western Roman Empire

The Republic started as an advisory council and reached its peak in the middle Republic when it was the most powerful body in Rome The Senate lost much of its power in the first period of the Empire known as the Principate

After Diocletian when the centre of government was moved out of Rome the Senate became just a municipal body The influence of the old idea lived on and Constantine II set up a Senate in Constantinople

The Senate passed decrees called senatus consultum which were advice from the Senate to a magistrate They usually were obeyed in practice

Through such advice the Senate directed the magistrates especially the Roman Consuls in their handling of military conflicts 

The Senate also had an enormous degree of power over the civil government in Rome Only the Senate could authorize the disbursal of public funds from the treasury As the Roman Empire grew the Senate also supervised the administration of the provinces which were governed by former consuls and praetors It decided which magistrate should govern which province

The senators were patricians and so members by birth or men of lesser birth who had notable achievements Under the early kings the Senate numbered 100 but grew to 900 then Augustus reduced it to 600 Even so only about 100 to 200 members were active at any given time From time to time there were other sources of power in Rome such as assemblies magistrates dictators and emperors but the Senate always played a part

In the government of the United Kingdom the Cabinet is a group of 22 people led and chosen by the Prime Minister who are the main decision makers in the British government People in the cabinet usually have to be members of either the House of Commons or the House of Lords

In the cabinet today there is a coalition which is when two or more parties make up the government In this case there are two political parties the Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats

Superman is a 1999 video game for the Nintendo 64 where the player controls Superman a fictional superhero Superman must save his friends from Lex Luthor his archenemy Most of the game is spent flying through rings The game has received very negative reviews from critics and has been stated as one of the worst games of all time for lame weapons in the non ring levels overcomplicated controls and bad graphics

The player assumes the role of Superman who is challenged to complete many tasks and puzzles throughout the 14 levels in the game Most of the levels in the game are restricted to two types of gameplay in some levels referred to as Ride Levels in the games instruction manual Superman is instructed to fly through a series of hoops by Lex Luthor in between he is also tasked to perform certain feats such as battling Luthors minions the Dark Shadows and rescuing civilians from natural or artificial disasters firstly stopping two cars from trapping civilians

In other levels referred to as Maze Levels in the games instruction manual Superman has found one of his friends from within one of Luthors outposts and must escape with them and defeat a boss These levels are generally more rooted in action adventure and make great use of puzzle solving The games virtual Metropolis in which these stages take place is filled with what the developers called Kryptonite fog in an apparent effort by Lex Luthor to diminish Supermans abilities

The game also includes two multi player modes that can be played with up to four people In the battle mode players must defeat their opponents by throwing various weapons and items at them In the racing mode players control a spaceship and rings shoot from the backside of one opponent

Superman was originally shown at the E3 in 1997 In interview before the game was released Eric Caen co founder of Titus Software stated they were attempting to create the first super hero based video game where players really behave as a super hero After the N64 versions negative response Titus decided to completely redesign Superman for the PlayStation Unfortunately Titus lost the rights from the Warner Bros for the Superman License resulting in its cancellation in 1999 Given an exclusive look at the game playstationmuseumcom stated that they had expected the worst but they were pleasantly surprised by the high quality graphics and animation and awarded the game a rating of 90

The Delisle scale is a scale to measure temperature It was introduced by French astronomer Joseph Nicolas Delisle in 1732 Delisle used a thermometer that worked with Mercury The unit is abbreviated De or D 0De is equal to the boiling point of water under normal pressure Delisle then measured the volume change of the mercury At the start the Delisle scale had 2400 degrees Josias Weitbrecht recalibrated the theromometer in 1738 so that the melting point of ice was taken into account Ice melts at 150De 

The Deslile scale counts downwards from the boiling point to the melitng point It was widely used in Russia in the 19th century

The Wandering Albatross is a large seabird of the family Diomedeidae It is also called the Snowy Albatross or White winged Albatross It is the largest member of the genus Diomedea and has the largest wingspan of any living bird It can be up to 115 feet wide According to the IUCN it is a vulnerable species

Wandering Albatrosses live together when breeding which they do once every two years They are monogamous and usually mate for life They can live for over 50 years and adult mortality is only 5 to 7 a year 

They make many different kinds of noises such as screams whistles grunts and bill clapping When they are looking for a mate they spread their wings wave their heads and tap their bills together They feed at night on cephalopods small fish and crustaceans

The Roman Kingdom was the monarchical government of the city of Rome and its territories No written records from that time survive The histories about it were written during the Republic and Empire and are largely based on legend Therefore not much is certain about the history of the Roman Kingdom 

However the history of the Roman Kingdom began with the citys founding traditionally dated to 753 BC and ended with the overthrow of the kings and the establishment of the Republic in about 509 BC

What eventually became the Roman Empire began as settlements around the Palatine Hill along the river Tiber in central Italy The river was navigable up to that place The site also had a ford where the Tiber could be crossed The Palatine Hill and hills surrounding it presented easily defensible positions in the wide fertile plain surrounding them All these features contributed to the success of the city

The traditional account of Roman history is that in Romes first centuries it was ruled by a succession of seven kings The traditional chronology is discounted by modern scholarship The Gauls destroyed all of Romes historical records when they sacked the city after the Battle of the Allia in 390 BC or 3876 so no contemporary records of the kingdom exist All accounts of the kings must be questioned

The power of the kings was almost absolute though the Senate had some influence There was one big exception kingship was not hereditary

Whenever a king died Rome entered a period of interregnum Supreme power of the state would go to the Senate which was responsible for finding a new king The Senate would assemble and appoint one of its own membersthe interrexto serve for a period of five days with the sole purpose of nominating the next king of Rome 

After the five day period the interrex would appoint another Senator for another five day term This process would continue until a new king was elected Once the interrex found a suitable nominee to the kingship he would bring the nominee before the Senate and the Senate would review him If the Senate passed the nominee the interrex would convene the Assembly and preside over it during the election of the King

Once proposed to the Assembly the people of Rome could either accept or reject him If accepted the king elect did not immediately enter office Two other acts still had to take place before he was invested with the full regal authority and power

First it was necessary to obtain the divine will of the gods respecting his appointment by means of the auspices since the king would serve as high priest of Rome This ceremony was performed by an augur who conducted the king elect to the citadel where he was placed on a stone seat as the people waited below If found worthy of the kingship the augur announced that the gods had given favorable tokens thus confirming the kings priestly character

The second act which had to be performed was the conferral of the imperium upon the king The Assemblys previous vote only determined who was to be king and had not by that act bestowed the necessary power of the king upon him Accordingly the king himself proposed to the Assembly a law granting him imperium and the Assembly by voting in favor of the law would grant it

In theory the people of Rome elected their leader but the Senate had most of the control over the process

Romulus was Romes first king and the citys founder the two names are clearly linked In 753 BC Romulus began building the city upon the Palatine Hill After founding and naming Rome he permitted men of all classes to come to Rome as citizens including slaves and freemen without distinction To provide his citizens with wives Romulus invited the neighboring tribes to a festival in Rome where he abducted the young women from amongst them After the ensuing war with the Sabines Romulus shared the kingship with the Sabine king Titus Tatius

Romulus selected 100 of the best men to form the Roman senate as an advisory council to the king These men he called patres and their descendants became the patricians He also divided the general populace into thirty curiae named after thirty of the Sabine women who had intervened to end the war between Romulus and Tatius The curiae formed the voting units in the Roman assemblies Comitia Curiata

In addition to the war with the Sabines and other tribes after the Rape of the Sabine Women Romulus waged war against the Fidenates and Veientes After his death at the age of 54 Romulus was deified as the war god Quirinus and served not only as one of the three major gods of Rome but also as the deified likeness of the city of Rome

The seventh and final king of Rome was Lucius Tarquinius Superbus Tarquinius was of Etruscan birth It was also during his reign that the Etruscans reached their apex of power More than other kings before him Tarquinius used violence murder and terrorism to maintain control over Rome He repealed many of the earlier constitutional reforms of his predecessors

A sex scandal brought down the king Allegedly Tarquinius allowed his son Sextus Tarquinius to rape Lucretia a patrician Roman Sextus had threatened Lucretia that if she refused to copulate with him he would kill a slave then kill her and have the bodies discovered together thus creating a gigantic scandal Lucretia then told her relatives about the threat and then committed suicide to avoid any such scandal Lucretias kinsman Lucius Junius Brutus summoned the Senate and had Tarquinius and the monarchy expelled from Rome in 510 BC

Etruscan rule in Rome thus came to a dramatic end in 510 BC which also signalled the downfall of Etruscan power in Latium

Lucius Junius Brutus and Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus a member of the Tarquin family and Lucretias widower went on to become the first consuls of Romes new government This new government would lead the Romans to conquer most of the Mediterranean world and would survive for the next 500 years until the rise of Julius Caesar and Octavian 

Many years later during the Republican period this strong Roman opposition to kings was used by the Senate as a rationalization for the murder of the agrarian reformer Tiberius Gracchus

Bromine compounds are chemical compounds that have bromine ions in them Bromine comes in several oxidation states 1 1 3 4 5 and 7

The most common 1 compounds are bromides Ionic bromides are colorless solids that dissolve in water easily Covalent bromides can be liquids or gases

Unstable oxidizing agents less stable than the hypochlorites

Unstable oxidizing agents less stable than the chlorites

Stable oxidizing agents similar to chlorates

Very unstable oxidizing agents

Hypobromite is an ion Its chemical formula is BrO It contains bromine in its 1 oxidation state It is an oxidizing agent It is similar to hypochlorite Hypobromites are the salts of hypobromous acid Hypobromite is a disinfectant Some white blood cells oxidize bromide to hypobromite with peroxide and use the hypobromite to kill germs Bromides can be added to pools along with chlorine to make hypobromite which disinfects the pools

Hypobromites are made by dissolving bromine in a basic solution Hypobromite disproportionates to bromate and bromide when heated

Hypobromous acid is a chemical compound It is also an acid Its chemical formula is HBrO It contains hydrogen and hypobromite ions It is a weak and unstable acid It is similar to hypochlorous acid It disproportionates into bromate and bromide when heated or left to dry It is made when bromine is added to warm water It can kill many bacteria and deodorize It works very well when it is with hypochlorous acid 

Bromous acid is a chemical compound It is an acid Its chemical formula is HBrO2 It contains hydrogen and bromite ions It contains bromine in its 3 oxidation state

It can be made by oxidizing hypobromous acid with hypochlorous acid It can also be made by careful disproportionation of hypobromous acid It can also be made by reacting hypobromous acid and bromic acid They can be used to reduce permanganates to manganates 

Perbromic acid is a chemical compound It is an acid Its chemical formula is HBrO4 It contains hydrogen and perbromate ions

Perbromic acid is a very unstable acid It easily breaks down It can be made by reacting perbromates with an acid It releases oxygen and turns into bromic acid It can also totally break down releasing bromine gas

Bromite is an ion Its chemical formula is BrO2 It is made by reacting bromous acid with a base They easily disproportionate to bromates and bromides

Perbromate is an ion Its chemical formula is BrO4 It contains bromine in its 7 oxidation state It is a strong oxidizing agent It is very unstable and turns into bromate and oxygen easily It was first made by decay of a radioactive selenate Later it was gotten by electrolysis of a bromate It can also be made by oxidation of bromate with fluorine or xenon difluoride 

Bromate is an ion Its chemical formula is BrO3 It contains bromine in its 5 oxidation state It is more common than hypobromites perbromates and bromites Sodium bromate is an example Bromates are strong oxidizing agents

Bromates are made by reacting bromides with ozone They can also be made by electrolysis of a hot bromide solution Chlorine dioxide can react with bromide when in sunlight to make bromate Bromates can be made by reacting potassium hydroxide with bromine This makes bromide and bromate Bromates can be made by reacting bromic acid with a base

It might be a carcinogen It is made when bromide is in water and reacted with ozone or chlorine Sometimes water with too much bromate has to be gotten rid of

Constructivism was an artistic and architectural movement that originated in Russia from 1919 onward which rejected the idea of art for arts sake in favour of art for social purposes

Constructivism as an active force lasted until around 1934 having a great deal of effect on the art of the Weimar Republic and elsewhere before being replaced by Socialist Realism Its motifs have sporadically recurred in other art movements since

Suprematism is an abstract art movement started in Russia 19151916 It focussed on basic geometric forms such as the square and circle It is an example of geometric abstraction

Suprematism was founded by Kazimir Malevich In his book The Non Objective World published abroad as a Bauhaus Book in 1927 Malevich described the inspiration which brought about the powerful image of the black square on a white ground

He created a suprematist grammar based on fundamental geometric forms in particular the square and the circle In 1915 Malevich exhibited his early experiments in suprematist painting The centerpiece of his show was the Black Square placed in what is called the redbeautiful corner in Russian Orthodox tradition the place of the main icon in a house Black Square was painted in 1915 and was a breakthrough in his career and in art in general Malevich also painted White on White which marked a breakthrough from polychrome to monochrome suprematism

Some of the titles to paintings in 1915 express the concept of a non euclidean geometry which imagined forms in movement or through time titles such as Two dimensional painted masses in the state of movement 

The Supremus group met from 1915 onwards to discuss the philosophy of suprematism and its development into other areas of life There was some crossover with constructivism with suprematists such as Lyuba Popova and especially El Lissitzky working on propaganda and industrial design 

Lissitzky spread suprematist ideas abroad in the early 1920s

Nikolai Suetin used suprematist motifs on works at the St Petersburg Lomonosov Porcelain Factory where Malevich and Chashnik were also employed and Malevich designed a suprematist teapot The suprematists also made architectural models in the 1920s which offered a different conception of socialist buildings to those developed in constructivist architecture 

Malevichs architectural projects were known after 1922 Arkhitektoniki Designs emphasized the right angle with similarities to De Stijl and Le Corbusier and were justified with an ideological connection to communist governance and equality for all Another part of the formalism was low regard for triangles which were dismissed as ancient pagan or Christian

This development in artistic expression came about when Russia was in a revolutionary state ideas were in ferment and the old order was being swept away As the new order became established and Stalinism took hold from 1924 on the state began limiting the freedom of artists From the late 1920s the Russian avant garde experienced direct and harsh criticism from the authorities and in 1934 the doctrine of socialist realism became official policy and prohibited abstraction and different artistic expression 

Computer rage is a heightened physiological response with associated feelings of anger and frustration resulting from using a computer or other complex electronic device It may result in the physical assault of the computer or similar item possibly leading to the device incurring more damage than it had before

Computer rage may manifest itself in verbal abuse and occasionally physical violence towards the object in some cases violent actions towards the hardware itself usually either thumping the keyboard shaking the monitor or banging the mouse on the tabledesk In online interactions enraged persons may flame and abuse other users shouting at them through headsets sending rude messages or rage quit 

Computer rage may be caused by distress due to a hardware or software problem which the enraged person is unable to correct Persons may bang or kick the computer in an attempt to get it to function normally though this action carries the distinct risk of destroying the computers hard disk drive via a head crash Another common occurrence of computer rage is whilst playing computer games mainly first person shooters and mmorpgs Computer rage is normally induced when a gamer either fails an objective or is killed repeatedly

Tech support personnel and systems administrators may be subjected to customers anger at a malfunctioning system commonly including the aforementioned verbal abuse

Kazimir Malevich was a Russian painter and art theoretician He was born in Ukraine of ethnic Polish parents He was a pioneer of geometric abstract art and the originator of the avant garde Suprematism movement

In March 1913 a major exhibition of Aristarkh Lentulovs paintings opened in Moscow The effect of this exhibition was comparable with that of Paul Czanne in Paris in 1907 as all the main Russian avant garde artists of the time immediately absorbed the cubist principles and began using them in their works 

Already in the same year the Cubo Futurist opera Victory Over the Sun with Malevichs stage set became a great success In 1914 Malevich exhibited his works in the Salon des Independants in Paris

In 1915 Malevich laid down the foundations of Suprematism He published his manifesto From Cubism to Suprematism In 19161917 he took part in exhibitions of the Jack of Diamonds group in Moscow Famous examples of his Suprematist works were exhibited there including Black Square and White on White 

After the October Revolution Malevich became a member of the Collegium on the Arts of Narkompros the commission for the protection of monuments and the museums commission 

He taught at the Vitebsk Practical Art School in the USSR the Leningrad Academy of Arts the Kiev State Art Institute and the House of the Arts in Leningrad He wrote the book The World as Non Objectivity which outlines his Suprematist theories

In 1927 he traveled to Warsaw and then to Berlin and Munich for a retrospective exhibition This finally brought him international recognition 

Malevich arranged to leave most of the paintings behind when he returned to the Soviet Union because he could see what was going to happen

Malevich thought a shift in attitude of the Soviet authorities towards the modernist art movement would take place after the death of Lenin This proved correct In a couple of years the Stalinist regime turned against forms of abstractism considering them a type of bourgeois art which could not express social reality As a consequence many of his works were confiscated and he was banned from creating and exhibiting similar art

Critics derided Malevich for negating everything good and pure love of life and love of nature Malevich responded that art can advance and develop for arts sake alone regardless of its pleasure art does not need us and it never did

Malevichs work only recently reappeared in art exhibitions in Russia after a long absence Since then art followers have worked to reintroduce the artist to Russian lovers of painting A book of his theoretical works with an anthology of reminiscences and writings has been published

On 3 November 2008 a work by Malevich entitled Suprematist Composition from 1916 set the world record for any Russian work of art and any work sold at auction for that year It sold at Sothebys in New York City for just over 60 million US

An interhalogen is a chemical compound It is made by two halogens reacting with each other Normally interhalogens are quite toxic and reactive An example would be chlorine trifluoride or bromine monochloride

Chlorine trifluoride is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is ClF3 It contains chlorine and fluoride ions The chlorine is in its 3 oxidation state

Chlorine trifluoride is a colorless gas but it can be compressed to a light yellow liquid Chlorine trifluoride is normally sold compressed It is an interhalogen and is very reactive It can burn plastics sand skin hydrogen sulfide metals phosphorus and sulfur Since it is a much stronger oxidizing agent than oxygen it can burn things that normally cant burn like concrete or sand It reacts with water very violently to make hydrofluoric acid and hydrochloric acid It can ignite glass after being in it for a while

Chlorine trifluoride is made by reacting chlorine with fluorine This makes other chlorine fluorides which have to be taken out

Chlorine trifluoride is used to make uranium hexafluoride by reacting it with uranium metal It was looked at as a rocket propellant It was also looked at as a poison gas It is too difficult to make and store though Chlorine trifluoride can be used to clean areas where semiconductors are made

Chlorine trifluoride is extremely toxic and dangerous It can catch many things on fire The fires are almost impossible to put out It reacts with most things

The Evil Empire is a term which was used by the US president Ronald Reagan It is a synonym for the Soviet Empire which consists of the republics of the Soviet Union and the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance Members of this council were satellite states which where formally independent but always controlled into the right direction by the Soviet Union with military if they considered it as necessary

The first known usage of the term Evil Empire was in one of Reagans speeches at 1983 He proposes to continue the endless war between good and evil This emphasizes that you need both sides to agree for an nuclear freeze If only the US reduced their nuclear weapons it would be a very dangerous fraud for that is merely the illusion of peace In contrast to this illusion he stands for the reality This means for him peace through strength

The policy of containment was a diplomatic strategy of the United States to prevent the spread of the communism during the Cold War Economic support should bind countries to the United States This was a counteraction against the new Soviet sphere of influence

In March 1947 the US president Harry Truman announced support for countries which were threatened by military force This speech is called Truman Doctrine nowadays In detail he promised support for Greece and Turkey against the Soviet Union

The most important part of the policy of containment was the European Recovery Program also known as Marshall Plan which should boost the European economy after the destruction in the Second World War usingmost importantmoney successful American economic models and less European trade barriers

The Y10K literally meaning the Year 10000 Problem is an error machines and computers will encounter when the need to express five digits for a year

Some people practice the art of cutting the last two digits of a decade For example the 1970s becomes just the 70s However this becomes a problem because to keep order one will now need to take the last three digits rather than two

This is also a problem because the 000s might be confused with the legit 00s representing a new century Also the year can overflow with certain computer programs On Microsoft Excel for instance in a cell the date 12319999 is a legit date but 1110000 causes a problem The date ten thousand is unable to be supported producing a large negative instead

So far the Long Now Foundation is able to preempt the Y10K by adding a 0 in front of the date So the year 2000 would look like this 02000 However it would still be subsceptible to a Y100K problem

Araucaria is a genus of evergreen coniferous trees in the family Araucariaceae There are 19 species in the genus with a scattered distribution They are found in New Caledonia Norfolk Island eastern Australia New Guinea Argentina Chile and southern Brazil

The present populations are relicts and of restricted distribution They are found in forest and shrubland in exposed sites These tall trees are living fossils dating back to early in the Mesozoic era 

Fossil records show that the genus also formerly occurred in the northern hemisphere until the end of the Cretaceous period By far the greatest diversity exists in New Caledonia due to the islands long isolation and stability

Araucaria are mainly large trees with a massive erect stem reaching a height of 3080 m The horizontal spreading branches grow in whorls and are covered with leathery or needle like leaves In some species the leaves are narrow awl shaped and lanceolate barely overlapping each other in others they are broad and flat and overlap broadly

9500 is a year in the 10th millennium

Agathis is a genus of evergreen coniferous trees the kauri They grow mainly in the southern hemisphere including southeast Asia areas of the western Pacific and Australasia

Agathis is a relatively small genus with only 21 known species As a conifer it produces pine cones Mature Agathis can become quite large reaching 130 feet in height and 10 feet in diameter

The genus is part of the ancient Araucariaceae family of conifers a group once widespread during the Jurassic period but now largely restricted to the southern hemisphere

Mature kauri trees have large trunks forming a bole with little or no branching below the crown In contrast young trees are normally conical in shape forming a more rounded or irregularly shaped crown as they mature

In the logging industry it is generally referred to as commercial grade mahogany Timber from the Agathis has several uses including cabinet making boat building musical instruments and in years past artificial limbs It also produces a wide variety of resins

9500 is a number It comes after 9499 and before 9501 It is also an even number

Red Bull is an energy drink Red Bull is based on the Thai energy drink Krating Daeng which translates as Red Bull Red Bull is the most popular energy drink in the world based on its share of sales The company was founded by Thai national Chaleo Yoovidhya and Austrian national Dietrich Mateschitz Chaleo Yoovidhya and his son own 51 percent interest in the company Mateschitz is responsible for the companys operations through the Austrian company Red Bull GmbH

Red Bulls slogan is it gives you wings The product is strongly marketed through advertising tournament sponsorship sports team ownerships celebrity endorsements and with its record label Red Bull sponsors Red Bull Air Race Red Bull Crashed Ice It owns the sports team Red Bull Racing Scuderia Toro Rosso EC Red Bull Salzburg FC Red Bull Salzburg Red Bull New York and RB Leipzig Red Bull started its own record label Red Bull Records 

In 2009 it was discovered that Red Bull Cola exported from Austria contained trace amounts of cocaine Red Bull has also been criticized about the possible health risks of the drink

Red Bull took many marketing and ingredient ideas from an energy drink in Thailand called Krating Daeng Dietrich Mateschitz an Austrian entrepreneur developed the Red Bull Energy Drink brand Mateschitz was the international marketing director for Blendax a toothpaste company when he visited Thailand in 1982 and discovered that Krating Daeng helped to cure his jet lag Between 1984 and 1987 Mateschitz worked with TC Pharmaceutical to adapt Krating Daeng for the European market

At the same time Mateschitz and Chaleo Yoovidhya founded Red Bull GmbH each investing 500000 of savings and taking a stake in the new company Chaleo and Dietrich each held a 49 share of the new company They gave the remaining 2 to Chaleos son Chalerm but it was agreed that Mateschitz would run the company The product was launched in 1987 in a carbonated format

Red Bull was launched first in Singapore in 1989 followed by Hungary its second foreign market in 1992 It entered the United States market in 1997 and the Middle East in 2000 In 2008 Forbes magazine listed both Chaleo and Mateschitz as being the 260th richest persons in the world with an estimated net worth of 40 billion

Red Bull contains taurine glucuronolactone caffeine B vitamins sucrose and glucose Red Bull sugar free also contains phenylalanine in place of sucrose and glucose

Red Bull GmbH also manufactures Red Bull Cola containing the coca leaf which has sparked a controversy in Germany regarding minute traces of cocaine

A review published in 2008 found no documented reports of negative or positive health effects associated with the amount of taurine used in energy drinks including Red Bull concluding that The amounts of guarana taurine and ginseng found in popular energy drinks are far below the amounts expected to deliver either therapeutic benefits or adverse events However caffeine and sugar are present in amounts known to cause a variety of adverse health effects

Commonly reported adverse effects due to caffeine used in the quantities present in Red Bull are insomnia nervousness headache and tachycardia A 2008 position statement issued by the National Federation of State High School Associations made the following recommendations about energy drink consumption in general by young athletes

The results of a study conducted in 2008 showed that the ingestion of one 250mL can of sugar free Red Bull in a sample of 30 healthy young adults had an immediate detrimental effect on both endothelial function and normal blood coagulation This temporarily raised the cardiovascular risk in these individuals to a level comparable to that of an individual with established coronary artery disease

Based on their results researchers involved with the study cautioned against the consumption of Red Bull in individuals under stress in those with high blood pressure or in anyone with established atherosclerotic disease Red Bull representatives however stated that this observed increase in cardiovascular risk was not felt to be different from that associated with drinking a regular cup of coffee They also stated that they believed that Red Bull must be safe as it was felt the only way Red Bull could have such substantial global sales is if various health authorities had concluded the drink safe to consume

There has been at least one case report of Red Bull overdose causing postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome in a young athlete A February 3 2009 article in The Daily Telegraph called Red Bull may have triggered heart condition that killed student reported on the death of a 21 year old woman who died after drinking four cans of Red Bull as well as alcohol at social levels It was believed but had not been proven that she suffered from a rare heart condition called long QT Syndrome She was on medication for epilepsy A medical examination found that there were no illegal drugs in her system The article quoted a doctor as saying The QT levels may have grown over a few years or it may have been artificially pushed over the limit by caffeine

In April and June 2009 batches of Red Bull Cola drinks imported from Austria were found to contain between 01  03 micrograms of cocaine per litre according to Hong Kong officials In Taiwan it was found that the importer was due to launch a marketing campaign the next day Importing cocaine to the island is an offense that is punishable by death or a life sentence in prison In Germany 11 out of 16 states had already banned the drinks by May 25 2009

Testing of Red Bull Energy Drink and its variations has shown that a person with a low tolerance for cocaine would have to consume two million cans of the drink in a single sitting before becoming critically ill from the cocaine However this finding is legally irrelevant since distribution of cocaine is illegal in any quantity in Taiwan At this point no further action has been taken on the matter in Taiwan

The Tammar Wallaby are a small species of wallaby from Australia They were the first macropods to be seen by Europeans Francisco Pelsaert captain of the Batavia saw them when the ship was wrecked on the Abrolhos Islands in 1629 He said they looked like hopping cats There are three sub species of Tammar Wallaby

The name Tammar comes from the word tamma meaning sheoak The wallaby lives under sheoak plants

Tammar wallabies became extinct on mainland South Australia in the 1930s Extinction has been caused by habitat destruction hunting and foxes In 1998 a small population of South Australian wallabies was found living on Kawau Island near Auckland in New Zealand This group had been established by former South Australian governor Sir George Grey in 1862 as part of his own private zoo In New Zealand these wallabies were seen as a pest and scientists have been studying ways to get rid of them 85 wallabies were taken back to South Australia After extensive fox controls at Innes National Park 10 wallabies were released in November 2004 Another 36 were released in June 2005 These first releases were tracked with radio collars Another group has been put into a captive breeding program at Monarto Zoo

Tammar Wallabies live in thick scrub during the day and come out into grassland to feed at night They eat mainly grass and herbs In dry areas they have been known to survive by drinking seawater They range over an area of about five hectares

They are about 50 centimetres in height with a dark grey brown fur They have reddish colour on their arms and sides with pale grey fur on their bellies They may also have a feint white line on their cheeks

The wallabies have a very unusual breeding pattern The fertilized eggs remain dormant inside the mother until the summer solstice when foetal development restarts This is called embryonic diapause All the young are born on the same day about 31 days later at the end of January or the beginning of February

The Tammar Wallaby is the marsupial chosen for the genome sequencing project Scientists are studying the milk from the wallaby as they think it might contain a new and powerful antibiotic

The Antonine Wall is a stone and turf fortification built by the Romans across the Midlands of Scotland between the Firth of Forth and the Firth of Clyde

The Antonine Wall is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site called Frontiers of the Roman Empire It shares this listing with Hadrians Wall and the German wall known as the Limes Germanicus 

It was the northernmost frontier barrier of the Roman Empire It spanned about 39 miles and was about ten feet high and fifteen feet wide There was a deep ditch on the north side The barrier was the second of two great walls created by the Romans in Britannia Its ruins are less visible than the better known Hadrians Wall to the south

Construction began in AD 142 at the order of Roman Emperor Antoninus Pius and took about twelve years to complete Pressure from the Caledonians may have led Antoninus to send the empires troops farther north The wall was protected by sixteen forts with a number of small fortlets between them troop movement was facilitated by a road linking all the sites known as the Military Way The soldiers who built the wall commemorated the construction and their struggles with the barbarians in a number of decorative slabs twenty of which still survive 

Despite this good start the wall was abandoned after only twenty years The garrisons were sent back to Hadrians Wall In 208 Emperor Septimius Severus re established legions at the wall and ordered repairs this has led to the wall being referred to as the Severan Wall However the occupation ended only a few years later and the wall was never fortified again Most of the wall and its associated fortifications have been destroyed over time but some remains are still visible Many of these have come under the care of Historic Scotland and the UNESCO World Heritage Site Committee

This was the only attempt the Empire made to hold Scottish territory

The Fosse Way was one of the main Roman roads in Britain It linked Exeter in South West England to Lincoln in the East Midlands The road went via Ilchester Bath Cirencester and Leicester

It joined Akeman Street and Ermin Way at Cirencester crossed Watling Street at Venonis south of Leicester and joined Ermine Street at Lincoln

The word Fosse is derived from the Latin fossa meaning ditch For the first few decades after the Roman invasion of Britain in AD 43 the Fosse Way marked the western frontier of Roman rule in Iron Age Britain It is possible that the road began as a defensive ditch that was later filled in and converted into a road or possibly a defensive ditch ran alongside the road for at least some of its length

It is remarkable for its extremely direct route From Lincoln to Ilchester in Somerset is a distance of 182 miles The road is never more than six miles from a straight line

Place names with words like cester or chester are derived from the Latin castra meaning military camp Street is derived from the Latin strata meaning a paved road

Fosse Way still exists In places it is a major road in others a country path The A46 between Lincoln and Leicester is on the Fosse Way From Bath to Ilchester the A37 follows the Fosse and from Ilchester to Exeter the A30A303 roads follow the Fosse for the most part

The Roman road is quite simply the shortest route possible

Geometric abstraction is a form of abstract art based on the use of geometric forms in non representational compositions This art is not meant to depict our everyday visual world but instead uses the shapes of basic geometry

Wassily Kandinsky one of the forerunners of pure non objective painting was among the first modern artists to explore this geometric approach in his abstract work Other examples of pioneer abstractionists such as Kazimir Malevich and Piet Mondrian have also embraced this approach towards abstract painting

Geometric abstraction is not just an invention of 20th century avant garde artists or movements It is present in many cultures throughout history both as decorative motifs and as art pieces themselves 

Islamic art in its prohibition of depicting religious figures is a prime example of this geometric pattern based art It existed centuries before the modern movement in Europe and in many ways influenced this Western school Geometric patterns were often used in the architecture of Islamic civilisations from the 7th century 20th century to visually connect spirituality with science and art 

Abstract art has also historically been likened to music in its ability to convey emotional or expressive feelings and ideas without reliance upon or reference to recognizable objective forms already existent in reality Wassily Kandinsky has discussed this connection between music and painting as well as how the practice of classical composition had influenced his work at length in his seminal essay Concerning the Spiritual in Art

Expressionist abstract painting as practiced by artists such as Jackson Pollock is the opposite of geometric abstraction 

Artists who have worked extensively in geometric abstraction include Josef Albers Theo van Doesburg Wassily Kandinsky Kazimir Malevich Piet Mondrian Barnett Newman Kenneth Noland Bridget Riley Alexander Rodchenko Sophie Taeuber Arp among others

Josef Albers was a German born American artist and educator His work in Europe and the United States was highly influential and far reaching art education programs of the 20th century

Albers was born in Bottrop Westphalia He studied art in Berlin Essen and Munich before enrolling as a student at the prestigious Weimar Bauhaus in 1920 He began teaching in the preliminary course of the Department of Design in 1922 and was promoted to Professor in 1925 the year the Bauhaus moved to Dessau His work at this time included designing furniture and working with glass 

With the closure of the Bauhaus under Nazi pressure in 1933 Albers emigrated to the United States In 1950 Albers was appointed head of the Department of Design at Yale University In 1963 he published Interaction of Color which presented his theory that colors were governed by an internal and deceptive logic A key idea which he proved by examples was that our perception of color is not constant It is influenced by the juxtaposition of one color with another This interested artists interested in optical illusions

Albers is best remembered for his work as an abstract painter and theorist Most famous of all are the hundreds of paintings and prints that make up the series Homage to the Square In this rigorous series begun in 1949 Albers explored chromatic interactions with flat colored squares arranged inside each other This was a union of geometric abstraction with experiments in color

The TERGV is a model to run trains in Nord Pas de Calais The idea is to run regional trains on lines constructed for express trains instead of the classic lines This works only in the case that the high speed line is used only rarely Running regional trains on such lines slows down the express trains and costs more than running them on the classic lines Despite these problems the concept is very promising for distances between 100 and 200 km 

There are currently two lines that operate in this manner

To use these connections an extra fee must be paid which is three euros per day Another line Lille to Arras has been opened This line does not require the extra fee and has proved very successful

Conceptual art is art in which the concepts or ideas involved in the work are more important than traditional aesthetic and material concerns Many of the works sometimes called installations may be constructed by anyone simply by following a set of written instructions This method was fundamental to one of the first to appear in print

Conceptual art even questions the nature of art Joseph Kosuth elevated this into a definition of art itself in his early manifesto of conceptual art 

The notion that art should examine its own nature was already part of art critic Clement Greenbergs vision of modern art during the 1950s With the emergence of an exclusively language based art in the 1960s however conceptual artists began a far more radical analysis of art than was previously done One of the first things they questioned was the assumption that the role of the artist was to create special kinds of material objects

Conceptual art has came to mean all contemporary art which does not use the traditional skills of painting and sculpture

Center of mass or barycenter of a system is the average position of all the mass in a system

In a rigid body the centre of mass is always in the same place In a loose collection the center of mass may be in space as it is in the Solar System Also as planets orbits change slightly so will the position of the barycenter

A simple way to understand the concept of barycenter is to push a supermarket trolley If you hold only one corner and push it will only go in a straight line when you push through the centre of mass Otherwise a turning force is created This shows that the mass acts as if it were only in one place

The center of gravity is a closely related term It is the point where an object can be balanced perfectly by a sharp point holding it up under the object It is the center of mass acting in a gravitational field

The concept of center of mass was first introduced by the ancient Greek physicist mathematician and engineer Archimedes of Syracuse Archimedes showed that the torque exerted on a lever by weights resting at various points along the lever is the same as what it would be if all of the weights were moved to a single point their center of mass 

Archimedes was the first person to work out ways of finding the center of mass in various objects 

The center of mass is often called the center of gravity because any uniform gravitational field g acts on a system as if the mass M of the system were concentrated at the center of mass R

Implication may be one of these

Marcel Duchamp was a French artist whose work is most often associated with the Dadaist and Surrealist movements Duchamps output influenced the development of post World War I Western art He advised modern art collectors such as Peggy Guggenheim and other prominent figures thereby helping to shape the tastes of Western art during this period

A playful man Duchamp challenged conventional thought about artistic processes and art marketing not so much by writing but through subversive actions such as dubbing a urinal art and naming it Fountain This approach would 50 years later be called conceptual art though he himself used the term ready mades for this idea He produced relatively few artworks while moving quickly through the avant garde circles of his time

The creative act is not performed by the artist alone the spectator brings the work in contact with the external world by deciphering and interpreting its inner qualifications and thus adds his contribution to the creative act

Upon his return to Paris in 1923 Duchamp was in essence no longer a practicing artist Instead he played chess which he studied for the rest of his life to the exclusion of most other activities

Duchamp can be seen very briefly playing chess with Man Ray in the short film Entracte by Ren Clair During this period his fascination with chess so distressed his first wife that she glued his pieces to the board Duchamp continued to play in the French Championships and also in the Chess Olympiads from 19281933 favoring hypermodern openings such as the Nimzo Indian

The Battle of Marathon took place in 490 BC during the first Persian invasion of Greece It was fought between the citizens of Athens aided by Plataea and a Persian force 

The battle was the result of the first attempt by Persia under King Darius I to subjugate Greece The first Persian invasion was a response to Greek involvement in the Ionian Revolt 

Then Athens and Eretria had sent a force to support the cities of Ionia in their attempt to overthrow Persian rule The Athenians and Eretrians had succeeded in capturing and burning Sardis but were then forced to retreat with heavy losses In response to this raid Darius swore to have revenge on Athens and Eretria

Once the Ionian revolt was finally crushed by the Persian victory at the Battle of Lade Darius began to plan to subjugate Greece In 490 BC he sent a naval task force under Datis and Artaphernes across the Aegean to subjugate the Cyclades and then to make punitive attacks on Athens and Eretria Reaching Euboea in mid summer after a successful campaign in the Aegean the Persians proceeded to besiege and capture Eretria The Persian force then sailed for Attica landing in the bay near the town of Marathon 

The Athenians joined by a small force from Plataea marched to Marathon and succeeded in blocking the two exits from the plain of Marathon Stalemate ensued for five days before the Athenians decided to attack the Persians Despite the numerical advantage of the Persians the hoplites proved devastatingly effective against the more lightly armed Persian infantry routing the wings before turning in on the centre of the Persian line

The defeat at Marathon marked the end of the first Persian invasion of Greece and the Persian force retreated to Asia Darius then began raising a huge new army with which he meant to completely subjugate Greece however in 486 BC his Egyptian subjects revolted indefinitely postponing any Greek expedition After Darius died his son Xerxes I re started the preparations for a second invasion of Greece which finally began in 480 BC

The Battle of Marathon was a watershed in the Greco Persian wars showing the Greeks that the Persians could be beaten the eventual Greek triumph in these wars can be seen to begin at Marathon Since the following two hundred years saw the rise of the Classical Greek civilization which has been enduringly influential in western society the Battle of Marathon is often seen as a pivotal moment in European history

For instance John Stuart Mill famously suggested that the Battle of Marathon even as an event in British history is more important than the Battle of Hastings The Battle of Marathon is perhaps now more famous as the inspiration for the Marathon race Although historically inaccurate the legend of a Greek messenger running to Athens with news of the victory became the inspiration for this athletic event introduced at the 1896 Athens Olympics and originally run between Marathon and Athens

When the Athenian line was ready according to one source the simple signal to advance was given by Miltiades At themp191 Most likely they marched until they reached the limit of the archers effectiveness the beaten zone and then broke into a run towards their enemyp66 Herodotus suggests that this was the first time a Greek army ran into battle in this way this was probably because it was the first time that a Greek army had faced an enemy composed primarily of missile troops 

All this was evidently much to the surprise of the Persians Passing through the hail of arrows launched by the Persian army protected for the most part by their armour the Greek line finally collided with the enemy army Holland provides an evocative description The enemy directly in their pathrealised to their horror that the Athenians far from providing the easy pickings for their bowmen as they had first imagined were not going to be haltedThe impact was devastating The Athenians had honed their style of fighting in combat with other phalanxes wooden shields smashing against wooden shields iron spear tips clattering against breastplates of bronzein those first terrible seconds of collision there was nothing but a pulverizing crash of metal into flesh and bone then the rolling of the Athenian tide over men wearing at most quilted jerkins for protection and armed perhaps with nothing more than bows or slings The hoplites ash spears rather than shiveringcould instead stab and stab again and those of the enemy who avoided their fearful jabbing might easily be crushed to death beneath the sheer weight of the advancing men of bronze

The Athenian wings quickly routed the inferior Persian levies on the flanks before turning inwards to surround the Persian centre which had been more successful against the thin Greek centre The battle ended when the Persian centre then broke in panic towards their ships pursued by the Greeks Some unaware of the local terrain ran towards the swamps where unknown numbers drownedp71 The Athenians pursued the Persians back to their ships and managed to capture seven though most were able to launch 

Herodotus records that 6400 Persian bodies were counted on the battlefield and it is unknown how many more perished in the swamps The Athenians lost 192 men and the Plataeans 11

Weaning means changing the diet of a baby mammal little by little from its mothers milk to the food it will eat as an adult Since only mammals make milk weaning is only a necessary process for mammals When a baby does not drink any more breast milk the baby has been weaned

Human babies should start eating small amounts of solid food along with breast milk or formula when they are about six months old Before this time a childs digestive system and kidneys are still forming so the child is not ready for solid food

Babies do not have teeth and cannot chew their food so they are usually fed soft runny food such as cooked mashed fruit or vegetables Babies cannot digest some foods which adults can eat including food with nuts or with large amounts of gluten salt or sugar Also babies digestive systems are very sensitive to bacteria so they should not eat any foods with honey eggs or shellfish in them because these foods sometimes contain bacteria

Weaning conflict happens when the mother wants to wean her baby but the baby wants to keep breastfeeding The mother tries to force the baby to stop breastfeeding and the baby tries to force the mother to continue Evolutionary scientists think mammal mothers need to wean their babies as soon as possible so they will have a greater chance of having more babies and spreading their genes But mammal babies want to breastfeed as long as they can so they will have a chance to grow strong and also to enjoy the full care of their mothers Weaning conflict happens in several mammal species including primates and canines

Nanoelectromechanical systems will be very tiny machines with dimensions thousands of times thinner than the human hair that could be used as motors or sensors The technology is very new and still in the laboratory stage but may replace microelectromechanical systems

Compared to human scale things work very differently at nano dimensions For example attractive forces between materials of the same type may push together moving parts and block a motor

A photocathode is a negatively charged electrode in a light detection device They are the main type of photomultiplier That means they take a little light and make more of it

There are instruments which need to magnify the amount of light coming in Examples are astronomical telescopes and military night sight equipment binoculars and telescopes on helmets and rifles etc

The lens of the telescope or binocular passes the light onto a layer of glass coated with a special light sensitive metal When this is struck by light the absorbed energy causes electrons to jump off This is called the photoelectric effect The freed electrons are then collected to produce the final image

These devices are mostly based on alkali metals

Xanthan gum is a polysaccharide It is added to certain foods such as salad dressings to make them thicker It is also added to cosmetics to keep the ingredients from separating To make xanthan gum workers deliberately add a kind of bacterium Xanthomonas campestris to glucose or sucrose They let the mixture ferment for a while and then add isopropyl alcohol to separate the polysaccharide from the mixture They dry the polysaccharide grind it into a powder then add it to a liquid The xanthan gum is then ready to use

Allene Rosalind Jeanes and her research team at the United States Department of Agriculture first discovered xanthan gum The team was studying many biopolymers to see whether some of them were useful and how they could be used The Kelco Company was the first company to produce xanthan gum in the early 1960s At that time Kelco called xanthan gum by its brand name Kelzan Later in 1968 xanthan gum was tested and declared safe to be used in food The USA Canada Europe and many other regions and countries now accept xanthan gum as a safe food additive

Xanthan gum is a very effective thickener It is stable under a wide range of temperatures and pH Only 05 of xanthan gum is added to most foods to thicken them The thickening property of xanthan gum decreases when a food is mixed shaken or chewed but it thickens up again when the force is removed This property is called pseudoplasticity Sometimes this property can be very useful For instance the xanthan gum added to salad dressing makes the dressing thick enough to cling to a salad but shaking the bottle of dressing makes it temporarily thin and easier to pour

Salad dressings and sauces contain xanthan gum Even though xanthan gum is not an emulsifier it helps to keep an emulsion stable so that the oil in it does not separate Xanthan gum also helps to keep spices and other solid bits of food evenly distributed in a liquid Xanthan gum guar gum and locust bean gum help to give ice cream and other frozen foods a creamy texture Gluten free bakers use xanthan gum instead of gluten to make bread dough or batter sticky Packaged egg whites or egg substitutes contain xanthan gum to replace the fat and emulsifiers found in egg yolks

Toothpaste often contains xanthan gum to give the toothpaste a smooth texture People who have trouble swallowing add xanthan gum to drinks and other liquids to make them thicker and easier to swallow

Oil drillers use a lot of xanthan gum to make drilling mud thicker This thick fluid helps carry solids cut by the drill bit up to the surface of the earth When people need to pour concrete underwater they add xanthan gum to the concrete to make it thicker and keep it from washing away

Many cosmetics contain xanthan gum which helps hold together oil and water emulsions Xanthan gum can also help keep skin moist Fake blood toy slime and gunge all get their thickness from xanthan gum

Workers who were exposed to xanthan gum dust developed allergy like symptoms from breathing in the dust

Coeliac disease sufferers and other people who are sensitive to gluten and other allergens may need to be careful how much xanthan gum is in their food Some types of xanthan gum are made with wheat corn or soy and could cause allergic reactions Xanthan gum is also a strong laxative and can cause diarrhoea in people who eat too much of it or who are sensitive to it

The pickerel frog is a small frog in North America It has dark squares on its back The squares are in lines instead of randomly scattered Leopard frogs have circular spots They have an orange or yellow coloration on the inside of their back legs They are mainly found in the eastern United States with a little in southern Canada They have toxic glands in their skin that can kill other frogs

The Northern green frog is a subspecies of the green frog It is moderately large It is found in the northeast United States and some of eastern Canada Its call sounds like a plucked banjo It has a fold running from the top of its eyes down the side of its back The bullfrog does not have these folds It is normally found in swamps marshes and muddy streams

The Egyptians believe that once a body is mummified and set the corpses spirit may find the body so it may begin its journey to the afterlife First the Egyptians shoved a hook up the persons nose jiggled it around a little bit then let the brain drain out the persons nose They then cut a small slit in the stomach to reach up and get the lungs liver intestines and stomach out and placed them in the correct Canopic Jars When they finished mummifying those they coated the whole body with natron They let it sit for 40 days then put herbs and scents on the body for each had a special power

As the embalmers wrapped the mummy in fine linen they placed amulets in between the layers of cloth for good luck and such When the body was finished a death mask was placed on it and it was set in a series of containers finishing with a stone coffin

Many of the pharaohs things were placed with him as well as some guards wives and pets

Wikitext is a special type of code that can only work on wikis Some codes of Wikitext is similar to HTML Below is a table on the differences between Wikitext and HTML and what results they produce

The main purpose of having Wikitext in wikis instead of HTML is because HTML is more complicated and not many people know how to use it Therefore it is easier to use Wikitext rather than HTML and thus makes editors contributing to a wiki easier to create content

Environmentally friendly are terms that refer to objects that people buy services laws and rules that either do not harm the environment or do very little harm to it To make people who buy the goods or services know that they are environmentally friendly environmentally friendly goods and services often are marked with eco labels But because there is no single type of eco label the International Organization for Standardization thinks that these labels do not mean much because they could mean different things

Environmentally friendly is a term used to refer to goods and services laws guidelines and policies claimed to inflict minimal or no harm on the environment Companies sometimes use these terms to promote goods and services by making environmental marketing claims and with eco labels Also ecofriendly by 1993 from eco  friendly 

An intranet is a private network website that only a few selected computers can have access to Usually they are being used as internal company websites for employees to know more about what is happening in the company without letting other people see

An intranet works the same way as a normal website The system administrator can add webpages to it and it can be accessed normally from a web browser

Bold can mean the following

An act of being bold means a person becomes brave and have no fear of anything It means having the courage of doing something that a normal person would be afraid of doing

In Wikipedia there is a campaign of being bold to edit pages This encourages first time editors to start editing without worrying about being spoke badly about the edit

When making a text italic this means that the editor wishes the text to tilt towards the right a little Using italic is usually used as a place holder for a blank piece of information

There are different ways in making a text italic

In HTML the editor can add the and the tags to make text surrounded by these tags italic

In Wikitext the editor can just add two apostrophes around the text to become italic

In formatting bold makes a text become darker and a little bigger It is used to emphasize a few words as a bolded text can attract attention from the reader

To make a word bold there are different ways in doing so They are listed below

In HTML the and the tags are used to surround the text that needs to be bolded

In Wikitext an editor can bold a text using three apostrophes around the text to be bolded to produce the same results

To make a text underlined means to add a straight line below the text It is commonly used to emphasize the text However it is usually not used

Both HTML and Wikitext uses the same way in making underlined text They both use the and the tags to produce an underlined text

Iodic acid is a chemical compound It is also an acid Its chemical formula is HIO3 It contains hydrogen and iodate ions The iodine is in its 5 oxidation state

Iodic acid is a white solid that can dissolve in water to make an acidic solution Chloric acid and bromic acid only exist in solution and break down when crystallized Iodic acid is a strong oxidizing agent It can be converted to iodine pentoxide when it is heated gently If it is heated strongly it decomposes into iodine oxygen and other iodine oxides 

It can form several things when it is reduced If there is a lot of reducing agent it is reduced to iodide If there is a lot of iodic acid it is reduced to iodine If there is a lot of chloride then it is reduced to iodine trichloride a yellow liquid

It can be made by electrolysis of an acidic iodide solution 

Iodic acid is used to make other iodates by reacting bases with iodic acid It is also used as a strong acid

The Japanese Occupation of Singapore is a time from 1942 1945 where the Japanese occupied Singapore The occupation started after the army of Japan defeated the garrison of Australian British Malaya Britain and India This was at the Battle of Singapore It was officially returned to the British after the peace treaty ending World War II was signed 

The Japanese did not treat the people very well during their occupation They tried to kill all anti Japanese people There was a large amount of inflation because the Japanese printed paper money for Singapore to use

In 1941 due to the weak defenses of the country the Japanese attacked Singapore They took control of the colony on 15 February 1942 and renamed it Syonan to meaning Light of the South during the rule Many people suffered during this time till the British got back Singapore in September 1945

A ligand is a biochemical substance Its function is to bind to a biological molecule and make the molecule perform a function Ligand binding alters the shape of the receptor protein This changes the proteins behaviour 

In a narrower sense it is a signal triggering molecule binding to a site on a target protein

The binding occurs by intermolecular forces such as ionic bonds hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces The docking is usually reversible 

Ligands include substrates inhibitors activators and neurotransmitters The tendency or strength of binding is called affinity

Polyxena of Hesse Rheinfels Rotenburg was the second wife of Charles Emmanuel Prince of Piedmont future Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia

Polyxena was born at Langenschwalbach in Hesse and was baptised with the names Polyxena Christina Johanna King Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia approached her family and proposed a union between Polyxena and Victor Amadeus IIs son and heir Charles Emmanuel Prince of Piedmont A previous match orchestrated by Agostino Steffani with a daughter of Rinaldo dEste Duke of Modena had come to nothing His first wife Anne Christine of Sulzbach died March 1723 having given birth to a son

The engagement was announced on 2 July 1724 The marriage was celebrated in person at Thonon in Chablais on 20 August 1724 The happy marriage produced six children

In mathematics the dot product is an algebraic operation that takes two equal length sequences of numbers and returns a single number obtained by multiplying corresponding entries and adding up those products The name is derived from the centered dot that is often used to designate this operation the alternative name scalar product emphasizes the scalar nature of the result

The dot product contrasts with the cross product which produces a vector as result

FileDot Productsvgthumb300pxrightA B A B cos A cos is the scalar projection of A onto B

where a and b denote the length of a and b and is the angle between them

As the cosine of 90 is zero the dot product of two orthogonal vectors is always zero Moreover two vectors can be considered orthogonal if and only if their dot product is zero and they both have a nonzero length This property provides a simple method to test the condition of orthogonality

Sometimes these properties are also used for defining the dot product especially in 2 and 3 dimensions this definition is equivalent to the above one For higher dimensions the formula can be used to define the concept of angle

The geometric properties rely on the basis being orthonormal ie composed of pairwise perpendicular vectors with unit length

If both a and b have length one their dot product simply gives the cosine of the angle between them

If only b is a unit vector then the dot product a b gives a cos ie the magnitude of the projection of a in the direction of b with a minus sign if the direction is opposite This is called the scalar projection of a onto b or scalar component of a in the direction of b This property of the dot product has several useful applications

If neither a nor b is a unit vector then the magnitude of the projection of a in the direction of b for example would be a as the unit vector in the direction of b is b b

A rotation of the orthonormal basis in terms of which vector a is represented is obtained with a multiplication of a by a rotation matrix R This matrix multiplication is just a compact representation of a sequence of dot products

For instance let

Notice that the rotation matrix R is assembled by using the rotated basis vectors u1 v1 w1 as its rows and these vectors are unit vectors By definition Ra1 consists of a sequence of dot products between each of the three rows of R and vector a1 Each of these dot products determines a scalar component of a in the direction of a rotated basis vector

In physics magnitude is a scalar in the physical sense ie a physical quantity independent of the coordinate system expressed as the product of a numerical value and a physical unit not just a number The dot product is also a scalar in this sense given by the formula independent of the coordinate system Example

The following properties hold if a b and c are real vectors and r is a scalar

Two non zero vectors a and b are perpendicular if and only if a b 0

Unlike multiplication of ordinary numbers where if ab ac then b always equals c unless a is zero the dot product does not obey the cancellation law

Provided that the basis is orthonormal the dot product is invariant under isometric changes of the basis rotations reflections and combinations keeping the origin fixed The above mentioned geometric interpretation relies on this property In other words for an orthonormal space with any number of dimensions the dot product is invariant under a coordinate transformation based on an orthogonal matrix This corresponds to the following two conditions

If a and b are functions then the derivative of a b is a b a b

which is easier to remember as BAC minus CAB keeping in mind which vectors are dotted together This formula is commonly used to simplify vector calculations in physics

The Sarcocystis is a genus of protozoa a kind of disease Species in this genus can infect reptiles birds and mammals and sometimes pigs as well The name came from the Greek language sarx which meant flesh and kystis which meant bladder The organism was first found in a mouse by Miescher in 1843

The EZLN in Spanish Ejrcito Zapatista de la Liberacin Nacional or Zapatista Army of National Liberation is a human rights organization led by the indigenous people of the Chiapas Mountains in the southeast of Mexico The name Zapatista refers to Emiliano Zapata who was a leader of the Mexican Revolution of 1910

Though the movement has many leaders both women and men Marcos has become the unofficial spokesperson for the movement This is because he is very well educated a good public speaker and has written letters to and worked with writers and intellectuals from all over the world He signs almost all of his letters with Subcomandante Marcos from the mountains of the southeast of Mexico He is wearing a ski mask in every picture and video of him and ski masks have become a symbol of the EZLN in Mexico as the majority of its supporters also wear them Followers of the EZLN also paint murals of Marcos in his mask and Emiliano Zapata to show their support

The Western Grey Kangaroo is a large and very common kangaroo or macropod It lives right across the southern part of Australia They live from just south of Shark Bay in Western Australia to western Victoria In South Australia they live along the coast They also live in the Murray Darling Basin in New South Wales and Queensland The subspecies on Kangaroo Island South Australia is called the Kangaroo Island Kangaroo

The Western Grey Kangaroo is one of the largest kangaroos It weighs 2854 kg and its length is 084 11m with a 80100 cm tail and is about 13m tall It exhibits sexual dimorphism with the male up to twice the size of female It has thick coarse fur with colour ranging from pale grey to brown It has a paler color on its throat chest and belly It feeds at night mainly on grasses but also on leafy shrubs and low trees It has a nickname Stinker because mature males have a curry like odour

The kangaroo lives in groups of up to 15 The males compete for females during the breeding season During these boxing contests they would lock arms and try to push each other over Usually only the strongest male in the group mates The gestation period is 3031 days After the birth the tiny baby Joey attaches to the teat in the females pouch for nine months After it comes out of the pouch it will continue to drink milk from the mothers pouch for about another nine months

Long known to the Aboriginal people of Australia for Europeans the Western Grey was the centre of a great deal of sometimes comical taxonomic confusion for almost 200 years It was first noted by European settlers when the great explorer Matthew Flinders landed on Kangaroo Island in 1802 Flinders shot several for food but assumed that they were Eastern Grey Kangaroos In 1803 French explorers captured several Kangaroo Island Western Greys and shipped them home to Paris where they lived in the zoological gardens for some years Eventually researchers at the Paris Museum of Natural History recognised that these animals were indeed different and formally described the species as Macropus fuliginosus in 1817 Unfortunately for reasons that remain unclear it was described as native to Tasmania 

There the matter rested for over 100 years and it was not until 1917 that researchers realised that the Forester Kangaroo of Tasmania was in fact Macropus giganteus the same Eastern Grey Kangaroo that was and still is widespread in the more fertile south eastern part of the mainland By 1971 it was understood that the Kangaroo Island species was the same as the kangaroos of southern Western Australia and that this population extended through much of the eastern part of the continent as well For a time three subspecies were described two on the mainland and one on Kangaroo Island Finally by the early 1990s the current understanding emerged

There are two subspecies of the Western Grey Macropus fuliginosus fuliginosus which lives on Kangaroo Island and Macropus fuliginosus melanops which has a range of different types that change gradually from west to east 

The Western Grey does not live in the tropical north or the fertile south east of Australia The Eastern Grey does not live over the NSW South Australia border but the two species are both common in the Murray Darling Basin area They never interbreed in the wild although hybrids between Eastern Grey females and Western Grey males have been produced in captivity

The Western Grey Kangaroo is also called the Black faced Kangaroo Mallee Kangaroo Sooty Kangaroo and Carno Kangaroo

Traditional animation is much harder than todays style of animation It often uses a stop motion camera to liven or animate the photos made by the producer When movie makers use stop motion they need to draw one picture for every scene However there are tools to help save time with movie making Other types of animation such as limited or digital animation can also be used now FPS is the number of times a film is shot in one second

The photographer first shoots out or edits many photos These photos are combined to make the storyline And as with all movies not all scenes make it into the final movie

Many people help out in the editing of a film But in old times people had to draw the scenes on their own Then the stop motion camera took a photo of a scene once a second 

Most movies or cartoons in the 1950s required very hard work of the editors To make things cheaper though people made limited animation that used two to three copies of the same image

Right now movie makers use digital animation to liven the movie even more Movies from the 2000 to 2010 years are usually 1 2 hours long

FPS or frames per second is the number of scenes being shot in one second The higher this is the more smooth the film looks Most films have an FPS of 24 to 60

Cels or celluloids are tools used to preserve scenes An editor uses a cell to draw a scene then make changes to it on the next drawing It is useful when a cartoon or movie involves moving figures or objects

Sometimes a sketch pad is used to draft the scenes the editors think would be good in the movie A sketchpad at first may contain a comic book that looks like an animation when the editors flip it back and forth

Often editors preview the animation with a video shower On the stream of scenes movie makers test their animation and fix bugs or problems

Dennis Brain was a British horn player During his short life he became world famous Many people thought of him as the greatest horn player ever He made the horn very popular among classical music lovers in Britain His recordings include the four horn concertos by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart which he recorded with the Philharmonia Orchestra conducted by Herbert von Karajan

Dennis Brain was born in London on 17 May 1921  Several of his family were horn players including his father Aubrey his grandfather Alfred Edwin Brain Sr and his uncle Alfred Edwin Brain Jr  His mother Marion was a singer who had sung at Covent Garden He had a brother Leonard who was 6 years older and who was to become an excellent oboe player

Dennis started to learn the piano He also played bugle in the school cadet band at Richmond Hill Preparatory School From there he was sent to St Pauls School in Kensington where he sang in the choir and played piano solos at concerts In 1936 he left school and got a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music where he learned the horn with his father as well as the piano and from 1938 the organ He learned a lot from his organ teacher GDCunningham who had taught his uncle Alfred the piano some 40 years before

Denniss first professional concert was at the Queens Hall in 1938 when he played Bachs Brandenburg Concerto no 1 together with his father Soon he was playing in other concerts and making gramophone recordings

The outbreak of World War II in 1939 interrupted his last year of studies All theatre halls and concert halls were closed He managed to get a job as principal horn with the RAF Central Band which were in Uxbridge in north west London Dennis was always a very friendly person who got on well with everybody The older players in the band might not have liked a 17 year old boy to have a principals job but everybody realized he had exceptional skills He played in concerts whenever possible There were lunch hour concerts in the National Gallery during the war and he often played in these He started to become famous He met Benjamin Britten and he persuaded him to compose his Serenade for Tenor Horn and Strings He performed it in 1943 with the tenor Peter Pears and they recorded it for Decca in 1944 He toured the USA with the RAF Orchestra Several conductors heard him and wanted Brain to join their orchestra

By 1945 Brain was the most famous horn player in England He was still only 24 His father hurt himself in a fall and could not play much Dennis took over some of his work After the war two new orchestras were formed in London the Philharmonia and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra Brain was made principal horn player in both Later he left the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra because he did not have time

Brain played a lot of chamber music forming a wind quintet with his brother in 1946 This group got bigger and toured to Germany Italy and Austria Brain also started a trio with the pianist Wilfrid Parry and violinist Jean Pougnet The trio toured Scotland twice and there were plans to tour Australia in the winter of 1957 

In November 1953 Brain recorded the Mozart Horn Concertos Nos 14 for EMI with the Philharmonia Orchestra with Karajan conducting He kept up his organ playing and in July 1954 again conducted by Karajan Brain performed the organ part in a recording of the Easter hymn from Pietro Mascagnis Cavalleria rusticana 

In 1955 Brain became known to millions of people when he presented a radio program called The Early Horn 

Brain had a good sense of humour Among the many concerts he played in was a music festival in 1956 which celebrated the life of Gerard Hoffung the artist who had drawn many cartoons about music Dennis played a Leopold Mozart horn concerto by blowing through rubber hose pipes He cut the hose to the length he needed with garden shears so that it was perfectly in tune 

Brain was known for being careless The horn he played for many years had lots of dents in it because he kept knocking it or dropping it Benjamin Britten gave him a second copy of music for a new work he had written Inside he wrote For Dennis  in case he loses the other one His Alexander horn was badly damaged in his fatal crash Normally it would have been thrown away but it was saved and was restored by Paxmans of London and can be seen in the Royal Academy of Musics free museum

Brain often asked composers to write new works for him to perform Many composers wrote for him without even being asked Among them were Benjamin Britten Serenade for Tenor Horn and Strings Canticle III Malcolm Arnold Horn Concerto No 2 Paul Hindemith Concerto for Horn and Orchestra York Bowen Concerto for Horn Strings and Timpani Peter Racine Fricker Horn Sonata Gordon Jacob Concerto for Horn and String Orchestra Mtys Seiber Notturno for Horn and Strings Humphrey Searle Aubade for Horn and Strings Ernest Tomlinson Rhapsody and Rondo for Horn and Orchestra Romance and Rondo for Horn and Orchestra Lennox Berkeley Trio for Horn Violin and Piano and Elisabeth Lutyens

Brain also made the two horn concertos by Richard Strauss very popular He was the second to perform the Horn Concerto No 2 in public in 1948

Apart from horns Dennis had one big passion he loved cars At orchestral rehearsals he often had a car magazine on the music stand instead of his music His first car was an open Morris 8 with two seats He shared it during the war with his brother to motor from Uxbridge into London Later he had several cars Whenever a car did not work he bought another instead of repairing it He loved to drive and would often drive all the way home after a concert even it was 100s of miles  Elisabeth Schwarzkopf let him drive her huge Hudson saloon car over the Gotthard Pass in Switzerland when it was officially closed because of heavy snow On another occasion Herbert von Karajan let him drive his Mercedes 300SL Once he bought a very rare 1939 12 cylinder Lagonda but he soon crashed it and it could not be repaired Other cars included a Citroen and a green TR2 sports car

On 31 August 1957 Dennis was at the Edinburgh Festival playing a concert in the Usher Hall The Philharmonia Orchestra were playing Tchaikovsky Symphony No 6 Pathetique with the conductor Eugene Ormandy Unusually that day he seemed tired and Ormandy told him he should get more rest But Dennis had a recording session the next morning in London so after the concert he got into his car put his horn on the back seat and set off on the 380 mile journey back home

It was about 600am the next morning when he was near London It was raining heavily and he was on the A1 at the Barnet by pass According to witnesses he was travelling very fast when he came to a bend the car left the road turned over and crashed into a tree The car was a complete wreck Dennis was dead He was 36 years old He was buried at Hampstead Cemetery in London

Whenever Dennis played his horn is sounded easy and effortless It had an extraordinary lyrical beauty and was always incredibly musical He was a very sensitive player who listened very carefully to the other players and blended in with them At first he played a French instrument a Raoux piston valve horn similar to that used by his father This type of instrument has a lovely smooth tone but was less powerful than the German made instruments which had become popular since the 1920s In 1951 he changed to single Bmusicflat instrument made by Alexander which was not quite as wide as the usual German instruments still keeping the lighter sound of French horns

Dennis had made the horn very popular as an instrument not just through his concerts and recordings but also through the radio He played difficult music that other horn players could not play His Mozart recordings inspired Flanders and Swanns Ill Wind and his classical playing His sudden death added to the musical legend 

Aubrey Brain was a British French horn player There were a lot of French horn players in his family His father Alfred Edwin Brain senior played in Henry Woods orchestra at the very first prom in 1895 Later he played for the London Symphony Orchestra  His brother also called Alfred Edwin Brain was principal horn player in Henry Woods Queens Hall Orchetra but then he emigrated to the USA where he eventually played for the Los Angeles Philharmonic His son Dennis Brain was to become the most famous French horn player of all

Aubrey Brain was born in London in 1893 He started to learn the horn from his father In 1911 he won a scholarship to the Royal College of Music He soon became one of Britains best horn players The other great players of the French horn were his father his elder brother and Adolf Borsdorf He became principal horn player of the Beecham Opera Company There he met Marion Beeley a mezzo soprano They married in the summer of 1914 just before the World War I When war broke out he joined the Welsh Guards and played horn in the band After the war it was difficult for him at first to find a really good job as horn player  The best horn jobs were already taken by his brother Alfred Aubrey and Marion had two sons Leonard and Dennis However in 1922 Alfred emigrated to the United States Aubrey soon became first horn of the Royal Philharmonic Society and first horn of the Queens Hall Orchestra He was also first horn in the New Symphony and soon he joined the orchestra of Covent Garden as principal horn In 1923 he joined the London Symphony Orchestra

In 1923 Borsdorf retired as professor of horn at the Royal Academy of Music and Aubrey took his place One of his first pupils was his younger brother Arthur Although very talented Arthur decided not to take up horn playing professionally and joined the police Later Aubreys son Dennis was one of his students

Aubrey had a very successful career not only as principal horn player in several orchestras but also as a soloist He played Mozarts Second Horn Concerto in 1923 at The Proms His playing can be heard on several of the very early recordings when the LSO recorded for HMV Several works were written for him including the Concerto for French horn Violin and orchestra by Dame Ethel Smythe He played it very well including the chords in the last movement He played it at the Proms The conductor Bruno Walter invited him to play it in Berlin This made Aubrey the first British horn player to play a solo concerto abroad

When the BBC Symphony Orchestra was started in 1930 Aubrey was their principal horn player He was still principal horn player with the other big London orchestras but gradually his gave up these positions as the BBC Symphony Orchestra got more and more work and needed their players to be full time

Aubrey played a French type horn which had a narrow bore The German type horn had a wider bode and made a slightly different sound Playing on a Raoux horn there was more risk of a note cracking The German type horn was becoming very popular in England but Aubrey insisted that all the horn players in the BBC Symphony Orchestra continued to play on Raoux horns  Aubrey was a very skilled musician in chamber music and made a recording with the violinist Adolf Busch and the pianist Rudolf Serkin of the Brahms Horn Trio It sold many copies and continued to sell for many years until the 78rpm records were replaced by long playing records

Later life and retirement 

During the war Aubrey started to have health problems He had a bad fall on Christmas Day 1940 Towards the end of the war he started to get blurred vision his speech became slurred and he had strange feelings in his fingers and toes He retired in 1945 after the first rehearsal for the Prom season He still performed occasionally usually together with his son Dennis He died on 20 September 1955 three days after a bad fall which gave him a heart attack

Aubrey Brain may be remembered less today because of the exceptional fame of his son Dennis However he was a very great horn player who helped to improve the standard of horn playing in Britain both by his teaching and by the example of his performances The recordings on which he can be heard were all made before the days of the LP His older son Leonard became a well known oboist

The vertebrate brain is the main part of the central nervous system In vertebrates the brain is at the front in the head It is protected by the skull and close to the main senses of vision hearing balance taste and smell As an animal moves forward its senses collect data about the surroundings and that data goes directly to the brain

Brains are extremely complex The brain controls the other organs of the body either by activating muscles or by causing secretion of chemicals such as hormones and neurotransmitters Muscular action allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the environment hormones and the autonomic nervous system make slower changes in the body 

In vertebrates the spinal cord by itself can cause reflex responses as well as simple movement such as swimming or walking However sophisticated control of behaviour requires a centralized brain

The structure of all vertebrate brains is basically the same At the same time during the course of evolution the vertebrate brain has undergone changes and become more effective In so called lower animals most or all of the brain structure is inherited and therefore their behaviour is mostly instinctive In mammals and especially in man the brain is developed further during life by learning This has the benefit of helping them fit better into their environment The capacity to learn is seen best in the cerebral cortex

It is connected in several ways with the endocrine system which makes hormones and the digestive system and sex system Hormones work slowly so those changes are gradual

The brain too does much of its work without a person noticing it The unconscious mind refers to the brain activities which are seldom noticed

Several brain areas have kept their identities across the whole range of vertebrates from hagfishes to humans Here is a list of some of the most important areas with a brief description of their functions as currently understood These functions may still be disputed to some degree

There are action systems for several types of behaviour including eating drinking defecation and copulation

The relationship between brain size body size and other variables has been studied in a wide range of vertebrate species Brain size increases with body size but not proportionally 

Averaging across all mammals it follows a power law with an exponent of about 075 This formula applies to the average brain of mammals but each family departs from it reflecting their sophistication of behavior For example primates have brains 5 to 10 times as large as the formula predicts Predators tend to have larger brains When the mammalian brain increases in size not all parts increase at the same rate The larger the brain of a species the greater the fraction taken up by the neocortex

The cerebral cortex is a most important part of the brain In humans it is by far the largest part of the brain

Though this cannot be seen directly different parts of the cortex have different functions It plays a key role in memory attention perceptual awareness thought language and consciousness 

It is a sheet of neural tissue that is outermost to the cerebrum of the mammalian brain It has up to six layers of nerve cells The human cerebral cortex is 24 mm thick

In preserved brains it has a grey colour hence the name grey matter In contrast to gray matter that is formed from neurons and their unmyelinated fibers the white matter below them is formed predominantly by myelinated axons interconnecting neurons in different regions of the cerebral cortex with each other and neurons in other parts of the central nervous system

The surface of the cerebral cortex is folded in large mammals such that more than two thirds of it in the human brain is buried in the grooves

The phylogenetically most recent part of the cerebral cortex the neocortex has six horizontal layers the more ancient part of the cerebral cortex the hippocampus has at most three cellular layers Neurons in various layers connect vertically to form small microcircuits called columns

The neocortex is the newest part of the cerebral cortex to evolve the other parts of the cerebral cortex are the old cortex mostly the hippocampus The cellular organization of the old cortex is different from the six layer structure mentioned above In humans 90 of the cerebral cortex is neocortex

The six layer neocortex is a distinguishing feature of mammals it has been found in the brains of all mammals but not in any other animals

A Roman consul was the highest elected political office of the Roman Republic

Each year two consuls were elected together to serve for a one year term Each consul was given veto power over his colleague and the officials would alternate each month

The consuls were usually patricians though after 367 BC plebs could stand for election as consul

Consuls had extensive power in peacetime and in wartime often held the highest military command They conducted some religious rites which could only be done by the highest state officials Consuls also read auguries an essential step before leading armies into the field

The consuls could convene the Senate and presided over its meetings Each consul served as president of the Senate for a month They could also summon any of the Roman assemblies and preside over them Thus the consuls conducted the elections and put legislative measures to the vote When neither consul was within the city their civic duties were assumed by the praetor urbanus

Each consul was accompanied in every public appearance by twelve lictors who displayed the magnificence of the office and served as his bodyguards Each lictor held a fasces a bundle of rods that contained an axe The rods symbolized the power of scourging and the axe the power of capital punishment When inside the city the lictors removed the axes from the fasces to show that a citizen could not be executed without a trial Upon entering the democratic assembly the lictors would lower the fasces to show that the powers of the consuls derive from the people

Outside the walls of Rome the powers of the consuls were far greater in their role as commanders in chief of all Roman legions It was in this function that the consuls were vested with full imperium 

When legions were ordered by a decree of the Senate the consuls conducted the conscription Upon entering the army all soldiers had to take their oath of allegiance to the consuls The consuls also oversaw the gathering of troops provided by Romes allies 

Within the city a consul could punish and arrest a citizen but had no power to inflict capital punishment When on campaign however a consul could inflict any punishment he saw fit on any soldier officer citizen or ally

Each consul commanded an army usually two legions strong with the help of military tribunes and a quaestor who had financial duties In the rare case that both consuls marched together each one held the command for a day in turn A typical consular army was about 20000 men strong and consisted of two citizen and two allied legions In the early years of the republic Romes enemies were in central Italy so campaigns lasted a few months 

As Romes frontiers expanded in the 2nd century BC the campaigns became lengthier Rome was a warlike society and very seldom did not wage war So the consul upon entering office was expected by the Senate and the people to march his army against Romes enemies and expand the Roman frontiers His soldiers expected to return to their homes after the campaign with spoils If the consul won an overwhelming victory he was hailed as imperator by his troops and could request to be granted a triumph 

The consul could conduct the campaign as he saw fit and had unlimited powers However after the campaign he could be prosecuted for his misdeeds 

In the Roman Empire the consuls were merely a figurative representative of Romes republican heritage The consulate then held much less power and authority since the emperor was the supreme leader However consuls were often high ranking and important in their own right Some were designated successors of their emperor Also emperors frequently appointed themselves as consuls

The office survived until the early 9th century AD

SimCity DS or SimCity Creator is a simulation video game made in 2007 by Electronic Arts The player can build a city while trying to keep it healthy

The player will be known as the Mayor throughout the game They will have to look at five sheets to run their city

Zones are the places where buildings can develop They are different and the heavier the zone the more buildings grow However land value has a greater effect

Certain facilities are called needs Power and water are considered needs in the game although one is not completely mandatory

Advisers are people you choose to help you build a city

Power lines are poles that conduct electricity through to other facilities Some have step up transformers and step down transformers The voltage of the power at the end is usually 120V but is much higher while going through the lines The power at the end is then safe enough to be used when stepped down by a transformer

The original power is made at a power plant As the power is sent through the power lines sometimes it encounters spots that it cannot go through Then it will need to raise its voltage with a step up transformer The act is called stepping up But when it reaches buildings it is too dangerous to be used so it goes through a step down transformer The act is called stepping down Then the elctricity can be distributed to buildings

The Greco Persian wars were a series of wars fought between Ancient Greece and Persias Achaemenid Empire in the 5th century BC The struggle lasted 50 years from 499449 Fifty years before the war started Cyrus the Great had conquered the Greek colonies on the western coast of Asia Minor an area the Greeks called Ionia The Persians put a tyrant in charge of each city

The Ionian cities revolted under a former tyrant Aristagoras He got support from Athens and Eretria and together they burnt the Persian regional capital city Sardis The Persian king now Darius the Great vowed revenge

Although 449 BC saw the end of the wars started by the Ionian revolt the two civilisations continued for more than a hundred years The wars between Athens and Sparta allowed Persia to take back all she had lost in the Greco Persian wars until finally Alexander the Great put an end to the Achaemenid Empire This is a brief summary of these later conflicts

The Caro Kann defence is a chess opening It is a common defence for Black when White opens by moving his Kings pawn two squares on the first move It begins 

Usually the next moves are

followed by 3Nc3 3Nd2 3exd5 or 3e5 The modern variation is most popular 

The Caro Kann like the Sicilian defence and French defence is an asymmetrical defence to 1e4 These are sometimes called semi open games The Caro is thought to be more solid and less dynamic than the others which means that play is likely to be more quiet and positional It may lead to good endgames for Black who has the better pawn structure

The opening is named after the English player Horatio Caro and the Austrian Marcus Kann who studied the opening in 1886

The most common way of handling the Caro Kann the Classical variation happens after the moves 

For a long time this was thought to be the best play for both sides in the Caro Kann White usually continues

Although Whites pawn on h5 looks ready to attack it can prove to be a weakness in an endgame

This variation is a big reason that people think the Caro Kann is solid defence Black makes very few compromises in his pawn structure and plays c5 in time to fight for the d4 square Black can castle queenside castle kingside or even leave his king in the centre Should the game go to an endgame Black often has good chances because of his solid pawn structure and kingside pawn majority

Another solid positional line is the Modern variation It happens after the moves 

Played by the first world champion Wilhelm Steinitz today the variation is called either the Smyslov variation or most often the Modern variation 

The short term goal of 4Nd7 is to make developing his pieces easier by trading a pair of knights without damaging his pawn structure by the direct 4Nf6 Play is similar to the Classical variation except that Black is not forced to play his QB to the g6 square However this freedom comes at a cost as White is able to take up space in the center White often plays the aggressive 5Ng5 pressuring key points such as the f7 square

This variation can lead to a quick mating trap with 5Qe2 Ngf6 6Nd6

Two variations begin with

The Bronstein Larsen Variation is after

Black has chosen a worse pawn structure and often castles queenside Black does have compensation with of the open g file for the rook and unusually active play for the Caro Kann It is generally considered somewhat double edged

The Korchnoi Variation arises after

Viktor Korchnoi has played 5exf6 many times and this line has also been employed by Ulf Andersson Blacks 5exf6 is thought to be sounder than 5gxf6 of the previous and offers Black fast development though also giving White the superior pawn structure and long term prospects

The 3Bf5 variation that follows with

has become popular after having previously been thought as poor for many years The Advance variation has since been brought back to life by aggressive lines such as the Bayonet Attack a popular line in the 1980s and later favoured by Latvian Grandmaster Alexei Shirov or 4Nf3 e6 5Be2 c5 6Be3 popularised by English Grandmaster Nigel Short and often seen in the 1990s

The 3c5 variation that follows with

is an important alternative and avoids the opening theory with 3Bf5 It was used by Botvinnik in his 1961 match with Tal 

In comparison to the French defense Black lacks the tempo normally spent on e6 However White can only take advantage of this by weakening his own central bind with 4 dxc5 when Black has good chances of regaining the pawn

The Exchange Variation is 1e4 c6 2d4 d5 3exd5 cxd5 The Panov Botvinnik Attack begins with the move 4c4

This system often leads to typical isolated queens pawn positions with White gaining rapid development a grip on e5 and kingside attacking chances to make up for the long term structural weakness of the isolated d4 pawn The major variation in this line 4Nf6 5Nc3 e6 6Nf3 when Blacks main alternatives are 6Bb4 and 6Be7 once the most common line 6Nc6 is inferior as it is favourably met by 7c5 after which White plans on seizing the e5 square through the advance of his b pawn to b5 or by exchanging the Blacks Knight on c6 after Bb5

The true Exchange Variation begins with 4Bd3 Nc6 5c3 Nf6 6Bf4 Bg4 7Qb3 This line is thought to have equal chances for both sides and was tried by Bobby Fischer Some of the strategic ideas are analogous to the Queens Gambit declined Exchange variation with colours reversed

White can play 2c4 Then Black may play 2d5 This can transpose to the Panov Botvinnik or Caro Kann Or Black may play 2e5

Also White can play 2Nc3 Then Black may play 2d5 This can lead to the Steinitz Variation Caro Kann Two Knights 3Bg4 or Caro Kann Or Black may play 2g6

Two Knights Variation 1e4 c6 2Nf3 d5 3Nc3 played by Bobby Fischer in his youth where White gets rapid development and has options with the d pawn Blacks logical and probably best reply is 3Bg4 After 4h3 Bxf3 5Qxf3 the positional continuation Black has the option of 5Nf6 or 5e6 This variation sets a trap if Black plays along the lines of the Classical Variation he gets in trouble after 3dxe4 4Nxe4 Bf5 5Ng3 Bg6 6h4 h6 7Ne5 Bh7 8Qh5 g6 9Bc4 e6 10Qe2 with a huge advantage for White Now 10Qe7 is best Instead Lasker Radsheer 1908 and Alekhine Bruce 1938 ended quickly after respectively 10Bg7 11Nxf7 and 10Nf6 11Nxf7 4Bh5 is a complicated line in which White can trap the bishop though Black has much compensation

The Caro Kann can sometimes be reached through the English Opening 1c4 c6 2e4 d5

The Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings has ten codes for the Caro Kann Defence B10 to B19

The Bronze Age collapse is so called by historians who study the end of the Bronze Age

They see the transition in the Near East and Eastern Mediterranean from the Late Bronze Age to the Early Iron Age as violent sudden and culturally disruptive 

The palace economies of the Aegean and Anatolia of the Late Bronze Age were replaced eventually by the village cultures of the Ancient Dark Age

Between 1200 and 1150 BC the cultural collapse of the Mycenaean kingdoms the Hittite Empire in Anatolia and Syria and the Egyptian Empire in Syria and Canaan interrupted trade routes and extinguished literacy 

In the first phase of this period almost every city between Troy and Gaza was violently destroyed and often left unoccupied examples include Hattusa Mycenae Ugarit

The gradual end of the Dark Age saw the rise of settled Neo Hittite Aramaean kingdoms of the mid 10th century BCE and the rise of the Neo Assyrian Empire

Every important Anatolian site during the preceding Late Bronze Age shows a destruction layer It appears that civilization did not recover to the same level as that of the Hittites for another thousand years Hattusa the Hittite capital was burned and abandoned and never reoccupied Troy was destroyed at least twice before being abandoned until Roman times

The sacking and burning of the sites of Enkomi Kition and Sinda may have happened twice before they were abandoned Originally two waves of destruction ca 1230 BC by the Sea Peoples and ca 1190 BC by Aegean refugees have been proposed 

Syrian sites previously showed evidence of trade links with Egypt and the Aegean in the Late Bronze Age Evidence at Ugarit shows that the destruction there occurred after the reign of Merenptah 

The last Bronze Age king of Ugarit Ammurapi was a contemporary of the Hittite king Suppiluliuma II The exact dates of his reign are unknown A letter by the king is preserved on one of the clay tablets found baked in the conflagration of the destruction of the city Ammurapi stresses the seriousness of the crisis faced by many Near Eastern states from invasion by the advancing Sea Peoples in a dramatic response to a plea for assistance from the king of Alasiya

My father behold the enemys ships came my cities were burned and they did evil things in my country Does not my father know that all my troops and chariots are in the Land of Hatti and all my ships are in the Land of LukkaThus the country is abandoned to itself May my father know it the seven ships of the enemy that came here inflicted much damage upon us

Unfortunately for Ugarit no help arrived and Ugarit was burned to the ground at the end of the Bronze Age A cuneiform tablet found in 1986 shows that Ugarit was destroyed after the death of Merneptah about 1178 BC 

All centres along a coastal route from Gaza northward were destroyed and not reoccupied for up to thirty years  

None of the Mycenaean palaces of the Late Bronze Age survived with destruction being heaviest at palaces and fortified sites Up to 90 of small sites in the Peloponnese were abandoned suggesting a major depopulation The End Bronze Age collapse marked the start of what has been called the Greek Dark Ages which lasted for more than 400 years Other cities like Athens continued to be occupied but with a more local sphere of influence limited evidence of trade and an impoverished culture from which it took centuries to recover

Several cities were destroyed Assyria lost northwestern cities which were reconquered by Tiglath Pileser I after his ascension to kingship Control of the Babylonian and Assyrian regions extended barely beyond the city limits Babylon was sacked by the Elamites

After apparently surviving for a while the Egyptian Empire collapsed in the mid twelfth century BCE This led to the Third Intermediate Period that is non dynasty 

Robert Drews describes the collapse as the worst disaster in ancient history even more calamitous than the collapse of the Western Roman Empire A number of people have spoken of the cultural memories of the disaster as stories of a lost golden age Hesiod for example spoke of Ages of Gold Silver and Bronze separated from the modern harsh cruel world of the Age of Iron by the Age of Heroes

It was a period associated with the collapse of central authority a depopulation particularly of urban areas the loss of literacy in Anatolia and the Aegean and its restriction elsewhere the disappearance of established patterns of long distance international trade and increasingly vicious struggles for power

There are various theories put forward to explain the situation of collapse many of them compatible with each other

The Hekla 3 eruption was about this time and is dated at 1159 BC by Egyptologists and British archeologists

Earthquakes tend to occur in sequences or storms where a major earthquake above 65 on the Richter magnitude scale can set off later earthquakes along the weakened fault line When a map of earthquake occurrence is superimposed on a map of the sites destroyed in the Late Bronze Age there is a very close correspondence

Evidence includes the widespread findings of Naue II type swords throughout the region and Egyptian records of invading northerners from all the lands The Ugarit correspondence at the time mentions invasions by tribes of such as the mysterious Sea Peoples Equally the last Linear B documents in the Aegean reported a large rise in piracy slave raiding and other attacks particularly around Anatolia Later fortresses along the Libyan coast constructed and maintained by the Egyptians after the reign of Ramesses II were built to reduce raiding

This theory is strengthened by the fact that the collapse coincides with the appearance in the region of many new ethnic groups Indo European tribes such as the Phrygians Thracians Macedonians and Dorian Greeks seem to have arrived at this time possibly from the north There also seems to have been widespread migration of the Aramaeans possibly from the South East

Ultimate reasons for these migrations could include drought developments in warfareweaponry earthquakes or other natural disasters This means that the migrations theory is not incompatible with the other theories mentioned here

The Bronze Age collapse may be seen in the context of a technological history that saw the slow comparatively continuous spread of iron working technology in the region beginning with precocious iron working in what is now Bulgaria and Romania in the 13th and 12th centuries BCE Leonard R Palmer suggested that iron whilst inferior to bronze weapons was in more plentiful supply and so allowed larger armies of iron users to overwhelm the smaller armies of bronze using chariotry 

It now seems that the disruption of long distance trade cut easy supplies of tin making bronze impossible to make Older implements were recycled and then iron substitutes were used

Drought could have easily precipitated or hastened socio economic problems and led to wars More recently Brian Fagan has shown how the diversion of mid winter storms from the Atlantic to north of the Pyrenees and the Alps bringing wetter conditions to Central Europe but drought to the Eastern Mediterranean was associated with the Late Bronze Age collapse

Robert Drews argues that massed infantry used newly developed weapons and armor192ff Cast rather than forged spearheads and long swords a revolutionizing cut and thrust weapon and javelins were used The appearance of bronze foundries suggest that mass production of bronze artifacts was suddenly important in the Aegean For example Homer uses spears as a virtual synonym for warrior suggesting the continued importance of the spear in combat 

Such new weaponry used by a proto hoplite model of infantry able to withstand attacks of massed chariotry would destabilize states that were based upon the use of chariots by the ruling class This precipitated an abrupt social collapse as raiders andor infantry mercenaries began to conquer loot and burn the cities

A general systems collapse has been put forward as an explanation for the reversals in culture that occurred between the Urnfield culture of the 12 13th centuries BCE and the rise of the Celtic Hallstatt culture in the 9th and 10th centuries This theory may however simply raise the question of whether this collapse was the cause of or the effect of the Bronze Age collapse being discussed 

In the Middle East a variety of factors including population growth soil degradation drought cast bronze weapon and iron production technologies could have combined to push the relative price of weaponry to a level unsustainable for traditional warrior aristocracies In complex societies which were increasingly fragile this combination of factors may have contributed to the collapse 

The critical flaws of the Late Bronze Age are its centralization specialization complexity and top heavy political structure These flaws then revealed themselves through revolts defections demographic crises and wars between states Other factors which could have placed increasing pressure on the fragile kingdoms include the Sea Peoples piratical disturbances of maritime trade drought crop failures famine Dorian migration or invasion

Adolph Borsdorf was a German player of the French horn

Borsdorf was born in Saxony in 1854 He studied the French horn at the Conservatoire in Dresden and played in a military band In 1879 he moved to England where he stayed for the rest of his life becoming the most important horn player in England The conductor Hans Richter offered him at job in the orchestra at Covent Garden In 1904 he joined the newly formed London Symphony Orchestra The four horn players in that orchestra were excellent players and were often called Gods Own Quartet

Borsdorf and his colleague Franz Paersch had learned to play on horns that were made in Germany These had a wide bore However both players changed to playing instruments made in France by a horn maker called Raoux These instruments had a narrower bore They were not quite as powerful but gave a particularly clear sound

Borsdorf became professor at the Royal College of Music when it was founded in 1882 He also taught at the Royal Academy of Music He soon became the best horn player in London He was playing principal horn in the orchestra which Henry Wood conducted at the very first Promenade Concert in the Queens Hall in 1895 He was also in the orchestra when Richard Strausss Till Eulenspiegel was given its first performance in England in 1896 with the composer conducting

In 1913 he became ill and had to have teeth removed There was also another problem for him World War I broke out in 1914 and there was a lot of anti German feeling in England After the war he rarely played in public

Borsdorf died in 1923 He had done more than anyone else to improve the standard of horn playing in England He taught many talented pupils including AEBrain Jr Aubrey Brain Frank Probyn and his own three sons Oskar Francis and Emil who all became professional horn players

A mute is an object used to make a musical instrument quieter

Alfred Edwin Brain was an English player of the French horn He was the founder of a great school of English horn playing His grandson Dennis Brain was to become perhaps the most famous horn player of all time He is known as AEBrain Sr because one of his sons who also became a famous horn player had the same name

AEBrain was born in 1860 His father had fought in the Crimean War and was now an invalid Alfred did not get much education When he was 12 he joined the Scots Guards and played the horn in the band He married in 1880 and had seven children Two of them were to become great horn players Alfred and Aubrey  

He played in several orchestras including the Philharmonic Society the Queens Hall Orchestra and Covent Garden He played a lot for Henry Wood in The Proms In orchestras he nearly always played fourth horn so his nickname was George IV  In 1904 he became a founder member of the London Symphony Orchestra The four horn players in that orchestra Adolf Borsdorf Thomas Busby Henri Van der Meerschen and AEBrain were often called Gods Own Quartet because they blended together so well

He died in 1929 after a short retirement 

Alfred Edwin Brain Jr was an English player of the French horn He came from a family which included many famous horn players including his nephew Dennis Brain who became perhaps the most famous horn player of all time

AEBrain Jr was born in 1885 His father Alfred Edwin Brain Sr was a well known horn player Alfred started to learn the trumpet when he was six but when he was twelve he changed to the French horn and learned from his father He studied at the Royal Academy of Music with Adolf Borsdorf and also learned the piano from GDCunningham who was to teach his nephew the organ some forty years later His first professional job was with the Scottish Orchestra He then played in the Queens Hall Orchestra and the London Symphony Orchestra 

When World War I broke out he joined the Scots Guards but later in 1917 he did a lot of dangerous work in France where the fighting was taking place After the war he was awarded the British War Medal and Victory Medal for his bravery

When he returned after the war he got jobs with several of the London orchestras including Covent Garden where he played for Sir Thomas Beecham His brother Aubrey also an excellent horn player returned from the war after him By this time Alfred had got all the best horn jobs in London so it was difficult for Aubrey to find the best jobs

In 1923 he emigrated to the United States He played in the New York Philharmonic Orchestra and later for the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra In his later years he recorded a lot in film studios including for 20th century Fox

Skimboarding is a form of shallow water surfing that has been around since the golden era of surfing When the waves were poor surfers would often attempt to surf in shallow breaking water This led to making of smaller lighter boards named skimboards for the way they allow the user to skim across the surface of the water Lifeguards were quick to adopt these new boards and used skimboarding as a way to quickly move up and down the beach in shallow water Skimboarding has progressed and is now a recognized sport Competitions are held annually around the world and produce large amounts of revenue for this corner of the market These competitions also allow skimboarders to exhibit the amazing maneuvers that technology evolution and skill have made possible

Arminius also known as Armin or Hermann was a chieftain of the Cherusci He was able to unite a group of Germanic tribes together to fight the Romans They destroyed a Roman army in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest This was the greatest military disaster the Romans had ever suffered

After the battle Arminius immediately sent Varus severed head to Maroboduus king of the Marcomanni the other most powerful Germanic ruler Arminius offered an anti Roman alliance Marobod declined the offer sending the head on to Rome for burial and remained neutral throughout the ensuing war Only later did a brief inconclusive war break out between the two Germanic leaders

Later in 14 AD the Roman general Germanicus nephew of the Emperor Tiberius led a huge 8 legion army into Germania against the coalition of tribes led by Arminius

After visiting the site of the disastrous Battle of the Teutoburg Forest where 1520000 Romans had been killed in 9 AD and burying their remains he launched a massive assault on the heartland of Arminius tribe the Cheruscans 

Arminius initially lured Germanicus cavalry into a trap and inflicted minor casualties until successful fighting by the Roman infantry caused the Germans to break and flee into the forest This victory combined with the fact that winter was fast approaching meant Germanicuss next step was to lead his army back to its winter quarters on the Rhine

In spite of doubts on the part of his uncle Emperor Tiberius Germanicus managed to raise another huge army and invaded Germany again the next year in 16 He forced a crossing of the Weser near modern Minden suffering heavy losses Then he met Arminius army in an engagement often called the Battle of the Weser River

Germanicuss superior tactics and better trained and equipped legions inflicted huge casualties on the German army with only minor losses One final battle was fought at the Angivarian Wall west of modern Hanover repeating the pattern of high German fatalities forcing them to flee 

With his main objectives reached and with winter approaching Germanicus ordered his army back to their winter camps with the fleet occasioning some damage by a storm in the North Sea Although only a small number of soldiers died it was still a bad ending for a brilliantly fought campaign After a few more raids across the Rhine which resulted in the recovery of two of the three legions eagles lost in 9 Germanicus was recalled to Rome and informed by Tiberius that he would be given a triumph and reassigned to a different command

Five years later Arminius was killed on the orders of rival Germanic chiefs Although Arminius could not keep unity among the Germanic tribes the loss of Roman legions in the Teutoburg forest had a far reaching effect on the Germanic tribes and the Roman Empire Germanicus campaign was the last major Roman military effort east of the Rhine

Impairment or being impaired is the state of losing a part of a function For example people who drink too much alcohol could be impaired in some or all of their senses like touch or even eyesight The senses that impair a person might make the person do or say things they would never normally do or say The level of harm done usually depends on the substance If it is mild the person usually is not harmed or impaired Sometimes being impaired is natural or from a mutated gene

Mild stimulants like caffeine usually do not harm the person However opiates such as ecstasy or marijuana can impair all five senses of the person who ingested it However impairment can sometimes happen naturally with mutated genes

Often taking a mild depressant or stimulant does not have much effect on the person who took it But more serious drugs substances or even medications can have a large effect on the person Usually stimulants keep the person awake and energetic Depressants work the opposite way they decrease the heart rate of the person and relax them Sedatives give the same effect More of these substances can carry harm or even life threatening effects if ingested in large amounts This is called intoxication if with a toxin

The 1707 Hei earthquake happened at 1400 local time on 28 October 1707 It was the largest earthquake in Japanese history

The southern coast of Honshu runs in the same direction as the Nankai Trough This marks the place where the Philippine Sea Plate moves under the Eurasian Plate Movement on this boundary causes many earthquakes some of them are megathrust earthquakes The Nankai megathrust has five parts that can break one by one The different parts have broken either one at a time or all together many times over the last 1300 years This kind of quake often happens in pairs with a relatively short time between them In addition to the two earthquakes in 1854 there were similar earthquakes in 1944 and 1946 Each time the northeastern part broke before the southwestern part In 1707 the earthquakes were either at the same time or close enough together so that writing from that time do not describe them separately

29000 houses were destroyed and more than 5000 people were killed The earthquake caused at least one major landslide in Shizuoka This landslide was one of the three largest in Japan and is called the Ohya Landslide It covered an area of 18 km2 with an estimated volume of 120 million m3 In the Nara Basin the earthquake made the soil behave like a liquid

There were two other very large earthquakes the 1854 Ansei Tkai and Ansei Nankai earthquakes The 1707 was stronger than both Several observations show that the Hei earthquake was bigger At Cape Muroto Kchi a cliff was raised up about 23 m in 1707 but just 15 m in 1854 In the Kawachi Plain area the earthquake was around 67 on the JMA scale Also the amount of damage and height of the water from tsunami showed the strength of the earthquake There are also records of tsunami at distant locations such as Nagasaki and Jeju do South Korea

The tsunami that followed the earthquake raised water along the coast Along the southwestern coast of Kchi the average increase in sea level was 77 m In some places it rose up to 10 m 

Changes in stress caused by large earthquakes may be enough to cause volcanic eruptions when the magma system of the volcano is close to a critical state The great earthquake in 1707 may have changed pressure in the magma under Mount Fuji

Photo editing is the changing of images These images can be digital photographs illustrations or prints Some types of editing such as airbrushing are done by hand and others are done using photo editing programs like Photoshop and Microsoft Paint Photo editing is done for many reasons Many photos of models are edited to remove blemishes and make the model sexier This is usually called retouching airbrushing or Photoshopping even if Photoshop is not used to edit the photo Other reasons to edit a photo include fixing errors practical jokes and tricking people Photo editing is also used to make completely new images Photo editing is sometimes called photo manipulation usually when it is used to trick people

The first known example of photo editing happened in the 1860s to a photo of President Abraham Lincoln Before the invention of computers people had to edit images by hand Some editing was done by pasting photos together People also used tools like ink paint and airbrushes

In the 1980s the photo editing computer programs were released The first version of Adobe Photoshop was released in 1987 Since then it has become one of the most popular photo editing programs In fact it is so popular that many people now use the word photoshop to mean photo editing in general

A piata is a type of decoration with bright colors It is made from either clay or cardboard and is covered with papier mch

In Puerto Rico Ecuador Peru Venezuela Colombia and in some other Latin American countries piatas are traditionally used only at childrens birthday parties They are usually made of cardboard colorfully decorated to match the birthday party theme and filled with candy chocolates small toys and confetti Colored strings are attached to the bottom of the piata where a trap door is hidden under the decoration The piata is then hung somewhere where everyone can see but the strings are kept out of the reach of children Toward the end of the party usually after the cutting of the cake an announcement is made that the piata will be broken and each child is given an empty party bag All the children get together directly underneath the piata and each child is given a string to hold Then at the count of three the children pull their strings all at the same time This opens the hidden trap door and the children receive a shower of candy and confetti while they rush to fill up their bags with the treats

The Hei dai funka started on December 16 1707 and ended about January 1 1708 during the Edo period There was no lava flow but the Hoei eruption released at least 800 million cubic meters of volcanic ash This ash spread over very large areas around the volcano It even reached Edo almost 100 km away Cinders and ash fell like rain in Izu Kai Sagami and Musashi provinces

The eruption was on Mount Fujis eastnorth east slope and made three new volcanic openings called No 1 No 2 and No 3 Hei vents The danger of the eruption increased over the next several days After the first earthquake and explosion of cinders and ash another stronger explosion happened a few days later This explosion threw out rocks and stones Mount Fuji has not erupted since

Hokusais One Hundred Views of Mount Fuji includes an image of the small crater which developed from a secondary eruption site on the southwestern slope This was called Heizan because the eruption happened in year Hei 4

Today the crater can be visited from Fujinomiya Trail or Gotemba Trail of Mount Fuji

In the year after the Hei eruption another related disaster happened The Sakawa River flooded Sand from the volcano fell and widely covered the fields east of Mount Fuji Farmers made sand piles by dumping the ash and sand from their fields The rain washed away the sand piles from the dumping grounds and into the rivers again and again This made some of the rivers shallower especially the Sakawa Enough ash had fallen to partly block the river The ash made temporary dams Heavy rainfall on August 7 and 8 1708 caused an avalanche of volcanic ash and mud and broke the dams The river flooded the Ashigara plain

They were some of the heaviest creatures ever to walk the earth Titanosaurs included Saltasaurus Isisaurus Argentinosaurus and Paralititan The largest might have weighed up to 100 tonnes or perhaps even double that if some poorly described data are to be believed 

They were named after the mythological Titans the early deities of Ancient Greece who preceded the Twelve Olympians 

Together with the brachiosaurs and relatives they make up the larger clade Titanosauriformes

The Battle of Thermopylae 480 BC was fought between an alliance of Greek city states led by Sparta and the Persian Empire of Xerxes I It took place at the pass of Thermopylae 

The battle was the climax of the second Persian invasion of Greece It took place over three days at the same time as the naval Battle of Artemisium

The Persian invasion was a delayed response to the defeat of the first Persian invasion of Greece This was ended by the Athenian victory at the Battle of Marathon Xerxes amassed a huge army and navy and set out for the second time to conquer all of Greece 

The Athenian general Themistocles suggested the Greek allies should block the Persian army at the pass of Thermopylae and block the Persian navy at the Straits of Artemisium

A Greek force of approximately 7000 men marched north to block the pass in the summer of 480 BC The huge Persian army arrived at the pass in late August or early September

Vastly outnumbered the Greeks held off the Persians for seven days in total before the rear guard was annihilated in one of historys most famous last stands 

During two full days of battle the small force led by King Leonidas I of Sparta blocked the only road by which the massive Persian army could pass After the second day of battle a local resident named Ephialtes betrayed the Greeks by revealing a small path that led behind the Greek lines Aware that his force was being outflanked Leonidas dismissed the bulk of the Greek army and remained to guard the rear with 300 Spartans 700 Thespians 400 Thebans and perhaps a few hundred others Most of them were killed

The pass at Thermopylae was thus opened to the Persian army according to Herodotus at the cost to the Persians of up to 20000 fatalities The Greek rearguard meanwhile was annihilated with a probable loss of 2000 men including those killed on the first two days of battlep397p148

After this engagement the Greek navy at Artemisium received news of the defeat at Thermopylae Since their strategy required both Thermopylae and Artemisium to be held and given their losses the Greek navy decided to withdraw to Salamis The Persians then captured the evacuated Athens 

Seeking a decisive victory over the Allied fleet the Persian fleet attacked but were defeated at the Battle of Salamis in late 480 BC Fearing to be trapped in Europe Xerxes withdrew with much of his army to Asia leaving Mardonius to complete the conquest of Greece The following year however saw a Greek army decisively defeat the Persians at the Battle of Plataea thereby ending the Persian invasion

Both ancient and modern writers have used the Battle of Thermopylae as an example of the power of a patriotic army of freemen defending native soil The performance of the defenders at the battle of Thermopylae is also used as an example of the advantages of training equipment and good use of terrain as force multipliers and has become a symbol of courage against overwhelming odds

The Coriolis effect is a force that is found in a rotating object Gaspard Gustave de Coriolis first described the Coriolis effect in 1835 using mathematics It is a fictitious force that acts upon all bodies which are described using a rotating frame of reference The force is perpendicular to both the axis of movement of the body it acts on as well as that of the frame of reference

Approaching Artemisium towards the end of summer the Persian navy was caught in a gale off the coast of Magnesia and lost around a third of their 1200 ships 

After arriving at Artemisium the Persians sent a detachment of 200 ships around the coast of Euboea in an attempt to trap the Greeks but these were caught in another storm and shipwrecked 

The main action of the battle took place after two days of smaller engagements The two sides fought all day with roughly equal losses however the smaller Allied fleet could not afford the losses

After the engagement the Allies received news of the defeat of the Allied army at Thermopylae Their strategy was to hold both Thermopylae and Artemisium So given their losses the Allies decided to withdraw to Salamis The Persians overran Boeotia and captured the now evacuated Athens However seeking a decisive victory over the Allied fleet the Persians were later defeated at the Battle of Salamis in late 480

Wilderness or wildland is a natural environment on Earth which has not been much disturbed by humans 

Wilderness areas can be found in reserves estates farms conservation areas ranches National Forests National Parks and even in urban areas along rivers gulches or any undeveloped areas These areas are important for the survival of species biodiversity ecology conservation solitude and recreation 

Wilderness is deeply valued for cultural spiritual moral and aesthetic reasons Some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity 

They may also preserve historic genetic traits and that they provide habitat for wild flora and fauna that may be difficult to recreate in zoos arboretums or laboratories

From this point of view it is the wildness of a place that makes it a wilderness The mere presence or activity of people does not disqualify an area from being wilderness Many ecosystems that are or have been inhabited or influenced by activities of people may still be considered wild This way of looking at wilderness includes areas within which natural processes operate without human interference

The WILD Foundation states that wilderness areas have two dimensions they must be biologically intact and legally protected The World Conservation Union classifies wilderness at two levels Ia and Ib 

Probably no place on earth is completely untouched by humanity either due to past occupation by indigenous people or through global processes such as climate change Activities on the margins of specific wilderness areas such as fire suppression and the interruption of animal migration also affect the wilderness

Especially in wealthier industrialized nations it has a specific legal meaning as well as land where development is prohibited by law Many nations have designated wilderness including Australia Canada New Zealand South Africa and the United States 

Many new parks are currently being planned and legally passed by various Parliaments and Legislatures at the urging of dedicated individuals around the globe who believe that in the end dedicated inspired people empowered by effective legislation will ensure that the spirit and services of wilderness will thrive and permeate our society preserving a world that we are proud to hand over to those who come after us

Impedance and resistance are very much related

At the physical level simplifying many things

One important difference between the resistance and the impedance is that a resistor will dissipate energy it gets hot but an inductor and a capacitor store the energy and can return that energy to the source when it goes down

Across a resistor both the voltage and the current goes up and down at the same time they are said to be in phase but with an impedance its different the voltage is shifted by 14 wavelength behind the current in a capacitor and forward in an inductor

A 14 wavelength is usually represented with the imaginary number j which is also equivalent to a 90 degree shift

The use of the imaginary number j makes the mathematics much simpler it allows to calculate the total impedance the same way as its done with resistors for example a resistor plus an impedance in series is RZ and in parallel its

These are the UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the USA

Mesa Verde National Park is a US National Park and UNESCO World Heritage Site It is in Montezuma County Colorado United States 

The Park was created in 1906 to protect some of the best preserved cliff dwellings in the world The UNESCO listing was with Yellowstone National Park the first from the USA 

The park occupies 814 square miles near the Four Corners and features ruins of homes and villages built by the ancestral Puebloan people sometimes called the Anasazi 

The ancestral Puebloans made these stone villages their home in the 13th century However the first ancestral Puebloans had settled in Mesa Verde over 600 years before the cliff dwellings were ever built

These first people are known as the Basketmakers and they lived in pithouses clustered into small villages usually built on mesa tops but sometimes in the overhangs of the cliffs These hunter gatherer people settled and began farming and using the bow and arrow a weapon that was more efficient and accurate than the atlatl

By 750 AD the people were building mesa top villages made of adobe By the late 12th century they began to build the cliff dwellings for which Mesa Verde is famous

Mesa Verde is best known for cliff dwellings which are structures built within caves and under outcropping in cliffs including Cliff Palace which is thought to be the largest cliff dwelling in North America The Spanish term Mesa Verde translates into English as green table Approximately 600 of the over 4700 archeological sites found in Mesa Verde National Park are cliff dwellings

Mesa Verde National Park is in the south western corner of the state of Colorado

Elevations in the park range from about convert6100to8400ftm The terrain is dominated by ridges and valleys running roughly north and south The northernmost point is 132 miles farther north than the southernmost

Although explorers from Spain went through the general region in the 18th century actual sight of the cliffs dwellings by outsiders seems to have first occurred in the latter half of the 19th century 

The fame of Mesa Verde soon began to spread thanks to the Wetherill ranchers and the archeological work of Gustaf Nordenskild Vandalism led to President Teddy Roosevelts support of protecting the area as a national park in 1906

The shelling of Yeonpyeong was an exchange of artillery between the North and South Korean military on Yeonpyeong Island on 23 November 2010 After a South Korean artillery practice on the island North Korea fired about 170 shells at Yeonpyeong The shelling damaged the island greatly It killed four South Koreans and hurt 19 At this South Korea shelled North Korean gun positions North Koreans said that they had fired the shells because they heard South Korean shells being fired into the North Korean part of the sea Many nations disapproved of what the North did and the tension in Korea grew The United Nations said that it was one of the most serious things that had happened after the end of the Korean War

On the morning of 23 November North Korea said that it complained to the South asking whether was an attack against the North It said that it would not allow firing in what the North thought was its part of the sea South Korean forces practiced firing in waters near Baengnyeong Island and Yeonpyeong Island in South Korean waters According to a South Korean military official the shells were fired towards waters in the south away from North Korea The firing was not part of the Hoguk exercise It was a practice they did every month

At 1434 in Korean time North Korea moved 22 mm Multiple Launch Rocket System shells towards an artillery place in Kaemori Then it began firing on the island of Yeonpyeong The firing went on 1434 to 1455 and again from 1510 to 1541 Many of the shells destroyed homes and shops When they saw this South Korea used 15mm self propelled howitzers to fire about 80 shells at the North The firing ended at about 1642 It was the first artillery battle between North and South Korea since the 1970s It was thought to be one of the most serious attacks by the North on the South since the Korean War ended 

Several fires began because of the North Korean shelling so the South Korean military moved civilians away from Yeonpyeong

Two South Korean soldiers Hasa Seo Jeong wu and Ilbyeong Moon Gwang wuk were killed Six other people in the military were seriously hurt Two workers on the island Kim Chi baek who was 61 and Bae Bok chul who was 60 were also killed Many parts of the island were put on fire because of the attack Most of the people living on the island were moved after the shelling From the 1780 people living there about 1500 moved away Many of them moved to Incheon on the mainland The Incheon city sent 22 fire engines and ambulances to the island

James Hilton was an English writer He wrote several best selling novels including Lost Horizon and Goodbye Mr Chips Lost Horizon introduced an imaginary place called Shangri La and made it popular 

James Hilton was born in Leigh His father John Hilton was the headmaster of Chapel End School in Walthamstow James Hilton partially based the character Mr Chipping in Goodbye Mr Chips on his father

Hilton wrote his two most famous books while living in an ordinary semi detached house on Oak Hill Gardens Woodford Green The house is still there and a small blue sign says it was Hiltons home

He was married twice first to Alice Brown and later to Galina Kopineck Both marriages ended in divorce He died in Long Beach California from liver cancer

Hilton became a success writer when he was still young He published his first novel Catherine Herself when he was 20 years old Several of his books were international bestsellers Some successful films were made based on his novels Three of the best known movies are Lost Horizon Goodbye Mr Chips and Random Harvest Many copies of Lost Horizon were sold in the 1930s as one of the first Pocket Books The serial number was 1 Some people call it the novel that began the popularity of paperback books

Lost Horizon is set in Tibet and especially in a secret imaginary valley called Shangri La Shangri La now means any perfect pleasurable place or utopia

It is unsure exactly where and how Hilton got his ideas about Tibet He may have been inspired to write Lost Horizon and to invent Shangri La by reading the National Geographic Magazine by Joseph Rock Rock was an Austrian American botanist and ethnologist who explored southwestern China and areas near Tibet Hilton have also read articles by early travelers in Tibet that he found in the British Library for more ideas Christian Zeeman may also have been the model for the hero of the story He disappeared while living in Japan and there were rumors that he was living secretly in a Zen Buddhist monastery Some say that the isolated valley town of Weaverville California in far northern Trinity County was Shangri La However this is a misunderstanding of a comment by Hilton in a 1941 interview In that interview Hilton said that Weaverville reminded him of Shangri La Coincidentally Junction City now has a Tibetan Buddhist centre with the occasional Tibetan monks in saffron robes

After the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo the US President Franklin D Roosevelt told the press that the airplanes had taken off from Shangri La This was a kind of joke to hide the secret that they had taken off from aircraft carriers Later the US Navy gave that name to an aircraft carrier and Roosevelt named his Maryland presidential retreat Shangri La That retreat is now called Camp David since President Dwight D Eisenhower renamed it after his grandson Zhongdian is a mountain region of Southwest China that has now been renamed Shangri La because it may have inspired Hiltons book 

Hilton lived and worked in Hollywood beginning in the mid 1930s He won an Academy Award in 1942 for his work on the screenplay of Mrs Miniver That film was based on the novel by Jan Struther Hilton was the host of The Hallmark Playhouse for CBS Radio One of his later novels Morning Journey was about the movie business

Some of Hiltons novels became films

Hilton co wrote the book and lyrics for Shangri La an unsuccessful 1956 Broadway musical adaptation of Lost Horizon

Maroon 5 began writing the songs that appear on Hands All Over after winding down from a world tour in support of their 2007 studio release It Wont Be Soon Before Long Several months later the band received a phone call from Robert John Mutt Lange who had heard that the band were beginning to write a new album and expressed an interest in producing it In a press release on their official website the album is described as a killer hybrid of rock pop funk and RB 

tzi the Iceman is a well preserved natural mummy of a man who lived about 5300 years ago 

The mummy was found in September 1991 by two German hikers in the Schnalstal glacier tztal Alps near Hauslabjoch on the border between Austria and Italy

He is also known as the Iceman Similaun Man Frozen Fritz and Man from Hauslabjoch He is Europes oldest natural human mummy and has offered an new picture of Chalcolithic Europeans 

There was a bit of a diplomatic struggle between Austria and Italy for the ownership of the body His body and belongings are now displayed in the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology in Bolzano in the Southern Tyrol

There was also a long legal struggle by the finders Helmut and Erika Simon for a suitable reward After many court hearings the provincial government agreed to pay Erika Simon 150000 By that time 17 years had passed and her husband was dead

In 2001 X rays and a CT scan revealed that tzi had an arrowhead lodged in his left shoulder when he died and a matching small tear on his coat 

The discovery of the arrowhead led researchers to think tzi died of blood loss from the wound which would likely have been fatal even if modern medical techniques had been available 

Further research found that the arrows shaft had been removed before death and close examination of the body found bruises and cuts to the hands wrists and chest Cerebral trauma suggested a blow to the head One of the cuts was to the base of his thumb that reached down to the bone but had no time to heal before his death 

At present it is believed that death was caused by a blow to the head Researchers are unsure if this was due to a fall or from being struck with a rock by another person

Apparently the iceman had 57 tattoos

The tattoos were carbon There were groups of short parallel vertical lines to both sides of the lumbar spine a cross shaped mark behind the right knee and various marks around both ankles 

X ray examination of his bones showed age conditioned or strain induced degeneration in these areas These tattoos may have been related to pain relief treatments similar to acupuncture If so this is at least 2000 years before their previously known earliest use in China

Stutter is a song off of the Maroon 5 album Hands All Over The song hit US Mainstream in Europe and Japan in early 2011 

The song was rumored in November of 2010 that it would be the 3rd upcoming single by the band off the album Hands All Over however wasnt officially released

In Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome amphoras were used to transport liquids or grain Amphores had two handles used for carrying Amphores existed in different sizes between 5 litres and 50 litres They were made of clay or metal

Amphoras existed even before the times of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome Old amphoras as old as 4500 BCE have been found in China

Peter Waldo Valdo or Waldes also Pierre Vauds or de Vaux is believed by many to have started the Waldensians This was a Christian spiritual movement of the Middle Ages People are still alive in southern Europe who come from this movement Because not much was written down about Waldo while he was alive people do not agree how important he was to the Waldensians because it may have been around before his leadership Also the French historian Thuanus thought Waldo died in the year 1179

Not know many details are known about the life of Waldo Some sources say that he was a rich man who sold clothes and that he was a merchant from Lyon Also sources say that he had some education Sometime not long before the year 1160 he was inspired by some events One of these was hearing a sermon on the life of St Alexius Another was when saying that one did not believe in transubstantiation became a crime for which one could be punished by death A third event was the sudden death of a friend during an evening meal After this he began living a radical Christian life He gave his property to his wife He gave the rest of his things to the poor 

At about this time Waldo began to preach and teach publicly about his ideas of living simple lives and about poverty He taught that No man can serve two masters God and mammon and strongly criticized things done by the Papal and things taught by the Roman Catholic Church Some of the things taught by the Catholic Church that he criticized were purgatory and transubstantiation He said that the Roman Catholic Church was the prostitute from the book of Revelation By 1170 many people were following him These people were called the Poor of Lyon the Poor of Lombardy or the Poor of God who would spread their teaching abroad while dressed up as peddlers Often called the Waldensians they were different from the Albigensians or Cathari 

The Waldensian movement had lay preaching people who were poor by choice and strictly obeying the Bible Between 1175 1185 Waldo either had a cleric from Lyons translate the New Testament of the Bible into the language that most people spoke the Arpitan language or translate it himself

In 1179 Waldo and one of his followers went to Rome where they were welcomed by Pope Alexander III and the Roman Curia They had to explain what they believed in front of a panel of three clergymen including issues which were then debated within the Church These included the idea that all people were priests teaching the gospel in the language most people spoke and people living poor simple lives on purpose The results of the meeting were inconclusive and Waldos ideas but not the movement itself were condemned at the Third Lateran Council in the same year although the leaders of the movement had not been yet excommunicated 

Sent away from Lyon Waldo and his followers moved to the high valleys of Piedmont and in France in the Luberon Finally Waldo was excommunicated by Pope Lucius III during the synod held at Verona in 1184 and the doctrine of the Poor of Lyon was again condemned by the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215 where they are mentioned by name for the first time and called heresy The Roman Catholic Church began to persecute the Waldensians and many were tried and sentenced to death in different European countries during the 12th 13th and 14th centuries The Waldensians survived by moving the Alps and hiding there Centuries after his death the Waldensian denomination joined the Genevan or Reformed branch of the Protestant Reformation

The Siberian Intervention was part of a larger plan by the Western powers and Japan They wanted to support the White Russians against the Bolshevik Red Army during the Russian Civil War The Allied Forces left by 1920 but the Imperial Japanese Army stayed in Siberia until 1922 The European soldiers went to the Russian Maritime Provinces 

The Siberian Intervention came quickly after the Russian October Revolution of 1917 The new Bolshevik government signed a separate peace treaty with Germany That was a serious problem for the Entente powers The treaty ended fighting for the Germans facing Russia Germany could then move soldiers from east to west against Europe The peace agreement also allowed Germany to get many supplies from Murmansk Arkhangelsk and Vladivostok In addition a 50000 man Czech Legion had been fighting on the side of the Allies They became trapped The Czechs were trying to fight their way out to the east to Vladivostok along the Trans Siberian Railway However the Bolsheviks controlled that railway

Great Britain and France decided to use military power and join the Russian Civil War against the Bolshevik government because of all of those problems They had three goals 

The British and French did not have enough soldiers so the asked the United States to help They asked the US to send soldiers to both the North Russia Campaign and the Siberian Campaign President Wilson agreed in July 1918 even though the War Department said not to help The US sent two groups of soldiers 5000 soldiers were the American North Russia Expeditionary Force and 10000 were called the American Expeditionary Force Siberia In the same month the Russian White movement asked the Beiyang government of the Republic of China to send men They sent 2000 soldiers by August The Chinese later occupied Outer Mongolia and Tuva They sent a battalion to the North Russian Campaign to fight against the Bolsheviks

The British had few soldiers sending only 1500 troops to Siberia These soldiers came from 9th Battalion Hampshire Regiment and the 25th Battalion Middlesex Regiment

The Canadian Siberian Expeditionary Force was commanded by Major General James H Elmsley The Canadian government approved the mission in August 1918 The Canadian soldiers were sent to Vladivostok to support the allied armies already there There were 4192 soldiers in the group They returned to Canada between April and June 1919 The Canadians did little fighting Fewer than 100 troops left the base area to go to Omsk Those 100 worked as administrative staff for 1500 British troops who were helping the White Russian government of Admiral Alexander Kolchak Most Canadians stayed in Vladivostok They did routine practice and worked as police in the unstable port city

The Italian soldiers were most active in three areas Irkutsk Harbin and Vladivostok

The American Expeditionary Force Siberia was commanded by Major General William S Graves At its largest it was 7950 officers and enlisted men

The Allies began to work together in Siberia in August 1918 The Japanese entered through Vladivostok and places along the Manchurian border They sent more 70000 soldiers The Allies worried about Japanese plans because they sent such a large group On September 5 the Japanese met the leading group of the Czech Legion A few days later the British Italian and French groups joined the Czechs to try to restart the war in the east They tried to make a new battle line beyond the Ural Mountains This meant that the European allies moved west The Japanese had their own goals They would not go west of Lake Baikal and stayed behind The Americans were suspicious of Japanese plansThey also stayed behind to watch the Japanese By November the Japanese controlled all ports and major towns in the Russian Maritime Provinces and in Siberia east of the city of Chita 

In the summer of 1918 onwards the Japanese army supported White Russian groups the 5th infantry division and the Japanese backed Special Manchurian Detachment of Grigory Semyonov took control over Transbaikalia They started a White Transbaikalia government but it did not last long

The Planck time is the length of time at which no smaller meaningful length can be validly measured due to the indeterminacy expressed in Werner Heisenbergs Uncertainty Principle It is thought to be the shortest period of time known so far One Planck time is the time it would take a photon travelling at the speed of light to cross a distance equal to one Planck length

It is figured out from the Planck constant which was first thought of by the physicist Max Planck in 1900 This work by Planck asserts that the energy of a photon is proportional to its frequency and their relation can be put in terms of familiar units such as the joule by using the proportionality constant Planck gave us Heisenbergs original quantum theory was improved by his teacher and colleague Max Born Born put Heisenbergs equation into a matrix form Born immediately noticed that to calculate using these matrices one matrix had to be multiplied by another matrix In matrix multiplication multiplying matrix P by matrix X gives a different result from the one obtained by multiplying matrix X by matrix P He further noticed that the difference between the two matrices involves h the Planck proportionality constant It shows that one can never pin down things like P and X exactly It turns out that we cannot pin down a time any better than we can pin down a place or a momentum We get closer and closer and then we reach the Planck time

Silva Barunaki Sirvard Kaputikyan was a 20th century prominent Armenian poet writer academian and public activist 

She was awarded by the Renowned Master of Arts Armenian SSR and Renowned Worker of Arts Georgian SSR official titles State prizes of USSR and Armenian SSR Nosside Italian prize ordens of St Mesrob Mashtots and Knyaginia Olga She was a member of International PEN

In February 1988 during a reception in Kremlin Mikhail Gorbachev said that he and his wife Raisa greatly admired Kaputikyans poetry She appeared as herself in the 1992 documentary Parajanov The Last Spring about Sergei Paradjanov a legendary film maker of Armenian descent who was persecuted by Soviet authorities

Pointillism is a way of painting in which small separate dots of pure color are used to form images The artist paints the picture with hundreds of tiny dots mainly of red yellow blue and green with white The eye and mind of the viewer mix the colours to make different shades of these colours as well as orange purple pink and brown depending on the way the dots of colour are arranged 

Georges Seurat who at first worked with the Impressionist painters first used this technique in 1886 Other important artists were Paul Signac Camille Pissarro and in some paintings Vincent van Gogh Art critics who saw their work laughed at it and called it Pointillism as an insult This name is still used but is no longer thought of as an insult

Pointillism is very different to the traditional ways that artists use to blend pigments on a palette Pointillist painters do not mix the colours on the palette at all they just use the bright colours straight out of the tube Traditional painters and Impressionist painters use many different types of brushstrokes and many dfferent textures of paint The surface of the painting may have flat colour lines squiggles and dabs of paint but in a Pointillist painting every part of the picture is done in tiny dots and most of the dots are about the same size Pointillism is usually done in oil paints because they are thick and do not run into each other when they are painted on the canvas

Printing and Television Many colour printers and large printing presses use four colours to print in tiny dots of Cyan Magenta Yellow and Key Televisions and computer monitors use a similar technique to show many different colors using only Red Green and Blue

The name Pointillism is also given to a style of 20th century music Different musical notes are made separately from each other giving a sound texture similar to pointillism This type of music is also known as punctualism or klangfarbenmelodie

Samuel Lewis Francis was an American painter and printmaker He was born in San Mateo California and studied botany medicine and psychology at the University of California Berkeley He served in the United States Air Force during World War II before being injured in a plane crash He was in the hospital for several years and it was while he was there that he began to paint Once he was out of the hospital he returned to Berkeley this time to study art

Francis was initially influenced by the work of abstract expressionists such as Mark Rothko Arshile Gorky and Clyfford Still He spent the 1950s in Paris having his first exhibition there in 1952 While there he became associated with Tachisme He later spent time in Japan and some have seen an influence from Zen Buddhism in Francis work

Francis spent some time in Paris making entirely monochromatic works but his mature pieces are generally large oil paintings with splashed or splattered areas of bright contrasting colour Areas of white canvas are often left to show through and in later works paint is sometimes confined to the edges of the canvas

Francis returned to California during the 1960s and continued painting in Los Angeles  During the final three decades of his career his style of large scale bright Abstract Expressionism was also closely associated with Color Field painting During the last year of his life suffering from prostate cancer and unable to paint with his right hand after a fall in a final burst of energy he used his left hand to complete a dazzling series of about 150 small paintings before he died He was buried in Olema in Marin County California

After the death of the artist the Samuel L Francis Foundation Inc was founded The Foundation not only serves as his official Estate but also has a mission to research document protect and perpetuate the creative legacy of Francis The US copyright representative for the Francis Foundation is the Artists Rights Society

As of 2008 the Foundation is working to create a Catalogue Raisonn of Franciss work In addition to collecting information on known Francis works they also have a page dedicated to missing works for which they are seeking any information interested parties may have 

In 2010 artist and filmmaker Jeffrey Perkins released the documentary The Painter Sam Francis The documentary includes film of Francis at work filmed between 1968 and the early 90s together with interviews with friends family and professional associates of Francis

Tuff is a type of rock produced by the eruption of volcanoes

It consists of consolidated volcanic ash ejected from vents during a volcanic eruption Rock that has more than 50 tuff is called tuffaceous The chemical and mineral composition of tuffs varies according to what was in the molten magma

The products of a volcanic eruption are volcanic gases lava steam and tephra Magma is blown apart by volcanic gases and steam Solid material produced and thrown into the air by such volcanic eruptions is called tephra regardless of composition or fragment size If the pieces of ejecta are small the material is called volcanic ash defined as such particles less than 2 mm in diameter sand sized or smaller These particles are small slaggy pieces of magma and rock that have been tossed into the air by outbursts of steam and other gases

Among the loose beds of ash that cover the slopes of many volcanoes three classes of materials are represented 

In some great volcanic explosions nothing but materials of the second kind were emitted as at Mount Bandai in Japan in 1888 There have also been many eruptions in which the quantity of broken sedimentary rocks that mingled with the ash is very great 

These materials in contrast to true ashes tend to occur in angular fragments When they form a large part of the mass the rock is more properly a volcanic breccia than a tuff A breccia is a rock with sharp edged fragments in it

The ashes vary in size from large blocks twenty feet or more in diameter to the minutest impalpable dust The large masses are called volcanic bombs they have mostly a rounded elliptical or pear shaped form owing to rotation in the air before they solidified Many of them have ribbed or nodular surfaces and sometimes they have a crust intersected by many cracks like the surface of a loaf of bread Any ash in which they are very abundant is called an agglomerate

A tuff of recent origin is generally loose but the older tuffs have usually been cemented together by pressure and the action of infiltrating water This makes rocks which while not very hard are strong enough to be used for building purposes 

Many volcanoes stand near the sea and the ashes cast out by them are mingled with the sediments that are gathering at the bottom of the waters In this way ashy muds or sands or even in some cases ashy limestones are formed As a matter of fact most of the tuffs found in the older rock formations contain mixtures of clay sand and sometimes fossil shells which prove that they were beds spread out under water

During some volcanic eruptions a layer of ashes several feet in thickness is deposited over a considerable district but such beds thin out rapidly as the distance from the crater increases and ash deposits covering many square miles are usually very thin 

The showers of ashes often follow one another after longer or shorter intervals and hence thick masses of tuff whether of subaerial or of marine origin have mostly a stratified character In the fine beds it is often developed in great perfection

Welded tuff is a pyroclastic lava flow which was hot enough at the time of deposition to weld together During welding the glass shards and pumice fragments adhere together deform and compact together 

A hot lava flow welded by heat can be highly voluminous such as the Lava Creek Tuff erupted from Yellowstone Caldera in Wyoming 640000 years ago Lava Creek Tuff was at least 1000 times as large as the deposits of the May 18 1980 eruption of Mount St Helens It had a Volcanic Explosivity Index of 8greater than any eruption known in the last 10000 years

Basaltic tuffs are occur widely They are found in Skye Mull Antrim and other places where there are tertiary volcanic rocks in Scotland Derbyshire and Ireland among the carboniferous strata and among the still older rocks of the Lake District southern uplands of Scotland and Wales 

Basaltic tuffs are black dark green or red in colour They vary greatly in coarseness Often submarine they may contain shale sandstone grit and other sedimentary material and are occasionally fossiliferous Recent basaltic tuffs are found in Iceland the Faroe Islands Jan Mayen Sicily Sandwich Islands Samoa etc 

Copper iodide also known as cuprous iodide is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is CuI It has copper and iodide ions in it The copper is in its 1 oxidation state

Copper iodide is a white solid It does not dissolve in water It easily turns tan or brown It is a reducing agent The iodide easily oxidizes to iodine Copper does not form a stable copper iodide copper iodide breaks down right away to make copper iodide and iodine It dissolves in concentrated iodides like potassium iodide When it is diluted it makes copper iodide again 

It can be made by reacting iodine and copper in concentrated hydroiodic acid Another way would be to react copper sulfate and potassium iodide This makes copper iodide which as said before breaks down right away to make iodine and copper iodide

It is used to make organic compounds It is also used to make clouds rain It is used to make nylon resistant to heat It can be used to put iodine to foods

Copper bromide also known as cuprous bromide is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is CuBr It has copper and bromide ions in it The copper is in its 1 oxidation state

Copper bromide is a colorless solid It turns green when in air It does not dissolve in water It is a reducing agent 

Copper bromide is made by reacting copper bromide with any sulfite and any bromide salt This reaction makes hydrogen bromide gas 

It is used in organic chemistry It is used to make organic compounds that have copper in them

Copper bromide also known as cupric bromide is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is CuBr2 It has copper and bromide ions in it The copper is in its 2 oxidation state

Copper bromide is a grayish black solid Most copper compounds except for the oxide are bright blue or green It can be reduced to copper bromide

It can be made by dissolving copper oxide in hydrobromic acid It can also be made by reacting copper and bromine82

Copper bromide is used in lasers It is also used to add bromide ions to other chemical compounds in organic chemistry 

Fading Echoes is the 2nd book in the fourth Warriors series Omen of the Stars It includes another point of view in the story which is Ivypaw Dovepaws sister

This takes place around a fictional lake with an island over by the south side of it for Gatherings

Dovepaw learns to hone her ability to sense farther than any cat around the lake while her bond with Ivypaw dwindles in the middle of the story due to Dovepaw not being allowed to share her secret with any cat except for Lionblaze Jayfeather and eventually Firestar The reason for her being able to tell Firestar is this She senses Sedgewhisker one of the cats who had gone on the journey with and her patrol get attacked by dogs Sedgewhisker was the only cat hurt so she and Ivypaw go to see her but they get caught resulting in them being escorted back to their camp Firestar realizes that Dovepaw Lionblaze and Jayfeather are the Three in the prophecy that the series is centering around 

Tigerheart and Dovepaw try to make friends but can not as their duties keep them apart except for the Gathering Even then he does not reveal what he was doing on ThunderClan territory He gets close though

Later Dovepaw save most of the Clan from injuries by sensing a tree when it is about to fall The Clan evacuates but Longtail gets killed and Briarpaw later Briarlight gets her spine broken The four stories join together soon after

Jayfeather reads Mothwings mind and discovers that StarClan had made a good choice of RiverClan medicine cat after all then is cornered by Lionblaze who asks about the stick Jayfeather had broken He tells the story of the stick then they talk about the prophecy Later Dovepaw lets it slip and then the Three and Firestar talk about the prophecy and they then can work with him After this conversation Jayfeather discovers Tigerheart on ThunderClan territory then starts to question him trying to get answers 

He soon must care for Briarlight after a tree falls on her He goes to see Littlecloud for help and discovers that she has lost all feeling in her hind legs because the tree fell on her spine Later he tries to treat a perhaps deadly cough from her not being able to walk properly

Meanwhile he discovers that some cats in the Clans are being trained by Dark Forest cats meaning that the Three would soon have to fight the Dark Forest cats and their army

There the stories collide

Lionblaze trains his apprentice Dovepaw when she senses a WindClan patrol being attacked by dogs The next day Dovepaw makes a big blunder and lets slip how she knew about the patrol being attacked Firestar discovers then that they are the Three

After the Tigerheart on ThunderClan territory incident Lionblaze soon must help with the falling tree He helps to rebuild the camp with the materials that are now available with the tree having fallen

There the stories combine

Ivypaws story begins when she starts having dreams She is unknowingly being trained to be in the Dark Forests army and she gets stronger and quicker She has a row with Dovepaw and their bond starts to weaken 

Much later she has a sign that ShadowClan is going to take the territory up to Jayfeathers herbs and then the stories all combine

Ivypaw Dovepaw and Lionblaze all join into the major fight that happens as a result of Ivypaw and the tree climbing techniques come in handy for the battle ThunderClan wins the fight but each Clan loses a life Firestar loses his semifinal life Russetfur dies

Starlight is the fourth book in the second series of Warriors The New Prophecy

This book and all following books in this series takes place around a fictional lake The lake has a small island in the southern end of it and it has moorland pine forest deciduous forest marsh and some wooded area with more streams

A proposition is a term in philosophy and logic It is a sentence which says something is true or false The sentence must be a meaningful statement It must be possible to decide whether the proposition is true or not

It is possible to express the same proposition in many ways because a proposition is concerned with meaning not with the mode of expression

Two meaningful declarative sentences express the same proposition if and only if they mean the same thing This defines proposition in terms of synonymity For example Snow is white and Schnee ist wei are different sentences but they say the same thing so they express the same proposition

In Aristotelian logic a proposition is a particular kind of sentence one which affirms or denies a predicate of a subject Aristotelian propositions take forms like All men are mortal and Socrates is a man

In logical positivism a proposition whose truth value cannot possibly be decided is meaningless This would include statements about deities

Many modern philosophers take the view that statement and proposition are synonyms or ought to be

Karst is a geological system of rocks where water has eroded the bedrock If very extensive karst can be a geographical or topographical feature

Almost always karst is formed in carbonate rocks such as limestone or dolomite Since carbonate sedimentary rocks are very common karst areas occur all over the world

Many karst regions display distinctive surface features with sinkholes being the most common However karst surface features may be absent where the soluble rock is mantled such as by a non soluble rock strata on top of the carbonate strata Some karst regions include thousands of caves and the water is generally underground

The Innsbruck Medical University is a university in Innsbruck Austria It used to be one of the four historical faculties of the Leopold Franzens Universitt Innsbruck but it became an independent university in 2004

The medical tradition dates back long before the university began The first hospital began in the silver mining city of Schwaz nearby in 1307 Because people grew as years went by a medical faculty was added to the university begun in 1669 by Emperor Leopold I making it the first of its kind in the Alpine region

Dolomite is the name of a sedimentary carbonate rock and a mineral both composed of calcium magnesium carbonate CaMg2 found in crystals 

Dolomite rock is composed predominantly of the mineral dolomite Limestone that is partially replaced by dolomite is referred to as dolomitic limestone or in old US geologic literature as magnesian limestone Dolomite was first described in 1791 for exposures in what are now known as the Dolomite Alps of northern Italy

Gravel is small loose rock particles It is any loose rock that is larger than 2 mm in its smallest dimension and no more than 64 mm

Small gravel is composed of granules Large gravel is called pebbles 

Particles smaller than gravel are sand larger particles are cobbles

Gravel and sand are used for road surfaces and for cement and Tarmac Mixtures of gravel and sand mixed with various crushed material are known as aggregate in the trade This is used for drainage in the basement of roads and other purposes

Natural gravel comes from ancient beaches which have not consolidated In effect beaches from the Jurassic are dug up in quarries The material is then sifted into size categories The gravel and sand is then sold on to engineering companies Most natural sand and gravel is silica SiO2 in its chemistry This is very hard wearing

However if the material is originally in hard rock form then it is first crushed This enables the industry to offer other materials such as granite or limestone normally in rock form as gravel

The open cast mining and processing of gravel sand and aggregate is a huge world wide industry

There were many fights between the British East India Company and the Dutch East India Company just to get the monopoly of trade in other parts of the world

There was a series of arguments between the two companies over one island Singapore The tensions between the two countries nearly became a war

During the 19th century the trade between India and China became very profitable The British had Penang and Bencoolen as her ports to protect her ships from the strong weather in the sea However these two ports were of no match to Dutchs two ports which were closer to the Straits of Melaka the main trading route There were very little profits for the British because of this Therefore the British needed to find a new port to solve this problem

Sir Stamford Raffles arrived on the Singapore island in 1818 to set up a trading port to break the Dutch monopoly that they had Seeing that there was no Dutch flags on the island Raffles proceeded with signing the contract with the local ruler Sultan Hussein This contract allowed the British to be able to set up a port in Singapore in the south in exchange for a small sum of money

After the British signed a second contract to gain control over the whole island the Dutch complained to the British government that Singapore indirectly belonged to them as the main government was at the Malay Peninsular which also governs Singapore There were lots of discussions between the two countries Everyone was worried a war might break out

The Anglo Dutch treaty solved this problem The two companies traded their ports so that there is a line separating where the British and Dutch are

The spice route was a route between Asia and Europe 

A few hundred years ago the rich people wanted spices Spices did not grown in Europe so they had to be brought from Asia People made a route to go from Europe to Asia to buy spices The route was very difficult and so the spices were expensive People tried to find ways cheaper than the spice route like going the other way around the world This is how many things were discovered like the Western Hemisphere

Nuclear winter is a theory stating the possible effects of a nuclear war including reduced sunlight extreme cold and the presence of large amounts of smoke and soot in the Earths atmosphere

Mesons are incredibly small subatomic particles that are made of one quark and one antiquark Antiquarks are the antimatter counterpart of a regular quark meaning that in a fraction of a second the two quarks will annihilate each other Since antimatter quarks have the opposite spin of regular quarks their spins can cancel each other out which forms a particle similar to a Higgs Boson The name meson comes from Greek mesos meaning middle This refers to the fact that their predicted mass was between the known masses of a proton and a neutron

Mesons are Hadrons which simply means that they are made of quarks Since quarks have different fractional charges Mesons can have a charge However the charges of the quarks may cancel out forming an uncharged Meson The rest of the Hadron family are known as baryons which are made of three quarks Since quarks all have a spin of 12 three of them will never add up to an integer spin An integer spin is simply 0 1 or 2 Particles with an integer spin are called bosons which obey Bose Einstein Statistics This means that more than one boson can actually be in the same point in space at the same time However a Meson is made of one quark and one antiquark which each do not have an integer spin Particles which do not have an integer spin have a spin of 12 or 32 These particles with 12 spin are called Fermions because they obey Fermi Dirac Statistics This means that no more than one fermion can be in the same point in space at the same time All known baryons and quarks are fermions and all mesons are bosons This can get very confusing because this means that more than one meson can exist in the same point in space at the same time but the quarks that make up mesons cannot exist in the same point in space at the same time

The most common natural way that we find Mesons are through the interactions of cosmic rays with matter This process can be duplicated in particle accelerators which smash high energy quarks and antiquarks However the Mesons are very unstable and quickly turn into other particles Charged Mesons can decay into electrons and neutrinos and uncharged Mesons can decay into photons Since antimatter is destroying matter a large amount of energy is created The energy follows the equation Emc2

Metriacanthosaurids were a family of carnivorous theropod dinosaurs They tended to be large predators some growing to sizes of 30 ft Metriacanthosaurids are carnosaurs and many were initially classified within Megalosauridae or Allosauridae prior to recent analysis A gigantic tooth belonging to what most likely is a giant metriacanthosaurid has been described recently by Xu and Clarke

Cladistically Metriacanthosauridae was latest defined in 2005 by Paul Sereno as the most inclusive monophyletic group that contains Metriacanthosaurus parkeri and all species closer related to Metriacanthosaurus than to either Allosaurus fragilis Carcharodontosaurus saharicus or the House Sparrow It is likely that these theropods represent or are close to the ancestors of the allosaurs Metriacanthosauridae is often referred to as Sinraptoridae but Metriacanthosauridae is the correct name under ICZN rules since Metriacanthosaurus was the first member of the family to be described and named 

The cladogram presented here follows a study by Benson and colleagues in 2010

A wedding dress or wedding gown is the clothing worn by a bride during a wedding ceremony The color style and ceremonial importance of the gown can depend on the religion and culture of the bride

The origin of wedding dress is from the Roman Empire period When the Christian religion spread to Europe wedding ceremony was held the church and a bride wore a wedding dress In the middle ages all most wedding dresses were black with white veil because of religion It changed white dress and veil in the 1840s This style of dress spread to Asia when European culture came there

Slender line is a dress which is tight along a persons body The Mermaid line is similar to slender line It looks like a mermaid A line looks like an A from the waist to foot Like these today there are so many kinds of wedding dress

The veil is the most popular decoration It is used for covering the face or head of women There are special grobes People use various length grove suiting their dress A woman usually carries a small bunch of flowers called a bouquet

Belemnites are an extinct group of marine cephalopod similar in many ways to the modern squid and closely related to the modern cuttlefish 

Like them the belemnites possessed an ink sac but unlike the squid they possessed ten arms of roughly equal length and no tentacles

The belemnites are a monophyletic group of super order status with five orders 

The belemnites evolved from nautiloids which are the basal group of cephalopods Well formed belemnite guards can be found in rocks dating from the Mississippian

Belemnites were numerous during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods and their fossils are abundant in Mesozoic marine rocks often with their cousins the ammonites The belemnites and ammonites become extinct at the end of the Cretaceous period 

Like some modern squid belemnite arms carried a series of small hooks for grabbing prey Belemnites were efficient carnivores that caught small fish and other marine animals with their arms and ate them with their beak like jaws 

In turn belemnites appear to have formed part of the diet of marine reptiles such as Ichthyosaurs whose fossilized stomachs frequently contain hooks from the arms of cephalopods

Belemnites swam in near shore to mid shelf oceans

 Ancient ink  Fossils which preserve the soft parts of belemnites show that like many modern cephalopods they had an ink sac hard beaks tail fins and large eyes Well preserved specimens show evidence of muscular fibers in the mantle indicating that they were powerful swimmers like modern squids

In 1826 Mary Anning discovered what appeared to be a chamber containing dried ink inside a belemnite fossil She showed it to her friend Elizabeth Philpot who was able to revive the ink with water and use it to illustrate some of her own ichthyosaur fossils Other local artists were soon doing the same when more fossilised ink chambers were discovered Anning noted how closely the chambers resembled the ink sacs of modern squid and cuttle fish which she had dissected to better understand the anatomy of fossil cephalopods This led William Buckland to publish that Jurassic belemnites had used ink for defence just as many modern cephalopods do

Frank Fenner was an Australian scientist He was famous for his work on smallpox and the myxoma virus

Fenner was born in Ballarat Victoria in 1914 He studied for a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery at the University of Adelaide and graduated in 1938 In 1940 he completed a diploma in tropical medicine and 1942 he completed his Doctor of Medicine degree During World War II he joined the Australian Army as a doctor and studied the parasite that caused malaria

After the war he worked at Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne where he studied smallpox In 1949 he became the first professor of microbiology at the new Australian National University in Canberra His interest on research was the myxoma virus This virus was used to kill millions of rabbits that were destroying large areas of Australian grasslands and farms

In 1967 Fenner became the Director of the John Curtin School of Medical Research at ANU and also Chairman of the Global Commission for the Certification of Smallpox Eradication In 1973 he became director of the Centre for Resource and Environmental Studies at ANU

Cheonggyecheon is a stream bisecting down town Seoul South Korea This stream has a length of 584 km and its greatest width is 84m This stream is famous for restoration It was a sewer of Seoul in the Joseon Dynasty For half a century industrial era after the Korean War it had been entombed by pavement and had been a highway After the restoration Cheonggycheon has become an ecological park The restoration of Cheonggyecheon took three years spending almost 400 million Since its opening in 2005 hundreds of thousands of people have visited Cheonggyecheon with friends and family Many interesting events have been often held at Cheonggyecheon as well

It was originally called Gaecheon The Cheonggyecheon used to be a naturally formed stream before the Joseon Dynasty designated Seoul as its capital This stream caused a flood and inundated private houses in full spate In ordinary times it was unsanitary because of standing sewage therein Therefore King Taejong the third king of the Joseon Dynasty firstly beginned river training work by starting construction work for an open channel After that King Yeongjo the 21st king of the Joseon Dynasty conducted the overhaul of the stream in earnest by dredging the stream building stone banks and changing a waterway Due to this construction the curved waterway of the stream became straight one at last During the reign of King Sunjo and King Kojong the overhaul of the stream was continued There were 24 bridges over the stream

During the Japanese colonial period it came to get called Cheonggye as it is called today supposedly from 1914 when the colonialists rearranged stream names in Korea In this perion the large scale dredging of this stream was planned in terms of a modern urban planning by Japan but it wasnt carried out because of lack of funds Therefore the urban improvement project was neglected 

As a result by Koreas independence from Japan in 1945 the Cheonggyecheon was severely contaminated with wastes from flimsy shacks built alongside of the stream It had a fetid smell as well In terms of Seouls appearance and sanitation the then Cheonggyecheon was a serious problem The easiest way of solving this promblem was covering over the stream with concrete In 1958 finally the work to cover it up with concrete started as quickly as possible by August 1958 In addition a 56 km long 16 m wide elevated highway was completed over the stream in August 1971 after four working years

About 40 years after covering over the stream with concrete Seoul city had resuscitated the stream since July 2003 After 386 milion recovery project Cheonggyecheon was born again as a haven for wildlife as well as pedestrians in September 2005

The Blue Lias is a formation of rocks mostly in south west England and parts of south Wales It is part of the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site

It is part of the Lias Group The Blue Lias consists of a sequence of limestone and shale layers It was laid down in late Triassic and early Jurassic times between 195 and 200 million years ago The Blue Lias is famous for its fossils especially ammonites Also found were remains of a number of dinosaurs and the pterosaur Dimorphodon

The Blue Lias alternates between limestone and mudstone These alternations are caused by short term climatic variations thought to be caused by Milankovitch cycles The bluegrey colour is given by iron pyrite

A bit higher these limestone mudstone alternations change into a clay member The deposition of a clay rich mudstone member shows it was laid down in a deeper marine environment

The film used in photography is able to record images In order to make these images visible the film needs to undergo a number of chemical processes The result of these processes will either be negatives or slides This is generally known as developing Different films need different processes The process for black and white film is different from that for slide film In general the provess involves the following steps

There are different kinds of films The most common of these is negative film With negative film all colors are reversed This is corrected in an additional step of making a print of each image So called reversal film which is used for diapositives directly produces positive images 

This whole process is known as film processing

Mineral water is water obtained from rocks It is often collected from springs or from underground rivers when they emerge from the rocks Mineral waters are very clean and have no germs in Because they have been held in rocks for a long time they often contain chemicals that have come from the rocks This chemicals can give the water an interesting taste Some mineral waters may be good for health Because some underground water comes to the surface from very deep layers in the earth it can also have carbon dioxide gas dissolved in it This can make the water fizzy

Lotte Giants is a professional baseball team established in 1982 As we can see the name the company Lotte supports this team and Lotte Giants are based on the cities Busan Changwon Korea They are one of the original franchises of the Korea Baseball Organization league They have Sajik Baseball Stadium and Masan Baseball Stadium They represent KyungNam province So they dont give up the game and show very exciting play style Lotte Giants won the first place on 1984 1992 With enthusiastic Busan residents in 2008 2009 2010 Lotte Giants recode about 4 million spectators and that is the best record The passionate spectators develop their unique cheer cultures The symbol of this team is a gull which represents Busan where is a harbor place Passion and Endurance are the values which Busan and Lotte Giants share

With hot passon there were great pitchers in Lotte Giants In 1984 there was a pitcher Choi Dong Won who won the 4 games in Korean Series In 1992 there was Yeom Jong Seok who was a rookie but the ace pitcher and Yoon Hak Gil who was called lonely prince played very important role to win the first place Also there were burning hitters like Tank Park Jeong Tae Ma Po Ma Hae Young Mr Lotte Kim Min Ho Lotte Giants were not the strong team but always threatened the high class teams with their enthusiasm

After 90s franchise stars got retired as times went by Always they were the root of the team who kept the basement But the rookie players were not prepared for the change of the generation Also a manager Baek In Cheon was posted and he was not the right person to run the team So from the 2001 to 2004 Lotte Giants recoded the bottom place making the people in Busan people unhappy Lotte Giants recorded 8 8 8 8 5 7 7 and people from other team called Ggoldae which means Lotte is the bottom loser

Suddenly a foreign manager came to Lotte Giants His name is Jeron Kennis Royster simply Jerry His strategies was innovative and he gave courages to the players With his efforts he found out great players then he made Lotte Giants go into the Post Seasons Fans named this Royster Magic From 2008 to 2010 Lotte Giants got advanced to the Post Seasons and made Busan people be happy

For the enthusiastic fans players tried to give back their thankfulness But some players made some issues like driving a car after drinking alcohol or hit the person with his bat And Lotte company has a little negative images among the fans The fans should send their franchise stars almost without the farewell party The Lotte company sometimes paid low wages and it made the players depressed Royster was fired in this year because he could not won the first place The pro baseball is a business but fans are also important factor of the team And sometimes too enthusiastic fans made messy during the games so it should be controlled

In 2000 suddenly a player collapsed near the 2B His name is Im Soo Hyuk Due to the poor preparation he could not receive proper first aid then his brain got damaged After that he had stayed on the bed losing his consciousness Include Lotte Giants players many people volunteerily made a game or events for his medical expenses The fans also paid expenses for him Lotte Giants players remembered him and did the event every year It is impressive thing beyond the pro or business mind Even though he was death in this year 2010 Their sincere mind made many baseball fans moved

Choi Dong Won He was one of the legend in this team At that time his name value was as same as Sun Dong Ryeol one of the best pitcher in Korean Baseball league With his effort Lotte Giants won the first place in 1984

Kim Yong Hee He was the one of the best 3B player He is famous for gaining All Star rewards so his nickname is Mr All Star

Kim Min Ho From 1984 he played as a 4th hitter He was one of the power hitter in early 90s Lotte Giants He had his special form which was called a Jagalchi hitting form His nickname is Mr Lotte

Yeom Jong Seok In 1992 Lotte Giants won the Korean Series and there was a rookie pitcher who did the most important job at the stadium He was Yeom Jong Seok who threw very dynamic sliders But due to the hard work he had to receive surgeon Fans mention about him that pitchers should have given for their hard work Their shoulders are not the iron ones

Joo Hyung Kwang He was also one of the best rookie pitcher with his bright left hand Before Ryu Hyun Jin every recode which a rookie pitcher could do was made by this pitcher Like his name Hyung Kwang he was too bright to maintain his talent Also he was the ace pitcher who kept Lotte Giants in mid 90s

Park Jeong Tae He is the legend of Lotte Giants and his leadership and will to victory is the spirit of Busan and Lotte Giants He spoke that If you dont have passion you cannot wear the uniform of Giants His nickname is a Tank

Yoon Hak Gil He is the pitcher who always finished the game only his effort He pitched more than 100 games by himself He now becomes the head coach of Lotte Giants His nickname is a Lonely Prince

Ma Hae Young He was the next 4th hitter after Kim Min Ho In 1999 he was the center of the clean up trio and his hitting rate was 0375 and he lead his team to Korean Series However he worked as a member of the meeting for players right then Lotter company traded him to SamSung Lions His nickname is Ma Po

Jeon Joon Ho He was the fast runner who stole lots of 2B and 3B Big thief was his nick name and competed base stealing title with Lee Jong Bum He was one of the best leadoff of Lotte Giants

Kim Ueng Kook His name is similar to the popular star Kim Heung Kook so he got the nick name Horang Naby Between the leadoff and the clean up trio he successfully connected them doing the best job as a 2nd hitter He was the one of the best out fielder

GFAJ 1 is a strain of rod shaped extremophile bacteria in the family Halomonadaceae When it does not have any phosphorus it takes the usually poisonous element arsenic as a substitute 

Geomicrobiologist Felisa Wolfe Simon collected lake bottom sediments in the shallow waters of Mono Lake in California Wolfe Simon cultured the arsenic using organisms from this hypersaline and highly alkaline environment

Its discovery helps the idea that life on other planets may have to some extent a different chemical makeup from life on Earth

Life is mostly composed of the elements carbon hydrogen nitrogen oxygen sulfur and phosphorus Although these six elements make up nucleic acids proteins and lipids and thus the bulk of living matter it is possible in theory that some other elements in the periodic table could serve the same functions

Up until now it was believed that all life needed phosphorus as a basic piece of the backbone that holds DNA together Likewise ATP a key molecule in the cells energy cycle

The team has evidence that this bacterium can use arsenic instead of phosphorus in its DNA Their paper will be published in the journal Science on December 8 2010

Sewage treatment is the process of dealing with sewage so that is does not cause harm to people or to rivers Sewage flows in sewer from houses and factories When it arrives at a sewage treatment works it passes through many stages Larger works often have more stages than a smaller works

First large objects are removed using screens The sewage then flows through a tank so that sand can fall out If sand was not got rid of it would damage machines in the next stages 

Large tanks the allow solids to settle to the bottom Fat also floats to the top Both fats and solids are removed What is left is liquid which is sprinkled over deep tanks of rocks or pieces of plastic The rocks or plastic have bacteria and other very small animals and plants growing on them These bacteria use oxygen from the air to remove chemicals from the sewage In some sewage treatment sewage has air blown through it to create a thick brown mixture in which bacteria float in the mixture making the sewage more pure 

The liquid at the end of this stage flows into another large tank and the bacteria and other solids settle to the bottom The clean liquid on the top can then flow to a river or the sea but it may also need further treatment to make it cleaner The bacteria that have settled to the bottom of the tank can be re used to treat more sewage

This process makes lots of solids and these can be used to make methane gas and fertiliser for farmers fields

Vladimir Arnold was a Russian mathematician said to be one of the greatest mathematicians of the 20th century He worked in many areas of mathematics including dynamical systems differential equations hydrodynamics magnetohydrodynamics classical and celestial mechanics geometry topology algebraic geometry symplectic geometry and singularity theory

Arnold was born in Odessa Russia He worked at the Steklov Mathematical Institute in Moscow and later at the Moscow State University Arnold died in Paris after going there to seek medical treatment

Sewage is the liquid waste produced by us all when using the toilet having a bath or shower or washing clothes and dishes In some places it also includes rain water falling on houses and roads In big towns and cities it can also have liquid waste from factories in it It flows in pipes called sewers to be cleaned up at a sewage treatment works

Sewage is mostly water but it also has many germs some of which can be harmful It can have many chemicals in it which can also cause harm

Snowdonia is a region in north Wales It is also a national park of convert838sqmikm2 1 in area It was the first National Park in Wales and it was made in 1951

The English name for the area comes from Snowdon which is the highest mountain in Wales  In Welsh it is named Eryri 

Before the National Park was made Snowdonia used to refer to a much smaller area around Snowdon itself 

More than 26000 people live in Snowdonia It attracts over 6 million visitors every year 

Most of the land is either open or mountainous land but there is also some farm land

The River Teifi is a river in west Wales It starts in the hills above the town of Tregaron and then flows into a large marsh called Tregaron bog This bog helps to stop flow in the river being too extreme It stores up flood water when it is raining hard and it lets water go during dry weather

The water in the River Teifi is very good quality The river supports lots of wild life including Salmon and Trout The wildlife is so special that the whole river has been given special protetion by scientists to stop it being damaged

The river passes through small towns such as Lampeter and Newcastle Emlyn before it reaches the sea at Cardigan For the last few miles before it reaches Cardigan the river runs through a deep gorge called Cigerran Gorge Some people still fish for Salmon here using a very ancient boat called a Coracle

The River Ystwyth is a river in west Wales It starts in the hills between Rhayader and Ysbyty Ystwyth and flow into the sea at Aberystwyth Although the river looks very clean it has high levels of some metals such as lead zinc and silver These metals poison a lot of the wildlife so that only a few things live in some of the river These metals get into the river from old lead mines Nobody uses the mines any more but the waste material left behind still has lots of metal in it and this dissolves in rain and gets into the river

Knut was a polar bear who was born in captivity at the Berlin Zoo Because his mother rejected him when he was born he was raised by zookeepers People began to protest for him after a German newspaper called Bild Zeitung quoted an animal rights activist saying the young cub had to die Both children and adults supported him and e mails and letters asking the zoo to let the cub live were sent from around the world Because of his fame Knut became a tourist attraction and commercial success

Knut became very popular and the center of mass media attention called Knutmania Many toys DVDs and books were made about him This brought in lots of money about five million euros to Berlin Zoo in 2007 More people went to the zoo and that year was the most profitable year in its 163 year history

Knut was born at Berlin Zoo His mother was Tosca a 20 year old polar bear She was a circus performer from East Germany born in Canada and her 13 year old mate Lars was from a park in Munich Tosca gave birth to Knut and his unnamed brother on 5 December 2006 However she left her cubs on a rock in the polar bear enclosure and did not take care of them The zookeepers rescued the cubs with a fishing net but Knuts brother died from sickness four days later Knut was only the size of a guinea pig and had to spend the first 44 days of his life in an incubator before zookeeper Thomas Drflein began raising the cub

Drflein had to sleep on a mattress next to the cub at night because Knut needed care Drflein also had to play with bathe and feed the cub every day Knuts food began with a bottle of baby milk mixed with cod liver oil every two hours At four months old he could eat milk porridge mixed with cat food and vitamins Drflein also appeared with Knut on the twice daily one hour shows at the zoo Because of this he appeared in lots of videos and photographs with the cub and became well known in Germany He also won Berlins Medal of Merit in honor of his hard work and care for Knut Drflein died of a heart attack on 22 September 2008

In early March 2007 the German newspaper Bild Zeitung quoted the animal rights activist Frank Albrecht who said that Knut should be killed instead of humiliated by being raised in a zoo He declared that the zoo was breaking the rules of animal protection by keeping him alive Wolfram Graf Rudolf the director of the Aachen Zoo agreed with Albrecht He stated that the zookeepers should have had the courage to let the bear die A group of children protested at the zoo holding up signs that read Knut Must Live and We Love Knut Others sent emails and letters asking for the cubs life to be spared Threatening letters were also sent to Albrecht Berlin Zoo agreed to support the baby polar bear and promised not to harm him

Albrecht later claimed that he had quoted this because he wanted to change the law not to have the bear killed The publicity from this coverage raised Knuts profile from national to international

On 23 March 2007 Knut appeared in public for the first time About 400 journalists visited Berlin Zoo on what was called Knut Day to make reports all over the world Because Knut became famous when he was very young many wrong stories about the cubs health were spread around during his first year For example on 16 April 2007 Knut took a break from his display because of teething pains but reports said that he might have an unknown sickness There were also many death threats like the one sent on Wednesday 18 April 2007 The zoo received an anonymous letter by fax which said Knut ist tot Donnerstag Mittag The police increased the bears security

In November 2007 Knut weighed over 90 kg and became too dangerous to be cared for closely Hundreds of children attended the cubs first birthday celebration This party was also shown live on German television The national mint also made 25000 special silver coins for his birthday When Flocke a female polar bear was born at the Nuremberg Zoo in December 2007 Bild named her Mrs Knut suggesting that the two German born polar bears might become mates

A year after his public debut Knut was reported as weighing more than 130 kg Very strong six inch glass was put up between him and the zoo visitors At the end of March 2008 Markus Rbke one of the zookeepers who helped raise Knut said the bear should leave the zoo to help him get used to living alone Rbke also said that Knut misses Thomas Drflein who was like a father to him and that he cries when no one is near him Knut needs an audience Rbke said That has to change

In July 2008 it was announced that the Neumnster Zoo in northern Germany which owns Knuts father sued Berlin Zoo for the money that came from Knuts success Neumnster had tried to be friendly with Berlin Zoo at first but now was trying to use the court to make them give part of the money that came from Knut Peter Drwa the zoo director at Neumnster said that they do not want to remove Knut from his environment but we have a right to our request for money Shortly before Knuts second birthday there were reports being spread that the bear would have to move to another zoo because he was getting too large for his enclosure However the zoo said that they still wanted to keep Knut

Disputes between the two zoos continued into 2009 On 19 May Berlin Zoo offered to buy Knut from Neumnster and take their financial claim on the two year old polar bear Although Neumnster Zoo set a price of 700000 Berlin Zoo stated that they would not pay a cent more than 350000 On 8 July the Berlin Zoo agreed to pay 430000 to keep Knut in Berlin

Giovanna a female polar bear about the same age as Knut went to Berlin from Munichs Hellabrunn Animal Garden in September 2009 She shared Knuts enclosure for a short time while her regular home had repairs Her arrival interested people from all over the world because many sources thought the two bears would soon be dating However in March 2010 the German chapter of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals called for Giovanna to stay somewhere else Knut and Giovanna share a grandfather and PETA spokesperson Frank Albrecht thought the same person who had claimed that Knut should be killed would threaten the German polar bear population if they might breed The Berlin Zoo did not respond but noted that Giovannas stay in Berlin was only for a short time In August 2010 Giovanna was moved back to Munich after repairs to her enclosure were finished

Knut died on 19 March 2011 because of a brain disease He had encephalitis The swelling was probably caused by a virus and caused an epileptic fit After death the body of the bear was a subject of further study at the Berlin Museum of Natural History

Berlin Zoo made Knut a trademark in late March 2007 As a result its shares became even higher Knut earned Berlin Zoo nearly 5 million that year

Many companies made cuddly toys modeled from Knut Steiff a toy company made Knut based stuffed animals in three sizes and models sitting standing and lying down They all sold out at the Berlin Zoo in only four days The money was used to improve the bears home Candy company Haribo sold a raspberry flavored gummy bear sweet called Cuddly Knut beginning in April 2007 They promised to give ten cents to the zoo for every package of Knut sweets it sold The gummy bears sold very quickly as well

Knut has been the subject of several popular songs in Germany such as the singles Knut is Cute and Knut der kleine Eisbr by nine year old Kitty In Britain musical comedian Mitch Benn has performed three songs about Knut for BBC Radio 4 satirical series The Now Show The Baby Bear Must DIE Knut Isnt Cute Anymore and Goodbye KnutGoodbye Knut was about Knut moving to the Neumnster Zoo Knut has also been in several DVDs including one titled KnutStories from a Polar Bears Nursery He appeared on the 29 March 2007 cover of the German Vanity Fair magazine which was about the bears life

On 1 May 2007 it was announced that New York based Turtle Pond Publications and Berlin Zoo had signed a deal for the worldwide publishing rights to Knut with the hopes of raising global warming issues Written by Craig Hatkoff and his daughters the 44 page book entitled Knut der kleine Eisbrenjunge is about Knuts life story as well as photographs Although books about Knut had already been published in Germany this book was the first to be authorized by the Berlin Zoo

The book was published in Germany by Ravensburger on 26 July 2007 After that the US publishing company Scholastic made an English version Knut How one little polar bear captivated the world

On 31 December 2007 the zoos director said that the zoo had received a proposal for a film deal from Hollywood film producer Ash R Shah to make an animated film about the bears life Shah reportedly suggested a 35 million film deal to the zoo The German film Knut und seine Freunde was shown in Berlin on 2 March 2008 Directed by Michael Johnson the film was about how Knut was rescued after his mother did not take care of him

Dr Gerald Uhlich of Berlin zoo stated that Knut draws attention to the environment in a nice way As a result the German Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel adopted Knut as the mascot for a conference about endangered species Gabriel met with Knut soon after his zoo debut and said that although Knut was safe worldwide polar bears are in danger and if Knut can help the cause then that is a good thing

Photographer Annie Leibovitz took pictures of Knut that were used for an environmental campaign The polar bear has also been on the logo for the German Environment Ministers campaign to help stop global warming and a 2008 stamp The stamp shows the roughly one year old Knut with the slogan Natur weltweit bewahren

The Freshwater Biological Association often shortened to the FBA is a British charity started in 1929 It aims are to promote freshwater biology It publishes identification keys to freshwater plants and animals throughout the world and also maintains a library of freshwater science 

Membership is open to anyone who is interested in freshwater science The Associations main offices are in Far Sawrey on the banks of Windermere in Cumbria

Freshwater biology is the study of plants and animals that live in freshwater This includes rivers lakes ponds marshes and other bodies of water It is part of the branch of science called Limnology

Much freshwater biology takes place in man made places such as sewage treatment works and water treatment works In these places water is purified using plants and animals Keeping them work as hard as possible helps to make the water as clean as possible

In recent times freshwater biologists have been looking at how plants and animals change in the autumn and spring This is helping us to understand more about the effects of climate change

Halophiles are organisms that require salt in their environment to live Halophiles live in evaporation ponds or salt lakes such as Great Salt Lake Owens Lake or Dead Sea The name halophile comes from Greek for salt loving 

Whereas most halophiles are categorized within the Archaea domain certain bacteria and eukaryotes are also halophiles such as the alga Dunaliella salina 

 Lifestyle  Most halophilic and all salt tolerant organisms use energy to remove salt from their cytoplasm Normally organisms living around a lot of salt would lose water and die because of osmosis Water inside the organism would move from inside the cell to its outside environment This is because there is always movement of water to reach a state where the concentrations of salt are the same on both sides of the cell membrane

To survive the cytoplasm of halophiles must be isotonic with its environment To get to this state halophiles use two different methods In the first organic compounds are stored in the cytoplasm These compounds help the organism survive stress of osmosis The most commonly used solutes for this process are neutral and include amino acids and sugars Advantages to this method are that organisms could live in a wider range of salt concentrations than in the adaption below Also the proteins not exposed to high salt levels do not have to adapt to high salt levels An important disadvantage to this method is that it requires the organism to use much more energy then the adaption below 

The second less common adaptation involves the selective intake of potassium ions into the cytoplasm In exchange the organism pumps sodium ions out with the help of the sodium potassium pump Ions of sodium may be used instead of potassium but potassium is the most common This adaptation is only used by one order of bacteria and one family of Archaea An advantage to this method is that it uses much less energy than the adaption above The main disadvantage to this adaption is that all of the machinery inside the cell must be adapted to high levels of non organic ions and high salt levels This is much more demanding than the compatible solute adaptation described above

Most halophilic organisms only use one of the two methods but a few halophiles can use both

Halophiles are categorized by the levels of salt at which they grow best Halophiles can either be categorized as slight halophiles moderate halophiles or extreme halophiles Slight halophiles grow best in concentrations of salt around 2 to 5 An example of a slight halophile is Erythrobacter flavus Slight halophiles live in mud on the ocean floor in seawater and in garden soil

Moderate halophiles grow best in concentrations of salt around 5 to 20 Examples of moderate halophiles are organisms in the genera Desulfovibrio Desulfocella Desulfohalobium and Desulfotomaculum Moderate halophiles live in marine salterns saline lakes in matter at the bottom of the sea and in oil brine fields

Extreme halophiles grow best in concentrations of salt from 20 to 30 Examples of extreme halophiles are Salinibacter ruber and organisms in the Halobacteria class Extreme halophiles live in the Dead Sea in the Middle East and in man made solar salterns

Halophiles play an important part in ecosystems For example halophiles often support entire populations of wild birds 

Halophiles are useful for cleaning up polluted environments Waste water with salt concentrations more than 2 is ideal for halophiles to remove organic pollutants from For instance halophiles have been shown to remove phenol from their environments This could lead to future use in cleaning up oil spills

Halophiles play an important part in the fermentation of some foods For instance halophiles ferment soy and fish sauces Halophiles also ferment salted fish

In biotechnology Halophilic microorganisms are useful in biotechnology The compounds that certain halophiles make are valuable Some of these compounds are not found anywhere else in the living world The salt tolerant enzymes that halophiles produce can be used in a variety of ways For example these enzymes could be used for rough industrial processes like food processing

Some moderate halophiles produce sugars outside the cell These sugars can be used as thickeners and emulsifiers in the petroleum and medicine industries

Owens Lake is a mostly dry lake in the eastern Sierra Nevada of Inyo County California located about convert5mikm1 south of Lone Pine California Unlike most dry lakes in the Basin and Range Province that have been dry for thousands of years Owens held water until 1924 Today some of the flow of the river has been restored and the lake now has some water

Dunaliella salina is a type of halophile pink micro algae found in sea salt fields Dunaliella salina is used in cosmetics and dietary supplements Few organisms can survive in such highly saline conditions as salt evaporation ponds To survive these organisms have high concentrations of beta carotene to protect against light and high concentrations of glycerol to provide protection against osmotic pressure This offers an opportunity for commercial biological production of these substances

Scarification or cicatrization is a form of body modification where a design or pattern is cut etched or scratched into human skin to make a permanent scar Like with most body modification there are many reasons why people choose to be scarified The act of scarifying has been compared to tattooing due to the fact that it permanently changes the skin It has also been identified with self harm because people have used it to cover self inflicted wounds 

Scarification began as cultural identification in some places especially in Maori and African societies Other cultures may use it for religious reasons and nearly all cultures use it for aesthetics Some people also use scarification for pleasure as the process of being scarified creates endorphins

Haloarchaea are protists and members of the halophile community They need a high salt concentrations to grow They are a distinct evolutionary branch of the Archaea and are extremophiles

The term halobacteria is a misnomer because we now know the archaea are a different group from bacteria

In taxonomy the Haloarchaea are a class of the Euryarchaeota found in water with salt They are common in most environments where large amounts of salt moisture and organic material are available

Cowbirds are birds of the genus Molothrus They are brood parasites similar in life style to the Cuckoo The entire family Icteridae is limited to the New World

They lay their eggs in the nests of other birds The birds whose nest is used by the cowbird is tricked into raising the young cowbirds

These birds feed on insects including those stirred up by cattle They lay their eggs in other birds nests This means that the birds can more easily stay with the herd

The Brown headed Cowbird has over 220 hosts The other cowbird species have fewer known hosts but all the species are generalists when it comes to choosing a host This means that the eggs may look different from the hosts eggs

Duchess Elisabeth of Bavaria was the wife of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria

Born in Munich Bavaria into the royal family of Wittelsbach she was the fourth of ten children of Prince Maximilian of Bavaria and his wife Princess Ludovika Known as Sissi she grew up in a warm and convivial family atmosphere with her brothers and sisters at Possenhofen Castle In August 1853 she went to Bad Ischl with her mother and older sister Helene to celebrate Austrian Emperor Franz Josephs 23rd birthday The event was also supposed to be the occasion to announce his engagement to Helene but Franz Joseph was so taken by the young and beautiful Elisabeth that he proposed to her instead 

They were married in great pomp in Vienna on April 24 1854 The couple had four children Sophie Gisele Rudolf and Valerie Franz Joseph and Elisabeth became King and Queen of Hungary in 1867 when the two country joined together and created the Austro Hungarian Empire  

Suffering from lung disease and melancholia and disliking the strict etiquette of the court Empress Elisabeth was often away and lived long period of time abroad notably at her villa in Corfu 

Her only son Rudolf committed suicide in 1889 after killing his young mistress Marie Vetsera Empress Elisabeth was assassinated by an Italian anarchist in 1898 while on a visit to Geneva 

She has since become something of an historical icon and highly romantic figure through a serie of films called Sissi in the 1950s featuring actress Romy Schneider

The Firmicutes are a phylum of bacteria most of which have Gram positive type cell walls structure

The Proteobacteria are a major phylum of bacteria 

They are Gram negative bacteria This means they do not retain the violet dye in the Gram staining protocol 

In a Gram stain test a counterstain is added after the crystal violet colouring all Gram negative bacteria with a pink colour 

The test itself is useful in classifying two distinct types of bacteria based on the structural differences of their cell walls

Proteobacteria include a wide variety of pathogens such as Escherichia coli Salmonella Vibrio Helicobacter and many other notable genera 

Others are free living and include many of the bacteria responsible for nitrogen fixation The group is defined primarily in terms of ribosomal RNA sequences

Most members are facultatively or obligately anaerobic chemoautotrophs and heterotrophic but there are numerous exceptions

There are alphaproteobacteria in this phylum which are widely found in marine plankton They may constitute over 10 of the open ocean microbial community

Colour is the British spelling of color Color is the US spelling of a word meaning hue

Necrosis is a medical condition in which parts of a persons body die turn black and fall off This happens when the there is not enough blood reaching the tissues This can happen for many reasons including injury poisons bacteria or radiation damage The dead tissue will not grow back

Mistaken Point Ecological Reserve is one of the worlds greatest fossil sites It is part of Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada

Mistaken Point was so named because sailors found it a navigational hazard on the foggy tip of Newfoundlands Avalon Peninsula The site is on Canadas Tentative List for proposed UNESCO World Heritage Sites No one can visit the fossil site without an official guide collecting actual fossils may not be done

The fossils are in Mistaken Points tilted and faulted mudstone and sandstone They are exposed visible on the surface They are part of the Ediacaran biota the oldest complex life forms The Ediacaran is the last period in the Proterozoic eon They date to 575 to 542 million years ago when all life was in the sea

The Reserve is the only place in the world where you can see a 565 million year old sea floor which preserves the ecology of these ancient deep sea communities

This lagersttte includes over 30 types of ancient creatures most of them extinct groups unknown in our modern world

 The palaeoecology  The creatures lived on the bottom of a deep ocean below the depths that light could reach What is now Newfoundland was then between latitudes 4065 South 

The imprints of the soft bodied animals were preserved in place on the muddy sea floor when they were suddenly buried by repeated volcanic ash falls The ash layers contain zircon which makes it possible for geologists to accurately date the fossil layers by radiometric dating Fossils of similar age are found in Russia and Australia but the variety found at Mistaken Point make the site unique

A period in geology is a main subunit of an era

Thus the Mesozoic era is divided into three periods the Triassic the Jurassic and the Cretaceous These periods are then futher subdivided into stages

Metric time is a way of measuring how long a period of time is using the metric system The metric system uses the second as a main unit of time There are periods of time that are based on the second but shorter They are named with metric prefixes Some of these are kiloseconds and milliseconds Other units of time like the minute hour and day are accepted for use with the modern metric system but are not part of it

The metric system was first used in France in 1795 It had units for length area dry volume liquid capacity weight or mass and even amounts of money but not for time Decimal time of day had been first used in France two years earlier but was set aside at the same time the metric system was started and did not follow the metric pattern of a base unit and prefixed units James Clerk Maxwell and Elihu Thomson came up with the Centimetre gram second system of units in 1874 The ephemeris second was made one of the original base units of the modern metric system or International System of Units at the 10th General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1954 The SI second was later made even more exact It was made into the time of 9192631770 periods of the radiation from the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium 133 atom

People have had ideas for other base units of metric time On March 28 1794 Joseph Louis Lagrange the president of the commission which developed the metric system wrote a report to the commission His report suggested the names dci jour and centi jour Base units that are decimal divisions of the day such as 110 1100 11000 or 1100000 day or other divisions of the day such as 120 or 140 day have also been suggested with names such as tick meck chi chron moment etc These other units have not caught on with people however

In computing metric time became widely used because it is easy to use with computers Unix time gives date and time as the number of seconds since January 1 1970 and Microsofts FILETIME as multiples of 100ns since January 1 1601 VAXVMS uses the number of 100ns since November 17 1858 and RISC OS the number of centiseconds since January 1 1900

The main problem with metric time is in the units The International System of Units has only come up with prefixes for 10 units exponentially in both the multiple and submultiple directions The first three multiples would be viable for use within a metric time system they are 101 102 and 103 respectively However the fourth value in the SI Units is 106 Followed by 109 a relatively nonviable unit with which to measure human timelife To make this system of prefixes work for metric time standard units and prefixes would have to be made for the 4th and 5th exponents to make metric time work for talking about time of human life These would be

104 seconds

105 seconds

The Chondrostei are a sub class of ray finned fish the Actinopterygii They include the sturgeons huge fish which provide caviar

The Chondrostei are mainly cartilaginous fish with some ossification There are 52 species divided among two orders The orders are the Acipenseriformes and the Polypteriformes 

This group has at times been classified with the sharks the similarities are obvious not only do the chondrosteans mostly lack bone the structure of the jaw is more akin to that of sharks than other bony fish Both lack scales Additional shared features include spiracles and in sturgeons a heterocercal tail However the fossil record suggests that these fish have more in common with the Teleostei than their external appearance might suggest

It is thought that the ancestors of the chondrosteans were bony fish but that this characteristic was lost in later evolutionary development resulting in a lightening of the frame Elderly chondrosteans show beginnings of ossification of the skeleton which suggests that this process is delayed rather than lost in these fish

In the early Mesozoic a number of fish families were beginning to develop adaptations which would make them lighter faster and more efficient predators Chondrosteans took a radical approach Cartilage is lighter than bone and they delayed the development of bone so that it only developed in elderly fish They lost the upper jaw bones completely Other changes allowed them to shoot the jaw forwards to grab prey

Why did Chondrosteans react with such total reorganization Obviously selection pressure must have been very strong However in one way they were almost unique Rarely amongst animals they underwent polyploidy several times Instead of two sets of chromosomes the Chondrosteans have 8 or 16 sets of chromosomes Such a dramatic genetic change may have given the potential for a rapid drastic reorganization of the body plan

A lifeboat also known as a liferaft is a small stiff or inflatable boat carried for emergencies in the event of a disaster on a ship Lifeboats are required by law to be on larger ships

At the beginning of the 20th century larger ships meant that more people could travel but rules about lifeboats were often overlooked After the Titanic sunk on April 15 1912 people realized that more lifeboats were needed on larger ships The Titanics lifeboats were only capable of carrying 1178 people although the number of passengers on the Titanic were 3330 people

Because many lifeboats were needed on the decks of passenger ships this led to the use of most of the deck space being used for lifeboats which created the problem of narrow passageways This was fixed by inflatable lifeboats being used

Overpopulation means that there are too many organisms of a certain species in a certain habitat This means that the number of organisms living there is larger than the carrying capacity of the habitat The habitat cannot support these numbers over time without hurting itself

The term overpopulation is most often used to refer to the number of humans living on Earth

The worlds population has greatly increased in the last 50 years mainly due to medical advances and agricultural productivity Steve Jones head of the biology department at University College London has said 

The recent rapid increase in human population over the past two centuries has raised concerns that humans are beginning to overpopulate the Earth The planet may not be able to sustain larger numbers of people The population has been growing since the end of the Black Death around the year 1400 At the beginning of the 19th century it had reached roughly 1000000000 The industrial revolution and green revolutions led to rapid population growth all over the world By 1960 the world population had reached 3 billion and it doubled to 6 billion over the next four decades As of 2011 the estimated annual growth rate was 110 down from a peak of 22 in 1963 and the world population stood at roughly 69 billion 

Current projections show a steady decline in the population growth rate with the population expected to reach between 8 and 105 billion between the year 2040 and 2050

The scientific consensus is that the present population growth and increase in use of resources is a threat to the ecosystem The InterAcademy Panel Statement on Population Growth called the growth in human numbers unprecedented and stated that many environmental problems such as rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide global warming and pollution were made worse by the population expansion At the time the world population stood at 55 billion and optimistic scenarios predicted a peak of 78 billion by 2050 a number that current estimates show will be reached around 2030

Pharmacoepidemiology studies the use and effects of drugs on large groups of people and patients It assesses probability of beneficial and adverse effects and risks for humans while using a particular drug 

Pharmacoepidemiology bridges pharmacology and epidemiology and borrows their methodology from both of them It uses descriptive epidemiological method by describing exposure to a drug and by calculating rates eg incidence and prevalence Such descriptive method generates hypothesis about influence of the drug but does not test it Pharmacoepidemiology also uses analytic epidemiological method by means of observation and experimentation The analytic study compares an exposed group with a control group and serves as testing of the hypothesis 

Pharmacoepidemiology provides pharmacovigilance the later is a type of continual monitoring of unwanted effects and other safety related aspects of drugs in current growing integrating markets Pharmacovigilance is conducted by spontaneous reporting systems through health care professionals and others which report adverse drug reactions to the central agency The central agency combines reports from many sources to produce a more informative profile for drug products

Ian Kevin Curtis was the singer of the band Joy Division He was born in Stretford Lancashire and grew up in Macclesfield Cheshire He suffered with epilepsy and hanged himself in 1980 after the disease became rather severe

In biology the carrying capacity of an environment is the number of organisms that can live there without harming the environment If too many organisms live in an environment it is called overpopulation

The carrying capacity of an environment can change and humans can have an effect on the carrying capacity Some things that can change an environments carrying capacity are pollution and the use of natural resources

Auto Tune is a proprietary audio processor made by Antares Audio Technologies Auto Tune uses a phase vocoder to fix pitch in vocal and instrumental performances It is used to hide out of tune singing and mistakes It lets singers perform perfectly tuned vocal tracks without needing to sing in tune Its main purpose is to slightly bend sung pitches to the nearest true semitone Auto Tune can also be used as an effect to distort the human voice when pitch is raisedlowered a lot

Auto Tune can be used as a plug in for professional audio multi tracking suites used in a studio setting and as a stand alone rack mounted unit for live performance processing Auto Tune has become standard equipment in professional recording studios

Auto Tune was first created by Andy Hildebrand an engineer working for Exxon Hildebrand developed methods for interpreting seismic data and then realized that the technology could be used to detect analyze and modify pitch

Auto Tune was used for vocal effects on Chers Believe recorded in 1998 This was the first major hit song to use the software for this purpose At first the sound engineers claimed that they had used a vocoder in what Sound on Sound said was an attempt to keep a trade secret After the massive success of Believe many artists copied the technique which became known as the Cher Effect It can be heard in songs of the late 1990s and early 2000s Some notable examples are Gigi DAgostinos La Passion and Janet Jacksons US Number 1 hit All For You Auto Tune became famous again in the mid 2000s when RB singer T Pain made active use of it in his songs This technique has been copied by many other modern RB and pop artists including Usher Beyonce Rihanna and Justin Bieber T Pain has even had an iPhone App named after him that copies the effect called I Am T Pain

The Boston Herald revealed that country music stars Faith Hill and Tim McGraw have both said they are using Auto Tune in performance They said it is a safety net that guarantees a good performance Sara Evans John Michael Montgomery and Gary LeVox of the group Rascal Flatts also use Auto Tune to fix pitch problems However other country music singers such as Loretta Lynn Allison Moorer Trisha Yearwood Vince Gill Garth Brooks Martina McBride and Patty Loveless have refused to use Auto Tune

YouTube musical group The Gregory Brothers have joined their original music tracks with Auto Tuned versions of mundane evening news video clips making fun of everyone from President Barack Obama to Antoine Dodson The popularity of their YouTube channel led the Gregory Brothers to release many of their songs on iTunes

In 2002 the CD Miss Fortune by singer songwriter Allison Moorer was released with a sticker stating that Absolutely no vocal tuning or pitch correction was used in the making of this record At the 51st Grammy Awards in early 2009 the band Death Cab for Cutie wore blue ribbons to protest the use of Auto Tune in the music industry Later that spring Jay Z named the lead single of his album The Blueprint 3 as DOA Jay Z said that far too many people had jumped on the Auto Tune bandwagon and that the trend had become a gimmick Christina Aguilera appeared in public in Los Angeles on August 10 2009 wearing a T shirt that read Auto Tune is for Pussies However when interviewed by SiriusXM she said that Auto Tune wasnt bad if used in a creative way She said her album Bionic uses the technology and highlighted Elastic Love being a product of it

Opponents of the plug in argue Auto Tune people will not treat musicians with respect in they need help to stay in tune A Chicago Tribune report from 2003 states that many successful mainstream artists in most genres of musicperhaps a majority of artistsare using pitch correction 

In 2004 The Daily Telegraph music critic Neil McCormick called Auto Tune a particularly sinister invention that has been putting extra shine on pop vocals since the 1990s by taking a poorly sung note and transposing it placing it dead center of where it was meant to be

In 2009 Time magazine quoted an unnamed Grammy winning recording engineer as saying Lets just say Ive had Auto Tune save vocals on everything from Britney Spears to Bollywood cast albums And every singer now presumes that youll just run their voice through the box The same article hoped that pops fetish for uniform perfect pitch will fade commenting that pop music songs are sounding the same as track after track has perfect pitch Timothy Powell a producerengineer stated in 2003 that he is even starting to see vocal tuning devices show up in concert settings he states that Thats more of an ethical dilemmapeople pay a premium dollar to see artists and artists want people to see them at their best 

The American television series Glee uses Auto Tune in its songs E Onlines Joal Ryan criticized the show for its overproduced soundtrack in particular complaining that many songs rely too heavily on the software

In 2010 there was controversy when British television reality TV show The X Factor had been accused of using Auto Tune to improve the voices of contestants especially Gamu Nhengu Simon Cowell ordered a ban on Auto Tune for future episodes

Baryons are composite particles which are made of three quarks Since all quarks have a spin of 12 a baryon will always have a spin of either 12 or 32 The 32 spin baryons are extremely unstable and only live for 10 23 seconds After that they will jump down to a lower energy state by releasing photons containing energy These 32 spin baryons are known as higher energy resonances the lowest energy state of a baryon is a simple 12 spin

All particles with 12 spin are called fermions which obey Fermi Dirac statistics This basically means that no two fermions can be in the same point in space at the same time This is not true for the other type of subatomic particle called a boson More than one boson like a photon can exist in the same point in space at the same time 

Baryons are part of a larger collection of subatomic compounds called Hadrons Hadrons are simply particles made of quarks The other type of Hadron is called a meson

The name baryon comes from Greek barys meaning heavy

The Upper Triassic or Late Triassic is an epoch in the Mesozoic era It was between about 230 and 200 million years ago It was the last of three epochs which make up the Triassic period

The other two periods of time that make up the Triassic are usually called the Lower and Middle Triassic 

Many early dinosaur species appeared for the first time during the Upper Triassic including Plateosaurus Coelophysis and Eoraptor Pterosaurs were common in the air and Ichthyosaurs dominated the seas

Fondue is a Swiss meal taken in an pot over a small burner by some men and women round a table The word comes from the French word naming an operation fondre

Long stemmed forks are used to put bits of food into a warm and liquid sauce The sauce is warmed by a wax or alcohol burner 

Cheese fondue with bits of bread is most frequent however there are other sauces and other bits to put in the sauce Bread meat or plants are cut into small bits and used

A great number of men and women believe that fondue is a very old country way to make food of hard cheese and hard bread Both Swiss and French men and women make fondue from the old time It is most likely first made in the Jura mountains

The oldest certain directions for making fondue used eggs and came from Vaud in the early 19th century A great number of Swiss places and towns came up with very special directions for making fondue based on cheeses wines and other substances of the town 

Fondue became pleasing to a great number of men and women in the United States through the late 1960s and early 1970s

In addition to the bread and cheese there are side plates of garlic pickled cucumber onions and olives

To give a special quality of taste the caquelon is first rubbed with a cut garlic Wine and cheese are added and heated and moved till they are warm and liquid A small amount of starch is added to join the substances Some strong alcohol from cherries is added just before bringing it to the table

The most common directions use 1 decilitre of dry white wine and 200 grams of cheese for every man and woman The cheese is a mix of hard cheese and semi hard

A cheese fondue would be kept at a temperature warm enough to keep the fondue smooth and liquid but not at a great heat to cause burning 

If the temperature is good there will be a thin hard cover of toasted cheese at the lowest part of the caquelon 

This is the la religieuse It has the structure of a thin cracker and is lifted out and every man and woman is given a bit In Switzerland sometimes boys and girls fight over the burnt cheese at the lowest part of the caquelon

Fondue Bourguignonne is named after Burgundy in France Fondue Bourguignonne uses a pot of heated oil to cook Bits of meat are put into the oil to quickly cook them A number of sauces are made ready on the side The earliest statments of this dish seem to have been made in the 1950s

Fondue Chinoise uses a pot of heated liquid to cook Thin bits of meat are put into a very warm thin meat soup As with a Fondue Bourguignonne a number of sauces are made ready on the side At the end of the meal the liquid from the pot is drunk as a thick soup

Chocolate Fondue was first made in the 1960s Slices of fruit or cake are put in a pot of warm liquid chocolate

It would not be good to touch the fork with your tongue because the fork will go back into the common pot At a meat fondue one uses a second fork to take meat off the fork that goes into the common pot 

In Switzerland what has been done for a long time is that if a bit of bread is lost in the cheese by a man he gives money for a bottle of wine If it is lost by a woman she kisses the man at her left

The case drew particular public attention because the arrests were on the day after a large protest of proposed legislation to expand United States legal authority against foreign piracy websites Shortly afterward the Department of Justices website and a number of other organisations websites were taken offline following concerted denial of service attacks from activist group Anonymous 

A group spokesperson described the attacks as the single largest Internet attack in the groups history in an interview adding that it was a terrible case of happenstance that federal agents went after Megaupload only hours after the thousands of sites protesting in an anti SOPA blackout went back online Web surfers were by and far ready to defend an open Internet the feds could not have chosen a worse time to take down Megaupload He noted that from commencement until the point the governments web servers were offline was a mere 70 minutes

Besides the Department of Justices justicegov the Denial of Service attack included Universal Music Group Recording Industry Association of America Motion Picture Association of America Broadcast Music Inc and the website of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Even without SOPA having been passed yet the federal government always had tremendous power to do some of the things that they want to do So if this is what can occur without SOPA being passed imagine what can occur after SOPA is passed Brown told RT Anonymous also attacked the website of Frances anti piracy organisation 

On 19 January 2012 Anonymous released a statement on Pastebincom accepting responsibility of the mass attacks on websites including those of RIAA MPAA BMI FBI and others

Tanganyika is the mainland part of Tanzania

From 9 December 1961 to 26 April 1964 it was an independent state 

It was an East African territory lying between the Indian Ocean and the African Great Lakes Lake Victoria Lake Malawi and Lake Tanganyika 

Once part of the larger colony of German East Africa it comprised todays Rwanda Burundi and Tanzania but not Zanzibar

After World War I the parts that are todays Rwanda and Burundi became a League of Nations mandate governed by Belgium The major part however came under British rule and was transferred to Britain under the 1919 Treaty of Versailles This was confirmed by a League of Nations Mandate in 1922 later becoming a United Nations Trust Territory Britain changed the name to the Tanganyika Territory

On 9 December 1961 Tanganyika became independent as a Commonwealth Realm and on 9 December 1962 it became the Republic of Tanganyika within the Commonwealth of Nations In 1964 it joined with the islands of Zanzibar to form the United Republic of Tanganyika and Zanzibar later in the year changed to the United Republic of Tanzania

Nicola Pisano was an Italian sculptor who is best known for the works that he made for Pisa Cathedral At a time when most artists worked in the Gothic style Nicola was influenced by the Ancient Roman sculpture that he saw at Pisa and copied the style into his own work For this reason Nicola Pisano is sometimes said to be to be the founder of modern sculpture

 Works 

Nicola Pisanos birthdate and exact birthplace are unknown A document in the archives of Siena Cathedral says that he was the son of Petrus de Apulia In 1245 Nicola was making sculptures at Prato Cathedral and then moved to Pisa where his son Giovanni Pisano was born 

Around 1255 Nicola received a commission to make the pulpit in the baptistery of Pisa Cathedral The baptistery was a very large circular domed building that stood near the west doors of the cathedral Nicola was assisted by other sculptors including Arnolfo di Cambio who later became a famous architect The work was finished in 1260 and signed Nicola Pisanus which means Nicholas of Pisa 

The pulpit is hexagonal and is supported on six columns of coloured stone with another column under the centre of the pulpit Four of the columns including the central one rest on the backs of carved creatures Around five sides of the pulpit are white marble panels carved with stories from the life of Jesus They are the Annunciation the Nativity Angels telling the Shepherds the Adoration of the Magi Baby Jesus presented at the Temple and the Crucifixion 

At Pisa Cathedral was a large cloister called the Campo Santo and used as a burial place All around the arcade in the Campo Santo were Ancient Roman sarcopgagi that had been stolen by the navy of Pisa when they had won a battle Many of the coffins were richly carved with scenes that told stories The biographer Giorgio Vasari wrote that Nicola Pisano studied these sculptures before he started work on the carvings for the pulpit Because of this Nicolas sculpture makes a bridge between the Gothic style of the 1200s and the Classical style used by Renaissance artists in the 1400s The Baptistery of Pisa had been built by an architect called Diotisalvi but the work was not finished Nicola Pisano made the dome much higher and put decoration all around it which 20 years later had sculpture added by Nicolas son Giovanni Pisano 

At Bologna and Siena  In 1264 Nicola Pisano was aksed to work on a grand shrine in memory of St Dominic called the Arca di San Domenico in the Basilica of San Domenico in Bologna It is believed that Nicola made the main design but many other sculptors worked on it More than 200 years later it was still not finished and Michelangelo when he was still a teenager made three small statues for it

In September 1265 Nicola began work on another a marble pulpit even grander than the first this time for Siena Cathedral The work took three years and Nicola was helped by his son Giovanni Pisano and his assistants Arnolfo di Cambio Lapo di Ricevuto and several other artists 

The pulpit is octagonal in shape and is supported on nine columns made of granite porphyry and green marble The message of this pulpit is Salvation and the Last Judgment It has seven sculptured scenes and many small statues Three of the scenes tell more than one story All the panels are crowded with figures 

In July 1273 Nicola Pisano was commissioned to make the altar in the Chapel of St James in Pistoia Cathedral The chapel was demolished and all that remains is a basin for Holy Water that was possibly made by Nicola 

His last main job from 1277 78 was to make the sculpture panels to surround a very large fountain in the main square of the city of Perugia The fountain was designed by Fra Bevignate and Boninsegna It is thought that most of the sculpture was done by his son Giovanni Pisano and his assistants

I Ching also known as the Book of Changes is one of the oldest of the Chinese classic texts It is used mainly for divination

As means Zhou Dynasty it was written in that age Before Zhou Dynasty there was Shang Dynasty Shang Dynastys main cultural characteristics are its divination and character We cannot say which one was first but it is supposed that characters were made from certain need while doing divination During Shang Dynasty divination was done by burning animals bone or tortoise shell Zhou Dynasty made Shang cease to exist but it accepted Shangs culture In early age of Zhou Dynasty a new way of divination appeared which was put into writing It was advanced form of Shang Dynastys divination and finally it took place instead of Shangs divination

The contents of I Ching consist of 64 hexagrams and explanation for each Hexagram is a group of six broken or unbroken lines The unbroken line represents yang and the unbroken line represents yin From the bottom to top six lines are gathered in parallel There exists one different name for one hexagram In I Ching the name of one hexagram and the hexagram itself comes first and after those there are different explanations for the hexagram and the each line consisting hexagram from bottom to top There comes next hexagram after explanations of all lines of one hexagram

The typical divination using I Ching needs the number of fifty thin sticks usually made from bamboo Using those sticks with certain order the person who wants to know the result draws hexagram and finds the explanation in the book To make process simpler some people use coin to know the result

In I Ching the word Heaven is considered as same as God or the absolute being with humane character who decides the good and evil and makes judgements For example the explanation of 26th hexagram is the Heavens bliss is given therefore lucky

Also there is the idea of constantly changing world as the explanation of 11th hexagram tells Everything flat will be inclined and everything gone will be come back Similarly the idea of endlessness can also be found The literal meaning of 63th hexagram is already finished but the last hexagram which is the 64th means not finished literally This means the process of whole world and life is endless and never stops

Secure Quick Response codes or SQR codes are secure high data density two dimensional bar codes QR codes are high density 2D bar codes first created and patented by Denso Wave in Japan QR Codes  They are becoming a popular means to encode data for quick machine readableretrieval and decoding on a worldwide basis Nokia Apple and Android smart phones often already have a mobile application to create and read QR codes and there are numerous mobile application available which can be downloaded from application stores 

Secure Quick Response codes are as the name implies a secure method for encrypting data into a bar code which then becomes extremely difficult to decode into the original plain text in the absence of the encryption cipher or key A typical implementation of SQR codes would be to create a one time use SQR code on a mobile handsets high resolution screen to effectively create a highly secure one time pad type of encryption One Time Pad of for example an on line account number SQR codes because they can be used on hundreds of millions of already installed phones and because no additional hardware on the mobile handset is necessary can operate in a similar fashion to NFC handsets for secure mobile payments A typical implementation is to encrypt and use a precursor physical machine readable token such as the card identity number written in read only memory of a Secure Digital microSD card contained in a mobile telephone or even the international mobile identity number IMEIin the event no microSD card is present as for example on an Apple iPhone SQR codes may be securely machine read in a retail environment at the POS using prevalent 2D bar code scanners or even a low cost web camera Secure Quick Response codes were first developed by Yodo a company operating in Japan and are patent pending

The Goryeo Dynasty also called the Kingdom of Goryeo is one of the Korean dynasties which existed from 918 to 1392 It began in 918 with Emperor Taejo The name Goryeo came to be said as Korea by foreigners and is still the name of the country Goryeo united the Later Three Kingdoms of Korea and by 1374 ruled most of the Korean peninsula until it was removed by the Joseon dynasty in 1392 Goryeo increased its borders to Chung cheon river and Youngheong and the Amnok River

Silla had accomplished an unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea in 668 But it weakened as local lords achieved power during the end of the 9th century The country entered a period of civil war and rebellion led by Gung Ye Gi Hwon Yang Gil and Gyeon Hwon Gung Ye established Hugogureo and Wang Geon made a contribution as Gung Yes subordinate However Gung Ye became more and more tyrannical and finally killed his own wife and son Also he insisted that he was Maitreya Meanwhile Wang Geon increased his power as he conquered Geumsung area in Later Baekje Finally some people who followed Wang Geon broke out the rebellion and he named the dynasty as Goryeo and changed its capital city to Song ak 

Goryeo made the policy to win the favor of people and maintained good relationship with Silla As a result Silla surrendered unconditionally to Goryeo Meanwhile Later Baekje collapsed by itself as princes fought each other over uccession to the throne Because of the internal conflict Later Baekje became weaker and weaker and was conquered by Goryeo Finally Goryeo united the Later Three Kingdoms again and accomplished re unification of Korean people 

Tae jo made important policies First he insisted that Goryeo should expand its territory to further North It is because he succeed to Goguryeo and Goguryeo had the biggest territory in Korean history So Tae jo named the dynasty as Goryeo from Goguryeo and tried to take back the territory of Goguryeo He emphasized the importance of Sukyung area because it is placed in the North part and kept in check Gu Ran that made an effort to come down to Goryeo Later all of these policies contributed to expanding its territory to Apnok River Also Tae Jo made the policy which unified all people from different dynasties Because of this policy Goryeo is considered that it accomplished actual unification compared to Silla

Composite particles are subatomic particles that are made of more than one quark Simple particles like protons are actually composites of multiple quarks Protons are known as baryons which means that they are made of exactly three quarks Baryons are in a family called Hadrons which simply means that they are made of quarks The only other subcategory of Hadrons is Mesons which are made of one quark and one antiquark 

Since they are made of quarks composite particles are not so much hard balls but rather like clouds that contain these quarks Depending on the energy contained by the quarks the quarks of a proton vibrate and this gives a proton a size larger than the actual size of the three quarks combined

The Test of English as a Foreign Language or TOEFL is a test which measures peoples English language skills to see if they are good enough to take a course at university or graduate school in English speaking countries It is for people whose native language is not English It measures how well a person uses listening reading speaking and writing skills to perform academic tasks This test is accepted by more than 7500 colleges universities and agencies in more than 130 countries which means it is most widely recognized English test in the world

The format of TOEFL test has been changed three times The first was the PBT It tests listening reading and grammar skills with perfect sore 677 Some centers where computers are not available still offer this format The second format is CBT People are each provided with a computer to take the test A writing section was added as well as the three sections The level of listening and grammar skills are automatically changed depending on peoples English level The third change is IBT that is being brought in around the world which measures listening speaking reading and writing 

There are three procedures that people are following to take the test First it is decided that where and when you are going to take a test because a format of test could be either IBT or CBT depending on location People need to register 23 months in advance to get a place Second is registration by in person online phone or email Online registration is most common and payment will be required to complete the registration The cost changes depending on what kind of exam is taken

As more universities and colleges want a TOEFL more people are wanting to do the test In Korea in 2010 nearly 115000 people took the test to demonstrate their ability in English This was 20 of the total for people doing the test It is considered as one of the ways for middle or high school students to apply for the high ranked domestic universities By studying at such an advanced level it could help to improve their English skills to get high scores in other English exams 

There are five basic positions in basketball game Center Power forward Small forward Shooting guard and Point guard Among them point guard is the most important position to play basketball A point guard should maintain his teams offense by controlling the ball safely and pass the ball to the right teammate at the right time Because of his role in the play a point guard is usually called a commander on the court Steve Nash Chris Paul and John Stockton are famous point guard in the NBA

First of all right pass is the most important requirement to be a good point guard A point guards first thought should be being an excellent passer and getting the ball to his teammates for easy shots Because the offense is usually started from a point guard who handles the ball he should be able to find the open man and when to pass and not pass to avoid costly turnovers and score easily

Second safe dribbling and ball handling are necessary Before a point guard passes the ball to his teammates he should carry the ball from back court to front court To carry the ball safely without turnovers it is important to know how to control the ball safely And by controlling the ball safely a point guard also can control the tempo of the game The ability controlling the tempo make a point guard choose right way to offense a fast break or a slow attack Through choosing right strategy a point guard can make chance at the right time and also save his teammates stamina effectively 

Third a point guard is a coach on the court To command proper strategy to his teammates a point guard should understand all strategies which are commanded by his coach This ability may help a point guard to play the game well with the right strategy at right time

Lastly a point guard should be a good shooter Sometimes the game can be unfavorable even a point guard pass well and play the game with right strategy At this time his accurate shooting can be an escapeway from this situation By announcing his ability to shooting accurately a point guard can plant an awareness to opponents that they should defense him well And it cause the decreasing of pressure to other teammates to offense Like this a point guards shooting ability can be the option to offense effectively

Organometallic catalysis is the chemistry of using molecules with carbon metal bond to lower the activation energy of a reaction

Compounds are the result of atoms bonding together Atoms are the basic unit of matter When atoms bond they stick by sharing electrons electrons are sub atomic particles with a negative charge

Chemistry dealing with compounds containing a metal carbon bond Organometallics combines disciplines of organic chemistry and inorganic chemistry

Examples of organometallic compounds are tetraethyllead image it was used as a fuel additive in the past Also Methylcobalamin is a very common organometallic compound

In the image below The Fe metal binds two organic rings together In the ring structures each point represents a carbon atom So ferrocene has 10 carbon atoms 5 in the ring above the iron and 5 in the ring below

 FileFerrocenejpgFerrocene 

Organic chemistry deals with carbon chemistry synthesis bonding and reactions The elements C H N O are the most common elements used in organic chemistry however other elements can sometimes be found in organic compounds Organic chemistry gives us plastics drugs petrochemicals food explosives paints etc with very few exceptions it is the basic chemistry of life

Inorganic chemistry deals with all other chemistry not containing carbon hydrogen bonds Table salt is an excellent example of inorganic chemistry sodium metal and chlorine combine via an ionic bond to make this crystalline solid  

Catalysis is the act of using a catalyst to increase the rate of a chemical reaction

Rate is how fast or slow a chemical reaction happens

Catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a reaction however it is not consumed in a reaction like the other reagents 

The link below shows a graph that is a general graphical interpretation of a catalysts effect on the activation energy The Y axis shows the activation energy while the x axis shows the reaction over time With no catalyst present the reaction has a higher energy to overcome In the presence of a catalyst the activation energy is reduced

 FileCatalysisSchemepngActivation Energy vs Time 

Research is currently under way using organometallic catalysis The energy crisis has initiated increased interest in more efficient ways of working with the remaining fossil fuels we have left While many agree that lowering oil dependence is safer for the environment as well as politically wise  The new interest in green technologies has also helped increase research Many examples of organometallic research can be found in the petrochemical and pharmaceutical industries Some current methods of chemical production are wasteful and produce toxic waste while many organometallic catalysts show promise to change that
